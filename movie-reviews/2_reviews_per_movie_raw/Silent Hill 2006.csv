"phayke","9","715","954","20 April 2006"," Finally, a good, accurate game/film crossover.
","First off, the downsides: Some parts of the movie seemed a little drawn out, the film was two hours, and at certain times, you could feel that. It's far-fetched, and I can imagine some people rolling their eyes at the storyline, and there WILL be some people walking out saying ""that was a stupid movie"". (As many people responded to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.) Of course, some of them will be saying that in response to the sheer amount of gore and violence, which brings me into the 'upsides': This movie certainly had it's 'wow' moments with shock, anticipation, and gore, especially near the climax. Scenes and even alleyways and monsters from the games were almost identical. If you've played the games you will get a lot of deja vu. (For example, the camera goes crooked at exactly the same time and place it does in one of the scenes in the game.) Also, a lot of the sounds and music tracks from the games are used, and so are the monsters. The entire feel of the games is preserved in the film, and you will have trouble keeping your feet on the floor the entire movie. The creepy presentation works, and if you haven't played any of the games, this movie will scare you in new ways."

","I'm not sure what the original comment leaver saw last night, but it certainly wasn't Silent Hill.<br/><br/>I saw a critic screening last night, and must say I was highly impressed. As a fan of the games, and anything related to them, my faith has been firmly established in Gans and Avery, and I can only wish for sequels.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was perfect, the acting was on point, the creatures were amazing, well, everything was amazing.<br/><br/>The town itself looks just like the town we love, and it's almost like coming home again. You'll see what I mean when you finally get to see the film.<br/><br/>Just be prepared for a disturbing, bloody (oh man, the blood), and genuinely creepy ride.<br/><br/>I'd say more, but giving spoilers would be like slapping you in the face.<br/><br/>Go see it!"
"recrimination","10","361","492","21 April 2006"," A very surprising, dark and gruesome movie!
","You have to approach any movie adaptation of a video game with extreme trepidation. Think of the other corkers we've all caught on TV in the past: Super Mario Bros., Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil. Stinkers, one and all. Doom was vapid, but at least got close to the source material.<br/><br/>So what about Silent Hill? The movie opens with music lifted straight from the game itself - in fact, the entire movie contains original tracks from the game as well as some remixed score. Just as it was a fantastic and brooding background when playing the game, it works very effectively on screen.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, the story is a composite of story elements from the first and second games, but the final act is a monstrous and highly original thirty minutes that kept me guessing (as well as being completely grossed out). Indeed, the violence is pretty gruesome.. clever mixtures of CGI and fully made-up monsters which really add to the foreboding atmosphere.<br/><br/>At first, I felt nervous watching this.. not because of the visuals (which are absolutely SPOT ON.. I've never seen ANY movie adaptation that is this close to the source material.. all the comic book movies from the past few years still stray furiously).. but because of the weak opening. After I'd resigned myself to the fact that the movie was going to be disappointing, I was pleasantly surprised as soon as the main character Rose gets to Silent Hill itself. If you're a fan of the game, you won't be disappointed. If you're a horror hound, you'll love the creatures and the visuals. If you're expecting a deep movie about the relationship between estranged mother and daughter.. you're in the wrong theatre.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. Best horror movie I've seen in a long time."
"nessa_tulcakelume","8","109","142","19 June 2006"," Horror? No. Psychological triller? Yes. Oh yes.
","Horror? Try psychological triller and you might be closer to understanding why is it that I found Silent Hill such an amazing piece of work.<br/><br/>With that in mind, the reason why Silent Hill worked for me was because it had a story to tell. Granted some of us are already familiar with the storyline and are frustrated with the pace of the film. Others may gripe at how much of a disappointment the movie was because of the lack of certain monsters, the lack of development in the characters they liked best, the lack of answers to puzzling questions, the fact that the storyline was too convoluted and confusing et cetera et cetera.<br/><br/>Yet, the heart of the film lies mainly on one simple idea - Silent Hill is first and foremost, a physical manifestation of a child's mind that is shattered, tainted and shackled by an abuse so terrible that one is unable to articulate it into words. (Ever wondered why Silent Hill is called ""Silent"" Hill in the first place? If you think along the lines of language being an ineffective medium in the expression of ""truth"", *cha-ching*! You're right!)<br/><br/>In this light, I cannot understand why so many people had a problem with the pacing of the movie because in the first place, such apparent ""meandering"" is necessary to the entire film. And why not? The inability for any one character to get to the heart of the problem is prevalent during the entire narrative framework of the film *No one* character dared to talk about it and those who sought the truth are met with an air of secrecy. The ""truth"" therefore, is oppressed by a *complete breakdown of words* and all that is left is to ""show"" and let the people ""experience"" what had happened themselves. (Such is the path that Rose must take because she ""chose"" to seek out the truth surrounding her daughter's psychological problem and since language fails in Silent Hill can the ""truth"" cannot be communicated through ""words"" it must be ""shown"".)<br/><br/>The same rule applies to Christopher. He tried to uncover the ""truth"" but was thwarted by people who are reluctant to talk about the town. Everyone who had prior knowledge of the town was unable or unwilling to describe what happened because they 1) are suppressing their guilt 2) are afraid of opening up a can of worms that is best left forgotten. Even Rose and Cybil are faced with a group of people who were so adamant into seeing things in their point of view that they have ""blinded"" themselves to the atrocity of what has taken place in Silent Hill. (Notice how most of the monsters i.e. Nurses, Pyramid Head, Janitor, are in a state of blindness? Coincidence? I think not.)<br/><br/>And still at the heart of all THAT, a child's horrifying story is desperately waiting to be told. The meanderings are not meant to be a flaw in the plot, in my opinion, but an attempt to show how the outside world tried to suppress and confine the deepest desire of a little girl - the desire for ""truth"" to be known. Therefore the ""truth"" cannot be ""told"" because words will ultimately fail in Silent Hill. It must be ""shown"". That was why Rose had to go through all the various stages of her journey to seek out the ""truth"". That was why it was crucial the narrative had to be mapped out thus and it reached its summit in the dramatic finale where the fanatics were reluctant to accept the ""spoken truth"" but was forced to accept it nevertheless through a physical manifestation of ""truth"" - the manifestation of their past deeds.<br/><br/>Hence in my opinion, this film isn't about monsters, busty characters, bloodshed, storyline or whatever it is that one normally looks out for in a film of this genre. This film is about a little girl's story that is struggling to surface in a world dominated by a viciousness she could not comprehend but fall victim to nevertheless. Think about it. To be thoroughly abused in a world that you never fit in and cannot comprehend. And later to want to seek vengeance for the wrongs that had been done to you but are unable to articulate it into words because there is no one out there who understands or listens to you. The intense hatred due to the complete lack of control that one is forced into, the desire to achieve ""satisfaction"" at any cost and the obsession with ""vengence"" - now that's a scary thought for a little girl of 10 to have, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>So was it good? Heck yeah. And I'm going for another round of this when my next paycheque comes in."
"fox_hound1980","10","795","1159","20 April 2006"," Silent hill isn't a horror movie its a nightmare drama
","For everyone who has seen or is going to see or is thinking of seeing silent hill, do not go into it thinking ohhh its going to be a scary movie,,, because its not suppose to be. Its for intelligent drama based crowds who like good visuals, story line, acting, and mystery. This isn't doom and this isn't resident evil, this is a well written drama/mystery that happens to be very disturbing in its visual and story. People who have not played the game go see it with an open mind and not look at it as a video game movie because even without the game it could stand on its own as a great movie. So that said, if your looking for pop crap gore then don't see silent hill, if your looking for a memorable movie you well think about for years to come then do see silent hill. WELCOME TO SILENT HILL...."
"craig-252","10","483","705","22 April 2006"," WOW, I mean W O W!!!
","Agree 100% with agentmatheus: This is, hands down, the best VG adaption bar none! Seriously, it truly is like you are living the game. Granted, several characters have been changed, but that's to be expected. (Having a woman as the main protagonist, ensure's the main character is more vulnerable, than if it were a man). The set-pieces with the creatures are even more disturbing than their VG counterparts - I kid you not! The production design is truly superb and you get the feeling that Silent Hill really does exist. <br/><br/>If I had to nitpick, it would be that they didn't include any puzzle elements in the film, as per the game; it could have been cool to have Rose solving some mad brainteaser, but you can fully understand that they didn't include this sort of thing (well, apart from her memorizing the hospital floor-layout), otherwise it could have slowed down the whole pace of the film.<br/><br/>I was so skeptical about this movie, as traditionally, Game-To-Movie adaptations are, let's face it, crap! - But they have completely pulled it off, and I await a second installment with heavily baited breath.<br/><br/>Again, it really is the best horror movie in years! HIGHLY recommended.<br/><br/>Check this film out as soon as you can.<br/><br/>Craig"
"ehousden","8","227","328","21 April 2006"," Fans of the game will enjoy this film!
","Fans of the game will enjoy this film. Critics should be impressed with the set design, effects and cinematography; but I'm afraid most of them will miss the boat entirely. As far as a game to film translation, this is one of the best ever made.<br/><br/>There are scenes in the film that are direct recreations from the game. Sounds, music, colors and even meticulous set design that pays homage to the game series. In as far as a horror film, there were scenes in this movie that are incomparable. Really disturbing, solid moments of horror.<br/><br/>Pyramid Head is this decade's Pinhead. A new cultural icon to be feared, and loved.<br/><br/>Good movie. Keep an open mind, and enjoy. This is one of those films that actually deserves its R rating. Don't take the kids, unless you're into the whole ""terrible parent"" thing."
"LupinsGal2004","9","646","966","20 April 2006"," Excellent Video Game/Movie crossover
","Someone said worst movie ever- dude- ever see UltraViolet or Scary movie? Please easily those are the worst movies that should NEVER have been made.<br/><br/>However. this movie was excellent. I have a feeling the person who gave this movie one star was someone who did not play the video game, maybe even did not realize it was based on a video game. I can see how this movie could present a problem to those who are non-gamers. However Most of my friends never played the game either, and they still enjoyed the movie very much.<br/><br/>I wasn't as disturbed by the changing of the characters as I thought I'd be. (Harry Mason to Rose for Example.) I totally understand how Harry wouldn't cross over well. while he was a cool character (From a girl perspective) he was kind of a wuss. lol.<br/><br/>the actors they picked to portray the characters were superb. they did a very good job portraying the intensity, the scary and sometimes disturbing nature of the movie.<br/><br/>I saw a sneak peek where most of the movie goers did a lot of gasping and clutching of their friends or dates, covering of eyes... it was a pretty creepy film, and the only horror movie that actually got my pulse to race. Normally I hate horror movies because they're more ridiculous than scary.<br/><br/>but this movie was scary, well acting, well written, and I loved the monsters. It was much more realistic to use people rather than complete CGI characters. it made it more creepy. I liked that touch. Definitely proves that old school can be more scary than technology. Although they don't completely ignore the modern day novelties. Its a perfect combination of both.<br/><br/>Pretty much- I miss Harry- I can understand why they did away with him (I'm glad it wasn't for a stupid reason like them wanting a tough cigar smoking buff man chick thinking that's ""P.C."") but the character changes work, the actors in their parts work, the script works, its creepy, its scary, its a great movie. Some who have not played or haven't heard of the Silent hill games may not get it... but for the most part, I think most should enjoy this movie, gamers and non-gamers alike. This has to be one of my favorite movies this year."
"KrwlngNMieSkin","10","547","854","22 April 2006"," Amazingly Emotional
","This movie was amazing. Beginning to end it had me drawn in. This movie  breaks the rules and thinks outside the box...and gets away with it.  Maybe not a blockbuster, but definitely a cult classic :D To other  reviewers: Please, do a little research before you cut the movie off at  the knees. 1st off they're not Christian fanatics, they're another  cult. Secondly, not everything is movies are based on real things.  Certain things can be completely fictional. The movie was made to have  that dream/nightmare feel. It was an amazing movie if you actually paid  attention to it, and I'm sorry if your feeble mind cannot comprehend  what is going on. As for the part where they tell you the back-story,  it had nothing to do with anyone not knowing what was going on. Konami  as well as Sony loved it so much they didn't cut anything. That is why  the movie is so long. Not to mention this is a European FILM!!!!  Japanese horror, European writers and actors with few Americans (yeah  some of the actors were but they don't write the film). The movie is  supposed to make you sit back and go ""what the ****??"" when things  randomly happen...that's what Silent Hill is all about. This isn't your  run-of-the-mill horror ""horny teen"" slasher film (which unfortunately  is what's most popular in America). If you can, go to a matinée where  you can watch it without all of the people who think they're in MST3k  and all of the people who feel the need to talk to the screen. The  story is deep, really deep. The ending is tragic. And if you still  don't get it, it doesn't mean the movie sucked...it just means you  don't get it."

","This movie was simply incredible. To all Silent Hill fans, I say, yes, PH was nothing more than a fanboy favorite and they changed the storyline a little from the first game, but I have never actually felt dread like I did in this movie when I heard the air-raid siren indicating that ""the darkness is coming"". I actually remember feeling the same dread while playing the game. The ending, while a bit of a letdown due to a lack of definite closure, was definitely very Silent-Hillesque in that it had a certain meaning that IS possible to find if you look closely enough into the clues.<br/><br/>Phenomenal movie, I suggest you see it ASAP."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","74","108","11 August 2006"," Great ideas, creepy atmosphere and eerie mood  but the rest is badly executed
","I remember I sat down to play Silent Hill a couple of years ago because the mystery genre intrigued me and the game had an interesting look to it, so I started running through the abandoned town of 'Silent Hill' as the main player. I stopped playing very soon because, in truth, not a whole lot was happening. It was mostly an uncomfortable experience, eerily lit and hauntingly scored. I could feel an intense build-up in that foggy place but I never reached the culmination, so I gave up. OK, fine - I was scared.<br/><br/>Years later this film adaptation is bravely made by Christophe Gans and, even though I'd played less than ten minutes of the game, I immediately recognised the haunting visuals of the abandoned city. So 'well done' here is an understatement. It is superbly breathed new life into.<br/><br/>The plot has been glossed over slightly in a Hollywood fashion, but captures the essence of its characters and storyline - which is: as a last resort, a mother takes her ill daughter to a place she often mentions in her sleep - a place near where she was adopted from. But the hope the mother has for her daughter's recovery quickly shatters and turns into despair when the little girl vanishes in the misty mysterious old town.<br/><br/>I truly cannot credit the atmosphere of this film enough. Christophe Gans has successfully captured the eerie mood of Silent Hill and it is a nightmarish place - a fog-enshrouded hell that shifts between two modes: barren ashen daylight and a gruesome decaying state with fiery ember, demons and enhanced by chilling (and very sudden) sound effects. It's strangely fascinating, surreal and above all frightening.<br/><br/>The problems of Silent Hill (2006) are that there are not nearly enough build-ups. They should have been used not only to stay faithful to the video game upon which it was based but to wield tension in the right way and shock us when the build-up finally culminates. But here we are introduced to horrid creatures early on and often without much foreshadowing devices. Because they are presented to us so generously and clear-viewed, they are not that scary. At all. Some even manage a raised eyebrow, like the crawly CGI cripples.<br/><br/>In the end, I think this is quality horror entertainment and probably one of the better game-to-film adaptations, abut it is much too chaotic - too many monsters and too often and too clearly to be frightening. The mood and atmosphere are what is frightening and so it should have been used even more in Silent Hill, but instead the director feels pressured to introduce creatures to satisfy mainstream audiences' need for bloody gorefest and kinetic action.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"l_biu","7","254","407","20 April 2006"," A great horror epic!
","OK, I have just returned from seeing silent hill. Did I like it? Yes! Did I love it? HELL YES! <br/><br/>The movie pretty much has a solid pace. The cinematography is beautiful and the special effects are great. So what about the story? It does get a bit convoluted, especially when we have scenes solely there to explain WTF is going on.....Sean Bean is a terrible actor, he was bad in LOTR, he was bad in that crappy ITV show he was on and he is pretty crappy in this.....I wish they had cut him from the film entirely..his scenes added nothing, except some explanation on silent hill and to remind us that Rose is in another reality to them...also I was a bit annoyed that PH was really only in two scenes...HOPEFULLY he will get used more in later instalments. The ending was a bit upsetting, I get why it happened...I just got a little chocked up (yes I am a wimp, so sue me). The score is wonderful, I really could listen to it all day....I don't know the names of the songs but I would definitely buy the soundtrack. Rhada is a amazing actress, she has a face which can tell a billion tales with just a slight twitch and she is very believable as a mother looking for her child. Cybil actually was my favourite character, in the beginning she is pretty much a tough ass bitch, but she does become more human towards the end.....what happens to her is pretty graphic,which leads me to another point.....this movie actually is pretty gruesome in parts, a little to gruesome for a silent hill movie. The tension in the film is nail bite ting, the nurse scene actually made most of the audience jump and someone screamed LOL! Thats what is so amazing about this film, you get the same feeling you got when you were playing the game by yourself, complete stillness and fear. <br/><br/>Overall this was a great movie, the visual and grand scale of the movie is so astonishing to watch. It really has some striking visuals...i.e grey children first attack, the first change to alternate silent hill and the final battle which holds much of the gore. <br/><br/>A almost perfect horror movie."
"Potty-Man","8","29","40","13 October 2006"," A patient, intelligent, atmospheric horror film that doesn't go for cheap scares
","I have been a fan of the first game since it came out. As with most video game adaptations, I expected this to be a piece of sh#@. Instead, I got an atmospheric, haunting thriller that slowly creeps into you and doesn't let go.<br/><br/>True, the game was scarier. Way scarier. And there was something appealing about the vagueness of the story - the fact that it was never fully explained. And some parts (especially in the third act) could have been edited down and made more intense. And I wasn't fully convinced by Radha Mitchell's acting. But seriously, folks, this goes above and beyond your standard fare horror flick.<br/><br/>Speaking visually, the film is breath-taking. Some of the best conceptual designs I've ever seen. The creature's design and effects are top notch. Pay attention to one very creepy scene that revolves around a flash-light. It is brilliant.<br/><br/>The score is perfect. Disturbing and melancholy at the same time, just like the themes the movie explores. It has depth and its meanings are relevant to our current existence.<br/><br/>One thing I wanted to see used more was the radio static that signifies when a monster is approaching. That was to me one of the scariest elements of the game, since you knew the monster is close, and yet you couldn't see it. Also, with such a tightly woven, dense atmosphere, some boo moments could have been super scary, although the movie doesn't use them. That is a plus and a minus. The result is more sophisticated, refined, working more on psychological horror rather than shock value. On the other hand, on a superficial level, the film is not as scary as it could have been.<br/><br/>To conclude, a very pleasant surprise. Hopefully this is not the last we've seen of Silent Hill."
"Crush726","6","44","66","22 April 2006"," It's Silent Hill, but it isn't Silent Hill
","I've got mixed feelings towards this film. I've eagerly awaited it's release ever since it was first announced.<br/><br/>The Silent Hill fan in me wanted me to love this movie, and the cinema fan in me told me otherwise, so I was quite torn while viewing the film.<br/><br/>Cinematically, it was a beautiful film. The sets were astonishing, the creatures were horrifically gorgeous, and the music was haunting (however, misused in some places, more on that later).<br/><br/>The films main problem is the script.<br/><br/>Oh, Avary. What happened? How the mighty have fallen.<br/><br/>The dialogue was horrendous. There were only a few lines that I really liked, and most of them were spoken by Dahlia. There were a few other lines scattered here and there that I liked ('mother is god in the eyes of a child' was one I really liked). The acting was also quite stiff and over the top, but that's mostly due to the poor dialogue that the actresses and actors were given. However, I was quite impressed with Jodelle Ferland's work. Quite impressed, indeed.<br/><br/>Now, from the perspective of a Silent Hill fan, this film was lacking. The story only took some ideas from the games, and then seemed to bastardize them. The whole cult thing didn't work well in the movie, and whenever they chanted ""BURN THE WITCH,"" I could only think of a certain Crusades movie.<br/><br/>The film wasn't really boring, though. The moment we first see the Grey Children, my heart sank. I never feel anything physical during movies, but here, I did. The Patient Demon was also quite neat, as were the nurses.<br/><br/>But the best things about the film were the Janitor and Pyramid Head. Wow. That's all I have to say about them.<br/><br/>Now, let's discuss the music. While I LOVE Akira Yamaoka's works (listening to them right now), I felt some of it was misplaced during the film. They used the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack way too much, especially Promise and True. Music was just weird in certain parts, but in others, it was completely fitting (like Prayer as Pyramid Head approaches the church).<br/><br/>Well, in a nutshell, this film was somewhat of a disappointment. It may have looked great, but the plot was jumbled and the dialogue was weak.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 6/10"
"skaje22","8","101","165","20 April 2006"," Thank god for the return of R-rated horror
","Wow. Silent Hill marks the return of well-written, well-acted, R-rated, balls-out, minimal use of CG horror. Did I mention it's R-rated? After months of PG-13 crap like Stay Alive, we finally got a movie that actually seems to stretch the limits of the R rating when it comes to gore. This movie drips and splatters blood. The use of CG is surprisingly low. Most creatures are really people in costumes, but it's so realistic yet strange that you almost think its CG. The movie is well-casted. Instead of, say Sarah Michelle Gellar they went on a limb and casted Radha Mitchell, who's biggest role so far has been in a minor Woody Allen movie. She carries the movie and does a fantastic job. They casted someone named Laurie Holden for the role of Cybil the cop, and she impressed me. Sean Bean as the husband is pretty much the only well-known actor in the movie, and he's basically a secondary character (though he does fine for his role).<br/><br/>Did I mention this movie has gore? In one lovely scene, Pyramid Head first rips off the clothes of a woman, then rips off her entire skin in one piece and hurls it at a closing door, which is just open enough that a spray of blood splatter the main characters. Oh yeah...Pyramid Head is awesome. When he first goes after Rose and Cybil, shoving that 10-foot sword of his through the door, I pretty much crapped myself. He really only has those two scenes, and they never do explain just what the heck he is, but as the movie already breaks 2 hours, they probably didn't have the time.<br/><br/>The whole movie is kind of like that. Most of the monsters you see just show up for no reason without explanation. And the story does get a little confusing near the end, but not too much.<br/><br/>The changing of Silent Hill between fog-time and Hell-time, is really well-done, and never fails to amaze and frighten, especially when it's preceded by that siren.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a bloodbath in a church that will shock all but the Japanese. The amount of blood, and the way in which it is sprayed around, is really quite nasty."
"mw_director","4","95","163","22 April 2006"," It's got the look. That's all it's got. I'm angry.
","If there was any video game-based movie I feel I had a stake in, it was Silent Hill. I'm a devoted fan of the games, having played all four multiple times each. I don't think I've ever had as spine-chillingly memorable a time doing anything related to the horror genre as I've had playing those games. After the crushing disappointment of the Resident Evil movies, I had cautious optimism about Silent Hill. Early interviews with director Christophe Gans seemed to point to a guy passionate about the material and determined to do right by it.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie goes down as Just Another Failed Game Adaptation. If the best video game franchise can't even get a good movie made from it, I think Hollywood and video games should be kept away from each other for good, preferably by restraining order.<br/><br/>Gans may be passionate, but here he's done the impossible. He's taken Silent Hill  which is not only the most frightening horror video game ever made but quite possibly one of the most frightening horror entertainment experiences in any medium, games, books, or movies included  and made it BORING. The video game is scary as hell. The movie has  I cannot stress this enough  not ONE single solitary scare, and indeed, a few of the intended scares come off as silly. <br/><br/>The movie has the look of the game down just fine. The production designers have replicated the game's foggy, deserted streets and dingy derelict buildings perfectly. But Roger Avery's script (and here was a guy who took great pains to warn fans he was NOT a huge devotee of the games) suddenly feels the urge to EXPLAIN everything in exhaustive detail. So, instead of piling on suspense and scares, it piles on exposition. And I mean, PILES it on. We get endless talky scenes of back-story and history, and yet the more the movie attempts to clarify the whole back-story of Alessa and the cult that victimized her and turned her into an evil malevolent force, the less coherent it all seems. <br/><br/>Gans's devotion to reproducing the game's visuals makes him forget that there will be a sizable audience who see this without ever having played the game. And to them, no concessions are made. Non-fans of the Silent Hill games are given no clue as to why the town changes appearance, or why it's inhabited by poison-spitting faceless monsters and other weird beasties. To non-gamers this will be the most nonsensical movie ever, despite Avery's endless info-dumping dialogue.<br/><br/>But worse than info-dumping dialogue is Obvious Dialogue, where the writer assumes his audience is suffering from Downs Syndrome and must have everything spelled out no matter how obvious it is. In one scene, Cybill (the cop from game one, who has a much different fate here) has just found a drawing by Rose's missing daughter in a slot at the hotel desk.<br/><br/>Rose: ""Where did you find this?"" Cybill: ""Room 111."" Rose: ""We have to go to Room 111!""<br/><br/>Well, duh. <br/><br/>All of the exposition simply stretches the running time out to over two hours, while spending as little time as possible in the Otherworld for which the games are famous. Here's another failing I cannot stress enough; **where the hell WAS Silent Hill in Silent Hill?** Why are we listening to Alice Krige doing her endless Cruella DeVille routine when we should be trapped in terrifying dark corridors or fleeing monsters down misty back alleys? This stuff gets started just fine in act one, then stops when the script settles into a talk-fest. <br/><br/>So much from the video games appears in the movie to please fans, but only at the most superficial level. It's as if Gans pored over each game, saying, ""Okay we'll use that, gotta have that creature, okay, and how about a Lisa Garland cameo!"" But that's where the homage stops. The school? The hospital? Yeah, they're there, but wasted. Radha Mitchell literally RUNS through the hospital (which, for some reason, is about 200 stories underground) in the third act, until she encounters the nurses...who look great, in their prosthetic makeup, but move in such an absurd way I kept expecting them to break into a dance routine like some Janet Jackson video. And Pyramid Head? Cripes, how do you waste Pyramid Head!?! He has two scenes, does one cool thing where he grabs a woman and tears her skin off like a candy wrapper  then it's bye bye. He's gone from the movie after that!<br/><br/>By the time we're well into the protracted act three, in which a mob of mad cultists is threatening to burn Rose's daughter alive, any resemblance between the game Silent Hill and this movie is purely coincidental. I saw a post from one guy on Rotten Tomatoes suggesting the filmmakers must have come down with ADHD and thought they were making a Hellraiser movie instead. Couldn't have put it better myself. The movie is just one cheesy line of bad dialogue after another at this point. I just cannot listen to a mob of people (and where did this mob come from, anyway?) shouting ""Burn the witch! Burn the witch!"" without thinking of Monty Python and the Holy Grail!<br/><br/>I'm hurting. I'm angry. I'm bitter. The video game movie that should have been a masterpiece is just another disasterpiece. I don't know how everything that was so awesome in the game got so badly lost in translation. Is it too much to hope someone, someday, will do another Silent Hill movie that will nail the whole thing, not just the perfect set design? Maybe. I'm going to play the game again, to remind myself why I love Silent Hill in the first place."

","I don't play video games, so I went into this film with no pre-conceived notions or expectations. I came away pretty impressed and a little disturbed.<br/><br/>Rose and Chris Da Silva are worried about their adopted daughter, Sharon. Little Sharon has been sleepwalking and speaking, while still asleep, of a place called Silent Hill. When Sharon nearly falls to her death during her latest sleepwalk, Rose decides to confront the issue head-on. She packs Sharon into the SUV and heads for Silent Hill, West Virginia. But Silent Hill is a ghost town that the locals don't like to speak of and which is contaminated by an ever burning coal fire deep in the bowels of the earth. After a freak car accident knocks Rose out, she awakens to find Sharon gone and a rain of ash falling from the sky. Silent Hill is indeed a ghost town, populated by demonic mutants and the ghosts of the damned. Rose is led by grisly clues deeper into the tragic history of the town and a terrible secret which involves her adopted daughter. Aided by police officer Cybil Bennet, Rose must face the dark demons of Hell and prevent history from repeating itself if she is to save Sharon.<br/><br/>This is quite a freaky film, though surprisingly not as gory as I had thought it would be. After a somewhat slow first 20 minutes or so, the film descends into rotting horror as air- raid sirens warn of The Darkness, deformed creatures lurch out of the shadows and the patina of normalcy literally melts away with the approach of evil. Standout characters include the sorrowful Dahlia, played by Deborah Kara Unger, who looks like the worlds oldest and saddest Goth woman, and the hideous creature known only as Pyramid Head, who stomps into view with a horde of cockroaches at his command. Radha Mitchell does a great job as Rose, playing her as a realistically frightened woman, but also as a determined mother who will stop at nothing to save her daughter. Jodelle Ferland is great in her double role of Sharon/ Alessa, a sweet, haunted little girl one moment; a creepy, frightening little monster the next. Sean Bean as the hopelessly lost Chris Da Silva is perfect; you can feel his frustration and panic. Alice Krige too is unnervingly chilling as Christabella.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of this movie is great - ash covered cemeteries, drippy basements, abandoned schoolrooms - all very creepy and menacing in their utter stillness. The violence, when it comes, is quite brutal. Skin is ripped off, bodies are roasted, limbs ripped away by barbed wire. Pretty gruesome, but not overly so. The demons are the real attraction here: besides Pyramid Head, there are also twisted torsos spewing black acid, deformed beings in nurse uniforms wielding scalpels and, in the scene which freaked me out the most, a man with his body bent double and his feet over his head crawling across a bathroom floor. <br/><br/>I've never played the video game so I really can't tell you if this was a faithful adaptation or not. But I can say that it is very original, quite spooky, satisfyingly bloody and even rather disturbing in several parts...and I don't scare easily. All in all, a very good horror movie."
"Cooldude3","7","99","179","21 April 2006"," Fans will be pleased but wanting more.
","Silent Hill is far from a perfect movie. But, Silent Hill is also one of the best video game to movie adaptations out there. That's really not saying much. If you were to watch this movie without playing the games, you might as well bring your pillow. Fortunately for me, I've played all 4 games in the series multiple times, and it was for people like me that the movie was made in the first place. The plot of the movie steals familiar elements from the games. But, it doesn't tie into the games. They combined the plots of the first two games, changed the focus around, and ultimately steered away from the MUCH darker and much more confusing plot of the games. The fans will either be smiling with glee or reliving their darkest nightmares as the movie tosses fans a lot of bones. There are EXACT shots recreated on the silver screen that were used in the games. Multiple times I THOUGHT I knew the direction in which the movie was going, because it was so familiar, and then they'd go in a completely different direction. It was actually irritating at first, but once I got over that, I just enjoyed it for what it was. Do NOT expect to watch ""Resident Evil"" with this movie. While they may share similar genres, that's where the comparisons end. MUCH like the game, the movie is slow, and it's scares rely on a creepy, skin-crawling feeling rather than ""jump"" scares. But, the acting is actually what impressed me. Some may see it as annoying, but those that played the game, will actually feel like they pulled dialogue directly out of it. And, Radha Mitchell does a good job acting like a frantic mother searching for her child. I will admit though, at times I wanted to pull my hair out in frustration because her character actually hardly does anything. She just runs around, chasing after a little girl that she thinks is her daughter. Did no one learn anything from Event Horizon? If they run AWAY from you, they are playing a game with you. Apart from minor annoyances with her character, the other characters were bland and flat, but hey, you can't have an ""R"" rated horror movie without a high corpse count. Although they did take the ""survival horror"" to the extreme with the survival part. It would've been nice to see some of the violence directed at the creatures. C'mon, you beat them senseless with lead pipes in the game, but that was lacking. Sean Bean could've helped make the movie all that more stellar, but he's kind of a side-plot. Without giving too much away, there's some closure to the movie, but it would be naive to say they wouldn't make a sequel starring Sean Bean, unless, of course, he was only a ""draw"" to bring more to the movie. The cinematography and camera angles steal from the game, but they are effective and well done. The sound was superb, with many sound bytes from the games, and a lot of eerie effects for the creatures. The gore was a little over the top, and like mentioned earlier, needed to be directed more at the creatures. All in all, the movie felt like a throwback to the games, putting in as many elements that made ""sense"" with the movies plot, to make the fans happy. Those unfamiliar with the series, MAY appreciate it for what it is. Basically this- it's a creepy and gory distraction, that's pretty boring as is, but given that it's based off of a video game that's just a creepy and gory distraction, that's pretty boring as well, they're a perfect match. Just remember that it's probably the best video game-to-movie adaptation out there (need I bring up Uwe Boll?), but leaves it's fans wanting more. Thankfully, the movie industry milks licenses for all they're worth, and we'll probably see a sequel sometime in the future."
"chad_odom","10","54","95","21 April 2006"," Excellent film, meets and surpasses standards in every way.
","Silent Hill came in with big expectations from video game fans, and horror fans alike. Knowing what I do about ""game based films"" usually tending to be sub-par, I was very impressed when Silent Hill not only met my standards for a great horror film, but also surpassed them.<br/><br/>Ignoring the typical teen horror movie ""boo factor"" Silent Hill scares by the creepiness of the backdrops, creating hellish environments out of otherwise peaceful (but slightly haunting) areas. The plot describes the town of Silent Hill that Rose finds herself trapped in as a ""nightmare world"", and that is exactly what Christophe Gans does with the film. Buildings actually transform into a caged inferno when ""the darkness"" comes. The creatures that come with this darkness, the pyramid head, the patient demons, and the nurse demons all instill a sense of innate fear. <br/><br/>But perhaps the best part was the fact that none of the evils of the world are overused. That is what truly separates this film from a zombie movie. The demons, with the exception of the pyramid head, aren't the true evil of the film, but rather work to install a profound sense of fear while they are on screen. Gans was not afraid to get gory in the film either, having several scenes with deformed and tortured bodies, as well as one where the pyramid head flays a human being with his bare hands. These scenes are also used extremely effectively, and nearly always add to the intensity of the movie. <br/><br/>The music and sound, much like in the game, is nearly perfect, avoiding the overused and ineffective ""heavy metal horror"" approach. <br/><br/>The acting, was the only part I could find some fault in. Radha Mitchell does a very good job with her part in most scenes, but there's a few where she is just way too ""cool under fire"" to be realistic. Sean Bean is not very emotional when he is ""emotional"" either. Other characters such as Laurie Holden playing Officer Bennett do an amazing job, and truly pull you into the plot though, so I can't discredit the casting too much.<br/><br/>In the end I truly believe this film is the best ""video game movie"" I have ever seen. It sticks true to the tales of silent hill, and leaves many allusions to the games, while not watering down the sheer sense of both mystery and fear that the games instill in its fans. As a horror movie this one also stands out above the rest, keeping the audience entertained, scared, and guessing throughout much of the film. <br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10, and I look forward to a sequel. I also recommend that any of you who liked the movie try the game, they compliment each other perfectly."
"warjamy","4","16","26","19 August 2006"," good visuals, not so good acting, weak story line
","The title says it all : - the ""spooky"" moments (when darkness falls) are sort of cool visually but not creepy (to my mind). I never played the game but I suppose some of the gory stuff shows in the game (like bloody characters - or parts of them - hanging from barbwire and stuff, the big demon itself with its funny box hiding its head, and its huge sword are typical of a video game). The small distorted creatures are quite nightmarish. The change of reality is also successful I think. Also, when Rose is going down the pit to face the source of evil, I could definitely feel video gaming there. The screwed up nurses were a bit funny (but not spooky) ... <br/><br/>BUT ... <br/><br/>I completely lost interest when the church business started. Again, we have the same old (and annoyingly flat) ingredients : - religious fanatics, - f...ed-up kid that develops hatred - and worst of all : explanations!!! why on earth is the dark side of the girl explaining the whole root cause ??? <br/><br/>Another source of annoyance : acting. Pretty bad I think. The dialogs were a bit lame at times. Ex : <br/><br/><ul><li>Cybil, after her first darkness : ""what the f... was that ?""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rose, replying : ""It's gonna be fine, don't worry"".</li></ul><br/><br/>How lame can that be!!!<br/><br/>The character Chris is just optional, or not very useful at the least ...<br/><br/>I grade it 4/10 for the visuals, real effort here to a create nightmarish and disturbing atmosphere."
"Camera-Obscura","Null","29","52","17 October 2006"," Big, loud & dumb CGI horror fest
","I didn't expect much in the way of storytelling or suspense in a film based on a video game, but this was an embarrassment. All the lurid horror clichés are on offer; ravens flying round the church, witch burning. I don't even know what I just saw. There's no story, just one mindless action sequence after another. Sure, the beginning is promising and the first half hour it still got my attention, but soon it becomes clear that no effort was made to draw characters who have any resemblance to human beings and pretty soon it all becomes an alarmingly senseless excuse for and endless string of computer generated gory effects. <br/><br/>This is also a film that takes itself way too seriously, some in-joke reference could have made this slightly more bearable. We have undefinable creatures that are lurking in some underground tunnel complex, where for the last thirty years a coal fire is raging under the ground. At first I was intrigued - a little - but since it is absolutely impossible to grasp what these ""things"" are and no explanation is given, it becomes nothing more than a video-game side-show. The final scene in the church, where the whole cast suffers from some incredible over-acting, has some spectacular effects, I'll admit that, but eventually goes WAY over the top and takes so long, it soon becomes downright ridiculous. Going over the top can be fun, but not without humor. <br/><br/>Former Tarantino video clerk-buddy Roger Avary penned this thing down and assembled some bad Canadian actors. He should be so lucky he got co-story credit for RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION, since he clears things for us here. He can't write, he's got no idea whatsoever that a motion picture has very little in common with a video game. You need to have actual human beings in a motion picture, or present some interesting visual ideas. We get neither.<br/><br/>And the dialog...? I can't remember all the mumbo jumbo I've heard. The second half of the film is full of hysterical lines like;<br/><br/>""The Truth is clear for those who see."" <br/><br/>""We drew a line in the sand and said: Demon, do not cross!"" <br/><br/>And I thought THE VILLAGE was a new low in pseudo satanic reli-crab.<br/><br/>Sean Bean was top-billed but he only has five minutes screen time with - again - mind-bogglingly awful dialog. <br/><br/>Skip this big-budget overblown piece of junk.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 2/10"

","I had few expectations when I first saw this movie, except that I know I love Roger Avary's writing. Before I alienate any people who hated the movie, I will explain...some of this dialog and acting was meant to BE BAD!!! Although I love the story arch of the silent hill games the writing for dialog is downright AWFUL with acting worse than Keanu Reeves. In general I'd say most of the acting is quite good, but anyone has to admit moments like: --""They used to say this town was haunted"" --""I think they were right"" is so awful it makes skill crawl worse than any of the haunting images in the rest of the film. <br/><br/>I feel its great some of the better people in Hollywood are willing to make fun of the original source material, which they obviously were ashamed to love. Some plot points are difficult to follow, but I feel most people should be able to pick up on it if they aren't some drunk frat boy who wants to talk to the screen instead of watching what is on the screen.(I say this cause they were very loud in the theater the rest of the time.) <br/><br/>Sure, there's a lot of metaphors in it and I don't even want anyone to try and interpret it or worse say someone is far off. Things like this are left sketch with a few puzzle pieces missing and are meant for you to fill it in and make sense of it however you like! (Unless DVD audio-commentary tells you otherwise.) I never understood people being afraid during movies or complain about not being scared. I haven't been scared during a movie since I was a little kid and it was some awful film like tremors.

"ruhrohshingo","2","48","93","22 April 2006"," You've got to be kidding me, right? No? Damn.
","A two you might be asking yourself right now. Yeah, that's right. The ONLY reason why this movie got a two out of me was because I was impressed by the creature and setting designs. The transforming of Foggy Silent Hill into Nightmare Silent Hill was definitely a visual I would've loved to have seen in the game series. Also, the creature representation was excellent as well right down to their movements, and of course, freaking Pyramid Head. I loved that guy...monster...thing...I give up. But that's about it. In dead on terms my opinion of this movie was mostly bad, a little good, and a lot that was bad but was inevitable in the movie adaptation. Stop reading now if you gave this movie higher than a 5.<br/><br/>Reasons why this movie didn't work:<br/><br/>-There should be no hordes, rather in my opinion single creatures stalking around the protagonists would have been more effective in making an eerie and uneasy atmosphere. <br/><br/>-Although I agree with its usage, ultimately it would have been better to cut out the husband who does not really get ""involved"" with Silent Hill. His use to move the truth along is important, but I felt that the answers could have been found within the city itself rather than out. By cutting to scenes of the husband searching outside of Silent Hill you lose intensity which could have been focused inside the city. I felt that detachment from the source really put a cramp on the potential of this movie.<br/><br/>-Long drawn explanations. Rather than having it all just told to the audience straight out front from the horse's mouth, subtle hints and fragments of the truth would have made this movie noteworthy if not a hot topic of discussion after the movie is over. The only questions I heard about the movie after seeing it was confusion about the ending which you will have to see for yourself. A movie that gives subtle hints to the answer is a hell of a lot better after the movie is over rather than a movie that spills its guts in the last 20 some minutes.<br/><br/>-Idiotic statements. Let's see here, what are some lines that people just couldn't help but laugh at? ""it seems like there was a fire here,"" ""Look...I'm burning,"" ""what the f***....what the f***!?"". I'd certainly hope that the intellect of the audience isn't put into question when statements like these have to be made. And that just goes to show that silence is golden more times than not.<br/><br/>-Gore. We all know and some love it. What's a modern horror flick without the gratuitous gore-fest? I admit that sometimes it is necessary but not to the extent to which the movie goes with it.<br/><br/>The list could go on...and on, but it's gonna stop there. For me, who has played through all the SH games numerous times (once for each ending no less!), there were a lot of inherent flaws, but at the same time those flaws were necessary to make the adaption possible for the mainstream viewers. If you're someone who goes and sees this movie and found it unenjoyable, confusing, or not worth giving higher than a 5, then do yourself a favor and go find cheap used copies of the video games and find out why veterans are shooting back and forth between ""this movie was an excellent representation of SH"" and ""this movie disgraced SH"". <br/><br/>But don't let anything I've said deter YOU from seeing this movie. There is a lot to be appreciated that isn't connected to the plot, and yes, I do mean the visuals. Creature design and screen representation are amazing. I never dreamed I would be able to see Pyramid Head in all his frightening glory. Also, the architecture of the city itself is pretty much 100% scale to the city from the games (right down to the street names, in particular Nathan ave). But the thing that really made me smile was how the city would change from Foggy Silent Hill into Nightmare Silent Hill. I can't stress how cool that visual was."

In the last couple years, it seems that the J-horror movies was everything this genre had to show up, little girls with long black hair, with pale faces and all of'em living in a microwave, TV, Radio, refry, etc. Directors like Carpenter, Romero, Craven were on a second line and with movies with no promotion (at least here in Argentina). This movie it's like Carpenter meets Romero. lot of blood but a great history behind. I hope Gans carreers continue with movies like this.

But it seems that this is not supposed to be the case, so the rest of the story just goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>As she and her daughter near Silent Hill ... at night ... in the pouring rain ... (please, sir, I want some more predictability!) Rose sees flashing police lights behind her -- probably trying to pull her over for a busted taillight or something, but we never find out. Instead of pulling off to the side of the road, Rose tells Sharon (who is sitting in the front seat, as all children under the age of 12 should be doing in an SUV) to ""Buckle up"" ... and then guns it.<br/><br/>Okaaaaay. Good one, Mom! Way to start a high-speed chase with your kid in the car! That's almost as smart as taking her to a deserted village after dark with no plan whatsoever of what to do once you get there! So at least you're on the right track!<br/><br/>Of course, Rose loses control of her vehicle, swerves, hits her head on the steering wheel, and goes unconscious. When she wakes up, Sharon is gone, and the fun begins.<br/><br/>The rest of the flick shows Rose following ""clues"" to try to ""find"" Sharon. She makes a few unlikely friends along the way (shock!) and discovers a few disturbing things about the town (specifically, freakish phantom-zombie things), and honestly, I was really bored at this point, so I kind of stopped paying attention.<br/><br/>I was a bit revived when Rose's husband, played by Sean Bean (which, what kind of sadistic parents name their kid ""Sean Bean""? Probably the kind who drag their daughter to a haunted town, come to think of it), popped back into the picture to attempt to establish a sub-plot. But then I realized that whatever he was doing was having no impact whatsoever on the main, more retarded, plot, so I just sat back and let my eyes re-glaze over.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hoped that all my questions (namely, ""What the ...?"") would be answered, and that the ending would tie everything together and either be happy, sad, or intriguing.<br/><br/>Except, no. I would give the end away (so that you don't feel compelled to go and see what a festering pile of Why Did This Movie Get MADE?? looks like), but I just don't feel like wasting any more moments of my life on what was possibly the worst two hours I have ever spent in a movie theater, including the previews.<br/><br/>So, there you have it.

","You might learn that this supernatural thriller comes from a video game but don't let it stop you from watching it. It's an adaptation that's actually decent and that works very well as a serious horror film. How did they manage that rare feat? It might be because they hired a talented french director (he did Brotherhood of the Wolf which you should see) who loved the original material and actually found it frightening (which it is). He even had to woo the notoriously protective Japanese producers (Konami) for years to be accepted. The guy was dedicated and he shoots some hellishly beautiful scenes. It might be because the story is engrossing and mysterious. It might be because the mostly unknown actresses (mostly a female cast in the major roles) play it very well and seriously.<br/><br/>It might be because the creatures are genuinely creepy and disturbing. I would say they're original and never seen before but actually most of them are concepts from the games brought to life. They were so good I thought they were computer-made but actually it's mostly actors, actually professional dancers, in suits and makeup. And let me tell you having dancers makes a huge difference in terms of having great creature movements that push them a notch above. It might be because it relies more on unnerving atmosphere, nightmarish visuals, dreamlike quality than jump surprises and gore for its scares. Mostly it might be so good because Silent Hill changed stuff but kept the spirit of the games (yes, that's a good thing). Silent Hill is no Resident Evil for those unfamiliar so don't expect zombies or something similar. <br/><br/>Some might have issues with the actions of the main character at the start before going into the town. I did too but then I thought about it (the day after) and realized she was doing this against her husband's will as a last ditch attempt to help her daughter. Still... it's a bit reckless and irrational. The other thing that might bug and confuse viewers is that Silent Hill leaves you with questions unanswered. Personally, I like that type of story where they do explain a lot but don't neatly tie up everything. The ending will certainly make you think and second guess. The film itself might even warrant a second viewing for better understanding. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of everything here. It should please horror fans whether or not they're fans of the games provided they watch it with an open mind not expecting their standard American slasher fest.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"

","Strangely, the sequel did a better job of capturing the actual feel of the classic Silent Hill games from which this series ostensibly drew its name. This film, however, is a terrible disaster. It drags on for over two hours, in which time it never justifies its length. It's a pathetic attempt to alter the original game's story, but it manages to do absolutely nothing right, instead needlessly shifting characters' genders and creating extraneous characters that it never makes anything but annoying and awful.<br/><br/>The direction is terrible, the photography is atrocious, and the acting is barely serviceable, which says something considering that this film includes some generally good actors. Sean Bean is utterly wasted on the disposable role he's given, and Kim Coates is literally *painful* as Thomas Gucci. There's so much in this movie that is worth of contempt, and not just because it flagrantly disregards the beloved series of games, but because as a film it's crap.<br/><br/>Whatever message it attempts to present is lost in a morass of misogyny and incompetence. It's not even entertaining, which is probably is greatest fault; it certainly does not engage an audience, nor does it justify its ridiculously long running time.<br/><br/>Skip this one and watch the sequel instead; it actually tells a decent story that feels true to the source material, unlike this pathetic garbage.

In other words, when I came to the theater tonight, I was *expecting* that the movie would suck horribly.<br/><br/>And yet when I left the theater again, it had placed itself so far below my worst expectations that I was infuriated by how miserably deplorable it was. A pox upon the director.<br/><br/>I should declare that I am an avid fan of the three Silent Hill video games. (I pretend that the fourth one does not exist, just like I will banish the knowledge of the existence of this movie to the cobwebbiest corner of the most inactive compartment of my memory immediately after having written this review.) The Silent Hill games absolutely rule. I liked the second one the best. One thing that makes them good is that they manage to deliver that eerie Silent Hill atmosphere which most ""horror"" games and movies can only dream about. Another thing is that the game designers had found the *exact* point where the balance is optimal between how much is shown and how much is left to the imagination. A third thing is that the plot always was (although never quite as deep as I would have liked them) always deep *enough* so as not to be dull and boring.<br/><br/>The Silent Hill movie is a shallow, uninteresting, and *incredibly* annoying excuse for a pathetic, brainless gore flick that could have come out of that miserable genre's most disgusting peak in the 1990's, if it hadn't been for the special effects.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was actually slightly better than I expected. So I kind of regained some hope there. The classic Silent Hill imagery was brought to the screen pretty nicely, the music was great - although that might have been due to the fact that they simply took the entire soundtrack straight out of the games - and all I really had to complain about was that they had decided to scrap the Mark of Samael/Seal of the Metatron/whatever and that the volume was way too loud way too often, to the point where it became ridiculous. And then, the middle of the film appeared. Hello and welcome to The Middle of the Film, the moment where we take a never-ending break from *not* completely screwing up this game- to-film conversion. Cue a very long hour of extremely graphic close-ups of people being burned to death, penetrated by and torn in half by rusty barbed wire, superfluously stripped naked and then skinned alive and so forth. Reveal the plot in its ""dramatic"" and ""shocking"" entirety - and the plot is basically a mix of the first and third games, except stripped of everything interesting and dumbed down to fit the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>By the time the miserable movie finally ended, I was just p'ed off.<br/><br/>I hope the design team behind the games had as little as possible to do with this production, because if not, the next game is likely going to be as much of a waste of time and money as this movie was."
"doomtrot26","1","11","18","23 September 2007"," About as insipid, hackneyed, childish and inaccurate as a Resident Evil movie.
","All I ever really wanted out of a video game film adaptation was one that simulated the feeling of the game to the point where it actually felt like the game it was based off of in every aspect (save for the technical ones such as menus, options, etc.); not only would it full fill the needs of the long-running fans (in other words didn't start playing the most recent game in the series before viewing), but it would also give common movie goers a better idea of what the game is really about between its presentation, cast of characters, aspects, fun-factor and strains. <br/><br/>I realize this method is impossible, yet modern film makers, script writers and their massive checkbooks alike seem to think otherwise. <br/><br/>Here is the movie's most accurate points: <br/><br/>Set designs - 90% of the sets actually looked like the backgrounds to many of the Silent Hill games between the fog inundated street corners and even parts of the Other World (forgiving the fact that we only see a little bit of it now and then). <br/><br/>Cinematography - Some of the camera angles reproduced frame by frame were accurate as well, particularly the alley overhead shot from the first game. <br/><br/>Here is the movie's least accurate points: <br/><br/>Characters and portrayal -In the Silent Hill games, there is a large emphasis on character empathy as even some of the two dimensional characters you end up learning to care about. There were very few characters in the movie that really begged for sympathy including the main character and her determination to uncover her daughter's mysteries whilst attempting to get arrested and possibly even get her daughter injured in a car accident in the process. There was just about one character in the movie who showed any point of development or characterization, but the character was so poorly presented it was impossible to feel anything for said character.<br/><br/>Too much gore - It's not that I don't appreciate a gory horror film, it's just that the Silent Hill games were never entirely about massive amounts of gore, blood or even shocking deaths. The only game in the series that had any type of gore was the first game and all the gore was postmortem (some of the bodies were actually mummified) and none of it adhered to any form of reality or even the living characters in the game. In this movie, the gore is thrown out from the characters so much it feels like the film was based off a completely different game or movie.<br/><br/>Ripped soundtrack - Rather than finding musical artists to reproduce the sound of the game's soundtrack or even ask Yamaoka (the original composer of the game's songs) to compose a soundtrack for the movie, the creators found it unique to just take existing songs from three of the past four games and insert it into the movie, remixing at least two. All of the songs however represent specific moments in the game, so it's impossible to get into the movie when you're thinking too much of a specific moment from the games. <br/><br/>Combat - As the games allowed the players to navigate the protagonist around their settings, the games also allowed the protagonist to protect themselves against the various demented enemies. Such never happens in the movie. Rather, the heroine basically depends upon another heroine to do all the fighting for her; If Rose were trapped in an actual Silent Hill game, she would've been dead 5 minutes into the game.<br/><br/>Puzzles - Although the movie does try to display a few puzzles in the game as well as item searching, the concept falls flat after the first few items a nd puzzles experienced due to the fact that there was only one puzzle and one item retrieval moment, the puzzle being so simple any one could figure it out. The puzzles of Silent Hill have always been complex and challenging, even if there was only one such challenging puzzle in the fourth game with the rest being of the simple 'retrieve and use here' fashion.<br/><br/>Plot - Not only does it have little to nothing to do with the complex and unique history of the town, but it also has little uniqueness or complexity to it. What seems like a romp into another's psyche and a horrifying truth that challenges the very existence of the characters we're supposed to care about turns out to be a sad excuse to make a modern horror movie with a bunch of gore and a video game name slapped on the cover.<br/><br/>Atmosphere - The atmosphere of the Silent Hill games are indeed visual and often ubiquitous, but it is still a slow atmosphere that lingers on the audience and builds up through exploration of settings. Such just does not happen here. Although the settings were good, we just didn't get to see them enough for them to contribute to the atmosphere, nor did the presence of the monsters.<br/><br/>Creature designs that adhered to plot - No matter what, all creatures in the Silent Hill games had something to do with the plot. Nine out of ten times, the monsters here are just thrown in because they were inspired from previous games and only one of which actually adheres to the plot, forgiving the fact that it was made solely for show and didn't even do anything.<br/><br/>There are some other aspects the director and script writer added particularly the director's sense of over-rationalizing and questioning puritanical occult authorities (reminds me of another film that he's famous for...) and some of which do shoot down the game's principles, but my apathy for this movie has all ready taken mammoth proportions.<br/><br/>I refuse to call this movie accurate to its source, I refuse to call this movie good and I refuse to willingly see it again."
"goldberri","5","30","59","22 April 2006"," First half was perfect; second half was a WTF director's indulgence
","The trailers pulled me in. The sirens, the intro music. One of my favorite games had been brought to the big screen. For some reason I put aside my current cynicism about the incredible amount of unoriginal crap coming out of Hollywood and opted for nothing but excitement and anticipation.<br/><br/>The first half of Silent Hill delivered just that. Sure there were differences with the game. Harry the Dad instead became Rose the mom. Cheryl was now renamed Sharon (who the hell names their kid ""Sharon"" nowadays anyway?). Sean Bean (a wonderful British actor) was obviously written in at the last moment (and struggling to keep an American accent), just to keep the cast from being all female. But, it was still the Silent Hill that I loved. Exciting, horrific, mysterious. My husband knew nothing about the game yet he was equally transfixed once the sirens started and all went dark. It was perfect until...<br/><br/>*****THE HEART OF THE MATTER*****<br/><br/>Midway through the movie something went terribly wrong. It's not just that the movie changed the plot of the game. That's been done before and usually for very acceptable reasons. Instead, the director hijacked the movie with his own creative indulgence. And, it wasn't good. In fact, it was cliché and preachy. I was instantly pulled out of the story. All I could do was think of how boneheaded I must've been to assume Hollywood wouldn't screw it up. The movie lost me and the intensity and enjoyment were gone.<br/><br/>Suddenly what was originally (in the game) the cruel experiments of a group of ambitious doctors, instead became the fanaticism of a group of Hollywood's biggest enemy, you guessed it, evil Christians led by a ""pious"" ringleader who controls them with their own fear of evil and the impure. They take all that's different and burn it at the stake. This was so stupid it was insulting. Not only are we expected to believe that they burned a little girl at the stake as a witch, but that this occurred in 1974 (well it :was: West Virginia). <br/><br/>Nevermind the fact that a) witch burnings NEVER occurred in America and the last witch hanging occurred over 300 years ago (not even close to 1974); b) witch burnings only ever occurred in Europe. <br/><br/>And what the hell were witch burnings and fanatical Christians doing in Silent Hill anyway???<br/><br/>Well, let's take a look at the last movie by director Christophe Gans... that would be the thriller Pacte des Loups - what we in the US know as The Brotherhood of the Wolf. <br/><br/>Advertised as a thriller about an evil supernatural beast that goes around slaughtering folk all over the 18th century French countryside, this film also had my full interest for the first half. Until you find out who the *real* bad guys are. The *true* evil in Brotherhood of the Wolf were a group of fanatical Christians led by a ""pious"" ringleader who seeks to control the people of France using their own fear of evil and the impure. It was done in a very preachy and exaggerated manner, with none of the subtleties that could've made it remotely believable. Gee, that sounds familiar.<br/><br/>So what we have here is a director whose last 2 movies (Silent Hill and The Brotherhood of the Wolf) were: <br/><br/>TWO VERY DIFFERENT STORIES WHERE THE BAD GUY APPEARED TO BE SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL AND EVIL BUT WAS IN FACT A GROUP OF HYSTERICALLY FANANTICAL CHRISTIANS CONTROLLED BY THEIR OWN FEAR OF DIFFERENCE AND CHANGE, WHO IN TURN SLAUGHTER THE INNOCENT IN HORRIBLY GRAPHIC WAYS TO PROTECT AND RELISH IN THEIR CHRISITIANITY.<br/><br/>Hmmmmmmmm.................................................<br/><br/>Bit of an agenda out there.<br/><br/>Especially when that had absolutely nothing to do with the original Silent Hill storyline. A change in story to make it more accessible and understandable would be fine. BUT DON'T PUT IN SOME GUY'S PREACHY RELIGION-IS-EVIL AGENDA THAT HE DUPLICATED FROM HIS PREVIOUS MOVIE!!!!!!!! That's beyond lame. <br/><br/>Final note: What they did to Cybil was needlessly graphic. It wasn't art, it wasn't horror, it was disgusting and indulgent. <br/><br/>I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 because the first half was perfect and the 2nd merits less than zero."
"Gangsteroctopus","1","20","37","11 November 2007"," You people are ON CRACK
","First off, how does a film this bloody awful rate a 6.5 out of 10?! I suppose if you're an attention span-deprived adolescent who does nothing but play video games endlessly, and whose neural cortex has been so totally overstimulated that the only thing that will prompt you to move or register a flicker of human emotion (other than ennui or blind anger) is either a can of Red Bull or a jolt in the testicles with a taser, then have at it. This movie is for you.<br/><br/>However, if you're actually interested in a film with recognizable human beings, something that vaguely resembles a story and any kind of connection to what is generally acknowledged as the real world, then you better fuggidabowdit. Where to begin...<br/><br/>Okay, the opening scene pretty much sets you up for what to expect for the next 2+ hours (?! and I thought ""The Passion of the Christ"" felt long): you've got a young couple lives in a house that's RIGHT NEXT to a two-lane blacktop that's busy with truck traffic in the middle of the night, which is also poised RIGHT NEXT to a waterfall with a sheer drop of what looks to be at least a hundred feet; they've got a nine-year-old daughter WITH A HISTORY OF SLEEPWALKING - and yet...this little girl is somehow able to leave the house in the middle of the night; there are no safety features whatsoever to prevent her from wandering off their property either into traffic, or to stand poised on the verge of this precipitous cliff; and - AND (this is the big one) the girl's mother's solution to her daughter's problem is to IMMEDIATELY head off to this abandoned, haunted town the name of which her sleepwalking daughter has been repeatedly crying out during her somnabulistic states. I think we have a winner for Parent of the Year...<br/><br/>This film takes place in a 'reality' that bears absolutely no resemblance whatsoever to the one that you and I live in - and I'm not talking about the haunted town of Silent Hill here. I'm talking about a 'reality' where a young mother, alone with her young daughter at a gas station in the middle of the night, out in the middle of nowhere, as she is walking into said gas station to pay, blithely walks past a scary, dominatrix-looking bike cop WHO'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HER SUV WHERE THE DAUGHTER IS SITTING IN THE FRONT SEAT WITH THE WINDOW HALFWAY DOWN and doesn't even so much as turn her head as they pass one another. WTF..? And - oh, get this - she walks into said gas station/restaurant, whose parking lot outside is conspicuously empty of any other vehicles apart from her own and that of the scary bike cop, and...the place is FULL of people! Where are their cars and trucks parked? This movie can't be bothered with such 'mundane' details.<br/><br/>And that's a HUGE problem and here's why: look, I'm not one of these nigglers who demands that a movie adhere absolutely to some perfect resemblance to the real world. Far from it. BUT when you're making a movie with fantastical elements, like those in SILENT HILL, the more closely and rigorously you define a 'real world' to contrast with the fantastical you're going to create, the more impact that latter world will have on the audience. But if the 'real' world in which your characters live is, in and of itself, so totally disconnected from anything even vaguely resembling the waking world, then its bound to seem much, much less impressive when an armless, headless ghoul stumbles out of an auto graveyard and vomits black acid on someone.<br/><br/>Another thing: films with fantastic elements - sci-fi, horror, fantasy, etc. - need to establish, if only obliquely, what the 'rules of the game' are. That never happens in SILENT HILL. Basically, Rhada Mitchell gets to the haunted town, lose her daughter and then spends the next two hours running and stumbling from one lurid, horrific set-piece to another with absolutely no sense of progression or logic. And the fact that the viewer has only the vaguest sense of why she's doing what she's doing is only further infuriated by the fact that instead of at least attempting to lay out some ground rules or sense of purpose, the movie spends seemingly endless amounts of time and energy to fill in a totally absurd and utterly derivative backstory that supposedly makes this all make sense (which it most assuredly does not).<br/><br/>Oh, what a waste - of my time; of millions that could have financed 20 independent features (at least maybe 10% of which might have turned out good, giving viewers a 200% return on investment, so to speak); of the talents of a lot of good actors (Sean Bean, Rahda Mitchell, Kim Coates, etc.) and crew (Carol Spier's production design is, as always, top notch). Notice how I DON'T mention the director, Christophe Gans (go back to France, game-boy!) or credited writer Roger Avary (give back your Oscar now, Roger!). Yes, an utter waste.<br/><br/>I hated this film and if you liked it, chances are I hate you too."
"tributarystu","5","4","5","17 August 2006"," Not so Silent Hill
","I played Silent Hill 2, a few years ago, although I never adhered to the big fans of the series. I'm more a Resident Evil kind of guy - staying in the characters and in the storyline, not so much in the psychological realms of 'what the heck does this mean?'. So, in a way, I'm envious, because the movie looks a lot like the games (although there seem to have been a lot of compromises in constructing it - characters from one game, storyline from another, etc; or so my big SH fan - informer tells me).<br/><br/>However, Silent Hill suffers from a totally different disease than the Resident Evil franchise: the games are very engrossing, mind-boggling, they take you to the edge of perception and logic. A really hard thing to do in a film, without making it feel shallow and cold. Such an attempt would call for a great script. A script which, sadly, turns out to be so uninspired and poorly written, that it ruins all the fun.<br/><br/>The story about a mother looking for her child - mysteriously drawn to the town of Silent Hill - is nothing but a long and tedious pretext for atmosphere. I hate to say it, but to make Silent Hill so 'worldly' as a story about witchcraft and silly monsters just isn't creepy enough. You do feel at times that the director tries to transfer ideas from the world of the games to the world of film, in the sense of Silent Hill being not only a typical 'ghost town' story, but also a metaphorical place of demise and sin, the most horrid depths of ones mind - a big, entrenching nightmare. But this barely works. In the end you're left with silly lines of dialog, mediocre acting at its best (not that one could have done much more with such lines) and - what I felt it to be - mundane lighting (in the idea of what scares you most is what you don't see; just that it doesn't quite work).<br/><br/>I may have enjoyed the musical theme at certain moments, as it had a very dreamy ring to it - as it should've. But then again, it just wasn't enough. For a film which is two hours long, Silent Hill has very little contents to offer. It's not even the nightmare I always dreamt it to be."
"jason-gates","1","23","46","23 April 2006"," Awful, awful film.
","Takes ages to get going. Quite gory and un-necessary. Tries to be clever but this results in cheese-ball cliché lines. My take: at the point that the mother wakes following the crash both her, the cop and her daughter are dead. The whole film is set in effectively ""purgatory"" where the townspeople wait to be judged for their actions as witch-hunters.<br/><br/>The mother and cop follow all sorts of clues and for some reason ""the darkness"" wants to kill them despite the fact that they are ultimately useful to the ""demon"". The demon (a young girl possessed to carry out the revenge of Alicia, a young girl in the town accused of being a witch who was to be burnt to death. She survived and ultimately sought revenge with the assistance of the demon) could have explained the situation initially and offered an ultimatum from the word go and reduced the film's length by an hour. There was no need to follow clues.<br/><br/>At the end of the film the cop is burnt alive and the mother and daughter return home, still both dead, and haunt the father/husband.<br/><br/>Absolute garbage. Some of the filming and effects were impressive. The storyline is really really bad!"

","My girlfriend and I watched this movie in the theaters and we both agreed it was a complete waste of time and money. This film was so bad that we couldn't even laugh at the stupidity of it all. At least with some low budget films, they are so cheesy that you can crack a smile at how rotten and dumb they are, ala Date Movie or Bride of Chucky. This movie was just plain awful.<br/><br/>Admittedly I have never played the video game and am not a gamer. I am over 30 years old and everyone else in the audience was in high school. I think if you are over 25 years old you cannot possibly enjoy this film unless you still have the aptitude of a teenager, or excuse me for saying this, are mentally retarded or a complete moron.<br/><br/>The story made absolutely no sense. The characters were not in the least bit interesting and the acting was really bad. I am not only surprised, but am utterly appalled and that this movie has a 6.5 rating. It's as if all the fans of the video game joined forces, visited the IMDb, and voted a 10 on this film to counteract all the 1s that it surely received.<br/><br/>Generally I don't enjoy bad-mouthing a film, I prefer to review movies that I found entertaining, and which I could say something positive. Yet, I feel compelled to slam this one in hopes that it will prevent one person in my social demographic from avoiding this film if they were at all tempted to watch it. Rating 1 0f 10 stars."
"cyberknight","10","10","17","20 February 2007"," Must Have an Extended Version!
","It's hard to write about this movie, because the reaction to it depends somewhat on having or not played the games. This movie is based on Konami's ""Silent Hill"" series of games, mainly on the first, with elements of the second. Some people that have played the games seem to have failed to realize that, expecting to see a ""film version"" of the first game, what this movie is not! SH is based on the games, not converted from them, fortunately. The only complaint I have about this movie is that it is too short, the plot is too complex for a two-hours movie, some scenes could be expanded and some speeches slowed down (with longer background sequences).<br/><br/>The characters are mostly from the first game, the others are originals. Their development is much better than in the game, mostly because the characters wander alone in the first game. In the movie, the characters stay together most of the time (it's not ""Scooby-doo"", they do not separate when things get rough...) The actors also play very well their roles, mainly the little girl. Pay attention to her eyes, they tell more about the story than is actually said.<br/><br/>One thing that is preserved from the games (and even enhanced) is the background, the ""something-scary-is-coming"" atmosphere. If the movie was longer, some elements of the games that appear in the movie could have been better used, but that doesn't make the movie less enjoyable.<br/><br/>And after watching the movie, I realized something that is not so obvious in the games: humans are the real monsters (and I don't mean only in the games/movies!) The demons stalking in Silent Hill don't compare in evilness to the humans hiding there! If you can't cope with violence in movies, especially in this one, then don't read the morning newspapers, lock the doors and stay in bed... And once you are at it, play ""Silent Hill"", the game, it has not one, but TWO different ""happy endings""! Real life is not so merciful..."
"miknnik","1","19","37","11 February 2007"," I'm kicking myself for watching it
","Had I known this movie was based on a video game, I would never have watched it, but sadly, I wasted a couple of hours on this drivel on DVD. <br/><br/>The story starts with an anxiety-ridden family whose young daughter sleepwalks. Before the audience can understand more of the family dynamics, the mother and the daughter are on their way to Silent Hill, where the girl quickly disappears after a minor car accident. The rest is a series of CG action scenes with some live actors in them. <br/><br/>I do know there are quite a few movies whose main attraction is CG. So why am I picking on this one? Because I watched it. I also know there are many movie-goers who enjoy movies packed with special effects. I may be an old school, but I like movies with the characters I can empathize with or love to hate. And I truly appreciate fine acting whether on-stage or on the big screen. In my opinion, the movies, in which actors become peripherals to almighty CG and FX, are an insult to the actors and producers who devote their lives to this art form. While watching Silent Hill, my phone rang. I usually pause whatever the video I'm watching to answer the phone, but this time, I couldn't care less about the movie or its characters, let it play on and enjoyed a fifteen-minute conversation with my friend more than what was on the TV screen. <br/><br/>About the ending: it does remind me of a short science fiction about a young mother and her albino baby. Somehow they are transported to a different dimension, and the woman's husband frantically tries to bring them back; however, as he is pulling them back to this world, the invisible portal closes. While the husband ages over the following years, the 'portrait' of the mother and child (they are halfway in this world but the rest remains elsewhere) that hangs in the air remains unchanged looking content with each other's company. Although the story was short and labeled as science fiction, I loved it because it dealt with human emotions--sorrow, shame, relief. Compared to it, the ending of Silent Hill was trite, almost an afterthought. <br/><br/>I've been telling my friends that the movie makers in Hollywood nowadays are an unimaginative lot churning out remakes, sequels, prequels and movies based on comic books and old TV shows. Some of them may be in the alternate reality believing the audience would embrace a movie like Silent Hill."
"ma-cortes","7","5","7","11 October 2007"," Good and eerie adaptation about famous video game and well realized by Christophe Gans
","This creepy and fantastic film gets a riveting script by Roger Avary. It's a spectacular piece and quite scary, so many levels, so many complexities and so many wonderful themes that are permeating throughout. It's like ¨Alice in Wonderland¨ meet ¨Dante's Inferno¨. It's based on known game and completely unique, absolutely frightening and, basically, one of the few games that actually could become a movie. Samuel Hadida , producer of the last three movie of Christophe Gans tells the game was conceptualized on the difficult way, because we had to go convince the Japanese people from Konami Corporation, they produced the game, to give us the right to make the film . The game has such a cult following, the fan base is very protecting. Christophe Gans is careful to maintain the suspense and all the areas , like the means of illumination in the darkness by a splendid cinematography by Dan Laustein and certain key of characters and antagonists, furthermore an appropriate music score by Jeff Danna. Gans has a very surrealist sort of vision of the game and the film itself sort of explores the boundaries of reality. The Silent Hill movie is a great experience, is something disturbing , it's not only about fear, it's also about emotion. <br/><br/>The cast is really exciting. There's a series of fresh faces, actors that you may be familiar with but you haven't seen then a thousand times before, they're going to bring life to the characters. The producers very deliberately went toward actors from independent film because they bring with them something different, a different quality. Actress like Radha Mitchell, Debora Kara Unger, Tanya Allen, Laurie Holden and Alice Krige, it's much more exciting to see somebody who doesn't used to do this kind of movie, but the audience of this type of film love that. For the role of Rose, Radha Mitchell, needed somebody with that blend of vulnerability but strength and determination as well. We have to feel her fear but also appreciate when she stands up to all these terrifying moments.In fact, the producers spent lots of time finding the perfect Rose. In terms of the sensibility that Christophe Gang was having in this character, Rose is sophisticated and very vulnerable and Radha Mitchell has both quality, she has a freshness and energy and excitement and life, there's this original look to her, all of which are precisely what the producers needed for the central character to lead us through this horrific environment. The director is focused on female character with just females leading the story in a way, with exception of two male characters: Sean Bean and Kim Coates. Christophe Gans is almost exorcised the idea of femininity by polarising it with the male characters, and all the women are in this kind of fantasy nightmare."

","Well, I may be a dissenting vote, but I thought Silent Hill was pretty bad. Yes, some of the visuals were very good (hence a score of 5 and not less)...but the story line, how silly! In trying to put in all the elements of the game (which I have played often), they crammed way too much to make this a good story. Rather, it's one shock scene after another. While that works in the beginning, it gets old pretty soon. And that ending...please, couldn't you think of a more creative (and logical) way to finish the story. Sorry but even ""doom"" was more interesting...and that wasn't very good either! I hope the next Resident Evil movie makes up for this fiasco!"
"nauseaaa","5","25","51","22 April 2006"," SH = BD (big disappointment)
","I had such high hopes for this movie. Whenever I saw the previews I was like, ""Wow that actually looks like it's pretty good!"" After seeing the movie though, I have a feeling people in love with the game will love the movie just because they'll be like, ""I remember that from the game,"" but for most others it'll be very lackluster.<br/><br/>This is kind of proof to me that what makes a good video game does not necessarily make a good movie. In a video game you can really immerse yourself in the scene, you *are* the character, and you're ""living"" this horror. You get to choose where you go (sort of), what you do (sort of), and you have to figure things out for yourself.. sort of. The music in a video game just enhances your own adventure and emotions rather than guides them. You can also get away with crazy monsters because, well, it's a video game! <br/><br/>These same rules don't apply to movies, however the makers of Silent Hill tried to make it as video-gameish as they could. When watching something from 3rd person instead of experiencing it in 1st person, you need that extra ""oomph"" to put you in the scene. That extra ""oomph"" was never added, and that's a major reason why the movie will fall flat to about 90% of viewers. (I'm pretty certain most viewers who have run out to see the film after being out for one day are fans of the game.) <br/><br/>You're never really given the opportunity to get ""into"" the film. The music only assists in being an annoyance rather than a motivator. The shift in settings ends up making the film seem disjointed and messy, rather than dynamic and interesting. The CGI effects end up looking silly and laughable, rather than frightening. (I'm not a huge fan of CGI in movies anyways, but it really hurts this film because it shows such a huge contrast between CGI and non-CGI moments.) <br/><br/>The acting is also quite painful in some areas. The little girl is more like a soap opera actress than a movie star. She was so unconvincing that it made me not take her seriously at all. Also, there were some extras that looked like they really needed some better direction. I felt like I was watching a made-for-TV drama at times...<br/><br/>Anyways, there were just better ways to do things to make this film work, like hiring a new sound guy, a new director, new writers, new editors, better actors, possibly a new cinematographer... see what I'm getting at here? It's just boring, silly, and disappointing... save your money and rent it on PPV. I would have rather them made a great movie loosely based on a video game than a so-so movie greatly based on a video game."

Not only is the movie completely cliché, it is extremely so, trying to incorporate elements from other horror films, but failing completely.<br/><br/>If you want to see a gory flick with absolutely no plot to speak of, then I suppose this is the movie for you."

I was prepared to be entertained and perhaps even frightened, instead I was bored almost to the point of walking out. The beginning is hard to follow, the middle defies any intelligence the viewer may have, and then ending is a poor attempt at trying to be a ""what if"" twilight zone feature. If you want to watch this I'd suggest quite a few beers or wines beforehand to try and make it entertaining. If you're after mind-numbing rubbish then go for it, if you want decent entertainment try another movie."

","There must be something really wrong with the world when a ""movie"" like this gets 6.6 in IMDb (at least while I'm writing this). My guess is that most of the votes are casted by fans of the game, who somehow cannot separate the game from the movie, as bad as it is. I was a fan of Wing Commander, but that didn't mean that I couldn't see that the movie was horrible, actually it angered me that the quality of the film was such bad in comparison with such a good game.<br/><br/>It is very obvious that this is a video game made into a movie, and a bad one at that. I never played the game, but my only explanation for the director leaving such an absurd and badly glued plot is that they were faithful to the video game storyline. Now, when a novel is adapted into a movie, nobody expects it to be a carbon copy, there has to be some input from the scriptwriters. Why isn't it so with people adapting video games into movies? My guess: Lack of talent by the people trying to adapt them.<br/><br/>The movie feels at all times like a video game (without the fun), the monsters get badder as people progress, and are completely different ones for no apparent reason. I even laughed at the part where they explain what the source of evil is, because nothing makes sense, and it only becomes more and more ridiculous. It seems that they just tried to throw in all the ""shocking"" elements they could think of, without thinking on how to put them together coherently. Not bad in a video game, where playability is the most important factor, and the storyline is just a plus which is supposed to add a little depth between the monster slashing, but terrible in a movie, where the storyline is supposed to be what entertains you.<br/><br/>Not only that, the movie is completely predictable and the directors seem to aim quite low at their intended public, as they are making obvious in too many of the scenes something that was completely obvious from the very beginning and that is supposed to surprise you at the end.<br/><br/>The special effects were the least bad part of the movie, but they were far from impressive, you could always tell they were computer animations (the ""nude"" in the movie is also computer effects) and some of them were too faithful to first person shooters character figures, more cartoon-like than real.<br/><br/>The movie fails completely to create any suspense as it is completely predictable, the characters are completely dull and cartoon like. It's not either shocking (like for example SAW), as the supposedly shocking scenes are computer animated and not that gory. They're not even laughable. There is nothing that will surprise you from this movie, nothing is original, its all like a random gathering of clips from other movies, that have all been better than this one.<br/><br/>I would continue but its unfair to continue wasting time on such a bad movie. The only excuse to see this movie is if you were a fan of the video game, and I suppose you would be disappointed by it."

"jjunebb","6","2","2","4 June 2020"," Time passer has visual appeal, but little substance
","When I picked this movie from the bargain bin the title ""Silent Hill"" meant nothing, and it looked like an interesting horror movie. However, once I began watching it quickly became apparent it was based upon a video game. Something in the sweeping camerawork, meticulously conceived sets, and character POV, further reinforced by its endless pursuits and diversions. You can almost hear the Ching-Ching reward every time the protagonist chooses the correct path or finds a way to outdo an enemy.
The plot, such as it is, is about a sleepwalking girl, Sharon (Joelle Ferland), dreaming of going to a place called Silent Hill, so her mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) takes her on a road trip in search of the mysterious dreamscape.
En route the car crashes and when Rose regains consciousness she finds that Sharon has disappeared, and it becomes a quest to find the child among the deserted buildings of Silent Hill. It looked, to me, a cold, misty place, of gently falling snow.
Rose spots a small figure and follows it into dark cavernous depths where she is confronted by deformed, faceless creatures, wailing and writhing before bursting into flames. From what I could gather, the story is that the town is built atop a mine that caught alight burning to death all the residents both below and above ground. It is then evident the mist is, in fact, smoke, and the snow is ash.
So far, so good...
Regrettably, the movie then lurches into countless muddled directions, involving all manner of creature and creed, and finishes in a final act of brutal revenge. The violence ls graphic and its a cockeyed journey.
Granted, there is some great body horror and special fx.
Nonetheless, the story is so convoluted, the characters so empty, that it is difficult to engage with.
Actor Sean Beans only discernible purpose is to play the anguished father at the end of the movie to distinguish between two different planes of existence.
The structure of this movie does make sense as a game designed to maximise player time by putting them in a maze-like framework -up and down, round and round,in and out-with a view to immersing them in a myriad of complicated scenarios with minimum pay offs.
""Silent Hill"" may be one for game fans."
"Endless_01","8","2","2","28 October 2019"," Probably the best videogame adaptation ever.
","In the cinema, there is this close curse of creating works based on videogames in the worst possible way; adaptations that end up falling into a pit of mediocrity and oblivion both by fans without knowledge about the videogame itself and by fans from Cerrino who were looking for a faithful adaptation. It's something that's been going on for years in Hollywood and it doesn't seem to stop. However, sometimes we are blessed with a gift totally different from the formula that finally works. Silent Hill is a horror movie based on the popular and unique video game, creating what is one of the best adaptations in the world of cinema.<br/><br/>Silent Hill can be a bit confusing for those who haven't played video games; it can be enigmatic, different and disturbing, but this is one of the characteristics I can respect. You can see that the director had a great passion for the creation of this film, getting to put a multitude of succulent references within the film and following a perfect archetype to successfully create the feeling that Silent Hill causes, even going so far as to use much of the original OST of the video game. It is an entertaining film that manages to satisfy in the art of the pertubacion, with excellent overwhelming scenes that can traumatize to young spectators. This is a horror movie that builds itself through the visual experience and the disturbing environment, achieving a unique and fantastic scenography like no other. The actors deliver an unexpected quality in this type of film, presenting themselves as excellent protagonists with sympathetic motivations. The film is not perfect, may have overexposed and boring scenes, may even feel slightly long at times, but even so it is a solid horror film that manages to create a unique atmosphere not found in other films of the same genre."
"rooprect","7","2","2","17 October 2019"," A review for the clueless who didn't know this is an adaptation of a videogame
","Yea I live in a cave. Not only am I over a decade late to the Silent Hill party, but I had no idea that it is an adaptation of the famous 1999 PlayStation game Silent Hill. If this describes you as well then read on because it might help you enjoy this flick more.<br/><br/>Silent Hill the movie has a distinctly cold, brooding vibe similar to the classic supernatural mindbenders like The Others, The Sixth Sense, or even going way back to The Shining. That is, it immediately puts us in a surreal state of mind, cut off from reality (in this case an abandoned ghost town) where anything can & usually does happen.<br/><br/>Where it gets crazy and possibly disorienting to newbies is when it incorporates some of the videogame elements which are never really explained. The terrifying monster Pyramid Head just sort of appears without any context, and similarly the famous Nurses From Hell scene happens almost randomly. These are excellent scenes, but still a bit disorienting if you're trying to relate everything to the narrative that's unfolding.<br/><br/>The story itself is about a woman searching for a child in the creepy ghost town of Silent Hill, and it becomes a sort of dysfunctional Alice in Wonderland type tale with random gruesome episodes and good scares, but underneath it is a consistent plot which slowly reveals itself. One unique angle worth mentioning is that this movie is almost entirely a female cast. I thought that was a really interesting diversion from the standard horror flick where men dominate the story as both heroes and villians. Here our protagonist is a strong female lead--not quite Sarah Connor Terminator 2 strong, but definitely not a squeaking damsel in distress. The antagonist is a female as well, a very creepy matriarchal character whom you totally wouldn't want to meet at Sunday brunch.<br/><br/>Just be prepared that not everything ties neatly into the story (due to the videogame elements), and that's my only real criticism. However, if I watch it a 2nd time I'll be better prepared, as I hope you are after reading this! Silent Hill is a great flick with some terrifying moments, nice creative gore (ever see someone get their entire skin ripped off? tune in) and a satisfying story with a really interesting twist. Definitely worth checking out."
"GiraffeDoor","7","2","2","16 July 2019"," Probably the best of the game adaptations.
","People are very cynical about videogame movies and admittedly there isn't much presidence for a really good one to really show them how it's done.<br/><br/>Videogame horror has that advantage of interactivity so it has less need to keep its menace unseen for so long. I'm not sure I'd call this a horror movie but a paranormal adventure but it's really none the worst for that.<br/><br/>The atmosphere with mysterious beings emerging from the perpetual mist is quite terrifying and doesn't lose power for being able to see these bodily nightmares up close.<br/><br/>I saw this at 12 and I haven't rewatched but even then I was thinking ""this is more macabre than scary"".<br/><br/>But it's fun, it's great to look at and is really actiony.<br/><br/>I hate rooting for cops and I do wish they had kept closer to the original story now I know it (I miss Harry!) but it's overall a perfectly respectable ride."

","I've never played the game, didn't even know what it was about. That's how I like films, no pre-conceptions.<br/><br/>And I was pleasantly surprised by the film. I like my horror eerie rather than gory, and this has it in spades. I felt it let itself down a bit once the claustrophobic and 'alone' feeling of just the two ladies was dispelled with the dash to the church and all the other people there. Also, once they 'befriended' the lady who was assaulting Dahlia, they didn't ask the obvious questions that I would've asked about the town<br/><br/>I did love the fact it wasn't sugar coated, and nothing was really explained- like why the ash from the air, why there are several dimensions etc."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","7","11","20","2 May 2006"," Pulls you head-first into unfathomable depths of mystery
","I knew literally nothing of Silent Hill before I walked into the cinema, as I have never played the game or read anything of it. So I was almost free from bias or prejudice. However, video games have had a terrible history when made into movies (Super Mario Brothers, Double Dragon, Tomb Raiders, Doom, Resident Evil), especially in recent years with hacks such Paul Anderson and Doctor Boll laying waste to the genre. So no matter how good I thought Silent Hill was, it still suffers with the stigma of being a video-game movie. I fear a lot of people might unfairly judge film in association with all these terrible movies even though it is millions of miles ahead of them.<br/><br/>Since the plot of the film has been recited a zillion times before I will only give a brief outline. A narcoleptic girl has visions of a ghost town named Silent Hill. Her mother drives to this town to figure out the connection but the girl goes missing. Suddenly three separate timelines begin to exist at once and things become very confusing. But not to the point of incoherence.<br/><br/>Christoph Gans takes the material very seriously and never once sells himself out or disrespects the story by making it simple. The amount of atmosphere he forges is incredible, but I only expected this from the director of Brotherhood of the Wolf. The cinematography is often perfect and world of Silent Hill is so vividly realised that you might get a shock when you walk back out into the sunny real world. It is, at once, both beautiful and horrifying. Gans' original cut is rumored to have been over 200 minutes long. If so, that is one Director's Cut DVD I would love to own.<br/><br/>Mystery and horror go hand-in-hand and in Silent Hill we get ample amounts of both. Most of it is kept in the dark and never fully explained to the audience, which keeps us on our toes and just as perplexed as the characters living in the movie. The complex storytelling is involving but never so sophisticated that it will alienate an unthinking audience. But I didn't like the 'big explanation' at the end. While it certainly doesn't explain everything, I felt that the images used in this brilliantly conceived scene were enough without the narration.<br/><br/>But like all good mystery movies, Silent Hill continues it's fantastical darkness after the credits role by ending on a very curious and intriguing note.<br/><br/>Go see and judge for yourself. You'll be surprised at how much this movie is by far the best mystery AND horror film of 2006 so far."
"takshmir","1","17","34","23 April 2006"," arrogant, pretentious flick only saved by its production design
","OK, great monsters (thx tatopoulos), nice photography (thx laustsen), and cool set decoration (thx nikolakakis) but the result is a pretentious drama, extremely boring, with no intensity, no depth (excuse me, but the mother-child theme is pretty ridiculous and the evil/faith one is so cliché...)and over all NO EMOTIONS!! all this due to a director with a lot of ambitions but no guts that forgot that the Silent Hill videogames were over all visceral games. Here, you get a nicely shot flick, sometimes beautiful indeed, but never captivating, intense or disturbing. Sorry but the games were complex, hardcore, gore and really really disturbing. here the director has a great universe but it uses it to create conventionnal scenes (the toilets, the blade attack of the pyramid head, the flashbacks with an 8mm movie. we've already seen that a hundred times!!). Worse, each time great creatures appear, they're gone 30 seconds later. Instead, you get two actresses spending their time walking in hallways with a flashlight, and a completely useless sean bean, present during looooong scenes only to make us understand his wife is in a parallel world. I didn't know we were so dumb... And the climax, my god, it's grotesque.

If you're into movies that don't make sense, watch it. If you're into movies that you understand once you've played a game and are willing to play that game before you see the movie, watch it. I never even knew ""Silent Hill"" was a video game so I had no clue where these ideas were coming from or who the villains were. The little girl's acting threw me off from everything else with her slow, emotionless speech and her screams were all but genuine.

"bonnie91","9","13","25","21 April 2006"," A horror movie fan's wet dream
","First of all I have to say that I've only played the SH1 game, so I'm not as knowledgeable about the whole SH mythos as others.<br/><br/>I tried going into the movie with the most objective attitude possible, which was very difficult since I loved SH1 and played it all the way to the end.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, Silent HIll is a dark movie with a layered plot. However, I don't see why so many people have said that they couldn't understand it. IF you were paying attention throughout the entire movie, there's nothing in it that's not understandable by the end. It's obvious why Rose is looking for her daughter, it's obvious that the daughter has a mysterious past the parents don't know about because she's adopted, it's obvious what's going on with Rose's husband Christopher and why their paths don't cross much, and the ending is self-explanatory, even if you haven't played the game. Of course, it's not Halloween or Friday the 13th, which in my opinion have very linear plots and spell everything out for you. Like I said, it's layered. You have to read between the lines and think a little bit about what's going on.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, the movie, is mostly a visual experience. It could almost be understood without any dialogue, but I don't mean that in a bad way. It's a stunning film that had my eyes glued to the screen the whole time (I almost didn't want to sip my drink so as to not block the screen.) The acting is top-notch. Pyramid Head (one of the SH gamers' favorite creatures) only appears twice, but both appearances are worth their weight in gold (or should I say, blood). It almost fully recreates the atmosphere of the game (and I say almost because there's really no replacing that first-person, interactive experience you get in a video game); however some gore and violence could keep people who are not hardcore horror movie lovers or averse to blood and disturbing images from liking it.<br/><br/>Only one possible drawback, and I hope I'm wrong on this, but the lack of a major male character in the movie could hurt it at the box office. Sean Bean's role can hardly be called a leading one, as he appears more sporadically and for less time than many of the women in supporting roles.<br/><br/>That aside, Jodelle owns the role of Sharon Da Silva. I also like Alice Krige as Christabella. She portrays the role of insane religious fanatic very well and the ending of her character is as good as it gets in an R-rated horror movie.<br/><br/>Atmosphere, good acting, good direction, intelligent plot with a message, gore and violence, emotional situations and frightening revelations, this movie is the complete package for the discerning horror movie fan.<br/><br/>All in all a very satisfying movie. I'd give it a 10 in the genre, and an 8 overall, so I'm splitting the difference to a 9.<br/><br/>P.S. Support the ""WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES"" campaign! Go see it!"
"apandreas31","10","13","25","21 April 2006"," Haters be damned, this movie is great.
","In the past few days, a series of negative Silent Hill reviews have surfaced on the net. ""It's a video game movie, therefor sucks"" ""I didn't understand it"". Statements of this nature. I come here today to add my own statement ""This is the best movie of 2006"" Before you assume that I'm just some stupid Silent Hill fan (though the true ones rarely are stupid), who just 10ed the movie to up it's average, I'm a film student and have studied film for many years now. Of course opinions are going to differ on what makes a good movie, but for me, Silent Hill had it all. To me a movie needs good acting, good story, and good art design, all of which Silent Hill produced.<br/><br/>I'm probably somewhat biased however, because in every sense of the word, I am a Silent Hill nut. Many of the choices I have made in producing my own films have been based off of the video games.<br/><br/>Silent Hill really is a different kind of movie, and I think many people go in expecting one thing and seeing another. I get the feeling that many people are walking in, expecting a gore-fest horror movie, when really you are getting a story of motherhood, made up in that uncomfortable (but excellent) feeling a movie like Jacob's Ladder gave you. Also, this really is a movie that makes you think. There are many subtle touches to the film that many people won't pick up on their first viewing (SPOILER: like how the rapist janitor was also played by the person playing Red Pyramid, adding to the sexual aggression of his role).<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a beautiful work of art on so many levels. First off, just on it's own, it is amazing. I haven't seen a movie set it's mood so well in years. The art direction alone makes this a milestone in my own personal movie history. Secondly, this is an event to celebrate, as the first ""video game"" movie to have true artistic integrity.<br/><br/>Not everyone will like Silent Hill, but I have the feeling many people will."

You feel no connection with them, and don't actually care what happens to them. You'll see them doing all kinds of things that defy common human logic. The best acting is by Sean Bean, despite this being the worst role I've seen him in. And some idiot decided it would be a good idea for him to use an (American?) accent. Why, oh why? He just sounds odd. There are a few creepy monster designs but I found the CGI often interrupted the experience and dispelled any belief. I wanted to turn this movie off, but I persevered and sat through it. If you REALLY love the video games (as I'm guessing many of the other reviewers here do), you might find something to like. Otherwise, I strongly recommend avoiding this one."

","I don't know about what are thinking creators of game adaptations. Let's just say that the best game adaptation in my opinion is Resident Evil and this film, is only a passable, brainless entertainment. It seems that creators of films based on video games have still no clue that a movie is completely different type of medium than video game. As a result, they produce either films so closely related to video games that unbearable or insipid movies which have almost nothing in common with the game (Doom), which probably stems from ignorance of adapted game. Silent Hill belongs to the first category. I have no idea what screenwriter has provided for the film as it has practically no plot. Director Christopher Gans uses only some plot points which are so illogical even for the horror flick about supernatural phenomena. At first, why does Rose DaSilva bring her child to Silent Hill? Why does policeman chase her? ... The film doesn't give any answers and, in addition, ""the story"" is so poorly developed that even actors, who plays usually well, do badly here. In consequence, the film becomes a dull and unbearable experience. The facts that Silent Hill town is very atmospheric as well as both set design and special effects are good unfortunately don't save this pointless pic. What also makes bad impression is quite confusing ending which buries the film even more. All in all, you had better play once again the same game instead of watching this trashy movie.

If anyone from the film industry is reading this, simply having horrible sound effects is not scary, its just annoying. The plot didn't make any real sense (shes dead, i get it. but how exactly? car crash? yet the car is undamaged? airbag didn't even go off? and i didn't know ghosts could even drive cars) This is just one example of the poor and badly constructed plot. Its not scary its just unpleasant, the barbed wire at the end is a final weak attempt to scare us, it didn't work. (How is this related again exactly?)

However, they always disappoint.<br/><br/>This film has a higher rating that Resident Evil which I find shocking.

","This got to be the most realistic adaptation of a video game to movie today, and yet it works as a stand-alone movie. The problem with movies that are based on game and book is that if you have played the game or read the book already you will feel as if you were watching a re-run. For those that have not played the game, it will be a lot of information one needs to sort through to understand it. For most part, this movie copies the looks and feels of the game spot-on. The first half of the movie WILL send goose-bumps up and down your back as the town of Silent Hill and the atmospheres that surrounds it seems to rip it right off the game itself. I will tip my hat to the production designer for this film as he or she did an outstanding job. Nothing beats the creepiness of a lone woman walking down an empty street in an abandon town with a bad dose of ju-ju.<br/><br/>The monsters in this film are few when comparing to other movies that are based on video game, and their appearances are brief. Also, due to the nature of Silent Hill's game play, the protagonist doesn't engages the monsters but rather, avoiding them. The computer special effects are what drives this movie, and they will shock-and-awe you.<br/><br/>The pace of this film is also slower than most of movies of video game, but this is needed to provide the necessary creepy atmosphere that's the mainstay of the game, but 2/3 into the movie the pace of the storyline becomes bogged down with dialogs trying to explain everything. Which makes this film that is not heavy on the actions seems even slower to those who was bred on MTV.<br/><br/>All in all, I like this movie for its truthfulness to the game it is portraying and the craftsmanship of the production value, and at two hours long it doesn't seems to be long enough."

","I think ""wow"" pretty much sums up my opinion of Silent Hill. I never played the video games, but you shouldn't have to to enjoy a movie. There was absolutely no logic whatsoever in the movie, here's an example: This little girl doesn't have a father.....therefore we should burn her alive.....<br/><br/>What?<br/><br/>Did that just really happen? Are they really going to do it? Yup, they did it. And quite honestly, seeing people burned at the stake is not something on my to-do list, but thank you Silent Hill for that experience, I am sure to treasure it. This must have been the conversation between the writers: ""hmm, I don't think the viewers got enough burnings in 'The Hills Have Eyes', so let's burn someone else!"" ""Yeah, we should do that. Oh wait, but we should beat her to a bloody pulp with iron rods first"" ""Yeah, that'd great"". I really hope my blatant sarcasm hits home here, because I cannot emphasize the length this movie goes to ""scare"" people.<br/><br/>I really hate to say that this movie has a redeeming quality, but the......oh wait never mind, there is absolutely nothing in this movie worth mentioning.<br/><br/>I think the previews for this movie qualify for false advertising, trying to convince us naive viewers that the movie has a point. I have read many of the reviews posted on this site that say people were on the edge of their seats in the theatres, screaming, hiding their faces. Personally, I didn't watch the movie with Kindergartners so I don't know what that was like. I do know that I did not hear a single person scream, only laughs at the ridiculous ""plot"" and ""acting"". I did hear people get up and leave though, and I am regretting I did not do the same.<br/><br/>Please, I beg you, do not see this movie. Your mind, wallet, stomach, eyes, back, car, grandma, etc...will thank you for it."
"vlxxy","10","12","23","21 April 2006"," A Review reflecting movie to game comparison of Silent Hill.
","As a fan of the video game and others, I was kind of skeptical that this movie would be good. I was wrong! The crew did a very well job of re-making the game series into a movie. The main characters, mom and daughter, were played very well. The monsters, were even more scary and realistic in the movie than the game! Pyramid head, had a good role just as the nurses looked and acted very horrifying. The backdrop of the movie scenes, were very well done, looked very much like in the game. The movie even had a bit of a comedy element to it, as the audience members laughed at a few of the character comments. Other audience members reflected being scared, as the game series does to people as well, it can be very scary! I think the best viewer of the movie would be fans of the game or at least someone who has played it, it would help them to understand the movie better. People who are new into the whole Silent Hill ""cult"", may enjoy the movie as well. The graphics were outstanding, minus the few times they were comparable to the cliché'd ""The Ring"" movements, even if they are the latest form of horror effects. What was even better, that the monsters were not full CGI, as in the games of course. Another fun part of the movie, being a horror movie, it had a lot of Horror as some movies show very little. This one had mental horror as well. This year 2006, has a lot of horror movies coming out, Silent Hill is a must see if you are indeed looking for a Horror movie. I must say I have no complaints. This movie might even be the best horror movie out in years. Hopfully it will make a path for the future of horror movies. However, some may say it's not a horror movie or more than, more psychological, it may still change the path of such a genre."

","I remember saying upon first hearing about the movie release that if the director ruined this opportunity i'd ice him myself, anyone got his address?:P The fact is it ain't that bad a film, well, it is, but it could have been worse. The acting was OK for the most part and the horror element is, em, well it could have been worse:P. everything else, however, is way off.<br/><br/>I fell in love with silent hill way back when Lara's tits were 2 sample polygons and the scariest part of resident evil was the acting in the opening credits. Every detail of it was perfect from the schizophrenic camera angles to the 2 mile hikes into a dead end. But thats in game play terms, the real inspiration was the plot line and subtext.<br/><br/>This ain't fact as there are so goddamn many ways to interpret Silent Hill. But originally, the plot line was based around the garden of eden tainted by man. Paradise turned to the depths of depravity and indescribable horror. Awaiting the second coming of Christ incarnate, ready to start the apocalypse, which Harry(aka. Rose)would see briefly due to what was essentially the labour pains of allysia(aka. the mother of God) It was beautiful, a Christian contradiction. Essentially the first good representation of God if ever had the pleasure to witness, and I'm a bloody atheist. So much for a 20 story Caucasian hippie in a robe. I cant begin to descibe it, it was heresy and divinity intertwined as one twisted and degenerated mass of flesh and metal.<br/><br/>Now see what gans decided to do was put a literal aspect on this replacing the infinite power of God(or Lucifer, depending on what ending ye got:P)with some lame ass pretence of individual power developed from intense emotion(aka. white light witchcraft bulls**t)So what ye end up with is some exhausted revenge story along with a fairly tame portrayal of unique horror presented in the original Silent Hill games.<br/><br/>Alone this film doesn't deserve a 1, if they named it the ring part 3 I would've given it a 6 at least. But I'm so sick of poncy ass directors turning something of such magnificence and inspiration, into a 4.99 bargain bucket disk at your local HMV. I can say without contradiction that Silent Hill easily could of sat with Aliens and Silence of the Lambs, instead, its doomed to be forgotten. And if you were part of the cult following before it became a movie, you'd know just how much of a tragedy that was.<br/><br/>P.S A horror movie with a happy ending ain't a horror movie"

For example, I really enjoyed ""Resident Evil"", and I love zombie flicks.<br/><br/>However, this movie was painfully boring to watch! I couldn't figure out why, the effects and setting were right on and cool, but I just wasn't feeling anything in the way of creepiness. The movie just dragged along, the plot and all the ""explanations"" were insipid, and I just didn't feel as scared watching this movie as I did playing the video game, nor did I feel even mildly entertained. Towards the end, I was just laughing at how stupid the movie was, and afterward had to go grab a beer to drown this bland mess out of my head. I doubt my date will allow me to pick movies to watch for a while after this."

","I think Silent Hill the movie was even more disappointing than the Resident Evil movies, which seemed impossible before I viewed this piece of garbage. All they had to do was make a movie with the storyline of the first or second Silent Hill game, not combine elements from the two so it made no sense whatsoever. Either game would have made a great movie by itself, but instead, they felt obligated to carry on the tradition of making the worst possible adaptation when making a movie based on a book or video game. I don't understand how they always come up with the worst script possible for adaptations such as. I wish I could puke on them."

","I just saw this movie, and as a scary/horror/suspense movie lover, I was horribly disappointed. I have never played the video game, but I feel incredibly disappointed and cheated because this movie could not stand on its own. I walked into with high expectations, and walked out wondering what the hell had happened. Key elements were never explained, several characters served no purpose other than to confuse the story line, and at times there was bizarre sexual tension between Rose and Cybil which I just wanted to laugh at. Some of the gore was fun to watch, but I never even felt grossed out because it was so obviously fake. I wanted to like this movie, but it went on for about thirty minutes too long and for the rest of the day I was trying to figure out how the hell the writers, director, and actors decided it was a good idea to attach themselves to this movie.

","Rose and her husband Christopher Da Silva, are worried with their little girl, Sharon, who sleepwalks and has seizures with frequency. Since the medical diagnosis of their daughter is not good, Rose decides to take Sharon to Silent Hill (against her husband's agreement), the name of a city that her daughter keeps repeating all the time. When they are near the city,Rose creates a high speed chase between herself and a suspicious and strange police officer. While running with her car, Rose avoids a young girl to be crashed. She is then knocked unconscious. When Rose wakes up, she sees herself alone in a strange and foggy city, where no one seems to live and her beloved daughter is missed. As Rose begins to search for Sharon, many bizarre things and situations starts to happen; they will make Rose discover the true and disturbing secret behind Silent Hill's apparently calm.<br/><br/>Silent Hill'' is one of my favorite game series, and I think that even Resident Evil, one of the most well known horror games in the world, sucks near it. The movie is not exactly faithful to the games stories and logic, being based mainly in the first Silent Hill (where Cheryl gets lost in the city), but with elements from the other Silent Hills ( like the Pyramid Head) . They created new characters (with exception of Cybill and maybe Lisa) for instance, Rose Da Silva is the female version of Harry Mason, the main video game protagonist, and Cheryl's father of the first Silent Hill. And they also changed some relationships of the game, like Dahlia and Alessa Gillespie, and 'the order'' ( a demon cult), that is different in the movie and the game.<br/><br/>Even with so many changes, I liked the movie very much (more then I imagined), as it contained many of the horror and creepy traces of the game. Many times, I felt disturbed as I felt while playing the game, what is a good sign. For people who doesn't know the story of Silent Hill, the movie will be confusing, since it's hard to understand what is going on in some scenes even knowing the game (specially the end) but even so, I recommend to read the FAQ, where many of the explanations are given. And if you a horror game fan as well, and never played Silent Hill, I totally recommend you to play it. :)<br/><br/>Ps: ''The Janitor'' transformed to a monster, really scared me!"

'Pyramid Head' appears, scares the two female leads for a while, kills a random cult person, and vanishes forever from the rest of the movie, never to be mentioned again, or explained.

Do they know they're trapped in some weird, smoke filled dimension?

"glasswalker-2","8","5","8","17 May 2006"," Christophe Gans Strikes Again!
","If you enjoy cinematography in movies, or at least can appreciate what M. Night does with his flicks, then definitely go see Silent Hill. It is full of eye candy; eye candy of a darker, rustier manner, but eye candy, nonetheless.<br/><br/>I've talked to a few people about the movie, and it would appear that if you have no experience with the games, you will enjoy the movie a little more. Makes sense. Most movies based on books are enjoyed less by those that have read the novels simply because they know what to expect.<br/><br/>Of course, there is another group of people that will not enjoy the film; those that tend to over analyze movies. This is really not a movie for those people. If you have a problem with Mulder's extraordinary leaps of logic in The X-Files, then you will probably have an aneurysm when watching this. It's one thing to try to escape a cop when you're pulled over, if there's traffic, or an off-ramp, or something to blend in to. If you're in the middle of West Virginia, on a deserted road, you may want to rethink your options.<br/><br/>Leaving the logic behind, one is left with a tragic tale of a mother who loses her child. In her best efforts to be a loving, caring mother; she sets off on a journey that she thinks will help her child confront her inner daemons. On this path of good intentions, Rose (the mother) hits a bump in the road, and in the process loses Sharon (the daughter). So she must enter the town of Silent Hill to find her.<br/><br/>While there are not many truly scary moments to the movie (one or two 'jumps' just because of a loud sound), there is definitely a fair amount of creepiness to it. The gore factor isn't really that major in the film, but in the few times that gore is present, there is a lot of it.<br/><br/>I can't say much about the acting, let's face it, I love the Star Wars movies, so acting is not a big issue with me. Everyone does a passable job. The side plots though are not fully formed, and again require a large leap in logic.<br/><br/>The majority of the music comes from selections from all four of the Silent Hill games. Those soundtracks are all incredible in their richness. While it's no John Williams, or Howard Shore, Akira Yamamoto (both creator of the games, composer of all music in the games, as well as executive producer for the movie) provides all the tension and eeriness one could hope for.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good, enjoyable movie. I loved the way the film looked, and that was one reason for me to see it on the big screen. Christophe Gans has a very rich visual style (check out The Brotherhood of the Wolf if you're in doubt), that is, as mentioned before, very nice eye candy. Seeing some of the scenes from the first game enacted on the silver screen was a treat. And to be sure, Pyramid Head is one of the most disturbing creatures I've seen in a movie in a long while (imagine being chased by two of them, and then trying to fight them off!!).<br/><br/>In a nutshell, if you can see this movie in the theater, do so. It's worth it.<br/><br/>._._."

But after watching this movie, i left the theater in Aww...The atmosphere, camera angles, music all depict the game right down to the teeth.

Borrowing heavily from aspects of the SH 1& 3 games, and some aspects of the 2nd game you descend into a confusing, horrific and violent world. The scares are not the usual cheap "" BOO"" scares you often get in horror films, but a slow insinuation of terror that grows and grows to a stunning end scene that left the entire audience in the theatre I was in quite speechless. (A further point on this element, as the film started a group of giggling teenage girls came in and sat at the back of the cinema, and a group of boisterous younger guys sat about midway. Fully expecting interruptions throughout the film, I was surprised at the end to have noted each of these parties of people had gone VERY quite and remained so the entire film. I put this down to the fact that this film had serious ""weight"" behind it & that the all pervading atmosphere it gave controlled the cinema audience extremely well). <br/><br/>The imagery on screen was often disturbing, and coupled with the excellent music and terrific sound effects, this film added upto to a high scoring 8. <br/><br/>If you like the games, you will see nods to each of them within the film. <br/><br/>If you have never seen the games, then you are about to be inducted into a world ( SH ) that will provoke you in 2 ways. Either the story confused you and therefore you wrote the film off, or, you ""got into"" the story, understood the concept and will be talking about this film with your friends for days afterwards.<br/><br/>A special award should go to this film for its stunning special effects, both visual and audio...truly amazing.<br/><br/>The Director of this film seemed to have a total grasp of what makes Silent Hill so disturbing, and he should be applauded for making such an incredible adaption of the wonderful series of games. Go see this film with an open mind, and be disturbed. I shall personally be watching for more of this Directors work.<br/><br/>The only issues I have with the film was the questionable way some of the script was written in the opening scenes, the poor acting ability of the young girl in the film and of one female actors who appears when our heroine(s) first reach the hotel. A couple of very minor points in an otherwise stunning achievement. Other than those issues, this film was an out and out winner.

In the night, when the alarm rings you should be prepared, the dead come to life and there are always some strange creatures really close.

","""Silent Hill"" is an excellent example of a computer game that has been adapted with great attention to detail by an obvious fan. The tone, the plot and even the musical score remain faithful to the game, which results in a visual world that instantly feels familiar. However, the same could be said for Uwe Boll's glorious computer game adaptations. The difference between ""Silent Hill"" and ""House Of The Dead"", for example, is this film's ability to stand alone without prior knowledge of the game.<br/><br/>Christophe Gans begins his film with an ominous sequence that shows Rose frantically chase her sleepwalking daughter, Sharon, to the side of a cliff. Sharon wakes up and says ""Silent Hill"", the name of an abandoned town. Such is the simplicity of the film's premise - a mother decides to take her daughter to a town that she has mentioned in her sleep. This seemingly innocuous set-up belies the twists and turns that occur when Rose and Sharon finally arrive in Silent Hill. In fact, the film begins much like an Asian horror movie, deriving suspense from random creepy events and an ominous tone. ""Silent Hill"" works very well on this level, due to the stylish cinematography and creative art design.<br/><br/>The first half of the film moves slowly enough for the audience to learn more about the characters and appreciate the depth of Rose's maternal instinct for Sharon. Australian actress, Radha Mitchell delivers her best performance since moving to Hollywood as Rose. There is something wonderfully ordinary about Radha, which in turn makes Rose sympathetic and credible, despite the incredible scenarios in which she finds herself. This part of the film also introduces Officer Cybil, played with flair by Laurie Holden. Cybil is initially suspicious of Rose but turns out to be her only ally in the world's least friendly town. The supporting cast is bursting with gifted character actors like Sean Bean, Alice Krige and Deborah Kara Unger but their roles are too small to make a significant impact on the film.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" transforms from an eerie thriller into a fast-paced, supernatural horror movie when Rose loses Sharon to the Silent Hill locals. The second half of the film plays like a demented cross between ""Aliens"" and ""The Village"", only with more violence and gore. The segments, when the alarm sounds and the world literally turns to hell, contain some excellent special effects and editing. There are a couple of examples of poorly realised computer graphics but as a whole the visuals are stunning. The scene where Rose crawls past light sensitive drones in the basement is brilliant. The gore is surprisingly plentiful with victims being ripped apart and a mattress enacting a particularly painful revenge on one of the faithful.<br/><br/>There is much for gore hounds and gamers to enjoy in ""Silent Hill"". The majority of the film holds up very well for casual viewers; however the ending is destined to leave some people scratching their heads in confusion. Christophe Gans has displayed enough originality and flair to announce himself as a talent to watch. Bring on the sequel!"

","First off, I'd like to thank director Christophe Gans for officially ruining Silent Hill, and the chance of there ever being a sequel. I grew up addicted to the video games and their in-depth story lines, lovable characters and frightening atmospheres. This movie presented none of the above. The script was the biggest piece of garbage I have ever heard. The consistency of ""Mommy, mommy, Silent Hill,"" and ""Don't worry sweety, everything's going to be OK,"" was enough to make a billy goat puke! The storyline is completely rearranged from the game, and made into this ridiculously hard plot to follow. There was no character development, and by far the worst character is the police officer, Cybil Bennett, played by Laurie Holden. Hey Laurie, it's called acting and it would have been nice if you attempted it. With the exception of ""Pyramid Head,"" and the nurses, all the other monsters looked ridiculous. Think of the kids from The Children of the Corn, slap on some fake blood, strip the name of Malachai and bam! - You've got the gayest creatures ever to be produced. For Christ Sakes, people were laughing in the theater! What makes the Silent Hill game so scary and interesting is the fact that you don't always see what you're fighting, or what's about to attack you. In the movie, there was no element of surprise. Nothing popped out, nothing was shown briefly, and nothing stayed on screen for an extended period of time. Instead, the audience finds itself subjected to the silent hill ""survivors,"" huddled in a church, talking about heresy. Overall, the film was a very inaccurate representation of the game. My advice... stop ruining the possibility of making a video into a good movie until my generation becomes the future directors. It just seems like every director plays the games for 10 minutes and believes he or she now knows what's to come. Once again Christophe Gans, thank you."

"catahoulagirl","1","9","18","23 April 2006"," Convoluted and Disappointing
","I don't know how anyone can write a spoiler for this film since it didn't make any sense. But I thought I would check the box anyway in case I inadvertently gave something away.<br/><br/>Although I have not played the video game, I was somewhat familiar with the concept from watching my son play. My son I guess was expecting the movie to be similar to Resident Evil or Doom. I was hoping it would have at least a good scare or two. Both of us walked out of the theater going WTF?!?! While there were tons of disturbing images, none of them were inherently frightening, just weird. In fact the legion of zombie-nurse-creature-things, with their micro mini's and push up bras looked like they were leftover from Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video. I was literally expecting them to start dancing at one point.<br/><br/>The plot vanished about ten minutes into the film...as soon as they walked into Silent Hill. The abandoned town was creepy enough, but nothing happened there, which was disappointing. It appeared that all the action took place in a dream state? I just don't know though... I had to keep asking my son what was going on and he had no clue either. He kept complaining about all the creatures from the game that were missing from the movie. Maybe it was edited poorly, and they left out all the key elements? It did seem that quite a bit of dialogue was placed in an attempt to explain what was happening, but it missed the mark.<br/><br/>The imagery and concept reminds me slightly of an older sci-fi horror flick ""Event Horizon"", which I didn't like either. So I guess if you enjoyed that, this one will be right up your alley. Me, as soon as I got home, I got on the net trying to find a synopsis or plot outline so that I could at least say to myself ""Oh, is that what they meant?!"" Poor Radha Mitchell, ""Pitch Black"" was just awesome, what was she thinking on this one...."
"strangedays","1","9","18","22 April 2006"," Great casting & look but gets everything else wrong
","The story in the games is far better than this story. The film flat-out isn't scary. It's not creepy. It just walks you from locale to locale and trots out monsters from the games, but doesn't at all deliver on the feel. And the entire ending is just terrible. Where was all the subtlety and downright horror of the games? It's been replaced with just gore and unnecessary CGI, such as the unnecessary bugs. Plus, apart from Cybil shooting one monster, no one fights back in the entire movie. Especially disappointing was Brookhaven Hospital, which could and should have been terrifying but turned out to be just another place. If they do make a sequel, let's hope someone else writes and directs it."
"Cpa33138","10","9","18","21 April 2006"," The Highly anticipated movie is finally here...
","To start off, I've been a long-time fan of the video game series. I've played the games so much that I could literally memorize, recite, and interpret the story lines for each. As you can tell I'm pretty obsessed. What made me a big fan of the games was not so much the action, but the story... and the mystery behind the creatures that attack the protagonist in each story. Then when the movie was first announced a couple of years back, and I was really excited about it. Three years have passed since that day, and today I had the chance to see it on it's first showing in theatres... Well, I saw it and I've emerged from the theatres with mixed emotions. The movie was different from what was expected when watching the previews. To be honest I was a bit disappointed with some aspects of the movie, but surprisingly enough... I was happy with what I saw. The movie somewhat mimicked the cutscenes of the videogames when it came to presentation, because all the music in the movie was taken directly from the soundtracks of the games. And I thought the special effects were awesome. This movie wasn't like any other video game-based movie that I have ever seen, in that, the movie did not focus solely on action and the killing of strange looking monsters, and the storyline was pretty accurate to that of the first game (with a few exceptions to the plot, of course). In the movie, some things were changed in terms of the plot, for example, the way Dahlia is portrayed in the movie is quite different from how she's viewed in the game, and the connection between Sharon/Alessa (movie) is different from the connection between Cheryl/Alessa (in the video game). The plot to the movie answered a handful of questions that fans of the game may have had regarding the creatures that dwell in the town and how things came to be. There were certain instances in the movie that got me worried, but around the end I found peace with those worried areas in the plot... and the ending gives off a hint of a possible sequel... Personally I found the movie to be most entertaining and I cannot wait for the DVD release, and if there is indeed a sequel I can guarantee that I will be the first one in line to see it, as I was today. But keep in mind that I am a die-hard fan, and my opinion of this movie may vary from those that don't know much of the series and walked in expecting to see an action-packed monster movie, or some imitation of any of the Resident Evil movies. If you are one of those people that fit into that category and expect the movie to be like Resident Evil, then you will be very disappointed. But if you are a fan of the games, or at least as big of a fan as I am, then you will be pleased with the movie and at the very least think that it's pretty good. The only problem that I found with the movie is that I thought it deserved more action sequences involving the monsters, but we can't always get what we want (don't get me wrong, the movie had action sequences that were pretty sweet, and besides if there's a sequel I'm sure they'll decide to make more use of the monsters). And when looking back at the movie I'm always reminded that it COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE ... and as a closing statement... THANK GOD UWE BOLL DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO DIRECT IT..."

","With a wealth of technology at their disposal, with the backing of major studios, with a sea of class 'A' horror/fantasy material written, ready and waiting to be developed for the screen, it challenges belief that filmmakers seem singularly unable to make decent horror/fantasy movies anymore. What really bugs me (just as a brief example) is that no one has yet produced a satisfactory movie of Richard Mathesons' seminal ""I Am Legend"" or even attempted William Hope Hodgesons' ""The House on the Borderland"" or Clive Barker's ""Weaveworld"" or Ramsey Campbell's ""Ancient Images"" (well, in Campbell's case, anything he's ever written). Written works of tremendous quality and potential exist out there, just begging to be developed.<br/><br/>The earlier, stark and visceral approaches of directors such as John Carpenter, George A. Romero, Tobe Hooper, Wes Craven and others seems to have been diluted these days (even by themselves). They either produce nothing at all, or crank out sanitised re-imagined versions of past glories.Compare ""Land of the Dead"" with ""Day of the Dead,"" or ""Ghosts of Mars"" with ""The Thing"" or ""Red Eye"" with ""The Hills Have Eyes."" What's going on? As Hitchcock aged he matured as a director, as a creator and purveyor of suspense on a visual-emotional level. Granted, his last movie ""Family Plot"" was tripe, but the penultimate ""Frenzy"" was a classic serial killer thriller with some wonderfully manipulative set pieces. He lost none of his creative powers right up until the near end of his life. So, what is going on? <br/><br/>Film makers (due to market forces, or youth culture, or whatever) appear bent on feeding us bloodless, disinfected remakes (""The Fog,"" ""When a Stranger Calls"") or glossy throwaway fodder based on video games. Seemingly, as the video game has evolved into a media ""art form"" of its own with a significant and growing penetration into the youth market, it has become, along with the comic book or graphic novel, the preferred source material over the written word. And so we are served up flashy, nonsensical garbage that eschews narrative drive and the creative development of suspense and shocks in favour of tenuously related CGI set-pieces strung together by inane dialogue telegraphed through wooden cipher-performances from actors who really should know better. Still, a buck's a buck. <br/><br/>The preceding paragraph sums up for me the movie version of ""Silent Hill."" To truly enjoy this film you'll need to be about ten years old, play video games in a darkened room, have never read a book in your life (apart from the one about Spot the dog), never seen a truly great horror/fantasy movie (or if you did, dismiss it because of a lack of CGI), get easily confused by an episode of ""The Simpsons"" to the point where following a plot line for anything becomes superfluous to your enjoyment and you must have no idea of what good film making is about. <br/><br/>This movie is just soso cynical. Sean Bean, for instance, autopilots through his role in such an uninvolved and uncaring fashion that you know he's just doing it for the money. The same as everyone else involved. The writers have made no attempt to structure the plot in any meaningful way  it's disjointed, fragmented and has no focus whatsoever. I agree that a film needs a beginning and a middle and an end, and not necessarily in that order, but there should be some attempt to instill a degree of depth and quality, some emotion into the process that engages with the audience. Nope, 'fraid not. It's loud, sterile, about as scare inducing as a buttercup with as much life in it as a quick-dissolving aspirin. You don't care about the characters  unless you have a particular emotional attachment for cardboard cut-outs  and ultimately watching is a tedious process that is much like chewing celery sandwiched between balsa wood, only using your eyes and ears instead of your mouth and tongue.<br/><br/>Hitchcock's ""The Birds,"" Carpenter's ""The Thing,"" Romero's original ""Dead"" trilogy, Hooper's ""Chainsaw,"" Dario Argento's ""Suspiria,"" - ""Carrie,"" ""Pet Semetary,"" ""Halloween,"" ""Psycho,""  anything that uses the language of cinema to communicate something of relevance and meaning and entertain by so doing. Watch anything but ""Silent Hill."" Dear God, where will it end?"

It's an entirely different thing when the movie doesn't make an ounce of sense in addition to being too long, boring, idiotic, and not frightening. Unfortunately, SILENT HILL is all those things.<br/><br/>What looked like it could potentially be 2006's scariest movie based on previews becomes a muddled piece of garbage on the big screen. Essentially the movie is one long preview to a movie that looks intriguing, but leaves too many questions unanswered. A preview is a brief jumbling of different images without answering the audience's every question in order to bring them into the seats (keyword: brief). SILENT HILL is basically a preview, leaving questions unanswered and jumbling together random images that mixed together are simply confusing... only this preview drags on and on and on past 2 hours.<br/><br/>Based on a popular video game, SILENT HILL features some of the most stylized direction I've seen in a long time. Sadly, this stylization is not held together by a director with not a single ounce of apparent talent for coherent storytelling. Somewhere in all this footage there might have been a good performance from Radha Mitchell... but not as they're packaged here.<br/><br/>The most frustrating part of all this, is that there is the potential for an interesting movie here.

","After more than a decade of awful video game adaptations, Christophe Gans has proved that video games can be made into good films while staying faithful to the original work.<br/><br/>The movie is full of music and sounds from the games. You will hear tunes from most of the series, including a nice surprise at the end.<br/><br/>Visually, some of the special effects looked cartoonish, but on the other hand the monsters looked excellent. I specially liked how they pulled some scenes directly from the games, down to the camera angles.<br/><br/>The actors gave excellent performances, except for the daughter, who was kinda cheesy during the first parts of the movie (I liked her creepy look, though). I specially liked Cybil, who didn't miss a mark as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>I do have a few complaints though. The first would be the lack of monsters. The second monster to appear only had a few minutes of screen time, and it would've been awesome to see a few more of them. Piramid Head pulled some of the best violent bits, and it was a shame he couldn't pull at least one more appearance. My other complaint would be the ending. While it was good, and it fitted the tone of the movie, it killed any chances for a direct sequel (those who have played the games will understand).<br/><br/>Silent Hill is the best video game-to-movie adaptation there's ever been, and an excellent movie on it's own right. Being a fan will really increase the enjoyment, though. I only hope that this film motivates other directors to create video game adaptations that complement, not harm, the original work. 9.5/10"

I hate CG effects and funny monsters that have ruined many movies that could have been much better had the monsters been designed as good as in Silent Hill. Sound effects are great too, and there's no sudden ""boo"" to startle you as in cheap horror movies. Script is well thought and everything makes sense in the end.

"abecke11","10","8","16","21 April 2006"," At last; a video game film adaptation that delivers the goods!
","As a fan of the entire Silent Hill series of games, my first reaction to hearing that a film was in progress was ""Oh, no!""<br/><br/>Hollywood has a history of making terrible messes of games that could be promising movie ideas. At best, they are usually popcorn fluff, mindless action (see the Resident Evil or Tomb Raider films for perfect examples of this - they are good at being what they are, but they could have been so much more), and at their worst, they do not resemble the games at all (see The Mario Bros. movie - a film so bad it's kind of good in its own way, but to be sure, is nothing like the games, costumes and names aside).<br/><br/>However, the more I learned about this particular adaptation, the more hope I gained. The trailers looked surprisingly good, and when I learned that Radha Mitchell (of Pitch Black) and Sean Bean (of The Fellowship of the Rings) were in it, I was quite excited. By opening night (tonight), I could hardly contain myself; I NEEDED this to be a good film.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>**Minor possible spoilers ahead - particularly for those who have played the game**<br/><br/>It mixes some elements from all of the games - the basic plot premise is that of the first game - missing child (with a female lead instead of a male), and even keeps most of the characters from the first film; Cybill, Dahlia, Alessa - Cheryl becomes ""Sharon"".<br/><br/>Although it takes some liberties with the story lines of the games, it could be considered canon to gamers. If this is so, several ""explanations"" of certain things are given. These may contradict or agree with different endings of the games, but the film is certainly just ambivalent enough to be open for a sequel, with Sean Bean having a much larger role than what he had in this one. That is really all I care to say, for fear of ruining anything.<br/><br/>Pyramid Head, of course, does not appear in the first game, but he is in the film, and I add; ""thankfully"", because just hearing the Great Knife scraping down a hallway sent shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>All in all, the film seemed to still fit the idea that Silent Hill 2 offers up; Silent Hill's reality is created by those who dwell within it. Also, I interpret the ending to this film as akin to the ""bad ending"" in the first game. Watch it and see if you agree with me. Then again, there are plot points that would contradict that...<br/><br/>*end possible spoilers*<br/><br/>I'll have to watch it again.<br/><br/>And that's how I felt - I wanted to go back, pay the $7.50 again and sit down and have another watch. I will most certainly be adding this to my DVD collection when it comes out.<br/><br/>Is it The Godfather? Is it Brazil? No, of course not. Why the 10 stars, then? Because I believe a film can only be judged based on what it is. You can't compare a horror flick to a crime drama or dystopian nightmare; apples and oranges. As a horror film, it stands up with the best of them: Jacob's Ladder, Event Horizon, The Shining (all films which obviously influenced the creators of the game series), etc.<br/><br/>I had a small problem with some of the CG, but all in all, it was quite well done. In particular, the nurses and Pyramid Head were extraordinary. Well done."
"the_whyte_spyder","10","8","16","21 April 2006"," Silent Hill: A Retrospect
","While generally bashed by reviewers and by disappoint teenagers with nothing better to do on a Friday night, Silent Hill is an excellent adaptation as well as horror film.<br/><br/>Many people complain about two things: 1) 'I don't get it!' 2) 'It wasn't scary!'<br/><br/>Well I'm going to address both: 1) You probably don't get it because you never actually sat down and played the games. When viewing a film with such a complex back story as Silent Hill, one really needs to review the source material before viewing the adaptation. There is only so much info they can squeeze into 2 hours and 5 minutes. Another reason you probably didn't get it is because not everything is spelled out in black and white from the get go. But honestly, in all of the games (1 and 2 especially, which the film draws heavily from), nothing is really spelled out. Even after you beat the games, it leaves you wondering ""What the f--k was that?"". But that's not necessarily a bad thing, because it lets your mind and imagination fill in the blanks, and that can be a lot better than some lousy tie in.<br/><br/>2)If you had played the games, you'd realize that Silent Hill was never meant to be scary. Silent Hill above all else placed a lot of emphasis on setting and mood, rather than the zombie-jumping-from-the-closet shock moments. It was meant to creep you out and let your imagination do the scaring, which this movies has in spades.<br/><br/>Great cinematography, music, story, and characters; Silent Hill is the thinking man's Resident Evil. If you aren't smart enough to either: A) Play the Games or B) Spell 'cat' correctly then stay away from this movie. Okay?"
"hassenpheffer","6","12","27","21 April 2006"," ""It's OK. Everything will be alright. I promise.""
","I've never been one to blacklist any genre or type of film. The closest I can think of would be musicals, but that's just me.<br/><br/>The ""video game"" crossover film is a close second but it still won't keep me from seeing them. Granted, 80% of the ""vidgame"" flicks are downright awful like Super Mario Brothers and the Resident Evil films.<br/><br/>Enter ""Silent Hill"".<br/><br/>I've never played the game but only for a few minutes and I liked it but, unfortunately, never went back to it. I played it because it was a survivor horror game and those are my favorites.<br/><br/>It's not easy to convert a game into a coherent story but since the experienced and talented Roger Avary translated it to the screen I went and saw it. Oh, and I think the talented Radha Mitchell and Laurie Holden are hot too. That helps.<br/><br/>Much like the games, a lot of the characters run around, run away or walk towards doors and corners. This is mostly what all the characters do for the first half of the film. This is what hollows out the characters. They are very one dimensional and at times just plain dumb. All the interaction (few and far between) is very simple and formulaic. Lines like ""It's OK. Everything will be alright."" over and over again don't hold much in terms of their personalities and lends little to the story.<br/><br/>But this isn't Shakespeare. And it's not supposed to be, but there has to be a certain level of ""smarts"" in dialog and character. The only solid figure is the Mother who is, obviously, the main character of the story and she has a few good moments that are dumbed down by bad dialog. This hinders the actors' abilities at times, making them look a tad awkward or frustrated at the lines and people they're trying to portray.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the studio was not happy about Avary's original story that had a only female line up, so the father figure and the cop were added. (What's wrong with all female lead characters?) Perhaps this might've hindered the original story arch or maybe it didn't. Sean Bean's character is rather interesting but doesn't add a lot to the story. Although he could've provided more with what he discovers, but he never reveals anything substantial to the plot from his findings.<br/><br/>Remember also, that this is a ""horror"" film and I didn't move once from my seat. At no point was there a scare to be found. Given there were some great looking ""demons"" about (aside from the nurse rejects from the ""Thriller"" music video) there was still no tension from them at all aside from some ""twisting"" here and there. It seemed to me that this was more of a mood piece than anything else and that seemed more appropriate.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was too long. It seemed at times that a lot of the scenes were repetitive and took its time showing the effects but that's just a small peeve really.<br/><br/>Well, those were my negatives. Here are some positives.<br/><br/>Production design. It is staggering the amount of time and detail put into the town and its hellish bowels. The ash flakes alone were cool. The ""edge"" of the town and all the effects are top notch and give the film a great visceral feel. It's both creepy and unnerving. The church itself is monstrous and ominous.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very well done giving insight and terror in the rust, blood, wood, flesh and metal scattered through out the buildings and people. The darkness in the film is well contrasted and balanced. The numerous crane shots were a bit much but most were effect. I especially liked the aerial view photography (mostly computerized) of the chase sequence.<br/><br/>Jeff Danna & Akira Yamaoka score a great score giving the film a great ambiance combining coolness and creepiness into haunting melodies.<br/><br/>Lastly, the one thing that most people go to see it- the blood. It is one seriously bloody film. I lost count of the times Radha Mitchell was splattered with blood. It's not a slasher film, but it looks to have spent as much on corn syrup than most slasher films do. It's excessive but it works well in terms of the tone and that is always appreciated.<br/><br/>Over all, its actually one of the best vgf's (Video Game to Film) ever made, but it definitely needed a rewrite and another round by the film editor. That would've made this quite the freaky lil' flick that it could've been."

","All the reviews I have read on here so far talk about how this was a wonderful movie despite all of it's downfalls (not making sense, too long, etc.) But not one of them conveys the pure evil and demonic nature of this film.<br/><br/>I won't lie...I had no idea this movie was based on any video game, and so I guess most of the audience probably had more of an idea about what was coming and was more prepared to see what the movie contained. However, I didn't know that much about this movie, and only went to see it because I love horror films and couldn't wait to see the story about the girl who gets lost in an abandoned town.<br/><br/>However, after sitting through the two hours of torture, violence,and gore, I left the movie feeling sick at my stomach and weirdly guilty about having watched it. My boyfriend expressed the same feelings as I before I even had a chance to open my mouth.<br/><br/>I am sure there are plenty of sick, twisted people who will love this movie and recommend it to everyone they know, but I am saying don't go see this film. It is dirty, foul and BAD. The movie is filled with demonic happenings and human sacrifices. What makes it worse is that I am sure there are places where things like what happened in this movie actually exist...<br/><br/>I cannot name one particular thing that made me so against this movie...all I know is that I got a terrible feeling after watching it that I could not explain. I felt like the evil in the film followed me even after I got home and even this next morning after sleeping. I have never felt this way after seeing any movie, and I have seen some of the best when it comes to the horror genre. This movie did not make sense in any way, and will give you a horrible, dirty, evil feeling if you sit through it...<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and go see Scary Movie 4 instead..."

Well, Silent Hill proves'em wrong. EVERYTHING about this movie is bad ass. i'm not gonna sit hear and tell you everything about cuz that'll give it away, but i will say this, the acting-good. the horror-the best i've ever seen since the shining. The effects-brutal, do not bring your children to this movie, this was rated R for a reason, unless you want your 15 year old to be crawling in bed with you everynite, just take'em to stay alive or something. and last the story- they follow it so well, if you never played the game, your gonna want to after you see this movie. all i gotta, the decrypted Babs? ha, bring a friend, cuz your gonna freak! but there's also something else i wanna add, first off. If you like horror flicks like Hide and Seek, or Screem, just those kinda slow moving, make you think one thing and then OH it turns out to be the maid who was killing the cats! well then don't see this movie. Silent Hill is a very ""DARK"" ""SADISTIC"" film, with a lotta gore and very very sick story. i've seen some bad reviews on this film and most people complain about the story, well like i said, if you thought hide and seek was the scariest movie ever, don't see this movie, cuz it'll do 1 of 2 things, ether make you hate your life for seeing it, or blow your mind."

","After a small screening in our town I fell in love with Silent Hill all over again.<br/><br/>Me and a couple friends got tickets for a midnight screening last night and from what I saw in the trailers this was going to be a good movie and it was! Right from the start you notice how emotions and character are a big part of the film especially the stellar storyline, I love how they changed Harry Mason from Silent Hill one into a woman (not in a literal sense) the main actress has a lot of great scenes and plays them out well especially during the scene with the Janitor creature and most of every scene where shes shocked or frightened. I have to say though most of Sean Bean's (sp?) scenes weren't that great with the acting, the whole side dish from the atmosphere of Silent Hill and Rose's search to Christopher was a little relief mainly because it gives the audience who haven't played the game a little more storyline. The ending was pretty sad though it's one of those climaxes that make you wonder. Other than that I really loved the whole Cybill scene (fans of the game and people who have watched the movie know what i'm talking about.) Let's hope the critics accept this film and it makes a huge success I accepted it along with my friends. The nurse scene was scary lol first time I screamed in awhile. So yes Gans did one HELLUVA fine job with Silent Hill! Thank god Konami didn't give this movie to Uwe Boll or i'd just simply die and give up on video game film adaptations.<br/><br/>Great sense of the original video game atmosphere, chilling and edge of your seat sound and some of the best use of CG fog and GREAT acting.<br/><br/>Watch this movie and don't listen to critics or that one reviewer who said this movie was boring."

","I had the opportunity to see this at a prescreening and I have to say, this may be one of the best if not the best video game adaptations ever made. The movie follows the general plot of the first game, with elements of the second and third games as well. Of course, being a movie it has to take some liberties, including plot elements that were not present in the games. However, I think anyone who is a fan of the game will not be disappointed by what they have done here. It's a very fun movie to watch, managing to capture the disturbing psychological elements as well as the straight out horror moments that those of us who have played the game really enjoy. People who have not played the game will still enjoy the movie, although it will probably be a different experience from that of the gamers. Even if you do not like it as much as you might have hoped, I think you will at least consider your money well spent."

The child was such a terrible actor I almost wished Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen were once again children to fill the part.

A majority of the time I sat in plain disgust, mostly over the ""now were going to add as much digital effects as we can""-thinking of the filmmakers.

","Having seen the pervasive publicity for this film, I thought it would be average at worse. However, after an hour I felt that I was watching a second-rate made-for-TV film. This did not change for the second full hour I sat through.<br/><br/>The plot is very uninvolving. The camera mainly follows a mother wandering at random through a deserted town in search of her lost daughter where she encounters monsters. These computer-generated figures are totally out of place with the human actors, and their only horror is in being quite grotesque. There is no suspense. There is no plot. The main reaction of the audience I was with was bemused laughter at the shapes of these monsters, and the arbitrary times at which they appear.<br/><br/>Unless you have an interest in seeing how poor a film results from taking video-game concept and then removing the games controller and any sense interaction, this is a film to be avoided."

","Boy, let me tell you... if you loved the games, you're going to feel right at home with this movie. The games have always been known for fantastic visuals, eerie atmosphere, excellent plot, and awesome characters, and man oh man, it certainly carried over. The gore is simply fantastic, and let me warn you- if you have a weak stomach, you're not going to want to go see this. Let me give you a lovely example: Our old friend, Pyramid Head (of Silent Hill 2 fame) has an awesome scene in which he tears off a woman's clothes and rips off her skin in a splash of blood before hurling it at people who are escaping through closing doors. Fans of gore will not be disappointed, and this movie has quite possibly the coolest ending scene that I have ever seen in a horror film. Be prepared for a bloodbath, though.<br/><br/>I had a very hard time believing that there was hardly any CG in this film. The visuals were literally that great. Let me also warn you that this is a thinking man's movie- it's very easy to get confused with the plot, whether or not you've played the games before. And if you don't understand the plot, then you're not going to get the creeps at all when you watch this.<br/><br/>All that aside, I'm going to give this a 10/10. This is the best horror film I have seen in a long time. Whether or not you've played the games, I strongly suggest that even a casual horror fan like myself go see this movie."

Only the usual sounds are heard, but from behind me, the first clearly audible sentence is heard, and is as follows:""I don't get it.""<br/><br/>She clearly didn't understand the movie. Me and my friends, however, did. And we also felt a feeling of relief, that finally, a good game-based movie has been released. I felt pain in the beginning. Not because it was boring, no, I thought not one second of the movie was boring, but because I wanted to see the town of Silent Hill. Everything about the movie was perfect, except for some unintentionally funny dialogue. The camera work was nothing short of amazing, the monsters straight from your worst nightmare, and the performances, straight from the heart. I cant make this review much longer without putting spoilers, but I can tell you, this movie will make you feel the pain the main characters feel, and it will only suck you into the movie more. All the negative reviews its been getting from critics is unfair, and they treat this movie not as a horror movie, but as a game movie, and refuse to give it a fair trial because of that fact. But trust me, this movie is great, and to dare say its nothing but a game-movie shows how unwilling some people are to open their arms to changes.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to announce that this movie is the best video-game based movie ever. But thats not surprising. I however, do feel sympathy towards all other game to movie adaptations to come out in the future, because Silent Hill raised the bar to new heights. Not just for video game based movies, though, but for horror movies in general."
"timpackwood","8","7","14","21 April 2006"," Shocking, atmospheric, fun.
","my score for the movie was 8 out of 10. In all of this movie's atmosphere (which it has plenty), the visceral gore comes without apologies or even a mere glimpse of effort shown in restraint, but done so in a way that is refreshing in the last multiple years of throw-away shlock shock. It doesn't bring anything to the table it has to pull back by shying the camera away, and it brings quite a bit forward. Once you see it, you'll probably see why the gore in this movie feels so different. I can't explain it without giving away details. As a gamer, I probably set some different standards for the film. Higher as far as pleasing me as a gamer (which it did), and giving justice to horror movies in general (which I think it did). It did have an annoying 10 minutes where story was shoved down your throat, a radical religious figurehead was a bit tedious and repetitive, the ending pretty nebulous (but honestly, how could you explain them coming BACK from that and living happily ever after?). ASIDE from that, I found I came out of the theater more than satisfied. 8 out of 10 without hesitation."
"Reptileboy66","8","7","14","20 April 2006"," Silent Hill makes me happy!!!!
","OK, first off to the people who gave it bad reviews: do you have any idea what the real Silent Hill is about? the games themselves leave us players asking questions even until the ending. there are still parts in the four games I am still trying to figure out. Second, the games are scary in the psychological point of view. third, the film itself isn't just about the gore or the freaky ""pop out"" scares, what made it scary was the fact of Rose's reason to be there. Silent Hill the movie did exactly what the video games did, it scared me to a point where i realized i was also living it (when I play the games i feel like I am the one isolated there). The movie did the same for me and i am happy for that. the music was awesome and the monsters were believable. the story itself is explained in a form where the audience must ask themselves the questions in order to find the secrets beneath. the games made me do the same and so does the movie. The thing about the movie is that if you do not pay close attention to the film you won't get it, not even the ending. the gore and blood is a lot but hey it is Silent Hill. the ""other"" world is so believable again I felt like i was there. The only thing I had a problem with in the movie was that it kind of jumped to the town without going into much explanation with who they were. But then again that's Silent hill for you, you do not know the characters until you uncover their backgrounds through 'clues"". Awesome and terrifying story 10/10."
"Akira-36","9","5","9","1 October 2006"," A unique existential horror that suffers under Hollywood production
","The Silent Hill game series is a rare gem in the survival-horror genre. It blends a rich tapestry of psychology, symbolism, history,pop culture, as well as ancient mysticism. Konami did an incredible job developing a game that is immensely engaging, eerie and disturbing. <br/><br/>The movie version is visually as stunning as the game, but it lacks soul, empathy and coherence. Christophe Gans has gone to great lengths in securing the right to this movie. I've read that he played the console games, and personally wrote a letter to Konami expressing his understanding and respect for the game. However, from the look of things he has not successfully translated the essence of the game, and instead went into a tangent to tell a rather different story. <br/><br/>In any other instances, I would have welcomed a new twist, different interpretations or additions to the game's lore. However, by turning the very core of the story upside down this has become a disappointing adaptation of an otherwise beautifully shot film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Here are the differences between the movie and the console games: <br/><br/>1. The main the protagonist is now a woman. The father figure who is desperately searching for his daughter (in the game) has been supplanted by a mother figure. Hollywood is once again conforming to the popular stereotype of the absent father who is unable to protect the wife/daughter character from harm. Subconsciously, the terrors of Silent Hill can also be interpreted as the representation of malevolent presence or the incompetence of the male characters. <br/><br/>This change of gender also helps to support the underlying message of the film. This is clearly stated at least twice in the movie when the character of Cybil Bennett and Rose Da Silva mention that 'Mother is god in the eyes of a child.' The fertility-goddess subtext is indeed inherent in some parts of the movie.<br/><br/>2. The Satanic cult in the first game is led by Dahlia Gillespie. She also raised Alessa Gillespie to bear the seed of Samael. The burning that Alessa sustained was a ritual that had gone awry, or as some game fans have suggested was intentionally done to create undying hatred within the child Alessa: a prerequisite condition for the unholy birth.<br/><br/>Throughout the original game and its sequels, the Satanic cult continues to thwart our heroes/heroines. It represents the twisted and evil part of humanity. The cult membership comprises of nurses, doctors, a geneticist and other lay people. They even produce and distribute addictive drugs to control/influence the town's population.<br/><br/>In the movie however, the cult has been changed into a witch-hunting pseudo-Christian church. This is the biggest and most damaging alteration in the film, which changes the core story of the game. In the movie, now we have an evil church versus an evil child, complemented by agnostic/atheist protagonists.<br/><br/>3. The unholy trinity of Samael, Alessa and Sharon. Due to the failed ritual in the first game, Alessa's body has become so badly burnt that she couldn't function like a normal human anymore. Only the evil presence within her keeps her from death. It is this same power that taps into the mystical force of Silent Hill, and converts its environment into a nightmarish Silent Hill, which is essentially a projection of Alessa's own suffering.<br/><br/>Dahlia reverted to alchemy and genetic engineering to clone Alessa's DNA and creates a doppelganger baby. This baby is later saved by a nurse and adopted by the Masons (Da Silvas) and named Cheryl (Sharon). The movie is a bit clumsy in describing how Sharon became adopted. And it is even more ambiguous in describing how the 'Darkness' appeared and 'possessed' Alessa.<br/><br/>4. The monsters have lost their symbolic meanings. Every single monster type in Silent Hill game series embodies a psychological trait of a character. The mannequin nurses symbolize James Sutherland's suppressed lust. The theme of the second game is guilt, and thus Pyramid Head is at once the representation of guilt and also the executioner of James's sin (of killing his wife). In the predominantly female cast of the film, many of these monsters have lost their symbolic meanings and relevance to the main characters. In the games, Alessa's dark power feeds on the game characters and makes flesh that which is buried within.<br/><br/>5. The omission of the talisman of Metatron and the foghorn of Samael. These are two tools that have been omitted because they don't serve much purpose in the non-interactive medium of film. In the game however, they are physical representations of the two opposing forces of good and evil. The foghorn of Samael is translated into the church's siren in the movie though. Its purpose is slightly different to that of the game's.<br/><br/>6. Inconsistent and improper use of music tracks. Akira Yamaoka composed four incredible soundtracks for the four games. Each soundtrack is catered to a specific chapter within the Silent Hill saga. The music pieces help convey emotions and mental states of the characters. They immerse a player into the right mood and help build an eerie atmosphere that is at once disturbing yet attractive. <br/><br/>The movie makes use of at least the first three soundtracks extensively. They are selected and scattered throughout the movie almost without any coherence to the progression of the story, nor any significance to the characters' development. <br/><br/>I do enjoy the visual of the movie and to be honest, Pyramid Head and Cybil Bennett are really well done in the movie. So if you consider the movie as a separate and unrelated entertainment piece, then you will enjoy this movie as you are treated to an rare existential horror with amazing cinematography and visual effects."

Silent Hill was a town that was destroyed when a huge fire swept over it. Rose takes Sharon to Silent Hill but loses consciousness in an accident. When she comes to Sharon is gone and Rose goes to Silent Hill to find her...<br/><br/>I never played the video game so I can only review this as a movie. Visually it's very impressive with eerie locations and purposely washed out color. There's almost never a dull moment with monsters attacking (for some reason) left and right. Most of these things are never explained but certainly grab your attention. I assume they make sense in the video game. I do have to state it's a pretty sad state of affairs when you have to play a video game to fully understand a movie. Still I was never bored--I was trying to figure out the movie most of the time! There's also PLENTY of gore with people being ripped apart or torn open--this is not for the squeamish.<br/><br/>The acting is as good as it can be. Mitchell is good but a lot of her actions make no sense (again, they probably do in the game). Laurie Holden is very good as a police officer helping her. Sean Bean has a few good moments as Roses' husband. Alice Krige is exceptional as Christabelle--downright chilling. Ferland is wonderful as Sharon--this young girl has a bright career in front of her.<br/><br/>Basically I did like it but the plot was more than confusing and it got VERY upsetting towards the end. Also the ending was sort of ambiguous--I THINK it's meant to be that way. There's also a cute joke in the movie--the school in Silent Hill is called ""Midwich"". This is probably a direct pun on the book ""Midwich Cuckoos"" which became ""Village of the Damned"" about the evil kids--and that relates to this movie.<br/><br/>I give it a 9 because of the confusing bits and pieces and the ending. I do recommend it with some reservations. This is a must-see for gore fans."

It's just a bad movie entirely on its own merits.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is completely laughable, which is almost a good thing, as it makes the completely retarded decisions the characters make *almost* seem believable. Of particular note is Cybil.

""OOPS I'M WINNING BUT HAVE TO BE A TRAGIC HEAVY-HANDED MARTYR BETTER QUIT FIGHTING FOR NO REASON AT ALL LOL OH NOES FIRE IS HOT LOL"".<br/><br/>Although nothing is really as bad as the ""Congratulations Rose, your reward is the truth!"" scene. Protip: If your movie doesn't make sense without a ridiculous obligatory 10-minute sequence where you have to literally sit down and hold the audience's hand through the entire plot of the film, then guess what? TRY AGAIN. YOU DID IT WRONG AND YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED.<br/><br/>I found the CG effects to vary from simply unimpressive to silly. This film wasn't frightening. It was too boring to even be a mindless slasher-style romp. The script was an insult to the movie-going public at large. The music was good, but more often than not seemed inappropriate for the scenes it was matched to. The only part of the film I liked was the ending. And I'm not saying that in a sarcastic ""because it was finally over"" way. I really mean that I thought the ending of the film was decent. I wish I could say good, but I simply can't bring myself to do that about this movie.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I have seen fan-made films that were better movies than ""Silent Hill."" ""Silent Horror"" is a parody, and it still manages to capture the horror atmosphere than this disappointment.<br/><br/>Please do yourself a favor. Don't watch this movie. And if you did like this movie, do yourself a favor: read a book. Try the Great Gatsby, or how about Candide? Or watch something that does deserve praise, like ""Jacob's Ladder"", or maybe ""One Hour Photo.""

Most likely you'll leave the movie shaking your head, wondering why you just wasted your money. You were better off buying the game.<br/><br/>Things are just so terribly unrealistic in this movie, it will be hard to be genuinely scared by any of it, instead thinking to yourself, ""Um, that doesn't work that way.""

A place where a tragic history was unsolved, a place where mysterious deaths occur, a place where people where forbidden to go. You think you have seen horror, you think you have experienced fearwell once you go there, don't think you will return alive. Silent Hill is known as the ""God of Horror"". Delivering an edge-cutting masterpiece of psychological horror. Environments that will turn your blood blue and a storyline that is more intense, more bloodcurdling and more disturbing that any other horror you have seen, with breathtaking effects and perhaps the ""summit of all horror scenarios""<br/><br/>A lot of background information on the games is needed to understand some of the character relations and religious aspects, however do NOT let this stop you from watching perhaps one of the best horror films of the year. Most horror films or games that are made into films tend you lack that sense of identity which the original held. Not the same plot or same characters or same effect. Silent Hill, on the other hand provides a fascinating storyline, accurate character and creature design, even effects that seem to define real. Viewers may think that the story sides tracks a lot, but it is needed. Believe me I'm a huge fan. Nonetheless, Silent Hill still offers a world of fear, terror and shock. <br/><br/>Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) delivers an outstanding performance as a mother searching for her lost child, Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland). As the audience you feel her actions are senseless, yet they convey the tension throughout the film and make you wonder what hides round the corner. Together, Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) and Cybil Bennet (Laurie Holden  Police Officer) make a stunning team to fight off the creatures, each time you see these two together you are guaranteed action, along with loud, distressing, warning signal (You'll hear what I mean). Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) may seem a little unhelpful and pointless, but in fact he is the only reason why the film holds collectively. His performance is on the ball as a worried father, you actually feel aggravated and upset for his position. <br/><br/>Fans may argue, why are all the characters in Silent Hill 1 involved but not the two main characters, Harry and Cheryl ? Why is Pyramid Head in the Silent Hill 1 concept, despite only been in Silent Hill 2 ? Well I'll say this as simple as possible, perhaps the Silence Hill movie is during a different time period to game Silence Hill. Silent Hill is based on materializations of delusions, so thus the power the town holds has intensified greatly by including Pyramid Head. After all the reason why this creature, Pyramid Head appears is because of Alessa's hatred. But I am NOT here to tell you anything on the story, I'm here to give my opinion on the film and introduce you to a world of darkness<br/><br/>I can honestly tell you now! If you are a fan of this game series, you will NOT be disappointed in what you see. If you are a plain simple horror fan, that I would advise you too see this film, again you will NOT be disappointed.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a MUST see for fans! and a watch for all horror fans!<br/><br/>I hope this comment will at least give you some consideration in watching the film and I hoped you enjoyed reading this comment.<br/><br/>much appreciated, take care."
"st-MK","10","8","17","20 April 2006"," Silent Hill the Movie
","I'm pretty sure that Silent Hill will be interesting movie. You know, this kind of art should be seen as very different from the game. Like comics. Or like another part of the game. :) <br/><br/>Film should attract not only gamers, but also the other people to show them Universe of Silent Hill. The questions that appears while you'll be watching movie will guide you to finding answers. This is the main achievement of the cinema - to make people think. After watching this film you shouldn't have the answers. You should find it by yourself. <br/><br/>I think Christophe Gans is professional and as true Silent Hill fan he did his best."

","Now being a fan of the video game I was a bit worried another great game would have a lackluster movie, but I was surprised. I knew I was in good hands when the opening music from the first game started playing over the logo.Its got a great cast, some of whom play characters from the game but slightly different.The story is a tight and moves fast and is enough of a change from the game so fans will have something new to watch.The special; effect are also better than average with really creepy monsters and victims. As an added treat the music is taken from the game to give it the complete silent hill feel.My only dislikes were the actress who played Cybil,she did not seem very likable and my other complaint is not enough Sean Bean who is great in everything, he was underused. So overall fans will be pleased and average movie goers will see a fun horror ride where the good far outweighs the bad."
"quinnox-1","1","9","20","23 April 2006"," One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
","I had to write a comment upon seeing all the praise for this train wreck. This movie was about as scary as the Flintstones cartoon, but even the Flintstones could be entertaining unlike this crap movie. I'm a long time fan of horror, and this is yet another awful movie in the genre by Hollywood.<br/><br/>Dull, plodding, and way too long, this movie actually made me sleepy. The story is incoherent, and most of the time is taken up by the female main character running around empty movie sets, looking fearful. The rip off of the Hellraiser villain Pinhead with the chains ripping people apart in the climax was especially laughable. But at least Pinhead had some witty things to say, the creature in this one just sits there with a stupid look on its face, struck dumb and mute apparently. I can't blame them, being in this movie must have been torture.<br/><br/>TRULY AWFUL"
"Dianafan79","3","6","12","1 June 2007"," I know it's a game cross over but it really does feel like a game not a film
","I was hugely disappointed with Silent Hill. I know it's a game/film cross over, but to be honest it feels like it when sitting in the cinema (my local cinema showed a repeat showing last night). In fact I couldn't shake off the fact this originated from a game and it was almost like there wasn't a projector man in the cinema but someone who was sitting with his feet up with a control pad playing a game for our amusement. The characters to me, lacked any depth and I felt sorry for none of them despite the horrendous things that happen. I am also surprised that Sean Bean signed up for this film that lacked any character depth or a story that grabbed the audience. In it's defence the sets and effects are good and are very convincing. Sometimes too convincing! Overall this film didn't appeal to me, but I can understand why people who did like it, did. But the best thing you can do is judge for yourself. What is one man's meat is another mans poison. Enjoy the film and make your own mind up. I, for one, won't be watching it again!"
"mercywriter","1","6","12","6 November 2006"," Awful just doesn't describe it
","I don't think there really are any spoilers in here, but I'm checking the little box just in case. So read with caution if you don't want to know anything at all about the movie.<br/><br/>I only give this one star because 0 isn't an option. Yeah, I have not played the game. Don't care to. Won't even be tempted after wasting my time seeing the movie. The back blurb was enticing, as was the fact that one of my favorite male actors, Sean Bean, was in it. But not even Sean Bean made this worthwhile. I suppose I could have stomached the gore, even the ridiculously unbelievable, if not for the painfully unoriginal idea of fanatical ""Christian"" bad guys.<br/><br/>I am sick and tired of Hollywood demonizing Christians and the Christian faith, even if thinly disguised. It's tiring, really, and frankly, cliché. I suppose if they gave other religions equal ""bad guy"" time, it mightn't bother me. But a major movie that criticizes any religion or belief system other than Christian, whether Catholic or Protestant, is rare. (Note: I said rare, not non-existent.) It was frustrating to sit down to see a movie that seemed to have an interesting plot line, just to find it one more of Hollywood's Christian-bashing fests. This sort of movie only fosters hatred and anger, the same type manifested by the ""Christians"" in it, toward those of the Christian faith. It makes all followers of Christ look evil and irrational, and that is just silly, and untrue. I won't go further into that point because this is not the place.<br/><br/>Although at one point or another I wasn't 100% sure, the end really was no surprise. My husband, who fell asleep about half way through it, guessed what was going on. I might have fallen asleep as well, except the movie got me too riled for that."
"rchadwi@hotmail.com","3","6","12","23 October 2006"," Visually Awesome but Incomprehensible Garbage
","Well, after seeing this whiskey-tango-foxtrot of a movie I found out later it was based on a video game. Well, that explains a lot, since most of the film resembles a video game, with the lead character running through mazes/levels trying to find her daughter. But what is admittedly a very visually-satisfying film suffers from a lack of coherence and stupidity on a scale so massive, you don't know what you just saw and, frankly, you don't care! The film starts with the girl who suffers from sleep-walking and finds herself on the edge of a huge cliff (???). Her parents rescue her while the girl, in a sleep-state, shouts over and over ""Silent Hill!"" (in a not too convincing manner...the acting is, well, abysmal). This plot development takes literally 90 seconds of the film. Bingo-bango, her mom is taking her to, yep, Silent Hill! That'll cure her! This journey begins not two minutes into the movie. On the way, a motorcycle cop stops the mom. Mom pulls over. Cop approaches car. Mom immediately GUNS THE CAR AND TAKES OFF. Why? What human would do this for no apparent reason? I guess we're not to ponder this question. Mom is now (on a rainy, unfamiliar road, mind you) driving break-neck speed towards Silent Hill (a ghost-town in WV) and...get this...crashes full speed through a chain-locked barricade. Again...huh? WTF? Of course, she crashes the car and when waking up, daughter is gone and she finds herself right smack dab in the middle of ash-rain ghost-town alternate-universe what-the-you-know Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Now the movie is square into video-game mode. Our heroine (mom) sees a fleeting glimpse of a girl in a building. Mom enters (unfamiliar) building. Mom (with the aid of a single cigarette-lighter which never runs out of fuel or dies) proceeds to work her way through an unending maze which no sane person would ever find themselves able to back-track. Why? Heck, we've been asking ourselves this for the last (check the watch) 20 minutes! Mom encounters several scary looking creatures, surroundings, menacing-sounding civil-defense sirens, etc.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, the motorcycle cop arrives and hand-cuffs mom, after explaining that she dumped her bike a bit back (now we're starting to think, oh, I know, everyone is dead!)...both meet some mad, old woman who spouts out some pseudo-cryptic-occultish gibberish...more running through different buildings (you know, like levels of a video game)...they meet various ""bosses""...run some more...get ""keys"" and other clue pieces...<br/><br/>..this goes on for two-and-a-half-friggin' hours. And then in the end there is some more psycho-babble about evil and witches and ""not one of us"" and the townspeople (???) try and burn the girl but the girl has a spirit double who IS evil and wreaks havoc on the townspeople (who are....dead? alternate universe? who cares!).<br/><br/>And in the end mom and daughter get back in the SUV, leave Silent Hill and get home...but is it home (I mean, dad has been home the whole time and he's alone and everything looks...real. Mom and daughter are in the home but...everything is kinda foggy and ethereal, like it's home but in an alternate universe? Dead?)...<br/><br/>Whatever! The three stars I give this are STRICTLY for the stunning visual graphics. Yet graphics a film do not make. Buy the game (sounds cool!) avoid the movie and and thank me later."
"kari-kolehmainen","1","6","12","3 August 2006"," I didn't realize that game movies can be this bad
","Nothing in this movie works. Characters are shallow and do not develop during movie. There is no sense of horror at any point of the movie. Mere splatter is not enough to create horror atmosphere in fact it does the opposite. Shallowness of characters gives no reason to be afraid for them. Cinematopgraphy is so poor that it makes me wonder if director has attended any film school lessons. Games of this genre suffer from bad camera angles and now same feature (or bug) is transferred to movie screen, that is the only achievement of this movie. It resembles the game every way other than atmosphere and suspense. There is even the NPC that tells ""player"" what to do next..."
"clearlyvague","10","6","12","22 April 2006"," Intense and disturbing.
","I went into Silent Hill with high hopes. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>From the outset, the movie has a dark, twisted atmosphere. There is a pervading sense that something is just not right. When the world transforms, things really get interesting. You can almost feel the sanity of the town (and your own) slipping away as the darkness falls. During these times, you almost cling to any light on the screen, struggling to avoid looking at the surrounding darkness.<br/><br/>There are some truly gory scenes in this movie. I can almost guarantee that you will not be able to forget some of these images. Some of these scenes are anticipated, but end up being worse than you imagined. Others are by total surprise, leaving you in a state of shock as the horror of what you witnessed slowly dawns. Even those scenes that are not exactly gory are still disturbing.<br/><br/>The talent in this movie is great, and I don't just mean the main characters. The actors who play the monsters are amazing, moving in strange, inhuman ways that make you want to back away. It is hard to believe that these monsters are real people and not CGI.<br/><br/>The plot itself intriguing. There is little in the way of dramatic irony, the audience being just as clueless as the protagonist throughout the movie. The story shocks, confuses, and captivates, leading the audience on a twisted journey through the soul of the damned town. From the almost normal surface to the bowels of madness, this movie seeks to, and succeeds in, upsetting the sanity of the audience."
"karis-1","9","6","12","21 April 2006"," Don't Believe The Reviews...
","Well, we all know console to movie translations can so often go so horribly wrong...<br/><br/>Not so with Silent Hill, an exceedingly faithful-to-the-game movie.<br/><br/>As with all my reviews, this'll be super short, all you need to know is: If you like Silent Hill, you *should* love this movie. It's got everything in the game, plus a lot more. It's got a cool and rather twisted storyline, the acting is great, the child actor playing Sharon is typically what you'd expect of the new generation of kid actors (ie fantastic).<br/><br/>The movie has a good pace and lots of scares. While not the scariest I've ever seen, in fact, at times it feels more like a drama than a horror movie, it certainly is visually gruesome, with some truly wonderful imagery taken both from the game.<br/><br/>The scene with the ghoulish nurses is truly unforgettable.<br/><br/>Overall a wonderful movie and one well worthy of a 'best game to movie award'.<br/><br/>My ONLY criticism of this movie is that the scenes with Sean Bean are to its detriment. I hear the directors wanted the movie rewritten to include a male character - this was poor judgement, the movie was perfect as written and Sean's scenes just slow it down and add unnecessary (and rather weak) plot where it just wasn't needed.<br/><br/>Go see this movie if you like horror movies and it's a MUST if you ever played Silent Hill on your PS2... You'll be reliving scenes from the game from the tenth minute of the movie!<br/><br/>I have to add, as the reviews are streaming in, so many people asking 'what was this movie about?'<br/><br/>My answer is harsh: only people with HALF a BRAIN would be confused by Silent Hill. The movie not only adequately explains itself (through a ten minute dialogue - can't say any more for spoilers), but there are parts of the story that are meant to keep you wondering. <br/><br/>So, in summary: Silent Hill is hardly rocket science, and I'm confounded by people who seem to think the story makes no sense. <br/><br/>If you're looking for more and scratching your head, you're looking far too deeply (or talking through the movie and not actually paying attention!)"

","upon see the credits and hearing people that this was a dumb movie i guess these people are not fans of the game....this is a great movie literally almost perfect to the game mainly 1 and 2...if u love the game then u will love this movie and follow its story nicely...although some dialog was a bit cheesy its was still okay..as usually pyramid head was the best monster in the movie and sadly was not used a lot....but what he did to that girl's breast is very bad and shocked even the people that hated the movie. which as far as i have read has not been noted as the worse death in the movie or any movie. the sirens that alert of the dark side are nerve racking you know u are in for something special. the ending is perfect makes u feel like the second movie will be on par with the story of the second game...the father looking for his wife and daughter in scary silent ... not the clean one he was in ...ohh yeah am i the only one that found the zombie nurses hot...i mean they had cleavage and despite not having faces and being zombies they are very hot. lol...odd that the pics of pyramid head in a magazine were not in the film which looked like he was gonna fight the main girl character...that kinda sucked cause it would have been good...i bet. in part 2 show pyramid head do to the nurses what he did to the legs in the second game.... see this movie trust me."
"michaelRokeefe","9","6","12","21 April 2006"," A desperate mother battles evil.
","Extremely haunting. Rose Da Silva(Radha Mitchell)makes the journey to the deserted town of Silent Hill that has been repeatedly appearing in her sick daughter Sharon's(Jodelle Ferland)nightmares. Silent Hill is covered in a mysterious fog that ever so often moves out of the way for total darkness. It doesn't take long to realize that the darkness brings about unexplainable events. Rose witnesses puzzling manifestations and mangled beings spawned by evil in her search for her child. Sharon's horrid dreams actually could be the key to the history of Silent Hill's haze.<br/><br/>Fantastic visuals and special effects. Some very disturbing images and hellish violence. Harsh and compulsive original music by Jeff Danna and Akira Yamaoka strengthens the lurking prowess of evil. Sound editing is exceptional. Kudos to director Christophe Gans. Others in the cast: Laurie Holden, Sean Bean, Kim Coates and Alice Krige. If you like horror and hair-raising chills, SILENT HILL fills the bill."
"vormaen","9","6","12","21 April 2006"," A trip into the disturbing
","In my opinion most of the ""professional"" critics are old, without taste, and avid haters of video games and anything spawned from it. I loved this film. I will admit the climax got kinda jumbled and didn't fit what I thought would be a normal Silent Hill experience, but the rest of the film and the ending fit perfectly. The visuals are not intended to bring about a sense of horror, but are intended to deeply disturb you. If you have played the Silent Hill experience, you will understand more, as this film was tailored to the MILLIONS of SH fans, but if you're not, maybe this will intrigue you enough to pick up the series and give it a go. This is not intended to be classed as a Horror film, and the confusion the critics are causing really deters from what should be a good ""Jacob's Ladder"" type film. This film will merit a sequel, and by listening to the fans, the series will expand on what was strong about this film, and build on what a final confrontation should have been."
"synergyblades-1","3","6","12","21 April 2006"," Disappointing, from an otherwise avid Silent Hill series fan
","I find myself surprised that many fans have so far rated the film so highly having played and loved the games since it was first released - have we been playing the same series? In all this film left me feeling dismayed that this was being shown as an official tie-in, representative of the series, wondering whether in future the game series would be judged based on what people saw in the cinema and frankly whether other people only play the games for the gore content.<br/><br/>What works in this film? The visual effects, for one. The nightmarish Otherworld has never looked so good and the transition between the two was given an interesting twist with the burning effect and subsequent 'reapplying' of the surroundings. The monsters were also fantastically designed and moved very well indeed (I understand from IMDb that they were actors and not CGI which should say something to Hollywood, really).<br/><br/>What doesn't work? Well, most other things.<br/><br/>Clearly my biggest gripe was the story and general atmosphere of the film. Silent Hill games have all been about atmosphere - drawing you into the world, a stranger in a lost place. The start of this movie gave this in droves and it really felt as though an excellent film was to follow. Sadly, this failed to materialise as Rose travels through endless areas with no particular aim in mind, clues vaguer than those in the original game and with rushed scenes giving no chance to get drawn into the atmosphere. It was by the time they had finally reached the church that I knew the film would not recover. Pyramid Head's appearance, whilst clearly there for the fans (to which I've no objection, if done properly) was hampered by the gore that followed with absolutely none of the subtlety of the second game and a change of purpose. No longer there as a conjuring by a guilty soul to show past sins by making appearances and affecting his emotions, he's degraded to ripping people's skin off and directing hords of cockroaches. Great job.<br/><br/>Things turn from bad to worse with even more gore, the burning of a great character, Cybil, and the cringe-inducing ending worthy of a B-grade horror movie only (barb wire up the dress, anyone? You had to shake your head, as a fan, when people laughed audibly over the loud volume in the cinema). Out of the window flies the subtle, psychological terror from the games and in comes floods of blood, people splitting in half and all manner besides. I'm not suggesting blood is not usable - of course, the Otherworld has it as part of its decor - but the movie has clearly attempted to appeal to the masses. The games on the other hand use it to great effect and sporadically but more importantly - with purpose. Once more, it's about the atmosphere created, not the flesh and blood you spill.<br/><br/>As a result neither were impressed; people who hadn't played the game came out of the cinema with really negative reactions (comments ranging from ""I think that's the worst film I've ever seen"" to ""Were you scared? Reply: No, not at all"") and I as a fan feel let down.<br/><br/>The acting from Radha Mitchell was good given what she had to work with, whilst Sean Bean looked bewildered. Jodelle Ferland as the young Sharon played the cute child part well, though getting her to explain the whole scenario in a snap five minutes was a poor choice no matter which child actor you use.<br/><br/>All in all, not recommended and I won't be buying the DVD. This was a real opportunity to add to the series and it was let down by the rehashing of the first game and the tweaks made to appeal to the blood-gore-horror movie watchers. Not recommended, and I'm praying that the movie and the upcoming Silent Hill: Original Sin (warning: potential remake) is not going to disrupt the canonicity of the games; though somehow I'm left feeling the series has been tainted, regardless."
"chalometalero","10","6","12","21 April 2006"," This is an explanation for those who give it a bad score
","This movie is excellent in every angle, anyone who doný understand this movie and is upset is because doesn't understand the Silnet hill games and ambient, before to see the movie if you don't have played the game you must understand that tho world of silent hill is all about understanding and don't know where you are, if you pretend to have a logic explanation better don't go to the cinema. The movie if for all fans that understand silent hill ambient and for all who understand my explanation, this movie can't have a bad review. Excellent movie don't miss it. There is not all about monsters and especial effects is about a great history and an excellent ambient to make you feel sad and sick, very good acting and I prefer to call it a horror drama like the game is. <br/><br/>Less than a 8 for this movie is a crime."
"zmmcgar","10","6","12","21 April 2006"," Fans of the game series will not be disappointed
","Though the film Silent Hill mashes up the details of the first game in the series (adding in a dash of Pyramid Head from SH2), it manages to capture the atmosphere of the games perfectly. Fans of the series will notice that a number of shots are lifted directly from the game itself; this is most notable in the beginning when Rose descends a staircase into her first encounter with the ""evil"" version of Silent Hill. Also, most of the music in the game is from the soundtrack to Silent Hill 3, which is my favorite soundtrack of the series.<br/><br/>The transitions from ""ghost town"" Silent Hill and ""full-on hell"" Silent Hill are beautiful--well, as beautiful as the deterioration of reality can be. I had an enormous grin on my face the first time everything shifted, and the world became barbed wire and blood and rust.<br/><br/>And is this movie ever full of barbed wire and blood and rust. And guts. Pyramid Head's scenes are particularly brutal, as is the finale (SPOILER) when Alessa has her revenge on the elders of Silent Hill in the nastiest way possible.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of making the SH narrative coherent: in fact, the narrative in the film is a lot clearer than the game's, in my opinion. However, the opening of the film, until about the point at which Rose reaches Midwich Elementary, moves very briskly, and those unfamiliar with the storyline may have a hard time getting into the movie at first.<br/><br/>The problem for people who aren't fans of the series is that they'll have to wait until near the end of the film to get the full background of the story, which is delivered in a monologue over a stylish, grainy flashback that will remind fans of the ""noise filter"" effect in Silent Hill games (as in, the film at this point is scratched and fuzzy).<br/><br/>The dialog's is occasionally silly, and the acting a bit overwrought at times; but I don't think it's distracting enough to ruin the film. And besides, horror movies aren't known for Shakespearian performances.<br/><br/>All in all, I would have to say that Silent Hill is not only good among video game adaptations (though that's a bit of a backhanded compliment) but also good among horror movies, and certainly more than worthy of the ""Silent Hill"" name."
"Senshiboi99","10","6","12","20 April 2006"," Loved this movie
","I saw this film at a critic's screening and let me just say that this movie is a blessed event. It's everything the Silent Hill fans could've ever wanted to see. I cried because I absolutely loved it. I screamed at several parts and thanked the director and writers in my head when the whole thing was finished. The Silent Hill fans know why. The story is great and the crossover from video game to film was clean. Now if you are unfamiliar with the games or storyline, then I suggest watching this film to know why the Silent Hill fans are so nutty over it. Plenty of blood, gore, and Silent Hill memories.

","This is the story of a little girl who sleepwalks and in her dreams mumbles «Silent Hill, Silent Hill». This is the catalyst for the movie's direction, and so off drive mom and daughter, leaving behind dad for unclear reasons due to an even more befuddling family relationship. At the beginning of their journey, they are stopped on the motorway by a police woman, for reasons unknown, propelling mom to risk their lives by crashing through a gate on the abandoned road leading to the ghost town of «Silent Hill». When she wakes up in her car, the daughter is gone and so for the next two hours she tracks the little girl (at least we think it is the little girl who keeps running away from her for reasons unknown) calling her name, but to no avail. She is then subject to creatures who attack her from all angels every time an alarm sounds, similar to «The Time Machine» from 1960, with about as much menace.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell does a good job as the mother and is alluring, but there are no relationships for her to play off of, and in the end I didn't really care about anyone in the film. Even the mother daughter bond is a bagatelle. Perhaps the movie was satisfactory for someone into the video game, or video games in general, but for me, it was void of anything except boredom.

"Disfigurator","8","4","7","8 September 2008"," Pure enjoyment for SIlent Hill fans and viewers with brains
","I have just read some bad reviews about this movie and marked them as ""not useful"", because ALL of them have one thing in common - all the reviewers which gave bad ratings didn’t have any idea of what are they dealing with - they haven’t understand the movie and story IN GENERAL. And how can a misunderstood opinion be useful?<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Silent Hill universe due to the rich depth and symbolism and music as well + due to mysterious-industrial-artistic look and scariness in general. I have played all the video games from this franchise and I must say, that the first part is my favourite. And this movie is based upon 1st and 3rd part of the game series.<br/><br/>In movie we have absolutely brilliantly done visuals and cinematography, which are held so closely to the original. Looking at this makes me to confirm that the Cristophe is a true fan of the Silent Hill game and a very talented director! This is a combination that serves as a good salmiakki for me - I cannot imagine greater pleasure.<br/><br/>I do find this movie to be a brilliant adaptation of amazingly brilliant video-game series under the same name, of course. In this movie all the key elements are kept true and alive. We do have multiple mirrored realities, we do have a brilliant story, which is like a puzzle itself, we do have some meaningful creatures (monsters) and we do have all the aesthetic values of the game franchise. Everything is done right. But it is not some kind of rip-off. We do have here some experimentation and interpretation from the movie crew. And even these off-roads are kept true to the aura and sense of Silent Hill. AND WE DO HAVE CREEPS AND SCARES AND THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SILENT HILL.<br/><br/>But if all the key elements are kept here, why do some people gave (and will give) extremely bad ratings and reviews? I think that it’s because that they did not see the depth of the story, didn't see the symbolism of creatures and actions (in story) in the movie. But, if they did see some of these elements - they didn’t understand them.<br/><br/>And you just cannot appreciate and enjoy the things, which you haven’t noticed or understand (with exceptions). So, if you do have negative opinion of this movie, I suggest you to open your mind, to be symbolism-tolerant, to run away from your stereotypes (it's OK that the main protagonist is a female - it doesn't affect the storyline) and to be open and able to think and accept the interpretations done by the Cristophe and writer, especially, if you are a fan of the Silent Hill games.<br/><br/>Be open-minded and try to accept those few well-done innovations and turns, and explanations.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a form of art, which can be enjoyed at its best, when completely understood. And YOU MUST use your brain to achieve the complete understanding. Believe me - there are no holes or gaps in the story, there are plenty of hidden clues instead, given to you to create your own interpretation.

","The Silent Hill VG series is the undisputed dark, creepy kings of horror/survival games. I went to see the movie with an open mind (haveing been severely disappointed with the screen play versions of good games....yes, I'm talking about YOU House of the Dead, and Alone in the Dark). So, being a big fan, I was hopeful, but skeptical. Well, it didn't take long before all skepticism was banished. It was so dark and creepy, I didn't leave, because I didn't want to miss any.<br/><br/>Although it was more of the story from Silent Hill II, and shovelhead wasn't in it enough, I still think the movie rocked!<br/><br/>I think Milla Jolvovich would have been way better in the lead role, but what's her name did pretty good, too.<br/><br/>I personnaly can't wait for a sequel"

","As I said in the title, this is one of the best game to movie crossovers( in my text GTMC), ever. Finally someone decided to make GTMC that is fun to watch, and not only to steal money from the game fans (If you are thinking about Uwe Boll, you're right). All of the actors and actresses are phenomenal(they really know how to do their job). By the list of good things, I'd say it's the following: -Good game choice(Horror adventure) -Great acting crew(Radha,Laurie,Jodelle,Alice,Deborah,Sean,Kim and Tanya) -High quality CG effects(melting the walls looks particularly impressive) -Awesome story(It's tightly connected to the game) As for the bad sides, maybe some (I'm probably detailing) unanswered questions in the end. That's it.<br/><br/>All in all, movie is definitely worth watching"
"eternalsea","6","4","7","21 February 2007"," Its good by game adaptation standards.
","Video games never seem to translate well to film, or most of the time anyway. Once in a blue moon you do get one that isn't a total stinker like the first Tomb Raider movie or Alien V.S predator, but even then they rarely turn out to be better than average. Silent Hill for these reasons is definitely one of the best game to film translations but that sadly, doesn't make it a great piece of cinema. Don't get me wrong its entertaining stuff, and a good Saturday or Friday night movie, but looking at the cast and crew involved along with the undeniable quality of the source material it's really a bit of a pity it isn't better. The Story follows Rose, who's daughter Sharon is sleepwalking and when she does she talks about a place called Silent Hill. Rose decides to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill in the hope that what is clearly disturbing her daughters mind can be resolved when she see's the place. The place itself is now a ghost town, abandoned for years it would seem, however when Rose and Sharon reach the outskirts of the town they have an accident that leaves both mother and daughter knocked out. When Rose wakes up Sharon is missing, and its up to her and Police officer Cybil to find the little girl, in a town where everything is far from what it seems. The high point of silent hill is undoubtedly its visual aspects. Director Christophe Gans has created a place both creepy and hauntingly beautiful, and the monsters that inhabit the town are some of the best I've seen on the silver screen in a good while. Screewriter Roger Avery can't replicate that success in his script however. Its wooden and far to long and at times the heavy script slows the film down horribly. Its admirable what Avery's tried to do, build a little more character and humanity into a genre that so often lacks it, but in the end he doesn't pull it of. The performances on the other hand are solid and believable. Rhada Mitchell makes a good fist of the leading role, and young Jodelle Ferland who has to play multiple parts as the story develops is a name to look out for in the future. Laurie Holden and Sean Bean aren't taxed by easy parts, though when it counts they get by just fine. Its also commendable that the film has gone the whole 9 yards and grasped an R rating. The source material requires the more adult and mature rating a Pg-13 certificate would have doubtless not been enough to coax up the required effects and mature tension."

","When I first heard that they are turning Silent Hill into a film i panic as i am a huge fan of the game series, but it was awesome! They kept the originally storyline from the first game, they incorporated the music from the games and also some of the ways the camera moves! The monsters also look amazing, they looked like they do in the game and they also include every Silent Hill gamers favorite monster Pyramid Head which also looked amazing! The only thing that i found disappointing was the predictable ending, i expected that the ending to the film would be like the game and keep you guessing. Even to someone who never played the games the ending was easy to figure out!"
"TJ1380","5","4","7","24 August 2006"," Sorry, but I've never played the game.
","Stating outright that I have never played the video game ""Silent Hill"" before seeing the movie might be an odd way to start this review, but I feel that it must be said. I just know that every negative comment I make from now on will probably be countered by a hardcore gamer who insists that I have no right to my own opinion of the movie version of ""Silent Hill"" because I am unfamiliar with the source material. Yes, I am unfamiliar with the source material, and that was one reason why I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I came into it as someone who just wanted to see a good horror movie. That being said, while I don't think ""Silent Hill"" is a complete disaster, I can honestly say that I've seen much better.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie (which I understand is pretty true to the game) involves a woman named Rose who travels to the abandoned town of Silent Hill believing it to have some connection to her adopted daughter's strange behavior (not only does she sleepwalk, but she constantly mentions the town by name while she does it). When Rose gets to the town, her daughter disappears, and Rose is left to deal with the strange and nightmarish things that plague Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie by far is the fact that it manages to maintain a very creepy atmosphere almost from beginning to end. As I said before, I have never played a ""Silent Hill"" game, but I've played games like it, and I can honestly say that the most effective parts of this movie are the ones that inspire the feeling of dread and isolation that persists throughout most good survival horror-style games. Everything seems to be shot from camera angles that seem to suggest that something scary could be just around the corner waiting to tear apart our heroine (who is as alone and practically defenseless as any hero of a typical ""Resident Evil"" game). The soundtrack is also very effective, with the kind of minimalist atonal music that sounds more like ambient noise than what most people would call real music. It adds a certain intensity that I'm sure would be lacking if the movie had a different soundtrack.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a creepy atmosphere seems to be just about all that this movie has going for it. There is some really weird and creepy things happening throughout this movie, but most of what we see is left mostly unexplained (yes, I know that I should probably play the games for a good explanation). The things that attack the heroine seem appropriately unnatural and creepy, but we are left with little explanation as to what they are (the guy with the pyramid on his head is probably the coolest and scariest monster in the movie, but he/it disappears way too quickly and never really serves a purpose). Things start to improve a little bit past the halfway point when we are introduced to what can best be described as the true evil of Silent Hill, but when that happens the other threats to the protagonist seem to be all but forgotten. I don't want to go into spoiler territory, so I'll just say that what we are left with is a film that cannot decide what kind of horror movie it wants to be.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that I found this film to be rather disappointing. It has a great look and a suitably creepy atmosphere, but there are too many things left unexplained and too many missed opportunities for me to really recommend this movie to anyone."
"martine-12","8","4","7","13 August 2006"," Well worth seeing
","The video game which the movie is based on is supposed to be quite good but that does not mean that the movie has to be any good, as a lot of previous video game to movie conversions have proved before (I'm looking at you, Uwe Boll!).<br/><br/>Despite the heritage of Mr (or is that Dr?) Boll the movie scores high grades from me (as you might have seen already). It's quite atmospheric and the town of Silent Hill makes a great backdrop for a horror movie.<br/><br/>There are certain aspects of the plot that is a bit cliché, and it would have been better to have the movie tell it than having a character explain it all to you three quarters into the movie, but on the whole it's no worse than any other movie of this kind.<br/><br/>The actors delivers a very convincing performance and there were times when I shouted at Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) to get a move on instead of screwing around.<br/><br/>Silent Hill clocks in at roughly 2 hours but I never felt that the movie lost neither its pace nor its grip.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that the ending is the right one for this kind of movie but it didn't spoil the rest of the movie for me -- quite the contrary perhaps as I'm still pondering over it.<br/><br/>The movie has it's fair share of gore and blood but it has ""just enough"" to make it scary and there are very few scenes where it's explicit. Most of the time it's psychological terror and uncertainty that keeps you on your toes."
"MrVibrating","8","4","7","2 August 2006"," A very good thriller.
","Don't think you have to have played Silent Hill in order to ""get"" or even appreciate Silent Hill the movie. I haven't, and I think the movie stands very well on it's own.<br/><br/>The imagery is without a doubt the strongest part of the movie. The camera-work is superb and varied and always fitting, and the subdued colours are perfect and moody. The special effects are often really cool and more often than not well integrated in the rest of the scenes, something not even really huge productions manage to pull off all the time.<br/><br/>The second strongest part was the sound. The score is haunting and hangs heavy over the scenes. The air-raid signal, the first time it's played, sends chills down the spine. The silent parts are well placed as well and you want them both to end and not to end, since they really add to the tension.<br/><br/>The story is smart, not the usual Hell invades fare(ala Doom), but shows the dangers of fanaticism. The acting is pretty solid. Although the movie breaks the ""Creepy adult-ish child""-quota(No more than zero per movie), it's done with style and not just for it's own sake.<br/><br/>Overall, the tension was great. Some scenes were disturbing, some scary, some just plain cool in their blood-curling way. For those who like horror movies and are tired of clichés and jump scenes, this is one of the pleasant surprises of the 00s."
"alexpakis","10","4","7","9 May 2006"," A great film that does justice to the game
","This movie was great. It totally lived up to the game's name and most likely let the game's fans happy and satisfied. Those laughable critics are biased against video-game oriented movies - i can't blame them, since Uwe Boll has put his own ""touch"" on the genre - and do not realize that video-game is a form of art! When they heard that it was a film adaptation of a game, they immediately thought that the storyline was poor (which was not!) or that the film bases its strength on raw violence and gory effects (the film has its gory climaxes, but surely does not rely upon them to make fans!). Maybe people should play the game before seeing the film, to see that it's not about monsters and blood, but it's about a beautiful and intriguing nightmare drama, based upon emotions. However, many friends of mine that have never played the games, found it enjoyable and were interested and curious as to what had actually happened in the film. A horror-drama masterpiece."

","damn critic! this movie was really good! it capture the whole thing of the game and really show people what silent hill is. I guess the ending ruin the movie but still it really capture what Silent Hill is. This movie was the closest to the Video game ever. It took stuff from Silent Hill 1 and 3. When i was watching this, i can feel and understand what is going on. there is also a PLOT! the PLot is really good, it isn't like Resident evil or any other video game movie. This movie was the best of any movie that was made base on the video game. The director basically made the movie to scare the audience in a dark scene and that is what Silent Hill was about. It was to scare people in a dark scene and showing that the people who goes there are just regular people like us. Not like REsident Evil where they are cops and they are trained to take anybody down. The movies show how and what people would do in a situation like that. Well overall, the movie was underrated due to critics because they think it is crappy and just another video games movie. but they are wrong cause it is really good ."

Go with an open mind, and believe me, this is great horror."
"Robert_duder","9","4","7","22 April 2006"," Everyone deserves an opinion....Silent Hill's complex nature intrigued me
","Silent Hill appears to be a genuine sore spot as people argue and bicker about it...was it good, was it smart, was it stupid, was it poorly done...and the name calling and petty bickering is stupid. To each their own...and that goes triple for movies. This was without a doubt one of my most anticipated films of the year and for three quarters of the film I had very, very mixed emotions. At some point I thought how stupid the whole thing was and how disappointed I was. And then next thing I knew I was drawn into it and really started to appreciate it's campy horror, sub-par acting and twisted, disturbing storyline.<br/><br/>First of all let's deal with this whole video game adaptation issue. We have to accept it, it's a way of Hollywood existence now and some will be good and probably more than some will be really bad. Silent Hill is not entirely a video game adaptation. Sure the idea and structure is loosely based on it but the story and characters are entirely unique. You DO NOT have had to play the game to appreciate or enjoy this film. I don't think it would make a lick of difference either way. I've played nearly all of them and it made no difference whatsoever. Fairly inexperienced director Christophe Gans, and gore-fest writer Roger Avary do a fair job of making the video game references very subtle. The story is complex, mystifying even at times (critics both professional and amateur are raving about how they don't understand it.) I admit I didn't find it THAT complex but there is no doubt that it's a deeply twisted and disturbing story but doesn't it have to be?? Isn't that what we wanted out of Silent Hill?? Radha Mitchell takes the lead as adoring mother Rose DeSilva. Now she certainly manages to captivate and hold her own as the main character in a small cast but her acting is campy (perhaps on purpose), a little over the top at times, but sufficient. She does the trick as the hero. Impressive is the work of the quite young, but already very experienced Jodelle Ferland who takes the role of Rose's daughter Sharon but ALSO the role of her evil incarnation Alessa. She is disturbing and horrific and plays both sides of the coin very well and convincingly. Her performance is the highlight of the film. Laurie Holden is the queen of camp in her performance as tough as nails cop Cybil Bennett. Her movements, wardrobe and lines all scream video game (which I assume and hope is on purpose.) I think it was necessary for Mitchell's character to have a partner in the bleak city of Silent Hill for Holden was important but they didn't seem to have great chemistry which would have improved Holden's role significantly. Finally Sean Bean plays husband and father Christopher DeSilva in a tacked on and obviously added role which really had no bearing on the story other than perhaps and hopefully to set up for a sequel. I love Bean and I think he's an incredible actor which is why it's unfortunate to see him so severely underused in this role.<br/><br/>Silent Hill the set was brilliantly made. The city was creepy and quiet (even the music stopped at some points to give you that feeling of horrific serenity.) There were some parts that were made to pay homage to the game that only hardcore fans would recognize as being sets directly lifted from the game. The monsters in Silent Hill were defined and brilliantly made if not occasionally poorly presented. Sometimes it felt like Mitchell's character was simply running from one side of the city to the other just so they could show off a new breed of monster but then again each one was more terrifying than the previous and they were magnificent. You could figure out the story despite it's complexity, and I DO NOT think anyone who really watches it would walk out confused. I think it all came together with only some plot holes that are unavoidable when making a film like this. I think it was the beginning of a brutal, bloody, wicked, horror series and I think this first entry will become absolutely a horror classic with defined monsters and horribly gory scenes and disturbing moments. The film is open to some interpretation and how great is it if a typical slasher horror film can ACTUALLY be unique and thought provoking?? The ending is even more brilliant and opens up a can of worms you can only imagine!! If you're a die hard fan of strange, sci-fi, almost TOO weird films you will DROOL over Silent Hill. It has it's shortcomings but I happen to think it is brilliant!! A series this HAS TO BE!! 9/10"

","This movie started out alright and the abundance of scenes that feel like they were pulled straight from the game were a nice touch, but somewhere along the line the filmmakers seem to have lost track of which plot elements they had and hadn't resolved. The ending of the movie created more questions than it even attempted to answer.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie feels like it was made by two different groups of people: One group who made a list of things they wanted to port directly from the games, and another group who had to try and tie everything together with a poorly realized and barely connected storyline."

"atliel","1","7","15","24 April 2006"," Another video game adaptation gone down the toilet and believe me I'm not happy about that
","I'm paraphrasing here but Kurosawa once said that if you have a great director, great editor, great cinematographer and a great cast but have a bad script then you will have a bad movie. This film is a great example to back up this statement. This film has some of the best visual effects out there, good editing, good cinematography, occasionally good soundtrack but an absolutely horrible screenplay. What happened? I wish I knew but could only guess that what we saw was the end result of a rough draft. Somewhere hidden in there might have been a good idea and it seems that unless you played the games it might be difficult to pin point exactly what that good idea is.<br/><br/>In order for a movie to be good it should not require an outside source (video game, comic book, novel or TV show) to hold it up. Some of the best films out there were based off of another medium, Spiderman 1 and 2, X-MEN 1 and 2, Batman Begins, Lord of the Rings (this list could actually go on forever), I even enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat. Obviously you don't have to agree with the titles I just mentioned, they're just opinions, the point is that these films don't require you to be familiar with the source material. The films actually stand on their own without that familiarity. There's nothing wrong with the director tipping his hat to memorable scenes that originate within the game as a wink towards the fan. What is wrong is when the director is not able to translate the games narrative into film for the non-fans. If he were successful in translating the game into film the non-fans would want to play the game! In this case Gans failed to do just that.<br/><br/>Is the movie hard to understand? No, because the main point of the plot, that is, the motivating factor for the characters in the plot is spelled out for you in the last 10 or so minutes of the film in the form of a flash back with running commentary. I can't help but think that the logic behind this plot structure is to make you feel like you've painstakingly played a video game and now you will be rewarded with a reason as to why you have played the game in the first place or why you sat for almost two hours wondering why Rose (the mother character for those who have not seen it yet) didn't take the kid to a doctor instead of taking her to an allegedly haunted town that is to this day burning underneath. The point is that this type of exposition is just plain lazy writing. That kind of information is typically (not always but in this way it is more challenging for the writer and allows for interactivity from the audience) leaked throughout the film with the use of action, dialogue, metaphors so when the payoff happens there is no need for an explanation.<br/><br/>Tension is caused by expectation, you expect something terrible to happen based off the clues that have been given to you throughout the course of the film. Sometimes the audience knows more than the main character raising the bar for tension. In other words you know what's coming before the character does causing the audience to scream the typical, ""don't go into that room"" or ""Don't open that door"" or just simply scream. Alfred Hitchcock has a better explanation as to how it works but the point is that tension is caused by expectation. Now putting aside the information that the fans are familiar with from the game, the movie itself does not clearly place any clues for the audience to create that tension. The clues that are presented are a mystery in of themselves. Although we eventually learn of the witch hunters origin and eventually, after the infamous flashback, we learn the story of Alessa, without some form of previous information placed earlier in the film it's difficult for most to see any of that coming. Therefore, the director literally has to hold our hands throughout the film for us to understand why anything is happening. But yes, by the end of the film you are TOLD everything and technically you should be able to walk out of the film ""getting it"". However, in this case, to ""get it"" was not fun.<br/><br/>I'm not going to argue about this being one of the best VG adaptations out there because it probably is. But unfortunately that's not saying much.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is I love video games and I really wanted to enjoy this film. Besides, I'm a huge fan of Brotherhood of the Wolf and based on that alone I thought this film was going to be great. I thought it was going to do for video games what X-MEN and Spiderman was doing for comics, people were finally going to look at it as a serious form of entertainment and not a mindless activity that most critics have labeled it as such. Unfortunately, in this case it did not do any of those things. Even worse, it seems, based on the number of the games fan responses in this forum, the film has isolated itself to the entertainment of only them, thereby alienating itself from the rest of the public and some are okay with this! That's not a good thing and you fans of the game should know that money ultimately rules this industry. If this film does not profit it will scare off the studios from not only making sequels of this movie but ultimately making future adaptations of other games. And there are a lot of games out there that deserve to be made into films."

"emperorkyle","1","7","15","22 April 2006"," Hmmm . . . not a good adaption, much less a good movie . . .
","Regardless of what others have said, anyone seeing this film should be forewarned: if you never played the game, you probably won't like it, and if you have played the game you will most likely hate it. As a movie it fails completely: has many characters that are unnecessary and should have been entirely deleted (I'm looking at you Sean Bean's character), not to mention weak acting on a whole from most characters. The story is pretty ridiculous and illogical (not in the sense of ""could this literally happen"" but in the idea that the concepts that are being portrayed are never clearly or consistently made evident.) and even worse dialogue. Cybil Bennett's character is completely out of context and is not an accurate representation of her character from the movie. This stands for the entire movie: none of the characters or even the plot represent and are an accurate adaptation of the game. In the game Dahlia Gillespie was at best a delusional psychotic, and at worst pure evil. In the movie she is portrayed as one of the most sympathetic characters in the film. The nature of evil in Silent Hill is clearly expressed in the game, whereas in the movie it is totally shifted and is never really explained. All I'm saying is be warned: great evil is approaching us, in the form of incompetent filmmakers who take good stories, throw them in the stupid-meets-total-bullshit blender, and creates total waste that continues to feed the minds of the moronic and dimwitted."

But then you wonder, if this is a video game, why is it so easy to win? The monsters all drop dead right as they're about to get you. Scary! Half of the film is so dark you can't even see the CGI freakshow. Honestly, there is nothing about this movie that works. Everyone in the theater was laughing at it and catcalling the entire time and nobody really wanted to stop them. It was the kind of film that was only enjoyable in making fun of how bad it was. I really hope someone gets fired for producing this crap."

","Dear God, I can't believe the positive reviews for this pile of crap!! Movie was a complete joke with horrible acting. This pathetic movie drug on for ever and the plot was absolutely deplorable! I have never been so angry with a movie. The creators of THE FOG think this movie was a major disappointment. Anyone that enjoyed this movie was either very high or is starved for entertainment. Save your money and skip this wretched waste of time! There was a monster that had a triangle for a head, what is that! We walked out of movie after they tried to tie all the loose ends up with a brain dead 10 minute flashback. The enlightening flashback only persuaded us more to run away screaming in disgust."
"Deathstryke","1","8","18","22 April 2006"," Bloody awful, in more ways than one.
","Let me first start by saying this movie's story is not, I repeat NOT as complicated as everybody makes it out to be. In fact most of the missing links and supposed plot holes are fused together in a lengthy, grainy flashback narrated by Alessa herself. The ending is a puzzlement, not in a Donnie Darko brain-boggling way, but more so because it wasn't relevant to the game and seems a strange route to take in terms of establishing a sequel. It is made blindingly obvious to us the events that have unfolded towards the end. It should not require a second viewing.<br/><br/>What the story fails to do is offer anything substantial in terms of the characters' backgrounds and their development. The fundamentalist cult is reduced to nothing more than a crowd of empty headed Quakers who seem to have substituted the normal terms used in everyday conversation like 'hello' and 'how are you?' with 'BURN THE WITCH!'.<br/><br/>The dialogue is as hammy as the hogs of hell. One prime example would be just after Rose and Cybil have a escaped a vicious attack by Pyramid Head's Great Knife, and a horde of flesh eating cockroaches. Supposedly frantic mother turns to terrified cop and proclaims calmly ""Hey, it's OKwe're gonna be OK"". In a speech to her faithful congregation, mad old Christabella manages to repeat exactly the same point five times over but with a different phrasing: ""She is a witch, she must be burned"" ""She is a demon, she must be cleansed"" ""Cleanse the sinner in the fire"" blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>The acting is cringe worthy, and despite what most reviewers have said, the golden raspberry does not go to Sean Bean. Rhada Mitchell is as wooden as a clog and seems to have her tongue shoved firmly in her cheek the whole time. When she and Cybil stumble into the church after being splattered with blood and chunks of Anna's skin, she turns to the camera looking as though she's just been caught in a summer shower. She delivers most of her lines in a rambling, robotic way, as if she were rehearsing them to herself at her makeup table before shooting. In fairness the script is crap and most actors do make a significant effort, most noticeably Alice Krige, who oozes the same menacing regal which she displayed as the Borg Queen. Deborah Kara Unger, who I must say still manages to look astonishingly beautiful clothed in a potato sack, also gives a good performance. Sean Bean's character serves little purpose, other than to give brief respites from the insanity of the town. These breaks are badly timed, however, and kill the film's momentum. His involvement and relevance to the story are minimal and it really feels like he was just thrown in to avoid claims of sex discrimination in the cast.<br/><br/>The one thing the movie managed to get right was of course the art direction, and there was the occasional little thrill at seeing the familiar alleyways and corridor shots. The CGI effects are quite impressive, especially in the bathroom scene. They're not so effective, however, when applied to the monsters, like the Straight-Jacket Man or the Cinder Children. It was an instant tension killer to see a wrathful demon child look up at Rose with fake, shiny, Bambi eyes.<br/><br/>Another thing that bugged me about the monsters was their relevance, or lack of, to Rose's character. We know that in the games the monsters were mocking manifestations of each character's psyche, his darkest nightmare represented as a real, physical threat, which created a deeply personal horror. Yet it seems the monsters in the movie only exist to give gamers a boner and to pop out randomly at Rose, saying 'Boo! I have appeared and now you will die'. Pyramid Head looked awesome, but he was only in the film for two scenes as nothing more than a brutish minion. The nurses looked both sufficiently sexy and repulsive, but what they have to do with Rose or Alessa, I don't know.<br/><br/>The gore wasn't nearly as explosive as I thought it would be. I had too little emotional engagement with the characters to care whether or not they lived or died. And, unless you've been living in a plastic bubble for the last 20 years of your life, you will not find this movie remotely scary.<br/><br/>I went to see the film in a theater packed with obviously avid fans and curious non-gamers. As a fan I was slumped low, my stomach gurgling, not with fear or excitement, but embarrassment and disappointment. When Rose dramatically burst into the church to see Sharon dangling above a pit of flame, and once again says ""It's OK baby, everything's going to be OK"" the audience burst out laughing, and I had to laugh with them. I appreciate that the story was ridiculous from the start, but I'm sure a better script and more competent acting would have encouraged our suspension of disbelief a little more.<br/><br/>I respect what Gans has tried to do, but it hasn't worked. Silent Hill offers nothing special and flops clumsily under the bar."
"lisa_surman","1","9","21","22 April 2006"," This film was a real once in a lifetime experience!
","This film really was a once in a lifetime experience- it was the only film i have EVER walked out of! The plot was non-existent, the acting stilted and the special effects laughable. There was no attempt to instill a sense of atmosphere - the directors simply thought that having the female lead screaming all the time would be enough to encourage the audience to engage in fear. Lazy film making. The only reason I could see for the woman to be running and screaming was that she had come to see how bad the film was and was screaming because she realised her career was over and was running to try to get out of the rubbish film she was in!<br/><br/>I could not believe that so many of us in the auditorium had forked out cash to see this tripe- there were absolutely no redeeming features. Shame on everyone associated with the film. Really really really bad. Please don't bother seeing this film. You will regret it. You have been warned!!!!!!!!!"
"vech24","2","9","21","21 April 2006"," Don't waste your money
","From it's vague and unbelievable beginning to it's tired drawn out climax, this movie left me feeling frustrated and disappointed. I'm not writing a synopsis as I refuse to waste any more time on this movie than I already have, but I will try and point out the pro's and con's in deciding to sit through this travesty. First off, on the positive side, this movie does seem to stay true to the game and should please fans of PS series by staying true to the morbid and creepy apocalyptic atmosphere that has been associated with the game. While the violence and monster effects were pretty interesting, it was not enough to save this train wreck of a movie from a variety of pitfalls. Unbelievable dialogue runs RAMPANT in this movie and in turn made me unsympathetic to the poorly portrayed characters and sabotaging what should of been the shining point of this movie: the story. The pace created by the director is both rushed where more of the story should be fleshed out, and stretched out to a boring length at times that are just plain boring. In short, aside from the spooky atmosphere and nods to the video game, Silent Hill has very little to offer in terms of a engrossing story, solid characters, and a plot that seems cohesive with the pace of the movie. It's a shame that they took the potentially rich story and delivered in such a ridiculously unbelievable and unsatisfying way. My advice is to see another movie or bash your head off of a wall until you lose consciousness, you're guaranteed to see just as much blood and suffer the proportional amount of brain damage as sitting through the movie itself. You've been warned."
"Elswet","8","5","10","18 March 2007"," I'm writing this as a NON-fan of the game.
","I have to begin this by saying that I don't understand the confusion. I followed the story line just fine, without benefit of ever having played the game. Other reviewers have declared this screenplay to be a convoluted mess, but I don't understand their perspective, as I had no trouble in following the storyline. Perhaps that was a ""perceived"" storyline, as I do have enough imagination to answer my own questions, filling in the blanks as the movie goes along, but either way, the time was lacking for the type of character and story development most seem to need in order to enjoy this work.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a darkling wonder of twists and turns. It is one of the few contemporary horrors which caught me and moved me to the edge of my seat. I found it exhilarating and genuinely thrilling.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"villatour234-1","2","5","10","21 October 2006"," extremely bad movie
","Not to appear demeaning towards other people, but it really is beyond me how anyone can say this is a good movie. The script's weak, hurrying to get the characters into the blood and gore without giving us any time to know them or comprehend their actions. There was a point when I wanted everyone to be killed so that the movie would be over. The only actor who's halfway competent is the one playing the cop. The main character in the story is so badly played you wonder how she ever got a role in a big movie. And what's Sean Bean doing here, after acting with Nicolas Cage and Jodie Foster in recent films? This movie is slow at times and downright dumb at others."
"theSultanOfSkeen","2","5","10","22 August 2006"," What a trainwreck of a film
","I hardly know where to begin on this one. I almost imagine that it was hip and cool the first couple of times movies were made based on video games; people got together and thought it was going to be awesome. Look at what we've got now, a fairly diverse assortment of video game inspired movies, but can you name one of them that's well done, or did well in the box office? Tomb Raider? Silent Hill fails on so many levels that it's hardly even a horror movie. The pacing of the film, very important for keeping up suspense, is completely skewed; you'll have a ""frightening"" and ""suspeceful"" scene followed by an altogether too long boring scene. Then it'll cut back to more ""scariness"" and, what, we're supposed to jump right back into being scared? The acting, from most of the main characters, is decent at best, but don't expect anything much out of the male lead. The script of Silent Hill reaches a level of worthlessness rarely found outside of an Uwe Boll flick. So a little girl who got immolated by town zealots uses ""hate"" to doing supernatural things? Blind fanaticism is a great counter to evil? Praying to god when you're SOL is fine, but organized religion is bad? Right, I haven't heard that one before. Remember in Resident Evil: Apocalypse, when at the end it was revealed that the Nemesis wasn't the bad guy, but it was the evil corporation that was naughty? Alessa's not bad, she's just misunderstood! And damned if blind faith didn't have a hand in making her that way.<br/><br/>About the only good thing you can say about Silent Hill is that the special effects are excellent... until the next big-budget horror movie comes along, and blows this one away. I give it a 2, because of special effects, and because Laurie Holden is beautiful in leather as the cop who helps Rose out. If you can manage to watch Silent Hill without paying for it (like me, I work at a video rental chain), you'll still want to think long and hard before flushing two hours down the toilet."
"northmarshalljets","3","5","10","29 April 2006"," Hokey
","This is quite possible the hokiest horror film I have ever seen. I mean the nurse zombies gyrating looked like something out of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."" I was excited to see this film because of the trailers and the awesome movie poster. It was however a really big disappointment for me. I think fans of the video game or just video games in general will probably really like the film. The locations used are the same used in all games, the hotel, hospital, church, and school. Also, the abysses that dominate the film, also have a very animated video game quality to them. Ultimately for me, fear is about realism. If I can't believe it, I just can't fear it. And, unfortunately, they didn't sell it to me."
"msperling","10","5","10","22 April 2006"," Simply excellent
","When I first saw the trailer, I thought this movie would be a corny, not so great film. Everyone was pretty hyped up for it- just like they were with ""Stay Alive"" and the ""When a Stranger Calls"" remake. Both of those movies turned out to be absolute crap, with no quality whatsoever.<br/><br/>But Silent Hill surprised me. It can be really skin crawling when it wants to be- and that's pretty much all the time. Almost everyone in the audience was scared to death- just like myself. And I'm no scaredy cat. I'm a huge horror movie fan and have seen what people claim to be scariest.<br/><br/>Silent Hill was also packed with a few twists and turns. It kept you thinking throughout the entire film- it was a very interesting mystery! I sometimes found myself saying in my mind ""I hate this movie"" because it was so terrifying. But, deep down, I was loving it and wanting more! The acting was okay. Radha was a pretty good actress, along with many others. The only actor I'd consider ""bad"" is Sean Bean.<br/><br/>I was able to connect with the heroes of the story and feel what they were feeling.<br/><br/>Overall, Silent Hill is a must see for any horror fan. It's packed with surprises and scary scenes. Very good special effects, too!"
"Jess_m_nunez","9","5","10","22 April 2006"," It was Pretty Good...
","Well I never really got into playing the actual Silent Hill games, but I happen to be an avid fan of horror flicks and I can honestly say that its been a long time since I've wanted to hold somebody's hand while watching one. Not that I jumped out of my seat or anything. I'd say that this movie is more of a creepy-crawly, ""OHMYGODRUN!"" type of film, with just enough scary ummm, we'll call them characters, to have you gripping the edge of your seat. Though it may start slow, I promise you an awesome follow-up. Plus this kind of plot always keeps you guessing. Does it go with the plots in the games? I say who cares! They did a good job and who knows? Maybe there will be a sequel in a few years. To all you fellow scary movie freaks out there... do yourself a favor and get this one under your belt!"

","Imagine if you will this situation: David Cronenberg, David Lynch, Dario Argento and Clive Barker all come together and do some bizarre sperm meld, they then fertilise with the egg of scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis and 9 months on a child is born. That child is brought up by a satanic cult. In then goes to film college and studies Russian expressionist cinema of the l940's and also Japanese and Italian horror. Then said child finds one of the dark lords home movies from the bowels of hell, he then brings it back to the surface and it disintegrates. Said child, now a young man had watched it while in the underworld though and decides to shoot his own version based of what he had seen. And there you have it Mr Christophe Gans born of fire and brimstone has re-created one of Satan's home movies, or at least that's what this film feels like. So critics naturally will hate this film because it's kind of warped and out there, and of course with the video game tag, they'd have made their mind up before even watching it. What many will fail to realise is that the Silent Hill games have a complex mythology, and some depth, it's not as Roger Ebert probably believes, something that the intellectually challenged will do, involving mindless hammering of buttons and blowing things up. Games have become quite intricate now, with some very filmic. Silent Hill was always a very filmic game and as such fans will appreciate this the most, while horror fans too will love the downright warped gruesomeness of this film. I'm not a big gamer and never really played SH much, but it's one I wanted to.<br/><br/>In some ways the fact that critics will generally hate this, makes it better for the genre fans the film is aiming for, because it means it's gone all out and hasn't held back. True to Gans' word he's made the film look just like the game and this film has an incredible attention to detail. The world of Silent hill has three dimensions, the real, the ghostly quiet covered in sooty fog, and the hellish version overcome by rank and rust and inhabited by evil creatures. It's at the start of the film that leads us into this strange world. Rose Da Silva's adopted daughter Sharon is ill, and suffers episodes of sleepwalking. The film open's with parental horror 101, with Rose and husband Christopher desperately searching in the darkness of their back yard for their daughter. Eventually she is found standing on a cliff edge about to jump, but is saved just in time. The young girl was adopted from an orphanage just outside of Silent Hill, and dreams of this place regularly, feeling inexorably drawn to it. Rose against her hubby's wishes takes Sharon for a kind of therapeutic walkabout. That's when the fun starts and when Gan's summons his memory of Satan's home movie.<br/><br/>While some critics have labelled the films plot nonsensical it's all pretty clear, in fact the few fuddys who had seen it before I went to view it myself have over-hyped the convolution and in the end I was expecting some Lynchian level of wha!? But no where close. Although there is plenty of Lynch coursing through this film, but mainly Cronenberg and Argento. If coming out the cinema feeling as if you've watched something you shouldn't have morally, and feeling like your eyes and ears have been abused by evil, then your gonna love this film. It seems some people went into this film intent not to listen, although in agreement the film is too long and some dialogue is whiffy.<br/><br/>Gans first and foremost does a great job. The film looks stunning. It's crisply shot and there's all range of tracking, crane, dolly shots that make the film feel fluid. Some of the shots are downright superb. Following the much enjoyed Crying Freeman and Brotherhood of the Wolf, with their beautifully shot antitheses to most mindless Hollywood action films, Gans will feel the critical burn for the first time with his first two films on the most part receiving positive reviews. However I think on this occasion the fans vote will be what matters. Similarly Dan Laustsen once again combines with Gan's to make something gorgeous but similarly disturbing and creepy. While the music comes from Akira Yamoaka who did it for the games. The music works superbly in this film and doesn't feel like a generic and boring horror score.<br/><br/>The cast are decent. Radha Mitchell is good as Rose, desperately searching for her daughter and she gives the movie a bit of heart. Elsewhere Laurie Holden is excellent as tough female cop Cybill. Also good support is added by a demented Alice Krige, and Kim Coates. Out of place somewhat is Sean Bean as Christopher. His character was certainly needed but still felt tacked in. The initial script didn't have him in and he was added at the studio's behest. Trouble is what could have been a 90 minute film is now a two hour film because of this, and while we needed that extra dimension and there were some interesting moments (such as Rose and Chris occupying the area in different dimensions and not seeing each other). Bean too gives his worst performance which is a shame cause he's always so reliable, but his American accent more than grates.<br/><br/>Overall though this is one of those films you need a bath and a prayer after watching. It's unique, but mostly won't be appreciated for being so, and it's plain creepy. My brother wants the much touted Nightmare on Elm Street remake to be done by Gans as he has done this film, with such a big scope and so damn out there and it would be great to see, rather than doing a plain old slasher re-make not nearly as good. ***1/2"

","I find it interesting that a lot of people say the dialog is ""corny"". Those people, and I do not mean this in an angry way, need to play the game before saying such things. The dialog is exactly how the dialog in the games is, questions from a apparent rational character such as, ""are you alright?"" with irrational responses, that never really get to answering the question being asked, leaving the questioner in the dark. This movie was done very well, and wasn't made to be a typical ""horror film"". It conveys several messages of religion, and good and evil, taken from each one of the current four Silent Hill video games. All respect to the Horror movie buffs, but this movie wasn't made for you, it was made for the fans of the game. Value does exist in watching this movie, when you never played any of the games, however, only the ones who have played it will get the full understanding of how good the movie really is. This movie is very well directed, very well written by Roger Avery, and is a must see/own, when it arrives on DVD."

","I just got back from the theater. The last screening of the movie on opening night...<br/><br/>I must say, right now that this is the best movie i have ever seen. The acting is beautiful, the music sometimes eerie... And the buildings in both realms (Normal and Dark) Were amazingly done. A lot of the special effects, whether it was Pyramid Head walking down the hall, the incredible amounts of beetles, the walls changing.. were well done. A lot of people on the forums and such speak of a scene where a girl gets her clothes and skin torn off by Pyramid Head... That is true, and its in the movie. And the footage of Pyramid Head throwing a dog towards the camera, is actually the woman's skin... (That might have been a spoiler) The only thing i have to nitpick about is a character in the movie says 'Im burning' in a weird voice as they catch fire, an evil character. That made everyone in the theater laugh. Like i said, the acting was done beautifully, the characters act like they should in those kinds of situations. If people think they are going to be let down because this movie is based on a video game, they are wrong. I thought it might be less then i hoped for, but it wasn't, it was the best movie i have ever watched. I recommend it to fans of the game series, to horror fans... To anyone really.

","The simple description of a woman trying to find her daughter, & being faced with a deserted town that turns into a hell, is just that. A simple description. The story within the movie and the game is far more complex.<br/><br/>Silent Hill (SH), being based on the highly successful video game, could have easily gone the route of so many other cheesy video game movies. Resident Evil, Doom, and any crap from Uwe Boll.<br/><br/>But director Christophe Gans went another way with the much more complicated story of SH. He decided to implement a bit more perfection to the script, editing the movie to the very end, removing cheesy lines like the girl saying ""I am the Reaper"" in a deep male voice.<br/><br/>It is obvious that Gans played the game. The surreal look and feel of the game comes through in the movie. Even some of the camera angles are similar, as it swoops over the character in an ominous way. And I can write a page on the attention to detail for the set design.<br/><br/>Using less CGI and more make up and costumes, they got the monsters right too. The evil incarnations from the game come right through on the screen, some ultimately more vicious looking! So will you like the movie? It depends on what you're looking for in a horror. Though fans of gore will love the multitude of the slice, dice and rips that happen in SH, that's not the movie's focus. It's a culmination of a claustrophobia, loneliness, paranoia, inability to determine reality from hallucination, being hunted, and no control over disastrous conditions. It's a formula that works well, and it is leaps and bounds over some similar genre movies.<br/><br/>But it's a more complex story that some may not like, & the ending is ambiguous, though relevant. I invite those that are left scratching their heads by the ending to look into it further.<br/><br/>I also invite you to watch other movies that helped shape the story for the game and movie. Rent Jacob's Ladder, David Lynch's Twin Peaks, perhaps the 1960's Village of the Damned, or read Stephen King's The Mist.<br/><br/>But if you really want to be creeped out, before or after seeing the movie, how about a dose of reality? Research the very real Centralia, PA. Take a look at some images. They will look like they came from the movie. Screen writer for SH Roger Avary researched this American town and implemented some of the occurrences that happened in this town in to the movie. It got so bad that the US postal service revoked it's zip code. Spooky. Sometimes reality is stranger then fiction."

Please stop doing that. Compared to the rest of the movie, the last 30 minutes SUCK royally.

Its really cool to see the darkworld and the monsters in 'real life' appearance... and thats about it. The plot is a mix of the first game and the morality of the 2nd game.<br/><br/>the sirens are stupid horns on top of the 'church'. They sound to alert the churchgoers that the darkness is coming, so they run to the church to protection. Essentially, the same concept as the alarm that sounds on a golfcourse if there's a thunderstorm. Lame. Pyramid Head isn't explained. Dahlia can command him apparently, but its not discussed why. He's vengeance. OK, thats a 2nd game concept. Why is he commandable by Dahlia and also Alessa's vengeance manifested? There was nowhere near enough blood and gore as we were promised. You actually see a total of less than 10 people die. The sound effects, btw were AWESOME but they were trying to distract you from the confusion of ""why is that monster who isn't related to this plot, there?"" I'm sad today. I will buy this on DVD.

","There are many things I dislike about this movie. It's not scary, the characters act like idiots, and most of all, it is nothing like Silent Hill. I'll try to explain what I mean. <br/><br/>First of all, the random changes. I understand changes having to be made to go from one medium to another, I really do. But when the changes are either small enough to make you wonder why they bothered. Changing the little girls name from Cheryl to Sharon for example. Or large enough that it seems stupid. Harry Mason being a woman named Rose with a completely different personality as another example. And it just makes you wonder what they were thinking. <br/><br/>Oh actually we do know why Harry was changed into a woman. They thought searching for your child and going through hell to find them, was a nurturing act and it better suited a woman. It's also the reason they had Sean Bean in his useless scenes that added nothing. Because people said there needed to be a male character with all the women. I WISH I WAS JOKING. So because a father can't care enough about his adopted daughter, they replaced him with a woman. Glad to see sexism is ever present here.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point. The entire movie is seeped with an overwhelming theme of ""motherhood"" that did not exist in the game at all. They even turned the antagonist of the first game, into a sympathetic character to help with this. This of course led them into having to create another antagonist out of nowhere. <br/><br/>So the cult then. There's a lot of cult members. As in you see them. There are a lot of people in this movie. Which rather brings down the feeling of isolation you are supposed to get from Silent Hill. You see cult members in this movie, not just a few of them, you see a church full of them. Silent Hill is not scary when it's filled with people.<br/><br/>Very few things resemble Silent Hill in this movie. There is no symbolism behind the monsters. Pyramid Head shows up for no reason other then he looks cool, I'm sure. The town is abandoned from the start, which only serves to make Rose look like a horrible mother when she decides to take her kid there in the middle of the night. Harry Mason was going on vacation with his kid to the town of Silent Hill. A normal town is implied to be there, you just can't see it. In the movie? Well it was already abandoned. <br/><br/>I could go on. I really could but to put it bluntly. This is a horrible movie. It's nothing like Silent Hill save for a few monsters and even they don't fit in.<br/><br/>If you are a Silent Hill fan, do not watch this movie. Despite the title, it isn't Silent Hill at all."

","I want to keep this short. First of all, I never played the video game. But I can tell this was a video game adaption after the first 30 minutes watching the main character Rose Da Silva running through the scenery (or levels) calling her missing daughter's name all the time. Her actions seem unmotivated (why is she running the car through the fence, at this point of the movie there's no reason for that), and when she gets into the town things are getting worse and worse. Her first encounter with the 'evil' is just ridiculous, as is her acting. And this goes on and on and on... I mean, this is a movie and it should work for people who are not familiar with the video game. All the characters act foolish throughout the whole movie and the dialogs are really, really poor. Even the special effects were boring, because most of them are way too dark and cut in a way that you can't really make out the action. There are some nice ones towards the end of the movie, that's the reason why I rate it with one star. Otherwise I would have rated it with no stars, if there was the chance to do so. This is the worst movie I've seen this year. And it stands in line with such 'masterworks' like 'Nang Nak' or 'Catwoman'. I hate those filmmakers for wasting two hours of my time. My advice: AVOID!"

","this is by far the worst film i have ever seen. i want the last two hours of my life back. this is the only film i have ever commented on bc it was literally that awful. save yourselves while you still can, don't watch this movie, you may feel like killing yourself afterwards. it has no plot, no acting, and continually forces you to ask yourself what the hell you are doing watching it. its not very scary just confusing and when you think it might get better, you are entirely incorrect. I'm seriously wondering if the people involved in the making of this film were trying to make the worst film of all time just for kicks. if so, congrats, you have succeeded. OK so good luck and don't watch this movie, sitting and staring at a wall would truly be a better use of the next 120 minutes of your life."

","Having enjoyed recent video game adaptations such as Resident Evil and Doom, I was looking forward to watching Silent Hill. I have played all the Silent Hill games and thought they were excellent.<br/><br/>I had heard some reviews state that players of the game will recognise parts of the game in the film so, I watched the film, if you can call it a film !<br/><br/>After 40 minutes I wanted to turn it off but thought it would get better, after an hour and a half it hadn't got any better and was still nowhere near the end. (it's about 2 hours long)<br/><br/>The suspense and creepy manner of the game just did not show through at all in the movie. My girlfriend even said that the monsters were about as scary at the Teletubbies !<br/><br/>The film actually came across as though watching someone else play the video game, but with much worse acting than you get in the game.<br/><br/>The only redeeming feature about this film is that Laurie Holden (the Motorcycle Cop) looks well hot in her uniform !"

This movie was more disturbing than the movie, ""The Omen,"" will probably be. It will. I know it. It's more about God and Satan and the Salem Witch trails. People get burned alive and you literally see the skin melting away from their face and you see them on fire. You hear and watch a little child burn and keep on burning. You see the skin literally get ripped off a women and thrown at a door. You see millions of spikes coming and impaling a women and ripping her in half. Many other people too. I have seen a lot of gory movies. This one was the worst. I would rather watch Hostel than this, and that movie looks all gore and torture!

","If you are a fan of the video games, you will find that the movie follows the games pretty closely.

The music and sound effects are perfect for the setting. There are parts that are a little hard to grasp, but the end of the movie explains everything before throwing you for another loop.........but isn't that what it's all about anyway? Trust me, this movie don't just carry the name of the games with a new story......it is the games. There were times it felt like I should have the controller in my hand!

Although there were a few gory scenes to make up for the multiple plot holes, the acting was horrible and overall it was a disappointing waste of money. We really were looking forward to a scary movie, this just bordered on ridiculous. It was more gore than scare. I was upset when it ended only because it was so stupid I wanted it to get better and it didn't.

","As for some of the reviewers, I don't know what they're on or what they watched. The gore content is not high, having about two scenes that are truly to be considered gore. The acting is believable, not being overacted or monotonous. The monsters are very creepy and gave me chills. The atmosphere of the movie is very dark and quite spooky. Any video game fanatics are to be pleased as well, because the storyline is almost identical with a few tweaks here and there. The characters are different, but that's to be expected. I don't want to spoil anything so that people can watch it, but overall I have no complaints and am a huge fan of the film. I wouldn't recommend you to watch it with young children though, it's a bit disturbing."

","I read many reviews saying that this movie was very bad, but I don't know why I can't agree. Silent Hill is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while, although I have not played yet the 1st Silent Hill game(I only played Silent Hill 4. I wish I could play them all!). The acting was surprisingly excellent; every actor and actress played their roles very well and and expressed the characters' emotions strongly and simply superb. The odd, deformed creatures of Silent Hill were portrayed superbly as well; making creepy and disturbing movements and noises(very creepy). And oh yes, there will be blood - lots of it. The soundtrack was great(although they were taken from the games). It's also got a good story. Although the CGI wasn't top-notch, I think I can live with it. I enjoyed this trip to Silent Hill. I highly not recommend anyone to watch this when sleepy. The movie might be too silent that it made you fall to sleep. Close your eyes - if you feel like sleeping when doing so, then you are sleepy. I watched this with my sibling who slept late and nearly slept in the movie.<br/><br/>Enjoy this trip to hell!"
"master_dark4dune","9","3","5","27 March 2007"," Silent Hill
","Silent Hill, another video adaptation is actually the best horror thriller I've seen since The Others. Christopher Gans direction of a cold deserted town and a woman attempting to find her daughter is the most chilling effect, with a musical score that's similar to his last film, Brotherhood of the Wolf, although this score was adapted from the actual game. Performances aren't particularly solid but is forgiven due to the scares and pretty nasty shocks within. Some of the special effects are superb, and there is that sense of another world which you are glad you aren't entering. I'm just glad that it is a stronger film than other films in this genre have been of late, as well as giving hope for other video games that could be taken into consideration."
"Hazzer_99","9","3","5","23 March 2007"," Despite the loss of the male protagonist, it is a brilliant portrayal of one person's depiction of hell.
","The general consensus of the film (clearly evident over IMDb's forums), and indeed my own, was that initially it was disappointing that Hollywood chose to change the protagonist from a father, named Harry Mason, to a mother, Rose Da Silva. But other than that, all the other aspects of the game were pulled off satisfyingly, if not almost perfectly, making it possibly one of the best game-to-movie conversions ever made. Once the initial disappointment over the loss of Harry has settled, there is little else left that will do anything other than leave you with shocked sense of awe over the brilliant portrayal of one person's depiction of hell. Unlike other horror games like, say, Resident Evil, which relies heavily on the character development and an in depth storyline complete with twists, Silent Hill relies on an exquisitely grafted atmosphere throughout the game and film. This was made using breakthroughs in 3D lighting and particle effects (smoke / fog etc.) at the time it was made. This became the game's trademark, and whether on purpose or not, was without doubt the aspect of the game which propelled it to stardom. And it is specifically this aspect that they followed so totally strictly that made the film feel so like the game. That, and the fact that a number of characters, many of the creatures (who could have been lifted straight out of the game itself they were so similar) and of course the slightly confusing story which was told in a more coherent fashion in the movie which allowed many of the fans of the game to see the story in a slightly different light. Of course in a film you don't have to rely on finding scraps of paper and diary entries to piece to together the story, so as they are laid out more linearly as you watch the character's journey unravel you can concentrate on the visuals more than having to get your head around the strange and awesome world that is Silent Hill.<br/><br/>If you just want a quick review of this film, I can tell you that it is your stereotypical good horror in the sense that it has a good story, a start a middle and an end, plenty of soft core gore throughout to remind you what it is that you are watching, and the occasional hardcore scene which will knock you off your seat and keep you on your toes. What it is, however, I can assure you is entirely unique.<br/><br/>The story is coherent, but pretty out there as far as fantasy goes, because it leans further towards fear-of-the-dark type of horror rather than conventional sci-fi horror. By this I mean don't expect an actual explanation of how the horrors that are seen came to be, but rather why.<br/><br/>The acting is all top notch, only slightly spoiled by Sean Bean's awful American accent which slips non-stop. But he doesn't have too much screen time, so don't let that ruin the film for you.<br/><br/>The audio is probably Oscar winning - I don't know and I needn't look it up as I am telling you how I saw it as an audience member, not a critic. But it without doubt plays it's part very well in the atmosphere which will chill you throughout.<br/><br/>Visually it is well filmed, consisting of some actually very nice camera angles and perspectives, but these were hard to catch due to utterly being captured by the film when I watched it. But when I broke my concentration to give the cinematography some of my time, I realised that what I was looking at was actually very visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The effects are perfect. I mean literally at no point do you look and think ""hey, that doesn't look realistic"". I mean, if it's so good that it can't be told apart from the real thing, then in my opinion if that's not perfection then I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the best films I have seen in a long time. I am a fan of the game, so whether that would have swayed my biased opinions in any particular direction I'm not sure, but if you are able to handle shocking visuals then it would be hard not to enjoy this film, at the very least on a leave-the-cinema-in-silence-with-a-heavy-feeling-in-your-stomach level like I, and everybody around me at the showing I saw did. It is a very deep and shocking film with a powerful finale and it will leave you thinking."
"turnturn1225","8","3","5","14 March 2007"," Incredible, overlooked Film
","Obviously, not everyone likes horror movies, they're usually cheesy and involve vulgar language and gore, and are not seen as upon as ""epic"". So the fact that this movie is under-rated is no big surprise to me. People saw it as a horror movie and decided not to like it because of that. The movie's horror is almost a minimum, and has a beautiful display of macabre and mundane colours that makes the world seem scary and chilling. The storyline and plot are so well done that it seems as if it were written by Stephen King. Even if you haven't played the games (which I haven't) the movie reaches out to you and makes you think, few movies do that these days, and the ones that do, are considered epic. If this films audience would just give this movie the time it deserves and pays attention, I could possibly see a sequel some time soon. Turner, over and out."

","Silent Hill is one of those movies that you will either love or hate. I personally loved it, though being somewhat of a fan of the games really doesn't hurt. <br/><br/>The story is told quite well throughout the movie, though at points it can get a bit confusing and you have to make a lot of inferences. Most of it is straight forward and can be easily understood. It focuses around a woman who takes her daughter, Sharon to Silent Hill, as she goes into outbursts and screams that name over and over. She loses Sharon in the town and learns about the towns horrible secrets and how her daughter is connected to them all.<br/><br/>The special effects are very well done, especially when the ""darkness"" comes over the town and the walls are peeling and all the wonderful little creatures come out to play. <br/><br/>This is easily the best video game to movie adaptation made so far, but then again, when a movie is in the same category as Super Mario Bros. The Movie, it really isn't saying much."
"Superunknovvn","5","3","5","27 September 2006"," Unusual, if nothing else
","""Silent Hill"" is a very unusual movie. It doesn't follow a traditional narrative and the reason for this is, of course, that the story is based on a computer game. This is apparent throughout and one of the major flaws of ""Silent Hill"".<br/><br/>Having never played the game - I'd love to but I never got round to buying a PS2 - I was puzzled by a lot of story details. Basically, we just follow a character around as she meets various monsters whose existence is never explained. There's no real tension whatsoever since we don't really know what's going on. The weakest part of ""Silent Hill"" is that in the last third the makers try to literally explain the background in a long flashback scene. That's sloppy film-making right there and it doesn't completely clear things up, either. Some fan summaries and interpretations have finally shed some light on the story for me, but I guess that all in all the main purpose of ""Silent Hill"" - the game and the movie - is not to tell an intriguing story but to creep the viewer/player out. Does the movie succeed at that? Yes and no. It's proved once again that a good storyline is necessary for there to be tension, and tension is necessary for us to be scared. Creepy characters alone don't make a genuinely scary horror movie.<br/><br/>Having said that, ""Silent Hill"" includes some pretty good moments. One involves a person getting her skin ripped off, another barbed wire and a lot of blood. And I've never seen someone burning alive on screen in detail, either. Director Christophe Gans doesn't shy away from gruesome exposition and that's cool, but not enough to make this an exceptionally memorable movie. And although the CGI in the movie isn't half bad, too much of it kills the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Fans of the game will probably love ""Silent Hill"". It definitely is one of the best video game adaptations so far (which is probably not saying too much). Still, as a movie on its own I would hardly recommend this feature to anyone with only a casual interest in the horror genre."
"step2ice","4","3","5","15 August 2006"," Deep plot changes, average acting, morbid dialogues and the missing of the Silent Hill typical psychological horror
","While this is the best VG adaption to date it is a shame that the main Silent Hill plot got changed so much. At the end you're stuck with mostly action scenes and not the subtle horror that was present in the game (often boosted by the strong ambient music). The various creatures which appear in the movie are a mix from the SH1 and SH2 games. Which has the effect of losing their connection to the different game plots from the respective game parts. Another thing what felt flat were the happenings which occurred in Silent Hill the years before. In the game it really has a rich background story and many interesting characters evolve. In the movie this once rich plot gets twisted and simplified way to much. One change is the character of Henry Mason into Rose. In the original game Henry Masons' wife died and he follows the call of his daughter Cheryl to visit Silent Hill. So he has a more desperate background than Rose which still has her ""happy"" family life.<br/><br/>I must admit that I speak as a fan of the original rich plot and the feeling the games are arranging.<br/><br/>To sum it up:<br/><br/>For me the movie couldn't bring over the isolated subtle terror the games were able to. The dialogues are also pretty stupid and morbid. And apart from the always screaming Rose the acting in this movie is just average. Gans has put to much effort in bringing the visuals without bringing the necessary feeling to it. The scenes have more of a music video mood than a actual Silent Hill scene.<br/><br/>Maybe it should have been a low budget project with more feel for the story and characters than Special Effects. If you really want to discover what Silent Hill is all about, play and analyze the games."

"tricky102088","10","3","5","20 July 2006"," Silent Hill at its best
","People complain movies are not faithful to the games and now some say too faithful...i say to them...""shut up"" The movie has the same feeling of the game, you don't feel the character is safe and you just wish they don't go to the town...but then it wouldn't be much of a movie. The story has basically mixed all Silent Hill Games together to one big freaky one, which is good because it made it script worthy. The music is amazing because there is so little of it, like the game, music game on when it was emotional and when you where getting chased by a dead janitor. With the return of some of the games biggest monsters makes the movie even more chilling because you know how the character in the movie feels to get attacked by nurses and stalked by a large demon with a sword longer than it. The acting was always breath-taking, like a few people, i was worried about the little girl in the movie, Jodie Ferland. There was a line near the start which starts with her saying ""mummy"" in a really childish voice, and i was thinking of the annoying stupid kids in other movies and games, but later in the movie when Jodie Ferland is ""the reaper"" the performance is award winning, never has a child looked so evil and actually scared me this much. Also the main actress in the movie Radha Mitchell should win awards for how she expressed her fear, it was not the annoying repeating of the high pitch scream, Radha Mitchell's gasp's and expressions made the movie more terrifying. I was lucky enough to get a ticket the first night it was out in the Scotland and the cinema was full, and you could hear everyone gasping, screaming and jumping out of their seats. Silent hill is so far the best game-to-movie i've ever seen and i hope for a sequel but fear one in case it doesn't live up to this amazing movie."
"jakesnake5555","9","3","5","9 July 2006"," Has a style of its own
","Silent Hill was really hated by critics, and the only conclusion I can come to for that is that they don't realize its style. Sure, Silent Hill is hard to understand, but calling this movie ""incoherent"" or ""stupid"" definitely means you don't catch what it's all about.<br/><br/>To start, this movie is a nightmare. From the part Radha Mitchell's character crashes in the town of Silent Hill until the screen goes black and the credits role, Silent Hill will send you on a terrifying psychological free-fall. There isn't one moment that I didn't feel like I was in another world during this time. It truly feels like an actual nightmare.<br/><br/>Without the art direction in this film, it wouldn't be what it is. Christophe Gans has truly payed attention to capturing a dreamy, surreal look throughout the movie. All of it looks great, and the music just adds more to the nightmare feeling that the movie presents.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that this movie is a first for me. I've never quite seen a good horror movie, but I can tell you that this is one. It seems the producers of this movie decided to take a different approach. Instead of trying to build up suspense and then offer cheap ""jump"" scares, it instead grasps you by the collar of your shirt and leaves you sitting, wide-eyed, squeezing the side of your seat, waiting for something to end. While this movie probably isn't scary enough, it still does a good job of being sick, gory, and disturbing.<br/><br/>The movie does have some bad points that convinced me to take one star off of the perfect rating. There is a side-story of the main character's husband searching for clues as to what happened to her and this can get very distracting. Some of the lines can be quite cheesy. A lot of the back plot (or at least what you need to know for the following scenes after that, excluding the ending) is explained in one big monologue instead of bit-by-bit as would be less painful. Yes. some of this movie has bad points. There. I said it.<br/><br/>But the rest makes up for it. One of the things that caught my attention most in this movie was the religious cult that is trapped in the town. Critics just don't get what these people are about so they just go off and talk in their annoying, pompous voices about how stupid the lines they say are and how confusing it is that they try to explain the movie. THEY ARE F***ING CRAZY. THEY DON'T TRIE TO EXPLAIN THE MOVIE BUT THEY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY THINK IT IS. <br/><br/>This movie didn't make much sense on the first viewing to many people, and they hated it for that, which I believe isn't very fair. You have to pay attention to everything the characters say, to what's happening, to everything, to understand the ending and what the characters don't come right out and explain to you. Like I said, this movie has its own style, and you have to realize that before you go off and say it's stupid.<br/><br/>I heard a reviewer on a different site, I think his name was like Humby or something, say that the monsters in this movie have no point. Here's what I have to say to him: They do to have a point in this movie. You just didn't look at the movie enough before you said it was horrible."
"voidrunner-1","10","3","5","20 June 2006"," Excellent for a movie based on a game, good for a horror
","It is definitely the best movie of those based upon a game up to date. And it is a good horror even if you ignore its roots. In my honest opinion, it is as close to the Mulholand Drive fame as Christophe Gans can get, and probably the closest any living director can, nowadays, so it is worth your time. The design is totally awesome (though most of it is borrowed from the original game), Silent Hill is worth a look just for the mere sight of those barren, picturesque ash-covered landscapes of a dead town. The story is better than average, somewhat lacking compared to the second and third of the games, but sill a solid one, exceeding those of most modern horror movies and the last of the parent game series. Recommended for those of you who have a good taste for tense, depressive and extraordinarily stylish horror movies. What else can be said (without spoiling)? Watch Silent Hill and have a great (or maybe horrible in the good meaning of the word, you know...) time"

","This movie was beautifully done. Enough said. I would tell you exactly why I loved it so much, but I feel that you can just read every other rating and find out for yourself. It is definitely worth your time and money whether you're a fan of the game or not. But one reason why I loved it so much was because of the attention it requires. You can't just go in and sit down, watch stuff get killed, watch people scream and yell, and then leave. If you do that you won't understand anything, which would lead you to believe that it is a bad movie. Just pay attention, watch it, and enjoy it.

"salvu_montalbano","8","3","5","16 May 2006"," remarkable horror movie
","I've never been a friend of horror computer games and probably i will never be. Nevertheless, two years ago I've played one part of the Konami's Silent Hill game series. At that time I've noticed quite soon, that this game will be different than the other ones. It was a different kind of fear I felt when playing it. It was not because the sudden appearance of monstrous creatures, dark atmosphere, weird sounds or any other usual horror elements like these generated the main thrill, well, they also did, but there was something else, something that happens beyond the story: helplessness in an impossible situation, that becomes real.<br/><br/>When I went into the movie theater I was excited, but honestly, I didn't expect too much. I was afraid and almost sure, that the director probably paid a lot of attention to the special effects and to the look of the foggy town Silent Hill itself, just to make sure, that the optical characteristic is good enough for a well made mainstream horror movie. But fortunately I was wrong. The french director Christophe Gans created a movie, that has not a typical story, beginning at point alpha and ending at omega. Of course there's a story, and by the way, it's a good one. But there is much more this movie offers to us. It shows us what happens, when the impossible hits us unexpectedly. The result is paralyzing and unconscious helplessness. In this case ""the impossible"" really means something, that gets ahead our ability of thinking and understanding about what's imaginable. This exactly is happening to the main characters who enter Silent Hill without knowing what's going on there.<br/><br/>I think this movie is absolutely remarkable and special. It doesn't happen very often, that a mainstream horror movie creates such a deep and lasting feeling of uneasiness in such a philosophical way. <br/><br/>When you go home after cinema or you switch off the DVD-player after watching silent hill, don't be surprised when there's an irritating taste left in your mind. That's because this movie is maybe touching your imagination and not just the lust for a scary movie...."
"frances2533","8","3","5","12 May 2006"," it was pretty good-better than some recent horror movies
","It is pretty gory, but the story was pretty good and it did justice to the game that it is based on. The monsters are very freaky looking, just like those in the game. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was very happy, because I'm an avid horror fan, and a lot of the more recent films have been very predictable, and not very scary. I don't believe a horror movie can be truly scary, if its rated PG. Now it could be a psychological thriller, but that's not the same thing, cause it's not monsters and spooky stuff, usually. I recommend this movie, and for anyone who likes horror movies-The Exorcist is my favorite-if you believe in the possibility of possession-it will scare you, and possibly keep you up at night. I also suggest reading the book-because the movie follows the book pretty closely, but it's hard to fit all the little details into a movie, without having it be extremely long. I've read the book three times, and every time I find something I missed the first time. It also keeps me awake-scary stuff."

","I have been waiting forever since I heard that they were making a movie out of one of my favorite game series, and the movie did not let me down! It was simply amazing, well crafted, and startlingly just like the games. They used the enemies, they used the plots, and they even used the music from the series. All in all, this was absolutely one of my favorite movies, and probably the best movie based on a game. I will admit I was thrown off when they chose a female lead, but in the end, I think it worked out well. They did such a good job incorporating the theme from each of the games. The cultists were probably my least favorite, just because it seemed that the actors were not doing their best performances. I think that the two BEST enemies in the movie were Pyramid Head, and the Nurses. Those were so amazing! I would recommend this movie to anyone who has played the games, but if you haven't, then don't bother, because you're just wasting your time."

","I went into this movie with much skepticism. First, I thought most of the good reviews on here were from people who had refused to believe this could be bad cause they loved the game so much. Then, I read the reviews when they first came out and noticed that most people seeing it didn't understand what was going on and the film didn't have an ending. Well I went ahead and took a chance, and boy was I surprised. I enjoyed this movie greatly. I played the game a long while back so I don't remember if it followed it, but it doesn't matter, cause it stands alone as a very good horror movie. What I loved the most was how quickly it got into the story and how it just kept getting better as it went along. Most movies that get off to that fiery start don't hold it throughout, but this one did. Then the camera movements and the general feel of it were brilliant. It really gave me an uneasy tension throughout which has been very hard for a horror movie to do for a long while. The sets are amazing, there are no stupid things just popping out all the time while some guy pounds the keys on a piano for a ""scare"", the horror is putting yourself in the situation and not knowing what to do. As for the ending that everyone keeps saying is incomplete, let's just say that if you truly think about what she just did, you'll know why this happened, and it ends like most horror movies do, with room for a sequel. In closing, it is a good flick, I was pleasantly surprised and I think you should check it out, and maybe you'll enjoy it as much as I did."

You expect to see the elements of your favorite game brought to fruition, in spirit as much as content, and for every one I've went to see, I've come out exhausted, distraught, and a little disappointed. Disappointed that there are Hollywood execs who rip apart a game license to make the film into something it should never have been. How many times will Uwe Boll be given a script that used to be a video game? It's this sort of attitude, that because something is a game, it has no artistic merit to it, therefore we shouldn't put in the time or energy. When I saw Silent Hill, I was clutching my armrests, partly due to the fear and tension in the film, but mostly for the fear I had that Christophe Gans may have been blowing smoke up our dresses when he said he was a fan of the game. I love this game, the way that atmosphere was so well crafted, the music, the fact that you don't expect when something will jump at you. I didn't want it to just be turned into another Resident Evil, which as fun as the first one was, I felt like I was watching a B-Movie. I wanted the true cinematic quality of the game Silent Hill to be represented. But I have to say, what a brilliant piece of artistry and design the film portrayed. I've heard people complain about the length, and I've been told the movie was originally three hours long. I think I still would have rather seen all three hours of Silent Hill then even an hour of Bloodrayne or some other Uwe Boll crap. I felt like there was so much more to see and to feel. I honestly haven't felt this entranced by a film in a long time, so I have to give it to the art production team, and to Christophe Gans and the DP for shooting such a fantastic painting. My only question is, who's going to create a Metal Gear Solid movie? Huh? Another PS classic!"
"Raikoh","8","3","5","29 April 2006"," Silent Hill the video game movie that succeeded
","Before I went to the movie theatre I already planned to see this a year ago. After being so let down by so many video game movies, I was still cautious of not letting my expectations too high.<br/><br/>Now I want to let you know about a few changes first. The changes I knew before hand were that Rose is replacing Harry Mason, and the added husband Christopher, both make up mother and father in this movie. The daughter Cheryle in this movie is named Sharon in here. Dalia is somewhat of a more caring mother. In her place is a religious leader of the cult in Silent Hill named Christabella, she basically takes Dalia's cruel personality from the SH video game.<br/><br/>Like in the game, Sharon is taken to SH by Rose because of Sharon's nightmares of that town. Cybil the cop follows them suspecting the mother of for her odd behavior, and gets her license plate number. This journey was against Christopher's wishes, so he cancels the credit card, and reports the car that Rose drove off with Sharon. Sharon in this case speeds off trying to get away from Cybil, and swerves off the road trying to avoid a girl. Rose wakes up in the car and finds Sharon missing.<br/><br/>The story starts picking up from here, Rose sees oddities from the ashes coming down like snow, the fog blocking out the sun, and the seemingly deserted town. The environment changes quite a few times, which makes the town a dark world and creates monsters within it.<br/><br/>Some of the locations should be familiar with the people who have played the first game. When the environment changes you can actually see the walls rot and turn rusty. All of a sudden the sky turns pitch black. CGI of course had to be used on the environment changes, it was used only when it had to be used, not to make shortcuts. It is much more amazing seeing it in the movie than the game. I was pleasantly surprised they were playing the soundstracks from all the SH's. It just added to the mood of the movie, and the right tracks I would say were played at the right scenes.<br/><br/>The monsters in this movie are from both SH1 and SH2. The first monsters that Rose runs into are the children from SH1. They look very grotesque and scary, also with their high pitches screaming. The monster children go after Rose, attacking her. The most infamous in the SH series is the monster Pyramid Head, he does make an appearance in here, and I thought he was used well and not too much here. And before I saw the movie, I did question why is he in here, he was supposed to be James's tormentor from SH2? But I still liked seeing him in anyways. The monsters all look great, just like they appeared in the game. I didn't notice too much CGI on the monsters, mainly costumes and special effects. Like the environment in the movie, CGI was only used when it had to be.<br/><br/>For Christopher's role in this movie. He tries to get to his wife and daughter, but the police are blocking the road to SH. An FBI agent blocking the road with the cops, goes with Chris look to look through some parts of the town to find his Chris's daughter, but it turns up nothing. Rose and his daughter are nowhere to be found. Chris does some investigating of his own, trying to find out more about his and Rose's daughter who is adopted. This mainly gives us the viewer a little more background of Sharon and the town.<br/><br/>The main character Rose eventually travels along with Cybil who empathizes with Rose's situation and tries everything she can to help her find her daughter. Cybil is very responsible by the book cop. And she is a good person, going beyond her duties. She had a chance to have a real peronsality here, so I like her here better than the game's version.<br/><br/>The cult does play a big part here. It shows a group of them in this movie, and Rose and Cybil meet with them. Their leader Christabella like I said before takes Dalias cruel role. While Dalia in the group loves her daughter, yet tries to keep some loyalty to the group. I thought the cult was used a bit too much. But only really towards the end of the movie, so it's not that bad. They are a big part of making the town cursed and the power it already held to come to life. I'd recommend playing SH 3 to know even more history of the town than the movie explains, or wait possibly for any future SH movies.<br/><br/>So I actually do like some the changes made in this movie, didn't mind some of them at all, and didn't care for a few others. So I'm not going to put in a negatives for that. But on this board their is a lot of contorversy about that. The story was well told, a very oppressive environment, and the monsters really made a lot of intense scenes. The story is a sad one very similar to the game."
"SilentHill001","8","3","5","29 April 2006"," If your a fan of the games then you've got to watch this. Very weird, but interesting and leaves you thinking (like the games)
","As a big fan of the Silent Hill games series I was excited but very dubious about this movie. I was particularly concerned about the transition of Harry (from SH1) into Rose, however the character did work more or less. The movie as a whole stays true to the games although the plot is very different in many ways to all of them. There are elements of the first three games present during the movie, particularly SH1 and SH2. Fans of SH2 will be pleased to see pyramid head brought to life on the big screen. What's great about the movie is the atmosphere, the isolation of the foggy streets of Silent Hill is perfectly created and the transition into the dark realm of Silent Hill is particularly good. The monsters stay largely true to their video game counterparts although I would like to have seen some dog monsters as these feature in every game in the series(from what I can remember). The storyline is very complex (like the games) and may leave many viewers very confused. One girl behind me in the cinema kept saying ""I don't get it!"". However, don't let this put you off. Like the games the storyline is open to your own interpretation. Different people will see different meanings in what is occurring and there isn't really a right or wrong answer. After leaving the cinema I asked my brother what he thought the ending of the movie meant and his answer was very different to my interpretation. I was thinking about the meaning behind various things in the movie for long afterwards. I think this is a good thing because it shows that the movie has got into your subconscious and stayed with you after leaving the cinema (a far cry from your average hack and slash horror film which is forgotten within about 2 minutes). The dialogue can get annoying at times. It seems as if Rose says nothing more than ""Sharon!"" for much of the film as she explores the town looking for her daughter. However there are some longer periods of dialogue which help to put together the pieces of the puzzle. Sean Bean's character's side plot is good at helping to explain a few things, however the character is under used in my opinion. In terms of violence the film gets quite intense in places. In England this movie has a 15 certificate but I have no idea how it didn't get an 18. One scene involving Pyramid Head is fairly gross and Cybil's death scene is very gruesome. There is a very gory and violent scene involving barbed wire (hellraiser style) when Allesa enters the church near to the end of the movie. So this movie is definitely not one for the kiddies. The scares in this movie are not ""jump out of your seat"" type moments but psychological horror that weaves its way into your subconscious. Although this movie is not particularly scary to someone who is used to the games I wouldn't recommend it to someone of a nervous disposition as it can get quite intense particularly in the dark realm. In conclusion, I would like to say that if your a fan of the Silent Hill game series then you should definitely see this movie because you won't be disappointed. If your not a fan and you want to see a horror movie that is much better and more intelligent then any horror movie in the last 10 years then you should also see this movie. If your of a nervous disposition and/or you hate gory death scenes then avoid this movie. And if your just curious and you want an evening out then definitely give this one some thought."
"hazards_r_us","8","3","5","29 April 2006"," This took me by surprise...
","I was highly looking forward to this release having been a fan of the games for years, and yet apprehensive it would go the way of other VG adaptations. I was pleasantly surprised, this film scared me. It doesn't fit exactly with the first game that it's mostly based around, but still leaves some aspects open for interpretation, like the VG. My only gripe with this movie is that it is a little too long, and this might put some people off. My advice would to be to go see this movie, with an open mind that it is slightly disturbed and long, and that you will probably leave the theatre a bit confused.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"danny_valentin_acme","10","3","5","29 April 2006"," Truly the most intelligent horror movie in decades, not to mention the best video game adaptation
","First, a little background about me: I am an avid player of video games, and I feel utterly insulted with the incredible amount of crap Hollywood spews out supposedly based on a best-selling game. Video game adaptations have gone the gamut from decent(Mortal Kombat) to crap(Resident Evil), to utter and complete sh*t that no human being could ever find the least bit marginally watchable(Alone In the Dark, CURSE YOU, Uwe Boll!!). It is truly insulting to see beloved game franchises(some of which actually include incredibly complex and mature story lines ripe for a movie adaptation) and see them slaughtered for a quick buck. I was scared as hell of watching Silent Hill because I love the franchise so much, and I'd be horrified to see one of my favorite franchises receive the Hollywood treatment.<br/><br/>And then Silent Hill broke the mold by not only being the absolute best video game adaptation ever, but being the most intelligent, mature and SCARY horror movie since the 70s-80s golden age of horror.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a completely faithful adaptation to the game. Yes, I said COMPLETELY faithful. Some people might argue that story elements have been changed from the game, and that is true, but Silent Hill has NEVER been about storyline: it's always been about mood, atmosphere, and breaking boundaries. And this movie does all three in spades. Yes, the story is not exactly like the game, but everything that makes the game is here and in perfect harmony.<br/><br/>The horror in Silent Hill is not based on cheap scares or a slasher(although Pyramid Head is a baddie that would make Jason Vorhees crap his pants), but is a more psychological type, the type seen in movies like Jacob's Ladder and Session 9. The movie wonderfully builds a sense of dread and doom that makes you uncomfortable in the extreme. With most horror movies, the scares start and end at the movie theater. Silent hill's horror follows you home and makes you think. It is a study in the most primal forms of fear, and the themes of corruption, betrayal and loss of innocence are pervasive throughout the movie. It is full of symbolism that subconsciously touches a nerve. Even scenes of apparent normalcy give you a sense that something is hideously wrong.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the technical stuff. Silent Hill has the ABSOLUTE BEST SOUNDTRACK EVER in horror movie history. Fans of the games will recognize every song, since they've all been lifted from the games, but the way the were integrated with the different scenes in the movie is perfect. And as cool as the music is, the sound effects also complement it masterfully. This is not surprising at all, considering Akira Yamaoka, one of the game's directors and its sound engineer, worked along with Gans in scoring and writing the movie. I truly hope this movie is a breakout film for Yamaoka and he gets more movie work, he deserves it. As for visuals, the movie delivers in spades. The creatures were almost completely done by trained dancers and stuntmen in makeup, giving the movie a truly primal feeling not present amongst the CG-saturated horror movies in recent memory. Where there IS CG, it is integrated and tremendously well done(when Silent Hill switches from fog to darkness the transformation effects are AMAZING).<br/><br/>The story is very complex, and many people will be left scratching their heads at the ending, but this is a GOOD thing. This movie incites discussion, and promotes people having their own theories on the events in the movie. This is a sign of INTELLIGENT film-making, of not wanting to sacrifice vision in favor of pleasing a larger audience. Watching the movie is great. Watching the movie with friends and discussing it afterwards, listening to each other's opinions and theories, is truly an awesome experience.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly great. Rhada Mitchell is awesome, I hope she gets a bazillion offers after this movie. She is a sympathetic and strong protagonist, and you really live every moment in the movie with her. Laurie Holden is also great, and she's a great counterpart and companion to Mitchell. Jodelle Ferland is a REVELATION. Not since Dakota Fanning have I seen a child actor in such a difficult role, and she delivers immensely. Sean Bean, while having a secondary role, is his always excellent self. The rest of the cast is uniformly great as well, with Alice Krige being deliciously villainous as Christabella and Kim Coates playing a surprisingly great role as a policeman who ignores Silent Hill's supernatural evil, but deep down knows there's something seriously wrong with the town.<br/><br/>Look, bottom line is that this is the best movie of the year so far(I liked it more than my former candidate, V For Vendetta), and any fan of the truly great horror classics owes it to him/herself to see it, not to mention any fan of the games. This movie receives my highest recommendation."
"dragonfiregames","10","3","5","29 April 2006"," Great as movie and as game adaption.
","This movie is by far one of the better game to film adaptions i have seen. While there were no defining ""scary"" parts, there were parts that made you say ""wicked"". People who tell you not to go see it due to lack of ""horror"", don't listen to them. The movie isn't supposed to be your normal horror. It is more(and was intended to be) a thriller. The acting was fairly good and did not take away from the movie. The people who are telling you not to watch it due to the ending. Don't listen to them either. The ending was done with some tact to possibly bring in some more elements from the games for later movies. And to the people who say they killed the plot, They were'nt trying to get the plot dead on. Even Konami and the writers for the games loved it and didn't cut any of it. Over all i give it a 10 due to the actual use of a plot...and they did an awesome interpretation of Triangle Head(The real name, from literal Japanese translation. don't email me about this, you will lose.)"
"Good_Bad_And_DeadDude","10","3","5","29 April 2006"," Definitely see this!
","I have always loved movies and video games, so when they started making movies based on video games, I thought that I was going to really love them. Instead, most of these films were so pathetic, they should never have released them in the theaters. Until now, the first Resident Evil movie and the first Mortal Kombat movie were the only two of the bunch that have been good, but even they weren't so great that I wanted to write a comment about them.<br/><br/>But now, Silent Hill was so great that I had to write a comment about it. From the minute this movie starts, your jaw will just about drop in just about every scene because the plot takes many interesting turns as the monsters keep coming and the blood keeps spilling. There are so many elements in this film that come directly from the game that at times it's almost impossible to distinguish movie from game. But at the same time, there's enough that's different so you definitely know you're watching the movie and not playing the game. What's even better is that you can actually watch this movie without ever having played the game, but after watching this, you'll be at home playing the game for sure! If you are unsure about whether to see this movie or not, you need to see this if for any other reasons than the following...<br/><br/>1) Good-intentioned Christians turn out to be the bad guys because they kill an innocent child; this actually pleasantly surprised me because most films try to shy away from religion altogether but this one dove right in!<br/><br/>2) This wicked-looking guy with a metal mask grabs a girl and rips her clothes off and then rips her skin clean off and lots of blood spews everywhere; this scene may stay with you the rest of your days!<br/><br/>3) The girl spirit gets her revenge in such a way that you will never want to be around barbed wire again; in fact, you may never want to see barbed wire again, for that matter...<br/><br/>4) The ending will disturb you because the mother finds her daughter and they make it home, but they are still stuck in another dimension and her husband still can't find her; bittersweet but it all makes sense if you've played the game."
"koolartur","10","3","5","28 April 2006"," An excellent adaption of the legendary video game
","Looking back at the history of movies based on video games, i never thought to see an adaption i would really like. If you think about titles like ""Street Fighter"",""Alone In The Dark"" or ""Bloodrayne"", you're right when judging them to be the worst movies ever made.But Silent Hill is different.Keeping it straight to the Video game, Christophe Gans did a hell of a job and created a very good horror-film. No stupid *non stop blasting away everything that moves* or *hey all my friends were killed by a monster but i'm still looking after every strange sounds coming out of the scary room*-standard-movie-s**t, but an atmospheric, intelligent and unpredictable (well, for those, who didn't play the game of course) piece of work. Even those, who know about the story of the video game, will have their fun because of the tons of details, like the characters and creatures, locations and even camera-angles, that appeared in the game.<br/><br/>I can really recommend this film to anybody, who likes to see good movies.Don't expect an Oscar-nominee,but you can surely give it a try. Thanks to Mr. Gans for not making it an Uwe-Boll-disaster, but a great VG-adaption.Go for Metal Gear!!! ; )<br/><br/>Peace!"
"Prugaroes","10","3","5","27 April 2006"," This is the best movie game crossover I have ever seen and a powerful horror
","I went to see Silent Hill with my friends recently expecting to see another repetitive horror movie but was pleasantly surprised at how much better Silent Hill was. I am a big game person to and when I went to go see Resident Evil in theatres I lost all hope for game-movie crossovers, they had incorporated some of the character's form the game and book but with the wrong roles and had put it together. Silent Hill on the other hand incorporated the characters from the first 2 games and modified the storyline to make it even better then the games. All in all if you enjoy action horror's and you just want a good scare I recommend Silent Hill to you, I personally think it is one of the best horrors I've seen."
"lilmonkey6690","10","3","5","27 April 2006"," Silent Hill The Movie: Great Movie
","Silent Hill The Movie, was excellent to me, but i think if people haven't played any of the silent hill games, especially silent hill 1, they will get confused and think that it was stupid. It had the same monsters as the game, the soundtrack from silent hill 1,2,and 3. The only thing I didn't like about it: they used different characters in the movie. The movie was based on silent hill 1, but silent hill 1 had Henry Townshead in it, this time it was Rose. Cybill Bennit was the same as the game, but that was the only character they kept. All in general it was a great movie and I'm so glad it was #1 in box office, and so big in Japan. I hope and wish they make more silent hill movies that follow the game, i would love it and so would a lot of people who like'd this movie!!!"
"tolstoy26","10","3","5","27 April 2006"," Wow
","First off, I don't really like movies. I'm a huge nerd who reads literature, especially Dostoyevsky and stuff like that. That said, this movie was amazing. I don't think the fact that I haven't been to a movie in the theaters in about 3 years had anything to do with the fact that I enjoyed and was horrified by this movie so much, but I guess the reader should take that into account while reading this review.<br/><br/>OK back to Silent Hill. My God, this movie was scary/exciting. I'm a pretty big video game fan, and this movie ""played"" just like a video game-not necessarily the Silent Hill games, but just a really fun, scary game in that genre. The movie really kicks in about 45(?) minutes in, and when it gets going, it dosen't really stop, except for brief bits to let your catch your breath and relax your death grip on the seat/friend sitting next to you/stranger. The creatures are absolutely amazing; I hope it's not too much of a spoiler to say that there's a thing running around with a HUGE knife (reminiscent of Knightmare's sword from Soul Caliber...) that just freaking rules.<br/><br/>The movie is not bound or weighed down by a heavy plot- note that I didn't say the movie had no plot, or had a bad one, but that the creators achieved an excellent balance of Horror/Action with well developed characters that seem to learn and grow based upon the plot line. It's a bit confusing at times, and never 100% clear, but I felt it was done appropriately and didn't serve to simply obfuscate or cover bad writing.<br/><br/>Back to the action. There are several absolutely horrifying scenes that had me staring at the screen wondering how this movie got an R rating. I may have seen more gore last night that I did my entire life. I literally left the movie theatre afraid, and I'm not a pansy in any way. If you like what video games have been trying to do over the last few years in the Horror genre.. think ""Its Blood!... I hope it's not Barry's Blood..."" but less B-movieish, you should see it. Just make sure you don't eat too much before hand."

","As a fan of the Silent Hill game series I was very impressed with the movie. The environment of the Silent Hill games has always felt like the main character and I was most anxious to see if the movie would be able to replicate the eeriness of the Silent Hill landscape; I thought it did an excellent job.<br/><br/>The monsters were appropriately disturbing and grotesque, and most were rendered by actors, costuming and makeup, which is a nice touch since I am quickly becoming bored with CGI.<br/><br/>My daughters and I are looking forward to seeing Silent Hill again very soon."

If I could try to compare it to something in life that is similar..... the concentration camps of the Jews during WWII. starvation, hopelessness, disease, all of your friends look like skeletons with skin so tight, you can see the white of the bone, all types of unspeakable acts, having to sleep with your dead brethren because that is reality you live in, being exploited beyond all reason, used and abused, raped,murdered, cut open alive, burned alive, dismembered, the list goes on and on and on and on and on. If you absorb the suffering of the Jews with all their pains both mentally and physically and spiritually, but even still you cannot, then maybe Silent Hill will show you what hate, yes hate, and ""a darkness that can be felt"" is. Silent Hill is more than something you can understand on a 2-D screen. It has to be felt..."
"pixiechic-2","9","3","5","24 April 2006"," There was a horror in the theatre, and it wasn't the movie!
","I would like to start by saying that I really enjoyed Silent Hill. I am a huge fan of the games and I thought that the movie plot followed as close as it could for ""Hollywood"" standards. Let's face it, we all know that a movie can only go so far in this reality. I believe the director did a great job putting the movie together with parts of the game(better than anything attempted in the past), and it most closely resembled the first one in my opinion. I will need to go back and watch it again though because a)the plot had some big holes in it, and b) There was a horror in the theatre that night, and it wasn't in the movie. Let me just say I will probably never go to the movies on opening night ever again, unless I know I am gonna die the next day and even then I might not go. The audience was horrible.For example, Rose was just walking along and if she would misplace her foot, or when Cybil would curse the whole audience would start laughing! What the H*ll is wrong with people when they are laughing at a movie which isn't supposed to be a comedy! People were making so much noise I couldn't even hear the movie(now that's bad)most of the audience was scratching their heads and saying ""huh?"" the whole time which leads me to believe they didn't even know there was a game prior to the movie. I started cursing under my breath that they would all be visited by horrible nightmares when they went to sleep. I think there was one other gamer there besides my husband and I, and we were lucky enough to all sit together, trapped in an inferno of stupidity by the neanderthals around us, like the little group of gamers that we were. The movie was intense enough though, that by the time Anna got her skin ripped off everyone was ""silent"" heh heh (sorry for the pun, couldn't help it). So in all the movie was good, the audience was bad, and I know that most of those people were either drunk or without a brain stem, and if any of you brainstemless idiots are reading this I don't care, because you ruined a great theater experience for me and I hope you did have lots of nightmares. Everyone else who had this problem, I completely sympathize with you. Enjoy watching it a second time."
"nicholas_seabra","10","3","5","24 April 2006"," Terribly Underrated, Unsettling Horror Feature
","Everyone's talking about ""Silent Hill"" not making any sense; maybe they haven't realized that is exactly the intention of the movie makers! Frankly, is it so hard not to appreciate a film which makes you actually think about it? And just for the record, it does make sense if you're willing to take a good, hard and long look at the clues one's given during the movie. Admittedly, they are few; but it's still possible! So think about it, or maybe even go watch it again.<br/><br/>Now, in what regards the game to movie aspect, this is as good as it gets. Not only is the subject matter terribly unsettling (a town that shifts into different dimensions and hosts horrible monsters), but its execution is top-notch (and I mean not only in the video-game adaptation department but also in the film department). It's probably the best game adaptation ever, because obviously Gans knows what he's doing. Another good thing is that he actually admires and respects the games, which are, in themselves, works of art.<br/><br/>So let's break it down: Cinematography: brilliant. And I mean awe-inspiring. With it go the FX and set-design, which are all totally perfect. This is, without a doubt, one of the most visually stimulating films in the past years (take, for example, the first time the town shifts into an alternate dimension). Music: very good. It creates a truly unique atmosphere, completely faithful and reminiscent of the games. Acting: well, here, it could be better. The leads and supporting actors (actresses, more like it. The film has almost a solely feminine cast) all perform well, but sometimes the dialog was a bit cheesy. Anyway, it's not bad, but just could be a little better.<br/><br/>Anyway, after all this, Silent Hill left me pretty shaken up. It's a very emotional film; one can say ""darkly beautiful"". I suggest seeing it and, more importantly, thinking about it. <br/><br/>Just be wary of the gore, because this movie deserves the R rating it has. 9/10"

","This movie was by far one of the best movies in the horror genre to come out this year. From the time it gets going to the end it is a non-stop thrill ride. In many parts of this film there are some disturbing and bothering images and scenes. I'm not bothered by many movies either, being a fan of House of A 1000 Corpses and Devil Rejects(movies known for there grotesque, and morbid scenes of death). This movie is not an exact copy of any of the games. It is only a mere prequel to the game with small elements from the games. The most disturbing scene in the whole movie was when an old janitor who was rapped up in barbed wire comes alive and begins to chase after Radha Mitchell. The second most disturbing scene is when the Demon of Silent Hill comes up at the end of the movie to reap its revenge, and it decides to cut everyone who was bad into small mince meat pieces. One of the strands of barb wire decide to venture up a ladies dress. Goes into her body via the sexual reproductive organ, and then rips her in half. This movie is a little bit gory in the end, wait I'm not giving any credit here, it is a hell of a lot gory. Christopher Gans (the director) did a good job transferring this game to movie, a never before in the realm of game adaptations. Resident Evil 1&2 sucked so there's not much in competition in this arena."

","Silent Hill is the first movie in a long time to top my ""favorite horror movies of all time"" list. However I wouldn't say that Silent Hill is a horror, or a thriller, or a mystery...Silent Hill in itself is a nightmare. And when you wake up from that nightmare, you can't help but smile and drag a few friends in.<br/><br/>Silent Hill begins with Rose's daughter, Sharon, taking her ""little walk"" as she chants something about Silent Hill. It more or less runs much like the trailer for a good period of time, only more quiet periods in between the ""darkness"" scenes. Don't let this discourage you from seeing it though - the trailer is just the icing on the cake. The mixed emotions you might have felt while seeing the trailer for the first time will multiply ten-fold while seeing the actual movie. Thats the part that keeps you hooked.<br/><br/>Even for those who don't like horror, grab a few friends and dive right in."
"Chr-24","10","3","5","21 April 2006"," Brilliant Adaptation
","Possibly the greatest game to movie adaptation. Despite the confusion and negativity of other reviews, this movie was not made for the common viewing, in other words, if you didn't play the games you will have a hard time trying to grasp the concepts of the elements and the meaning behind the endings. Monster effects were perfect, though a little random at times but that can be easily forgiven. The depiction of the shifting of dimensions was simply awesome. The acting was fairly good, despite some of the cheesy lines thrown in, which are very few. Scary, in a sense, not like the games but its still there. All and all, good story line. The adaptation of the first game with elements combined from the second creates a perfect mix. It met my expectations as a GAMER and fan of the series. Kudos on basing it off Centralia, PA!"

","If you love Silent Hill then you have to see this movie. I went into the theater with high hopes and I was not disappointed. This is the best video game turned movie ever. It has the essence of the game without a doubt. I really wanted this movie to keep going much longer than it did and I definitely plan on going back a second time. If a true Silent Hill fan doesn't go see this movie they will be cheating themselves and regretting it later. I know a lot of people will find problems with this movie, but whatever wasn't in this movie will be in a sequel. This is the first movie after all and whatever you may think of this one, it is much better than Resident Evil 1 & 2."

","I just got back from the Silent Hill movie. I'm an AVID fan of the game series. If you like the games, and are worried about whether or not you will like the movie, GO AND SEE IT.<br/><br/>The problems with the movie, as I see it, are: 1) There are a couple of scenes where the acting/dialog is not that great. 2) They take a couple of liberties with some of the characters from SH1 that I don't appreciate. 3) If you are a FREAK for the game series, there are a few plot inconsistencies.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie is basically perfect. Silent Hill is a game you play for the mood, environment, and TERROR. The movie delivers fairly well on all 3 points. If you like the Silent Hill series, this movie is a great companion to the games.<br/><br/>If you HAVEN'T played the Silent Hill series, the movie may or may not be for you. I dragged along a friend who hasn't played or watch a single minute of the games, but he enjoyed it fine. The plot of the movie, though, is probably a little bit beyond the typical horror crowd.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: True to the game, and fun to watch. The failings of the movie are basically the same failings of the games. (""Radio... what's going on with that radio..."") The Silent Hill games have their own scenes of bad acting/writing and their own inconsistencies between games. I'm hoping to see it again in theaters before I buy the DVD."

","OK, let's begin. This movie is the worst I have seen in a long, long time. I'm a fan of the games and of the horror genre, so despite awful looking visual effects in the preview, I thought I would give this movie the benefit of the doubt and drop $10 to go and see it - I should have followed my doubts. The script is bad, the visual effects are poor and overly ambitious, and the story goes absolutely nowhere. I can't help but think this movie could have been executed so much better, if they had just simplified everything and made a raw horror movie.<br/><br/>The fact that the studio didn't allow critic screenings before release, leads me to think that they knew they had a piece of s**t on there hands. The good reviews on IMDb stink of studio plants (not the first on the site), so ignore at all costs. Please trust me, I'm a true video game/horror fan.

"ego-tripping","1","7","17","22 April 2006"," Terrible
","I'm not going to try to be witty or use more words than necessary in my review of Silent Hill, because I simply don't feel it deserves more than the bare minimum, as that's all it gave. However, I will say I was never a fan of the game.<br/><br/>The acting is terrible. The best performance was given by a ten-year old, and I would only go as far as to call it below mediocre. (""Tell me! Where do I find the demon?"") <br/><br/>It's also far too long. 2 hours plus is ridiculous given that it's a horror movie.<br/><br/>What little CGI the movie had blew. Many parts looked far beyond fake, which brings me to my next point. It was not scary. Not in the slightest. Every time the movie gears you up, it only lets you down.<br/><br/>The plot makes little sense. (Again, I state that I personally am not a fan of the game, and know little of the Silent Hill storyline.) The pacing of the movie was also off. Too much time was spent on boring, barely important parts. On the flip-side of the coin, if you blink at the wrong time in parts, you'll miss crucial plot information.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie. Don't ever rent this movie. If you're slightly interested in the movie save yourself $10 and 2 hours by gouging your face with a screwdriver."
"sdignan","1","7","17","21 April 2006"," I went into this movie with low expectations...
","...and somehow, the movie completely shattered those low expectations -- that is to say, this movie was so amazingly bad that my limited vocabulary really can do little to explain just how bad it was.<br/><br/>But let me step back for a moment and explain myself. The original Silent Hill is one of my favorite games of all time, and went I heard that there would be a Silent Hill movie and finally saw the trailer, I was cautiously optimistic. Sure, some of the CGI looked a little cheesy and the acting didn't look particularly great, but really, it looked a lot better than a lot of the other video game-to-movie adaptations I'd seen in the past.<br/><br/>And then I actually went to see the movie.<br/><br/>You know, despite some awful acting at the beginning, I felt that the first ten minutes of Rose's stay in Silent Hill were portrayed fairly well. The visuals were rich and eerie, the use of CGI was spare, and the soundtrack complemented the atmosphere very well. However, shortly thereafter, the film begins to get worse. And worse. And worse. You eventually realize that every moment of the movie after the first half hour is progressively worse, so that you're essentially seeing the worst part of the movie yet, over and over and over again.<br/><br/>The plot is virtually nonexistent until about 2/3rds of the way into the movie when the film delves into an unnecessary, detailed ten-minute diatribe about who Alessa Gillespie is and why the town of Silent Hill is cursed, and so on. At this point, the plot becomes completely convoluted and worse, pedantic. This isn't high art or poetic at all. It's trite, and in the worst way possible -- the film's progression into a reflection on the pitfalls of dogmatism is hardly insightful, but rather, predictable.<br/><br/>Worse still is Sean Bean's character -- it's painfully obvious that his presence was merely tacked on after the completion of the rest of the film, as it is hardly integrated into the fabric of the plot well, and plays into a horribly clumsy conclusion to the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I am extremely disappointed, and if I had not yet found inner peace through the consumption of alcohol, I'd probably be pretty angry that the name of Akira Yamaoka had to be tacked onto this turd -- though I was initially pleased to hear he would be doing the soundtrack, as I love his work, it's painful to see it attached to such awful film-making."

Fair enough its based on a computer game, but why cant the ridiculous looking cgi monsters be left in the game, they're hilarious to look at, which I'm sure the creators of this ''horror''didnt intend on. The story had some potential but has far too many holes in it. We are led to believe that the mother and daughter die in the movie but when???The mother asks why she is being arrested by the cop but fails to remember that she sped away earlier and drove through a gate!

The special effects were outstanding. I was tense and on the edge of my seat/covering my eyes throughout the entire movie. The problem my husband and I had with the movie is that we walked out not knowing what the storyline was because there were too many sub-plots. We had a basic understanding (both of us are college-educated) but were not able to figure out exactly what was going on.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" reminded me a lot of ""The Grudge"", another movie that was truly scary but a little hard to decipher what exactly was going on.

"BA_Harrison","2","6","14","31 May 2007"," Play the game instead!
","Silent Hill is a big screen adaptation of the very popular and disturbing video game, in which a frantic father, Harry Mason, searches the terrifying titular town in an attempt to find his missing daughter.<br/><br/>In Christophe Gans' movie of the same name, the character of Harry is replaced by Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell), the little girl's adoptive mother, but pretty much everything else remains the same and will be familiar to those who have experienced the game. Silent Hill emulates its source's sinister setting and spooky sound design to perfection, producing bags of eerie ambiance. Unfortunately, it also replicates its extremely confusing plot, and, without the benefit of the direct interaction that game-play allows, the result is extremely boring. It's a bit like watching someone else play the game for two hours solid without once being allowed to take part in any way.<br/><br/>Aided by a tough and sexy cop named Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), Rose desperately wanders the streets and dwellings of Silent Hill looking for her girl, defeating a variety of hideous monsters on the way, and eventually doing battle with a nasty religious cult who were responsible for the death of an innocent girl many years before. Meanwhile, Rose's hubby Christopher (Sean Bean, giving a coma inducing performance) tries to discover the truth behind the town's terrible history.<br/><br/>Whilst rabid fans of the Silent Hill games might possibly find something to enjoy about this tedious cinematic offering, anyone else will most likely be bored witless at the protagonist's endless tramping through mouldy corridors, abandoned buildings and deserted alleys. A couple of scenes deliver some rather nifty and unsettling CGI creations, and even a touch of OTT gore, but it really isn't worth sitting through this dreadful mess for these occasional (and all too brief) 'good bits'."
"mdayer","1","6","14","24 April 2006"," Don't go too see this movie if you are a fan
","Don't GO TO WASTE ANY MANY IN THIS MOVIE IF YOU'RE A FAN!!!!<br/><br/>This is the worst adaptation of a game ever made by the industry. i'd played all the games (i was the first boy in my city who played the game in 1999 because i work at that time in a video game store) In first place the games are a complete movie itself so: why they rewrite the storyline again and bad? Examples:<br/><br/>In the original story of silent hill (the game) the mother of Sheril WAS DEATH! (this is the most basic error of all ever!) <br/><br/>The father of Sheril, Harry Mason, was the one who looks over Sheril. <br/><br/>This is the most important roll and its madness change it! <br/><br/>The first game (the game that contains the story of Sheril). Its very different. Harry don't go thru buildings jumping (this features appeared in SILENT HILL 2 and the character in this game it's not Harry). <br/><br/>The other ugly and very bad thing it's the casting of the characters and the characters itself.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>The mother: (this it's the ghost of the movie so...i don't going to say anything) <br/><br/>The policewoman: She is so Hollywood. her costume are the deja bu of T1000. And its out of place. The personality and the first encounter at the gas station is hilarious (she don't meet any mason or speak whit it before reaching town). <br/><br/>Dalhia Gillespi: This is a poor characterization of Dhalia. The old woman was scary no for the looks of her body, she was scary for the look of his could eyes. BAD BAD BAD!<br/><br/>In the other hand, they don't put attention at the most important characters of the original plot. Example:<br/><br/>Kauffman: This was a good character. A doctor in the hospital of town and drug dealer.<br/><br/>The nurse: It was the most important character. This was a nurse under the supervision of Kauffman Dr. She was working in the hospital in the most dark time in the life of SILENT HILL. The time of Alessa and her rare sickness.<br/><br/>Cut this characters its....BAD BAD BAD!<br/><br/>The monsters....JE JE JE JE JE JE...this is the most hilarious part of all (if that its possible at this point of my comment). They put every monster of the saga in one movie...this is...BAD AND INNESESARY PEOPLE!<br/><br/>After this observations i have one more:<br/><br/>Please, to all film makers in the industry of Hollywood and (now i must include lamentably) UK: DON'T DO MOVIES ABOUT GAMES! Because YOU PEOPLE ARE BAD TO REACH A GOOD LEVEL IN THAT FIELD! For the love of god. The game industry of japan is the non pop thing of the market. They are the independent part of the industry. They don't do things whit bad storyline...they are wood at it. Don't re-write a story, it was perfectly written. I now that you people (hollywood/UK people) needs to feed the bad writers of USA but, PLEASE...don't do this! it's bad! it's ugly! And the last, and most important thing of all: DON'T EVER CHANGE A MALE CHARACTER FOR A FEMALE Character! This is like put a piece of peach in a hamburger. I now that the Feminists of USA/UK push you to do this kind of things, and the marketing groups looks to take over that beautiful 60% of womens that buy every stupid magazine, dildo, and t-shirt of the country. But for the love of Buda... Don't DO THIS KIND OF SILLY AND BEGGINERS THING!!!<br/><br/>PD: In the visual hand, its a good movie. The director don't need to think this part (like all the others) because the game solve all the aspects of this job. The original director of the first game was perfect for this job position. But like i said before: The people of the USA/UK industry must eat and therefore must take this kind of jobs to make that possible.<br/><br/>PD: Sorry for my bad English...i'm a Argentine boy whit no education in the English field :P"

","Silent Hill is the worst video game movie I've ever had the displeasure of seeing in my entire life. Remember Super Mario Brothers? Street Fighter? Anything by Uwe Boll? This is worse. No, not just video game movie, it's the worst movie I've ever seen in general. I'm a Troma fan, I have every episode of Mystery Science Theater, and this movie by far surpasses the worst they could do.<br/><br/>Where should I begin? The biggest problem with this movie is that it's incredibly, painfully, mind-numbingly boring. It is boring beyond boring. Boring beyond what the English language can effectively convey. Imagine the most boring thing you've ever seen or done, double it, then stab yourself in the eye with a pencil. You've now more or less seen Silent Hill.<br/><br/>But isn't there anything good? Yes, there are five good minutes. Of a 127 minute movie. Which means two hours and two minutes of screen time are essentially watching someone play one of the most boring video games in video game history. The scary parts aren't scary, the action parts have no action, the drama isn't dramatic. It's a not just a waste of time, it's a violent waste of time. By the end of the movie you'll be wishing you had the good judgment to merely waste your time in a more conventional, less coma-inducing way.<br/><br/>Silent Hill gave me narcolepsy. Silent Hill may have given me eye cancer. Silent Hill is far too bad to even be on Mystery Science Theater, it makes Manos: The Hands of Fate look like Godfather 2. Death is far too good for Christophe Gans, director of Silent Hill. Killing him would merely be allowing him to escape the horror which he unleashed upon mankind.<br/><br/>What I'm saying here is for the love of god don't see Silent Hill. Even if you're actively trying to cause yourself pain, just shoot yourself in the knee or something, it's more humane. If you hate life there are far less painful ways to end it all. I suggest you even avoid walking past a theater showing Silent Hill since being in the same general area as the movie might cause you to pass out right there on the sidewalk.<br/><br/>I want my two hours back."

There is a very loose plot, one dimensional characters, horrible dialog, and the movie's logic goes nowhere.

In the beginning scenes, they're supposed to act like a family, but I never really got that feeling, I felt like the mother was sterile and cold towards her daughter, it felt too staged. Apparently, the daughter likes to scream ""silent hill"" and the most obvious answer to her mother is to take her to the abandoned ghost town of Silent Hill. That'll cure her up real quick.<br/><br/>At the gas station, there's a policewoman (dressed in uniform that was obviously meant to have sex appeal (tight leather pants, and a blouse with the top button open)) who just happens to check out Rose's SUV for no apparent reason. Rose even walks right by the policewoman without wondering why the policewoman is heading to check out her car. Then in the gas station, her credit card is declined, and I never saw how she actually paid for the gas. Policewoman acts all nosy, Rose just brushes her off and leaves.<br/><br/>Basically, the policewoman, Cybil, is the cause of the whole movie. Nothing would have happened if it wasn't for the cop. The cop apparently decides to pull them over later on the highway, for no reason, and Rose, being of sound and able mind obviously, decides to take off on a high speed chase. She takes the turnoff towards Silent Hill, which is gated, but instead of stopping, she floors it and her daughter starts screaming and she busts through a fence to continue on the road towards Silent Hill. As they get closer to Silent Hill, for some reason, communication devices and radio devices just stop working and emit annoying static (is this in the game? I don't know.) Rose tries to turn off annoying radio, sees child in road, swerves, and crashes. I was thinking in my head ""WOO! End of Movie! Let's go home!""<br/><br/>So after the accident (also the cop has an accident too, wow, coincidence?) we're finally in this strange land called Silent Hill. Looks like snow, nah it's ashes. If it's been ash-ing there for 30 years, I'd assume you would need ashboots to trudge through the ashdrifts. Mother wakes from concussion, finds daughter missing, thus begins the worst part of the movie. Apparently, the daughter runs off? Cuz obviously an abandoned ghost town is safer than a Toyota Sequoia. <br/><br/>Policewoman reappears, tries to regain authority, takes off helmet, and she's a blonde. I seriously thought she was going to be a brunette. I also thought Rose and Cybil were going to have some sort of lesbian escapade too the way they clung to each other. <br/><br/>There were like 5 different types of monsters!? People that were burning? A pyramid head guy, some nasty bugs, the nurses! SighÂ…the nurses. The nurses were all leggy and busty and quite attractive except for the fact that they were covered in nasty white vein-ridden flesh that prohibited movement. (Think of a giant latex covering you) I wasn't sure if the nurses were supposed to be sexy or scary. Pyramid head guy comes and goes and then disappears after he rips the flesh off a hillbilly. Burning people were only in first scene, disappear after ashes. Bugs apparently make up the walls, and never really get close enough to cause any fear (slow ass moving bugs.) Nurses only like light. Rose leaves a flashlight for them to toy with. The movie takes itself seriously. That's the worst part. It also tries to be ""deep"" and ""thought-provoking"" by inserting random bible quotes into the movie like they were product placement. There are the hillbillies who are religious and whatever and burn witches. (I laughed my ass off when the school teacher/spinster/evil bitch said ""burn her! she's a witch!"" I was thinking of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. ) Spinster says ""go find the demon! there's your child!"" So Rose and Cybil the Cop and spinster and a bunch of guys in deep sea diving equipment are in the hospital and open the elevator to hell. Spinster gives back necklace that belonged to rose, sees picture of the kid and suddenly decides she's a witch! Cybil the cop is an idiot and decides to stay back and fight everybody with an empty gun while Rose goes into the elevator. The demon, is a little girl that looks like Rose's adopted daughter. The little girl explains everything. (oh! it's all so clear now??) no. it's not. <br/><br/>Alessa, which was a story on the back burner, was a third degree burn victim (because she was a witch too) and somehow had a baby? Even now I am confused, trying to explain it to you! And her mother is the hag that wanders around the movie looking creepy? So... the baby left on the orphanage is Alessa's daughter who is Rose's daughter? *brain explodes* Whatever, it doesn't matter. <br/><br/>Cybil the cop gets burned (doy another witch) with gory flesh detail. Daughter of Rose about to get burned, but no! Mother bursts into church somewhat like she was stopping a wedding from happening, and says ""STOP!"" *rolls eyes* Pushing way through crowd, attempts to talk sense into the undead, etc.<br/><br/>What follows involves enough barb wire to contain all the cows in the world, and lots of blood. It was more disgusting than scary. It made absolutely no sense. <br/><br/>Last scene will destroy whatever you thought you understood about the stupid movie. Apparently they've been dead since about 5 minutes into the movie. tada. that's it. save your cash."

","I went into this movie with such high hopes. I liked the game, I like horror and suspense, and the gorier the movie the better! I read the bad reviews and brushed them aside (as I am not one to usually agree with the movie critics). All I can say after seeing this movie, is maybe I will pay attention to the critics a little more closely from now on. This movie did not just steal my money, more importantly it stole my time. What a waste of a Saturday afternoon. The movie was confusing, poorly acted, and, overall, just plain god awful. The few good gory scenes did not justify sitting there for two hours. I have never heard so much laughing at a movie. Too bad it wasn't a comedy. There is nothing sadder than an unintentionally funny movie. I left the theater feeling as though I had the very life sucked out of me. This movie is not worth seeing in the theater, buying on DVD, or even watching for free when it comes out on HBO. Run. Run far. Get as far away from this movie as possible, as fast as you can. Do something more productive with your time. And there are better things to do with your money...like throwing it in the trash."
"elliot69","1","5","11","24 April 2006"," Biggest Waste of $8 in my Life! Not to mention the waste of 2 hours of my time...
","This move runs just like a bad video game - lots of violence, minimal plot revelation, minimal dialogue, repeat - the only difference is that you don't even get to help fight the bad guys. Many of the camera angles even resemble video game screens that play while the game is loading (ie. oddball shots from a rooftop, or from the ground). This movie was disgusting, and really had no redeeming qualities, other than its half-witted attempt to say that ""hate is bad, and it creates evil"" - it does little to comment on the dangers of the cult/group think mentality, and substitutes all possibility of quality in favor of gore, gore, and more gore. It really isn't even scary. Don't waste your time with this one."

The script sounded like it was written by a high school D&D nerd who failed English Composition and lacked even the most basic social skills. Absolutely laughable plot. What's with the off-topic ""Plot Outline"" above? Fatal disease? Faith healer? Portal in reality? Why the ""variety of creatures""? Cybil was SENT to bring Rose back? Rose makes a deal with a demon? There wasn't any of that in the crap I just suffered through. Perhaps the writers should have consulted the ""Plot Summary"" for a better script.

"swl182","10","5","11","21 April 2006"," Best Movie Ever
","OK, that may be a little much, but it's hard not to say when it surpassed even my highest expectations. They nailed it, better than any video game based movie has ever done (though there's not a wide range of those). The story doesn't pick up until the second half of the movie... but just enjoy the first half for the mere fact it's introducing you to the most hellish place we've all come to love in the video games, and in time you will be rewarded with a more detailed account of how Silent Hill came to be the way it is, more so then the video games ever described. This was the biggest hope I had for the movie, to explain this. We all saw the trailers about the fire burning the town, but it's much more than just that. It is my opinion though that there will be no later installments, for it wouldn't add anything, you get all you would ever need from this one, it covers everything...to make another would be repetitive...it stands strongest all by itself..."
"interstella5555","10","5","11","21 April 2006"," You'll be scared, but not until after the movie.
","Simply put, I was amazed by this movie. I have never played any of the Silent Hill games, and yet I had exceedingly high expectations for this movie. Every time I saw a bit of news on the movie, every time I saw a TV spot, I would get more and more excited about the movie. And so I saw it opening day. And I was blown away.<br/><br/>First and foremost, don't expect to be jumped. This movie is about suspense and tension, building up for the entire movie. There are a few payoffs to the never-ending suspense, in the form of shocking, unexpected gore. Pyramid Head (in this movie called Red Pyramid), famous from Silent Hill 2, gets to enjoyably rip the skin off a girl. The climax of the movie features people getting ripped apart, exploded, etc.<br/><br/>The previously-mentioned suspense is extremely well-done. My girlfriend, whom I saw it with, was aggravated because her leg hurt after the movie-- I didn't let go until the credits were up. I was dying to see what was going to happen next, and happen next, and next, until the movie was over. Which brings me to the only complaint I have about the movie. You know how I said ""and next, until the movie was over""? Well, one of those nexts WAS the end of the movie. Once you finally realize the main characters (Rose, Sharon) are in a different timeline or something from their husband/dad (Christopher), be it about an hour into the movie and just right then, you need to know how the hell they're going to get back to him, and it ends you needing to know. If this movie doesn't do well enough to warrant a sequel, I will cry myself to sleep for many nights. Many.<br/><br/>The acting, the atmosphere. Amazing. After the movie, I was generally scared. I felt scared. Of anything, everything. I was so used to BOO! American scary movies that I wasn't expecting the kind of scared that this movie brings upon. Nothing really blows into you like OMIGOD AAAH, unless disturbing demon things walking around makes you scream--everything's built up to a kind of scared that you don't realize you have until you're out of the theater.<br/><br/>Look, alright, the movie is good. Go see it. Sorry about my total incoherence, I just list good things about the movie as it comes along. An amazing scary movie, just not the type you expect if you're used to movies like The Hills Have Eyes and House of Wax and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, etc. etc. etc.<br/><br/>10/10"
"CyanideMonkey","10","5","11","21 April 2006"," Desperation and creepiness are the words of the day
","Throughout the development process of this movie I'd often find myself wondering just how they could possibly recreate the atmosphere and desperation that is intrinsic to each silent hill game(save for 4). Even as I stepped foot into the theater I retained the mindset that there is no possible way that this movie could stir such continuous dread from the viewer as the game did from the player. <br/><br/>Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised. Silent Hill, in so many words, is an experience. A 'roller coaster' if you will. Once the movie starts it grabs hold of your heart and squeezes ever so tightly until the end. This is mainly achieved by the fact that IT HAS NO SCARES. Not one. This allows the movie, instead of going from high tension to low tension and back and forth like average American horror, to maintain the tension throughout the movie. You may then ask, however, ""If there's no scares then where is the tension coming from?"" The answer to that is silent hill replaces scares with pure desperation. The main character Rose, who by the way is portrayed amazingly by Mitchell, is faced with insurmountable horrors and odds that just keep piling higher and higher without letting up. There is no safe zone, no sanctuary in numbers, no comedy relief. <br/><br/>I believe that this movie addresses the problem that has been prevalent in American horror. Both the directors and the audience think that pop up scares and musical buildups are a prerequisite to any good horror movie. I have seen this view exasperated by all the reviews that have been coming up about this movie. All complain that there are no scares. The thing is, there are absolutely no scares in the game AT ALL, so in the successful spirit of the game there is none in the movie. The game runs on constant tension and desperation to enthrall the player, not jump scares that last a half a second. <br/><br/>The reason why this movie deserves praise is that it achieves fear and dread in the viewer without resorting to cheap thrills.<br/><br/>The movie is not completely without faults, however. The parts in which the husband is present mainly serve to give the viewer a break from the constant buildup of tension and are wholly in my opinion unnecessary and detract from the immersion of movie. They could have put across the necessary plot points in the confines of silent hill. Another point is the flaws in the plot itself. While still good it lends itself a bit too much to those who are already familiar with the games.<br/><br/>All in all a must see horror movie and hopefully a step forward to end the recent chain of horror movies that rely on the recycled garbage system put forth and used by thousands of cookie cutter movies before it."
"lukem-52760","9","2","3","14 July 2019"," EXTREMELY DARK, DISTURBING & ATMOSPHERIC, A HORROR CULT CLASSIC
","I have never played the ""Silent Hill"" games so i just make my opinion purely on the movie & oh my, this is a fantastic Nightmare world covered in falling ash.
Silent Hill is a Classic of the Horror genre in my opinion!!! It's full of suspense & has a thick,dark,gloomy Atmosphere that i haven't seen done that well since John Carpenter's CLASSIC ""The Fog"" (1980)!!! With ""The Fog"" it was obviously a thick creeping Fog bank rolling through that small coastal town & here it's also thick fog that's engulfed the town as well as thick white/grey falling ash from it's eternal burning from the under ground & it's done visually stunning!!! The town look is really eerie with it's Smokey-misty-fog, like the early morning look in the winter when that cold mist has engulfed everything, superb cinematography.
The ""Dark"" that comes is seriously scary as a black nightmare takes over the old abandoned town & twisted nightmare creatures stumble out of the darkness!!! It's as affective as it sounds on screen & it's here this movie moves into pure Horror territory with it's twisted-gothic set design, it looks scarily Awesome & the creature fx are Amazing!!!
The back story of the little girl is so sad & disturbing & extremely dark, it's a scary well told slow-burner Horror that really lets the Horror unfold & doesn't rush into easy jump scares.
""Silent Hill"" gets under your skin with it's raw bleakness,
I personally think ""Silent Hill"" is a modern Horror masterpiece, it atleast deserves Cult Classic status but personally i think it's more powerful than that & with it's stunningly detailed sets it's TRULY a work of ART within the Horror genre.<br/><br/>We also have an excellent lead in ""Radha Mitchell"" as Rose & she's a great fearless character to follow into this nightmare world of Silent Hill. Radha gives an excellent performance & is completely different from other screaming final girl type women in the Horror genre, here Rose is strong,tough,smart & has bigger balls than most men lol as she searches this evil place full of tortured, demonic creatures whilst looking for her daughter, she's a tough mother.
""Laurie Holden"" is equally excellent in her role as tough & smart no nonsense Cop ""Cybil Bennett"", a great strong performance.<br/><br/>The music score/soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself, full of tension & mood & very atmospheric.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is stunning visually & creepy as hell with some awesome nightmarish monsters roaming around, this makes a great Horror film setting & a unique new Horror world to explore!!!
The sequel ""Silent Hill:Revelation"" is also very good & does expand & explore more into this nightmare world but it doesn't beat this first cult classic.
Forget the other's comparing it to the video game as i haven't ever played a ""Silent Hill"" game & i loved it purely as a Horror movie!!!"
"nogodnomasters","10","2","3","2 June 2019"," GREAT HORROR FILM

"lucabratz","6","2","3","24 February 2018"," A step in the right direction.
","I think it is fair to say that the general consensus is that Video Game movies suck complete and utter ass, so I've skipped out on plenty. That is until I found a Youtube video crediting this film in particular for being not only faithful to the source material which is a great horror game, but also being just a decent film all around. Well I can certainly say that this film is far superior to most of it's caliber.<br/><br/>Allow me to say that this film certainly has plenty of hit or miss qualities as well as straight up double-edged sword qualities. Allow me to explain what I mean by that. First, the story. The narrative is probably the biggest hit or miss I've seen in any film ever. Sometimes the film has great moments because of it's surprisingly great directing, cinematography, and shot composition. However the story just balances out to just ""ok"" the positives at play here are the twisted themes and mystery elements. But the negatives here are the extremely pretentious and sometimes awful writing, certain lines really miss their mark when they try to be either melodramatic or casual. There were plenty of instances when I sat there and said to myself, ""people don't talk like that."" which is very dangerous especially in a film that is based on such a character driven game. So the plot was just, meh.<br/><br/>Visuals- Without a shadow of doubt are the most inconsistent thing in this film, even though it seemed to be the aspect praised the most around the internet. But I can still see where they're coming from. An element that I thought I wasn't going to even give a shit about but turned out to be awesome was the set design and creature design; OH MY GOD, it's too damn fantastic. The town of silent hill almost feels as if the town has it's own character, kind of in the sense that the real antagonist of the film is the town itself. From the ash that coats the streets and air like snow, to the dark noire atmosphere at night and the bleak environments by day. The set design also fares very well, a great sense of scale and realism, almost as if I was watching a completely practical production. Also let me just say how faithful to the source material the monsters look, the nurses and especially everyone's favorite huge boss spooky boi Pyramid Head are both recreated with delicate care and detail. Also watching Pyramid Head mess stuff up is just so satisfying. Now let me rip the other aspect of the visuals a new one, by talking, or in this case complaining about the CG. The CG looks somewhat decent in the final few scenes of the film, don't get me wrong, but I can never be convinced by the shift between day and night silent hill has. When the environment starts to rust I just don't buy it, maybe more detail and money needed to be put to these scenes because these transitions are crucial to how the viewer depicts the town; which as stated earlier has it's own character.<br/><br/>Overall 6/10 is very appropriate, not great, but never throw this film in with the garbage of it's peers."
"alaric87","10","2","3","8 September 2013"," Excellent
","First I should offer a caveat- I never played the video game this film was based on. That said, I thought it was excellent. I have read some of the other reviews, one of which mentioned that certain characters were different from the game. This (since I didn't play the game) wasn't a factor for me.<br/><br/>I have been watching horror movies for as long as I can remember, and only twice before have I been so disturbed and so frightened as I was when I watched ""Silent Hill"". ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Event Horizon"" were my two big scares; I saw them when I was twelve or thirteen and I am not proud to admit, I slept on the floor in my parents' room.<br/><br/>I was twenty when I saw ""Silent Hill"", and in college. I watched it alone in my dorm room and just sat on my bed and shuddered when it was through. The story is excellently written and holds the viewer's attention (mine anyway) better than any arbitrary slasher film ever could. Most important, I think, was the use of live actors wherever possible. I was born in the late 80's, and CGI will never do what a set and a good make-up crew can do.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" took an and fantastic story and made me (a cynic), immerse myself in a chaotic world of gore, creepy atmospheres, revenge, and madness. I was so riveted I was able to forget I was watching a movie.<br/><br/>A+ ""Silent Hill"""
"grahamsp","9","2","3","7 August 2013"," Dark
","Lets start off by stating that I have no idea what the game is like so any comparisons I don't give a crap about. Having enjoyed Dark city I thought I would give this a go and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The film puts you right in to the story line from the first minute so there is no hanging around for half an hour weighing up what is going on. The story line of the child's nightmares is not original granted. The thing that is though is the way the director unfolds the story with two different dimensions with the Father looking for his family and is very cleverly done. <br/><br/>The tension, macabre settings and terrific characters introduced to the story work very well especially Pyramid head. Like where did that idea come from! Sick or what. <br/><br/>The story goes at a great pace and keeps you guessing and I though it was terrific. Only down side why cast Sean Bean in the film with his Yorkshire accent terrible.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed Dark City then this is for you. Never played the game but the film stands up brilliantly on its own."
"mario_c","7","2","3","18 June 2013"," An entertaining and suspenseful dark ride into the lungs of Hell
","Based on a video game with the same title this movie is a good and suspenseful horror flick. The plot, which clearly follows the video game's story, is well built and leads you to a dark and atmospheric setting, the little village of SILENT HILL <br/><br/>From the beginning it has mystery, suspense and a Gothic dark atmosphere that combined create an enjoyable ghost story. Following the game's premise the movie dwells into two parallel realities, the dark sub world that haunts Silent Hill, where the main character ROSE (played by Radha Mitchell) has fallen, and the ""real world"" from where CHRISTOPHER DA SILVA (Da Silva is a Portuguese surname by the way – played by Sean Bean), ROSE's husband, never came out In fact by plot's developments we see they are not in the same dimension <br/><br/>The CGI are good but we can notice the clear inspiration in the game's computer graphics. A good example is the little creepy monsters of the dark world that appear along the movie; they are absolutely inspired the video game! The special effects are nice though <br/><br/>The other issue that is brought by this movie and which is the most important one (on a social perspective) is the religious fanaticism. The entire plot ends being around this topic and I might say I did like its final disclosure (and its message) <br/><br/>All in all I did appreciate SILENT HILL, it's not a movie to take too seriously (it's a video game adaptation!), but if we think about it just as an entertaining and suspenseful dark ride into the lungs of Hell, I guess we have a nice horror flick here!"
"Zachar_Laskewicz","10","2","3","1 April 2013"," SILENT HILL : video game adaptation or unique surreal horror nightmare?
","I had the fortune to see this film before I knew it had anything to do with a video game and even though I went out and played the games and its many spawns, I've formed my opinions on what the film presented rather than what I expected of it. It came across as a surreal Gothic horror masterpiece, particularly beautifully designed and with a strong cast, dominated by the four actresses who play essential roles as the little girl is brought home and the strange religion which keeps the ghost town's inhabitants trapped forever within an 'other world'. In this respect, the film is filled with flaws; there are things that just don't make much sense and if you try to compare them to the video game you won't get any wiser. If, however, you're not restricted by these expectations, these flaws add to set of ambiguities which create a roller-coaster horror ride towards a climax that is well-worth waiting for, and one that's thought provoking and disturbing as well, although you're never quite sure why. In a nutshell, if you don't know the games, Silent Hill is like Mullholand Drive on acid. No one expects Lynch to provide exact answers to experiences which are deliberately ambiguous, dream-like and/or that can communicate simultaneously on different planes. Because this is classed as a horror film and still worse one that lies in the shadow of other horror game film adaptations like the dreadful 'Resident Evil', a set of different parameters are applied. I was lucky; I saw the film knowing none of this and came out feeling stimulated, excited and extremely creative.<br/><br/>The film seems to use as its central premise a very disturbing idea about how an insane sect that seems to be based on hate, sacrifice and death can demonise a child into becoming the prophesied vehicle of utter destruction. Alice Krige is perhaps the highlight of the film; her penchant for playing evil characters receives in this film a stellar expression as Cristabella, the cult's mouthpiece that has kept the village trapped in a kind of eternal purgatory (her death scene torn apart by barbed wire is not to be missed). Deborah Unger, although in a small role, is the film's only real recognition that the whole concept of the film results from Japanese artistry; her character looks like something out of Noh theatre, and her acting style is similarly exaggerated and stylized.<br/><br/>If you don't know anything about what the film's origins are, you're in a position of advantage because you can make your own mind up about what the constant barrage of symbols could mean and what sort of reality the characters become trapped in. In this sense it's both a journey of discovery which quickly sinks into a terrifying nightmare, one which seems to be based on the anger of the little girl who is expected to bear the universe's woes and lead to its destruction. The ambiguous ending - that the character's who have overcome what the film confronts them with, are not able to return to the real world, is both ambiguous and disturbing. Did any of it actually happen at all? Did all the characters who became trapped in Silent Hill die, seeing that they were all involved in pretty nasty car accidents? Do we ultimately exist at all?"
"rockproductions","7","2","3","23 November 2012"," Despite it's Many Faults, A Good Video Game to Big Screen Adaptation!
","OK, yes, ""Silent Hill"" the movie is nowhere as great as the video games, but you know what, they did a pretty damn good job of turning this supremely eeriest of video games, into a pretty good eerie film. No small part due to the fantastic CGI effects, atmospheric cinematography, & what may be the most unnerving soundtrack in horror movies, or I should say, video games, the original ""Silent Hill"" video game music.<br/><br/>But for all this going for the films benefit, the direction was surprisingly weak, especially considering director Christophe Gans amazing effort, ""Brotherhood of the Wolf!"" Even so, a mediocre effort by this superior director is many directors ""A"" game, & the film does have it's surrealistic creepy, ""Hellraiser"" like charms. Other problems include a uninspiring execution of the plot, some weak acting, & an overwrought climax, to much of a good thing makes a mockery of the whole point of the film.

"croutonsofdeath","8","2","3","10 October 2009"," Believe it or not, Silent Hill is a very good movie!
","I love Silent Hill. While ""Homecoming"" and ""0rigins"" aren't that good, I will always love the foggy town and its uncanny ability to latch onto peoples heads and screw their minds 'till their brains come out their ears. Seeing as how most video game adaptations bastardize their respective franchises, or simply shouldn't be adapted at all (Seriously? Was anyone expecting ""Super Mario Bros."" to be a good movie? It's a game about two plumbers jumping on monsters. Just leave it on a game pack.) because the source material just doesn't make sense for a movie. Yet the Silent Hill series and its twisted, dark, plots which were very cinematic in and of themselves, had potential and while the film doesn't use up all that potential, it squeezes some very satisfying droplets of horror and style.<br/><br/>The first thing to praise is the films look. Everything looks perfect, Silent Hill itself looks incredible. Everything from the swirling fog to the eerie, lonely atmosphere is perfect. Even when the film changes to the Otherworld, it looks great. All the monsters are designed well too, the gray children are disturbing and even Pyramid head, despite being here out of fan service, looks great and his updated look is very well done. This is what a Silent Hill film should look like.<br/><br/>The acting, while occasionally cheesy (But then again, look at the acting in the games...) is decent and the story is well told, save for a confusing ending. The film doesn't rely as heavily on psychological horror, but there are still scraps of psychological horror to feed on and a bevy of disturbing scenes worthy of the series. Akira Yamaoka's beautiful yet creepy melodies make the jump to the film, so it sounds great and as always it helps the atmosphere and tone.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect, there is some fan servicing, and I'm not too fond of the fact that they explained the Siren you hear when the worlds change shape. The siren is much creepier and mysterious left unexplained. The film also has some strange pacing, sometimes its moving along fine other times it'll slow down and while you might expect exposition or mood building during these scenes, the scenes where the film loses steam or slows down the most are usually just so someone can do something completely irrelevant. There are also a few stupid scenes. I wanted to smack Cybil for her brilliant comment: ""They used to say this place was haunted. I think they were right."" Is that supposed to be funny? Cause I'm pretty sure it was just stupid. Also the scene where the demon says ""Look Mommy, I'm burning!"" was just downright silly. I also feel that Sean Bean's character is unnecessary, he usually just farts about, chewing scenery and occasionally tripping over some exposition that could've easily been made by another character or found by the main protagonist, Rose. Bean is a great actor, but he has no purpose here and his scenes could've been let on the cutting room floor. The writer should've let all the exposition flow with the main characters, it also baffles because whenever he shows up the atmosphere and tension is instantly burst. Silent Hill is supposed to be a desolate, lonely place. To retain atmosphere, the movie should never leave the town once the characters entered.<br/><br/>Despite that, Silent Hill is a genuinely creepy and well written, well made movie. If the writer can clean up the few problems the film had, I feel that the film sequel can be as monumental as the games sequel. Let us hope and pray Silent Hill 2 stays true to its source material, and provides a great dramatic horror show. For now, Silent Hill is still a very good movie, and a step in the right direction for video game adaptations."

","I've read numerous other reviews talking about how the dialog was bad and they didn't understand the storyline. I decided enough was enough and just decided to see the movie. Now, keep in mind, I have never played any of the Silent Hill games and probably never will; but this is the first good horror movie I've seen in years. Now if you want bad dialog and a milked storyline by all means watch every lame and tiresome installment of the saw, then do the same with hostel. But if you want to be truly scared watch Silent Hill. I've never been scared by any horror movie - ever, until I saw Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Let's face it, gore isn't scary - and Silent Hill doesn't rely on gore to scare. It relies on pure suspense, with a perfect balance of pure weirdness and insanity to complement and increase the scary-level of this movie. It doesn't drag out at all, it gives you enough to gain some knowledge and back story, and to also set up the storyline for this film, and even though the film has no super-famous actors or actresses in it - the acting is phenomenal, and as a whole this movie is fantastic, it gets a 10/10 from me, five stars and all that.<br/><br/>Seriously, just watch it"

","I don't think that a video game has been adapted in such a manner before. It's as if you're watching the video game in front of your eyes. And although I only have played one Silent Hill, I know that they achieved to transport the game on your screen (theatre) literally!! <br/><br/>But that is also the downfall of the movie (imo). It is very compelling in the beginning, but when it reaches a certain point (let's say the middle of the movie), the scares don't work anymore. The effects still remain great, but I'm just not feeling it. As a game that would work, because you're actively involved, but as a passive viewer, you get bored. So the best adaptation yet, shows us that there is more to the adaptation process, than filming a game ..."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","3","19 April 2007"," Like watching somebody else playing the game...
","By definition, any film version of a PC game that sticks as close to the plot of the game as this film appears to do is going to lose the vicarious thrill a player enjoys when playing the game. Watching this film has to be pretty much like sitting next to somebody you don't know while they play the game. The impressive visuals of the ghost town wrapped in a haze of white ash from the fires that have burned beneath it for thirty years can only keep you interested for so long and, once the action goes underground, the interminable succession of shots of plucky mum Radha Mitchell running down dark corridors away from vaguely defined phantoms as she searches for her daughter quickly grows boring. Character development is non-existent  which, again, is OK with a game because you are the hero, but is a death knell to any film  and, as he did in The Dark, Sean Bean once again plays the most pointless of characters. Completely passive, adding nothing to the plot, and serving only to offer an occasional change of scene from the dim alleyways of Silent Hill, he is totally redundant. The guy must really be desperate to crack the US market to accept a role like this. I don't remember Bean and Mitchell, who play husband and wife, sharing a single scene, so you can imagine the chemistry there: Bean could probably pass Mitchell in the street without knowing who she is."

","Great concept, bit hard to follow at times even though I played most of the games. Visually it was great, cool ideas with the creatures. Acting was OK need to do a better casting if they make another. Roger is a great writer but I feel he fell a bit short on this script. But all in all it pushed the boundaries and I enjoyed it. The score for it is GREAT as well, Akira Yamaoka needs to do more Hollywood movies as his music is scary as hell. I loved Gans movie brotherhood of the wolf and loved this as well. Nice to see that people will still make movies that are as bold as this. It may not be your cup of tea but this movie has so many new and cool ideas in it."

","while watching the movie, i could not differentiate whether i was watching cut scene from 'SILENT HILL' the game or the actual movie.the movie has some DOOM3(game) kind of touch to it as well especially when the 'baddies' come in. The movie is based on an absurd idea of ghost town, where the ghosts seem like aliens. The element of suspense in the movie is not well balanced and it is difficult to figure out what is going on exactly. however the location of silent hill is very ghostly and made excellent. I Could not understand the purpose of scene change after every now and then. By scene change i mean that after every now and then, the place changes into a hell and daemons start appearing. <br/><br/>The policewoman is sexy and so are the lady zombies. It would have been better if the lady zombies were naked instead of wearing a sexy skirt and half open blouse revealing their ghostly bosom.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a mixture of Micheal Jackson's video of 'thriller' + DOOM3 (game) + resident evil (game)+ silent hill (game)and is just a time-pass, not worth recommending to some one."

"sculpepper-1","6","2","3","8 December 2006"," Great monsters, awesome set, pretty fine plot - shame about the dialogue
","As a devotee of ""creepy small town"" stories, the story outline on the back of the DVD for this one was well-nigh irresistible. In many ways, I'm glad to say, Silent Hill does not disappoint. The town is, indeed marvellously creepy: ash drifting down from sinister coal fires, harsh sirens announcing the onset of ""the Dark"" and some fantastically rendered monsters.<br/><br/>However, the film is sadly let down by its very pedestrian dialogue. There's far too much yelling of ""Sharon!"" and ""Rose!"" at the beginning. Rose also keeps coming up with the most bleeding obvious there's-something-bad-about-this-type comments that you want to yell ""Duh!"" at the screen. There's also lots of awful cod-religious nonsense spouted by the leader of the cult in the church, who even, occasionally, has the decency to look embarrassed by the cheesy lines she has been given.<br/><br/>However, despite the atrocious dialogue, you do start to feel for the characters. Sean Bean plays Sharon's father in a pleasantly understated way and I felt genuinely sorry when the honourable female cop had to die. No good deed goes unpunished, I suppose. In fact, I felt that the cop's death was rather unnecessary and damn all gratitude she gets from Rose after all she did for her either.<br/><br/>The plot is clever enough; it features some interesting oriental ideas about people's dark and light sides and different levels of reality. Do Rose and Sharon die, or do they just ascend to a different plane? Though I occasionally lost patience with some over-long running-around scenes in the middle of the film, it's worth sticking out for the twists in the story, the excellent monsters and gore and the genuinely intriguing ending. Still feel sorry for that cop though."

Some of the game fans might get offended by the way that some things of the game have been brought out in the movie. The best movie based on a video game is of course Resident Evil. This movie didn't stun me.. It didn't actually bring anything new.. I had some trouble following the plot because I was a little drunk. The ending was just so predictable.. This movie reminded me of the movie ""Dark"", where mother and father lost their daughter and Sean Bean was playing the father's character! Too many of these kind of movies. Dark haired little girls haven't been scary anymore since ""The Ring"". But I have to say, they captured the game atmosphere of the Silent Hill town quite well.<br/><br/>In the end, if you're a big fan of the game series, you probably get much more out of this movie than other people.

","Rose has been having trouble with her daughter Sharon, who suffers from sleep walking. Each night this has been putting Sharon in more danger, with her constantly saying Silent Hill. In an attempt to help Sharon, Rose takes her daughter to this town Silent Hill. The town itself is a ghost town, laden with fog and never ending rain of ash. No one lives there, with good reasons, with a dark, benevolent force haunting the town.<br/><br/>Silent Hill walks a very fine line between film and its game roots. Screenwriter Roger Avary, has faithfully followed the source material, to bring a film squarely aimed at the fans. Just like the game there is an a constant accumulation of strange and awe gaspingly weird events and creatures, but there lacks an internal logic. Silent Hill runs just like a game, with a lot of things never making ultimate sense and lacking a central coherent plot. Conheriance may not ultimately be needed in a game, but it doesn't translate well. Avary seems to have aimed low for his skills, with great work for Killing Zoe, The Rules of Attraction and work on the stories for Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Even for its incoherence, there is this engaging element that just constantly keeps you fixated. Largely part of this is to the set design, art direction and special effects. The sets are so detailed; so much dirt, grit and grunge exceedingly evoke constant dread of forthcoming death. The hideous, deformed creatures are nicely freakish, ripped out of some demented nightmare. The rapid deterioration of buildings and rooms are mesmerising. The fantastic dark, ambient, electro soundtrack is perfectly used to the visuals.<br/><br/>The disappointing part of Silent Hill, it's not scary or very thrilling. Your pulse doesn't raise nor quicken, from so many missed opportunities to get the blood pumping. The mood might be eerie and creepy, but that's not enough for a film of this genre. The scares at least don't ride on a soundtrack turned onto eleven, yet it's ear piercing from every scream leaving Sharon's mouth. A heavy handedness also comes with revealing information. The time when all is revealed, it all goes clunk, from it's bluntness of giving all answers at once instead of bits to pick up along the way.<br/><br/>Paper thin accurately describes the acting. While the strongest link, Radha Mitchell is disappointing as Rose. Laurie Holden looks more like a dominatrix then a cop. Sean Bean is weak as chalk as Christopher. Deborah Kara Unger in unrecognizable as Dahlia, getting real dirty and one crazy hair style.<br/><br/>When you step back, not doesn't completely hold together, but it keeps your attention from wondering away."

","I enjoyed this flick immensely.

Also Alice Krige's was THE choice for her role, some trekkies out there might agree :) Amongst all the dirt they call ""horror"" these days this is a true gem, but tilts to fantasy just a tad not to be called pure horror.<br/><br/>In an afterthought some sequences may not make much sense to a non-player, but in my opinion they're cleverly hidden so not to appear too lame, so to say.<br/><br/>Only minus for me not to rate a full 10 was that in the very end the plot got just a little too twisted, but I'd say a very strong 9 1/2-."
"SeriouslyMike","8","2","3","31 July 2006"," The first good game-to-movie
","I wanted to see this movie the first moment I heard it will be made. The good news (director having at least one good horror movie in his resume, authors of the game having a degree of control over the production of the movie) encouraged me to go and actually see it. And I was not mistaken. I can say it's the first game-to-movie that is actually good. Not mediocre (like Resident Evil), not barely decent (like Tomb Raider), but a really good one. While not especially ""scary"", it keeps the dark atmosphere of the games, with all the psychological and emotional aspects.<br/><br/>Changes to the original plot are noticeable, but the new story behind the town and what happened to it is as good (or maybe even better) as the one told in the first game (which the movie is heavily based on). What's important, it still poses some questions, like all the games - touching the subjects of faith, devotion and dedication to family. There's no character that could be unanimously called ""evil"" due to his or her deeds and motivation - whether driven by faith in a misunderstood cause or the desire of ""righteous"" revenge, nobody in the movie comes out as saint or as the evil incarnate.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is true to the original. The CGI effects blatantly stick out in some moments, but I'm still impressed by the quality of ""monsters"" - played by dancers and gymnasts. Their make-up may fondly remind you of what you saw in the games, but luckily, the ""survival horror"" moments are rare enough not to tire the viewers with constant barrage of bullets and repeated whacks of metal pipes (only one typical pistol clip worth of bullets is spent during the whole movie).<br/><br/>Go see it.

"enrique-corrales","7","2","3","29 July 2006"," In the end, a decent cinematic effort is more than current video game adaptations can strive for...
","I tried to watch 'Silent Hill' with my mind free of any preconceptions I've had for / against the movie. My conclusion is the following: definitely, there's a certain degree of hope for video game-licensed films. 'Silent Hill' has something going for it, really. The story kicks off very well, the settings are a joy to look at (well, not exactly, but you know what I mean), monsters are in most cases straight from the game and look freaking real, there are some surprisingly gory scenes, and the general idea for the plot isn't actually bad. Visually, 'Silent Hill' is simply a master work: the CG effects are spectacular yet not really overdone, the photography is some of the best I've seen in modern horror films, and the scenery retains the disturbing quality of the games. The music, as well, is really good. The soundtrack is comprised of several themes taken from all four games, as well as some additional tracks composed by Jeff Danna, and they are good. My only gripe with the soundtrack is that some themes are already so attached to certain scenes in a certain game that they sound a bit unnatural, and also the absence of Akira Yamaoka in the credits, since after all he composed almost all of the music and was mentioned all over the creative process. So, what's wrong with the movie? First comes the pacing / tone balance: Christophe Gans decided not to make an all-out action approach like 'Resident Evil', resulting in some really slow and reflective scenes of Rose running around town and stuff like that. That isn't necessarily bad, but Avary's script lacks the level of sub-reading that is to be found in the games (that, coincidentally, are also slow and reflective), what results in too many slow scenes without any real purpose. The story itself isn't bad, but some of the scenes that give most plot development are simply ludicrous in terms of script: a personal favourite of mine was when Rose enters the church to save Sharon before they try to burn her. Rose talking prophetically while receiving some painful-looking punches to her poor cute face is pure (ridiculous) gold, and brings to my mind 'Pong: the Movie' rather than 'Silent Hill'. Finally, most of the movie fails to instill any real sense of terror. Monsters are way too visible; it seems we still have a lot to learn from 'Alien'. Still, while far from perfect, 'Silent Hill' is a solid cinematic offering with a visible production effort backing it, and simply for the inspiring visual experience, it deserves to be seen. It also gives great hopes for a sequel."
"jluis1984","7","2","3","24 July 2006"," Very good and atmospheric horror film...
","Based on a very successful series of horror video-games, ""Silent Hill"" is a new entry on the horror genre that has the challenge of surpassing the high expectations built due to the video-game's fame and status as one of the best series ever done. Not an easy task for a film (and one that hasn't been fulfilled by many films based on video-games), however, the highly anticipated film by french director Christophe Gans has proved to be up to the challenge and quickly has earned a cult-following even among fans without gaming experience.<br/><br/>The movie keeps the premise of the game series (it focuses on the key plot of the first video game) but enough changes have been done to keep it original enough to fans of the game and still easy-to-follow for non-fans. The plot revolves around the Da Silva family, whose little daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from bizarre nightmares about a town named ""Silent Hill"". While her father, Christopher (Sean Bean) trusts in psychology, her mother Rose (Radha Mitchell) doesn't and takes Sharon to Silent Hill in order to discover the mystery of her daughter's nightmares. What she'll find there will be a nightmare come true.<br/><br/>Written by Roger Avary, the movie's screenplay is what could be stated as an update to the first game's plot, with new things added and others changed. The most important one is that the lead character is now a female rather than a male, this change was a very appropriate one as it focuses on a mother-child relationship, a bond considerably stronger in the western culture than the father-child bond. The film keeps the feeling of isolation and the nightmarish atmospheres although it tones down the mystery and exploration of the town (another obvious change). It also has a small dose of drama, which came up as a good surprise as not many modern horror films seem to care for it nowadays.<br/><br/>Christophe Gans' conception of ""Silent Hill"" is a very beautiful work of art. Like in his previous work, the visual composition is amazing and ""Silen Hill""'s mix of haunting loneliness and menacing darkness is wonderfully portrayed. Gans' care for details and love for the video game are notorious as some scenes seem to be taken shot by shot from it. While it still has its fair share of gore and other cheap thrills, for the most part the films relays on atmosphere and mood rather than in graphic violence. However, it's safe to say that it's biggest problems occur when it moves away from that style.<br/><br/>The acting is for the most part good, with Radha Mitchell being an excellent choice for a lead character and shows her talent for drama as well as for horror. She carries the film with elegance and is very believable as a worried mother. Sean Bean is credited as co-star, but his presence is small and while he gives a fine performance, the real co-star is definitely Laurie Holden. As Cybil Bennet (a cop who follows Rose to Silent Hill), Holden is very effective and overall makes a good job. Deborah Kara Unger as Dahlia is somewhat disappointing, not only because her character is quite poorly developed, but also her performance ends up as weak.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Silent Hill"" are not the high expectations it built (relatively, it satisfied most of them), but the potential it left unexploited. The story is a fitting adaptation but still some of the magic is missing there and some details appear as flaws. The focus on apparently unnecessary characters (Christopher) contrasts with the poor development of more important ones such as Dahlia. As written above, while the film is for the most part an atmospheric Gothic film, when it moves to a gorier graphical film the results are less impressive and the massive use of CGI at times makes an otherwise beautiful looking film appear as of lesser quality.<br/><br/>Depsite this flaws, ""Silent Hill"" is a terrific film and a very enjoyable one for fans of slower, creepier films. It's not a gore-fest so fans expecting fast action will be sorely disappointed. It's true that its not a perfect film, but its a good attempt at making Gothic horror the way it used to be. 7/10"

","I know nothing about the video games, the history or anything else about Silent Hill. Still this movie is incredible. Music is dark, emotional, hauntingly beautiful and deep. Sharon is adorable. Rose is gorgeous and a wonderful mother. Cybil irked me in the beginning. Cop or not, what gives her the right to follow a car without any legit reason at all? In the first scene with the ""darkness"" in town itself the screeching that creature was making took me aback. Must be one of the worst noises I've ever heard in my whole life. Overall atmosphere of the town is dark, creepy and odd. Music adds to it more than all the fog, empty streets or ruckus. I absolutely hated Anna, all those despicable monsters (""people"") in the church. Not to mention Christabella. She is the one manipulating all of those brain dead morons which led to the town becoming their personal hell. Her death was probably the most gruesome movie death scene I've ever seen, but at the same time most satisfying. Imagine barbed wires ripping you in half literally. It had to be beyond excruciating. Yet, when it comes to monsters like her... No punishment is enough. No amount of pain is enough for her to repay all the monstrosities that she's done. Maybe a better punishment for her would be to burned alive, but alive, stuck in the attic (or whatever it was) just like Alessa was. Fate worse than death. Some forms of life are worse than death, and that's precisely the kind of fate Christabella richly deserves. I just didn't understand why wasn't Rose's husband experiencing the same kind of hell and darkness as she did while in Silent Hill. And why was he able to get out of there but she wasn't? And the whole she's a demon, a devil, a monster and a shame to the family, to town and whatever cause she had a baby out of wedlock? Enough to make anyone want to puke. This is one of the many examples of religious people being much bigger monsters than others, who don't care much for religion. Ok, these are mental fanatics, for sure, but in general religious people are worse. Great movie all in all."

","A slow building adaptation of Konami's 1999 survival horror video game, Silent Hill pairs the game's siganture fog, monsters, flashlights, and supernatural mystery elements with a story heavily adapted for the cinema. Although the film stumbles over plot holes and timeline discrepancies, its eerie atmosphere is bolstered by practial monster effects, thorough set design, and a surreal score by Akira Yamaoka, whose music from the first two games is wisely employed heavily throughout the film. At the movie's gruesome climax, original music by Jeff Danna evokes religious and Spaghetti Western sensibilities and enhances the visually and conceptually disturbing collision of supernatural and human horror."

The writing- both in terms of story and in dialogue- is dismal, the characters and acting are laughable, and the overall plot feels- you guessed it- like a simple videogame premise. I'm on the fence about recommending this, and so I withhold my recommendation. I can't fully say I hated this movie, but I also can't say I fully enjoyed it either. It's a film that has parts that are absolutely worth checking out, but it's also a movie that is far too long (over two hours) and gives little reward for those looking for a real movie with a real plot and real characters. See this movie if you want, don't see it if you don't want; trust me, you'll be fine either way.

","27 August 2006. This could have been a better horror-thriller. It wasn't even necessarily scary - this is a movie that tried to much special effects and gore, the same old stuff in a different way. Most of it didn't seem to make a lot of sense, except to being different. But overall plot is decent and by the end the movie actually has the mild twist, while not classic, sufficient to accept as something nicely done. Unfortunately, too much was done to try to make this movie different, but mostly in the stylish, creepy way that just didn't seem to work all the time. At other times though, the movie had an emotional connection, a lingering sense of horror. It just didn't seem to all mesh together perfectly. Six out of Ten Stars.<br/><br/>**Broadcast version - 11/5/11**. An amazing transformation and a rare occurrence except for Mission Impossible (1996) has a movie had a reawakening impact in its emotional and cinematic improvement. With selective use of in sync music of a diversity of tones and rhythms that echo the eerie and haunting and solemn horror movie, Silent Hill has suggestion of Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) along with fascinating and compelling set designs and engrossing themes in resemblance of quality fantasy horror movies such Coraline (2009) with the mysterious eyes and creepy nether world, Dark Water (2005) with the emotional bonding of mother-daughter and the immersion into the set design of mood and captivating environment and The Cell (2000) with its amazing depiction of the inner world along with the same older woman and young child theme. Even such movies as La Planete sauvage (1973) and Spirited Away (2001). The most significant weakness appears to be a somewhat edited, forced opening sequences that didn't quick portray the typical lush photographic and smooth flow of quality mainstream, high production value movies. What is quite impressive is the acting and the character presence without well not stars and instead the consistent storyline once revealed allows this movie to become well-rounded and proceeds like The Blair Witch Project (1999) to rivet the audience by the substance of the movie itself. This is one of the few horror movies and movies in general that appeared to become stronger and more densely rich as the movie went on until the haunting twist at the end suggestive of such highly impactful movies such as Solaris (2002), The Sixth Sense (1999), and 1408 (2007)."

The film had a story that had a fairly smooth flow, and the scenes and camera work, for the most part, were spot on. I felt tense throughout the entire film, which they accomplished without leaning on jump scares.<br/><br/>It was obvious that the director was passionate about his source material, and my suspicions were confirmed when I read about the production of the movie. The director spent 5 years trying to get the rights from Konami.<br/><br/>For me, the best parts of the film were when they were not with the cult kept me at the edge of my seat. There was nothing between the main characters and the monsters. The cult scenes were where my main issue with the film lie.

"Leofwine_draca","5","1","1","21 December 2016"," A real mixed bag: great set design and atmospherics, but a bad script
","Video game adaptations never really work well when transferred to film, with the RESIDENT EVIL films being distinctly average. Happily, SILENT HILL has a great director in Christophe Gans – who wowed us with his excellent BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF back in 2001. Gans brings his trademark atmosphere and suspense to a movie which marks a milestone in terms of set design – there's never been a creepier ghost town than the one seen here, complete with ash raining down and nasty beasties lurking underneath the streets. Sadly, the power of Gans' directing is countered by an appalling script from Roger Avary (whose directorial debut, KILLING ZOE, wasn't much cop either, come to think of it). Cheesy dialogue and endless exposition combine to ultimately ruin this movie effectiveness and make things pretty dreary as the story progresses.<br/><br/>Another major issue the film has is the heroine: she's totally unlikable and unsympathetic, right from the moment we see her fleeing from a good-natured cop, putting her kid in danger by speeding, and then crashing her car into the bargain. It doesn't help that the actress playing her is Radha Mitchell, whom I've never liked much; she convinces us that she's powerful and resourceful, and terrified in places, but she never engages for one moment with the audience. Sean Bean is also lurking about, playing Mitchell's husband, and he's fantastic, except he doesn't actually interact with any other cast members, and his scenes don't gel with the rest of the story at all.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is genuinely creepy, excellent in fact. The brooding atmosphere is powerfully built and punctuated by some fine scare sequences which manage to be both terrifying and disturbing – I'm thinking of the burning babies and the weird mutant think that spits acid from a festering chest wound. Also on hand is a brilliant movie villain, called Pyramid Head, who wields an absolutely massive machete and who features in two of the film's best shock sequences. Unfortunately, the film's second half, which attempts to explain the garbled back story, is much less impressive. Things slow down to snail-like speed as we get endless ""flashback"" sequences which are uniformly dull, and you'll cry in frustration as Gans fades out once more, bringing things to a halt with a black (or white) screen.<br/><br/>The introduction of a bunch of fanatical Christians, who turn out to be the bad guys, is a mistake, and detracts from the demonic horror so carefully portrayed in the film's earlier scenes; we're back to the clichéd ""burn the witch"" mob mentality here, seen on films a million times before, and it's just boring. Things liven up for a last-reel massacre, in which Alice Krige, playing a typically creepy villain here - she's a great actress - has an unpleasant run in with some sentient barbed wire, and various others are burned alive, have their skin stripped off, or are just torn to pieces. Special effects are excellent, by the way, but it takes more than that to make a movie.<br/><br/>In the end, the film suffers from the lack of likable people. Sean Bean is fine, but he's nothing to do with the film, really, and he feels like a tacked-on afterthought. Laurie Holden, whose heroic cop plays second-fiddle to Mitchell's tough mum, is boring and weirdly masculine, reminding me of Brigitte Nielsen. The only 'nice' character is Deborah Kara Unger, hidden under a load of old-age makeup, who plays the town's misunderstood psycho, and even she's not that nice. The only other surprise in the cast is an excellent Kim Coates, who has gone from B-movie fare (I'm thinking DIE HARD rip-off LETHAL TENDER) to Hollywood blockbusters."

","**THIS REVIEW COULD CONTAIN A LOT OF SPOILERS. IF THE READER DOESN'T WANT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MOVIE BEING SPOILED FOR THEM, THEN I SUGGEST VIEWING THE MOVIE BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW. THANK YOU.**<br/><br/>This movie was an okay movie, but horrible if your associating it to the Silent Hill video game franchise. I don't know how people can say that they'll like this movie, if they like the game. In my experience, I was let down when I associated it with the video game. <br/><br/>First, lets talk about Silent Hill, and why people end up their. In all my experiences with the video games (now I did miss one or two, so correct me if I'm wrong), the person that ended up in Silent Hill did something awful that they felt guilty for. Something sinful. Then, Silent Hill became whatever hell that the person made for themselves. Now, in the movie this wasn't the case at all. A lady had adopted this little girl, the daughter of the lady that had hate so bad for this cult leader of a woman, who sacrificed her daughter. The woman who adopted the little girl (her daughter) ended up in Silent Hill (the mother of the little girls Hell that she created for herself). The movie says fate brought her to Silent Hill, because she adopted her. In other words, she was ""chosen."" <br/><br/>Her purpose to being there was to find out what actually happened to the town, and the woman and her daughter during that time in Silent Hill. Then, bring the truth into the cult (which exists in the mother's hell). Once the truth is revealed, then the mother could take out her revenge on the people who tortured so many people in life. <br/><br/>In the game, it was always something that a person DID that caused them to go to Silent Hill, and pay back what they owe. Silent Hill was to punish the guilty (I do believe), by having the people live in the hell they created. The movie did do a good job on the monsters though. That I did appreciate. Also, when the darkness takes over, they also do a good job with the surroundings, and effect. Otherwise, I did not appreciate the story-line at all. <br/><br/>The movie had good physically related elements related to the game. Otherwise, the story-line sucked and the dialog was so-so. If you like the game, do NOT watch this movie."
"VenturousArtist","5","1","1","9 May 2014"," ""Very unfairly silent.""
","Many years before anyone expected Silent Hill to become a video game film, many people before that time excluded the idea of it being 'the worst', but also in most cases 'the best', for any attempt into being portrayed as the perfect adaptation based on a popular franchise that quickly - and subjectively - went downhill after the second sequel (Silent Hill 3). With this film being loosely based on the first installment, there's a lot of shoes to fill and plenty of time to adjust viewers to the story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many important things was changed from the original story and that alone shows that yet again a video game film adaptation has failed to simply stay closer to the source material rather than create an entirely new story that will contradict the chronological order the actual games set into place. But that's not to say some of the changes are all bad, because it was an interesting change to see the original male protagonist, Harry Mason, changed to a new female character, Rose, that still follows the main story without being too damaging.<br/><br/>The original plot followed a man that attempts to find his lost daughter, Cheryl, in an abandoned ghost town named Silent Hill for most of the similar reasons Rose does. But Rose is there for an even bigger excuse as her daughter has nightmares about the area. For most of the film, the cast and crew attempts their hardest to capture the essence of the original series, in ways, and only manages...in milder ways. Though it's a very tough adaptation to dislike, it's also a very tough adaptation to care for as some fans may feel just as disappointed with the changes and overall execution of everything.<br/><br/>Yes, it's nostalgic and fun to see familiar faces and areas revisited on film, but Silent Hill doesn't completely live to the name - it's very unfairly silent."

","I really wasn't sure what to think going into this movie, but ignoring some obvious parts, like pretty much giving away the ending in the beginning, it was a actually a good movie and was very suspenseful. It had it's flaws, such as Pyramid Head having no real need to be in the movie and being much too gory for the aim of the Silent Hill franchise. It had some very disturbing moments, which fit well into the entire Silent Hill atmosphere and although it is more of a re-imagining of the storyline than a sequel, it still makes for a compelling movie. I would recommend pretty much anyone to watch this, it is no masterpiece, but it was a fun movie and definitely worth the little over 2 hours it takes to watch it."
"trashgang","7","1","1","16 April 2013"," a strange experience for non gamers
","Silent Hill is based on a game and we all know that gamers love this flick because it stick close to the creatures in the game and the story. But for people not knowing the back ground of Silent Hill the game this could be a weird flick to watch. <br/><br/>The story itself is rather simple but still then for non gamers it could be difficult to follow. Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) the daughter of Rosa (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) has a sleepwalking problem. Not only that, she always mention the name Silent Hill. Rosa is fed up with the problem because Sharon being adopted she wants to go back with Sharon to her birth place to find out what Silent Hill means. But the drive towards Silent Hill isn't without problems, being chased by Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden)a police officer they both crashes down the road. After waking up they find themselves in a deserted place full of mist and falling ashes. Not only that, Sharon is gone. Clear to rescue her daughter together with Cybil they slowly get terrorized by the abandoned city and getting more and more entwined into the disturbing history of Silent Hill. <br/><br/>Freaks and strange creatures do move around some done with CGI some in the flesh. Some parts are indeed a bit scary because they used the effects of shadow and light. But again, some of the creatures aren't explained (like the one with the pyramid head) and will be weird to watch with a surreal grandeur. For a game being transformed into a flick it is even sometimes rather gory. Even the score from the game is used now and then. The incoherent story can irritate some viewers. And that's the main problem with this flick. It's a beauty for the gamers but for the unknown it's a complex story even as it is simple as it can get. I had a feeling of a bad flick looking good. It's hard to explain and review. Still, horror buffs will love it because we do see bodies burn and being teared apart. And some creatures do have a Clive Barker overtone.<br/><br/>Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5"
"basilisksamuk","7","1","1","3 February 2013"," Not enough invested in the characters
","Carrie, The Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Eraserhead, Salvador Dali, Tetsuo, Ring, Christian Iconography and Witchfinder General are just a few of the sources that you can see either influencing this film or being directly quoted. As in his previous film, The Brotherhood of the Wolf, Christophe Gans has tried to make a film that isn't quite like anything else you've ever seen whilst using the conventions of many different genres. In this case he has also based the entire thing on the the video game Silent Hill and tried to absorb the characteristics, or clichés, of the game genre. The result is unlikely to completely satisfy fans either of his previous film or of the games, although some of the fawning on IMDb suggests that the gamers are mostly happy with the results.<br/><br/>I have to say that I found the film quite hard to like simply because the gore quotient was set to maximum and then some. In terms of blood, violence and general trauma to bodies human and demon this raises the bar in an already competitive field. Usually I have no objection to high gore levels although they are often used to hide underlying deficiencies in a film. In fact I don't object to the level of gore displayed here – I just find that somehow Gans (or the CGI specialists) have somehow managed to take to the fun out of it! That might sound like an odd thing to say but in the best splatter movies there is an almost unholy joy to be had in watching the slicing and dicing. Just think of those moments when you simultaneously think ""Oh no this is just too gross!"" but burst out laughing because what you have seen is audacious and, yes, downright laugh out loud because you don't know what else to do with your emotions. Here the scenes are just gross and I think, on reflection, that I have this reaction because I had nothing invested in the characters. If only a little more effort had been made in the setup to make me care more about the heroine and her daughter and later some of the characters encountered in Silent Hill then I would have felt much emotional attachment and the gross-out feelings would have transferred to worrying about the characters and made them seem more acceptable. Weird or what? <br/><br/>However, much as the experience of watching this film was unpleasant, I also have a terrific admiration for the way in which the nastiness and the kinetic energy of the game experience was conveyed so effectively. I still think that Gans has the capability of making films like no other western director – his sensibilities and eclecticism put me much more in mind of Asian martial arts or anime films than they do of anything coming out of Hollywood. It's also worth saying that some of the sequences and images really stay with you after the film. This is a rare experience in a time when the next film off the conveyor belt gives you a rush the day you see you but is forgotten the very next day when you try to remember what was so good about it. As a failure then this film is considerably better than the average movie and I look forward to Gans next film.<br/><br/>Other things you may learn by seeing this film are a) Sean Bean cannot do a convincing American accent and b) not all little girls are capable of looking frightening by being bug-eyed and failing to comb their hair properly."

I've been a gamer ever since i remember and i'm always aware when i read or hear that a game is going to be adapted to a movie, because the transition isn't always what you expect, mostly because whoever directs the film doesn't have the game experience (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter and so on) or doesn't research about it. In this case, it's exactly the opposite. The director was able to catch the essence of Silent Hill, although with some script changes, and the result is the best adaptation of a video game until now. Nevertheless, it's all there and whoever played the game will notice that. If you are a fan of the game, i recommend this, it's the best adaptation from a video game i've ever seen. If you're not, well, you have two choices: don't watch it and don't review it, or embrace the mystery, insanity and darkness that Silent Hill offers you and take a journey to a place where no one as ever returned."

","The movie could be competitive to Hellraiser or The Cell in a matter of sickness and same time attractive horror scenes that might be engraved in your mind long time before you go to sleep. The story is based on a mother + daughter relationship; they ""feel that they must"" visit a strange abandoned city, all ruined by fire many years ago, in order to seek out the answers to the nightmares and strange behavior of Sharon( the little girl). The mother, Rose, ignores her husband's pleas to stay with him and she runs away with the child in a strange, supposed to mother-loving mood. I totally agree with below quoted review, that up to the time that they both reach Sillent Hill, there is no plot and no coherency in the story. ""I don't really think the director knew what to do before he takes us into Silent Hill itself. The interactions between the characters seem strained in the opening scenes, and it's hard to believe that the mother would basically abduct her daughter away from the father to explore Silent Hill. After a rather pretty moment the mother and daughter share in a field, they're off and running. There's some painful dialogue between Rose and the female cop (who is sporting the most form-fitting uniform I have ever seen, basically a stripper's police costume) followed by a brief car chase that again makes no sense. If Rose is such a caring mother who's trying to get to the bottom of her daughter's condition, why put both of them at risk in a high-speed chase? The whole thing seems rather contrived, as if they just tried to get the characters into the city the quickest way they could possibly think of. It feels like lazy writing, and as a result, the movie doesn't get off to a promising start. One car crash (which we can all see coming) later, and we're in Silent Hill. Time to buckle up.// by Ben Kuchera"" Finally we get into action and the whole movie takes place into fog and ash with really nice designed creepy figures, horror scenes of a very good fantasy plot. It keeps you up to the last minute but you should not look into details so much, as you will find so many ""story-holes"". Worst nightmare for me the scene with cockroaches and the look of the little daemon; most void detail the female cop in leather sexy pants and meaningless car chase.

","Maybe it didn't help that I've never played the game, but in any case it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! The storyline was hard to follow (I'm sure if I was a gamer, I would have had a better idea but the movie should be made to make sense to those who know the premise behind the game and those who don't). Secondly, it was BORING! It took a while for the 'plot' to really take off and by that time I had lost interest - also, the scary parts were not the least bit scary at all. And lastly, the movie seemed to drag on. Even though it was a 2 hour movie, it felt much longer than that.<br/><br/>I wanted to walk out on this movie from the first 15 minutes, but never did because I kept on thinking that it was going to get better - I guess I was mistaken! The only exciting part about this movie occurred in the first 5 minutes when I pointed to the screen and said ""I live like 10 minutes from there!!!"" (The first filming location where they show the huge cliff and the lit up cross in the background is part of a conservation area which runs along the Niagara Escarpment in Stoney Creek, Ontario called ""The Devil's Punchbowl"".) <br/><br/>...considering that was the highlight of the movie for me should say a lot about the quality of this movie in general...."

","I just got back from watching this ummm drivel. I am a huge fan of the original game, but this movie is one of the lesser things I have seen lately. Not sure why no one can figure out how to make a good video game adaptation.<br/><br/>This film has great art direction and the sets are spectacular. The special effects were up to par. However, the script is atrocious and the acting is pretty bad too. The little girl playing Alessa makes Jake Lloyd from Star Wars look like a master thespian. Sean Bean apparently needed a paycheck. Radha Mitchell was OK I guess, but who couldn't run down the street and shout, ""Sharon!"" for the 114th time. Of course you can't really expect anybody to do that well with such ridiculous dialogue.<br/><br/>I had high hopes too, after learning Gans was directing, that this would be good. I like the Brotherhood of the Wolf. I was all for Gans disparaging remarks about Uwe Boll, since we all know he hasn't come close to making a good movie yet, but good ole Uwe couldn't have done much worse with this piece of junk.<br/><br/>Oh well, here is to hoping that maybe Halo will have a shot of being good when it comes around.<br/><br/>Oh and honestly, this movie is not that gory either. Were it not for some specific curse words, a little creative editing could easily get this ""thing"" in PG-13 range.<br/><br/>Ultimately just another failed attempt that will make most people continue to assume video games are as bad as this piece of trash."
"Coventry","3","5","12","9 December 2006"," Most overrated film of 2006
","Okay um, do you have to be a member of a secret video game-cult to comprehend the ""brilliance"" of this film adaptation, or something? I sure as hell don't understand all the positive reactions and praising reviews on this movie, so maybe that's because a) I'm a stupid imbecile who missed the whole point or b) I never played the game or even heard of it before rumors got out that a movie was being produced based on it. I watched a very boring, pretentious, overlong, unnecessarily confusing and truly mundane ghost-story that, despite of the nifty direction job by Christophe Gans, felt like an utter waste of time. Granted, most of the locations and set pieces are genuinely sinister-looking and the grand finale, albeit realized with awful CGI-effects, is quite spectacular, but the story is just an incoherent bunch of nonsense that even the trashiest b-movie producers of the 1970's wouldn't dare turning into a movie! In order to unravel the strange behavior patterns of her adopted daughter Sharon, dedicated mum Rose Da Silva travels to the little girl's birth region to investigate what traumatizing events went on there. After dealing with the clichéd obstacles (like weird townsfolk advising her not to go etc...), Rose discovers the ominous village of Silent Hill, where ashes constantly snow down from the sky and computer generated beetles attack for no reason other than hospitality. Sharon vanishes after a banal car crash, but Rose teams up with female copper Cybil Bennett to conquer the horrors of Silent Hill. After this, I kind of lost all interest in Roger Avery's script, but it naturally has to do with diabolical cults, witch-covens and ancients curses. Can we say 'déjà-vu'? Everything in this film is incredibly mediocre, from Sean Bean's tiresome performance as the girl's father to the overly complex plot-twists that are clearly just there for padding reasons. Many people  myself included  complained about recent video game based horror films like ""House of the Dead"" or ""Alone in the Dark"" for being far too hectic and ridiculously over-the-top in the gore department, but ""Silent Hill"" is the complete opposite (dull and really lame) and that's definitely not good, either. Skipping this film would be my advise, but what the hell do I know about good video games?"
"Boarder3k","4","5","12","22 April 2006"," Good Game Adaptation? Yeah. Good Horror Movie? Eh...
","I came into Silent Hill without playing any of the games. But I've been told by almost everyone that has played the game and watched the movie that it was so amazingly accurate. Well... that's great and all, but I came into this hearing how freaking scary Silent Hill is. How amazingly terrifying the games were. What happened? I came into this movie expecting the same, and I was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is pretty good. Keeps you interested and watching, feeling just as pressured as our protagonist, Rose. The monsters look great and the environment looks just as good. Not to mention the sounds and background music is simply awesome.<br/><br/>There then comes a moment where you aren't as excited about it. You seem to be less nervous about everything. And it all starts with one horrible line from Rose. ""It's going to be okay. We'll be okay."" Now it wouldn't be so bad... but they just escaped a brutal death at the hands of many of the sadistic monsters lurking around in the dark.<br/><br/>From there, it all goes downhill. We found ourselves groaning at every line the rather butch, female cop says as she states the obvious. Even once halfway through the movie saying ""Something isn't right here."" To add onto the horrible dialogue, we find ourselves getting bored. It's no longer pressing against time to survive... it's trying to figure out a mystery. A mystery in which we can't try to figure out for ourselves which makes the audience feel less interested.<br/><br/>Once you didn't feel like paying attention anymore, you noticed that the directing and screenplay has slowly gotten worse. And by the time it hits the climax to a really cool scene towards the end, you're so turned off from the movie that you just go... ""Hey, that was pretty neat."" The horror is gone. The fear is gone. And then you'll be completely turned off from this movie at the ending which isn't quite explained well enough.<br/><br/>Trust me, I knew what was happening in the movie. But the ending had next to nothing to do with the events prior. Therefore it's up to us to pick which one of the theories we think the director wanted to go with. So we're left with a feeling of unfulfillment at the end, and not really caring about this unknown ending too much.<br/><br/>In the end, you may find yourself having a better time making fun of the unintentionally funny parts than sitting there and watching the second half of the film. It's depressing to think something with so much potential could turn so rotten so fast, but it did.<br/><br/>So in the end, if you are a huge fanatic of the series, I'm sure you'll love to see this adapted to the big screen. But if you are a movie-goer that just wants to see a good horror, I suggest looking elsewhere."
"steveangell","5","5","12","21 April 2006"," So disappointed I must comment on Silent Hill!
","What can I say.....it's happened again..a new horror film looks great in the trailer but fails to live up to expectations! It seems that there are no scary films anymore. I saw Hostel about two nights ago too and they are pretty much the same verdicts for both films.<br/><br/>I'm sure I will offend or at least annoy many fans of these films, but I must comment on Silent Hill. I kind of knew from the get go in my mind how Hostel might end and I pretty much got it right..not exact plots but the fact that the cheap and not well done gory and at times laughable plot would unfold! But SH started out with so much promise, one which wasn't fulfilled. The trailer (UK at least) contains clips which aren't in the final cut, minor point but still annoying none the less, but my main gripe is that the films starts so well without delivering at the end.<br/><br/>Plot is very interesting, the effects are in part fantastic, with high production value and the sound design was amazing. But the last 45 minutes for me were just no god at all. Why take a dark mysterious movie and turn it into rubbish and corny horror along the lines of the last few Freddy movies, cheap and uninteresting. And not scary in the slightest.<br/><br/>Why can't Hollywood produce films which actually FRIGHTEN people?? The last film to do this for me was The Grudge, well made, and genuinely quite creepy till the end, but the US films of recent years just aren't cutting it. Bit like Creep from the UK, starting out great but very cheap ending.<br/><br/>I would recommend you see this at the movies for the first half effects and sound which is cool, but unless you are someone who is totally taken in by any ""horror"" plot given to you, then save money and wait for rental, that way you can order pizza when you decide that it really is worth turning off! I hate saying this about someone's work, I totally understand the effort and the personal sacrifice that can go into movie making, and working in the TV industry over here in the UK I have a little idea as to how much this type of work needs to get on the screen, but as a film designed to be a horror flick, it didn't do it!<br/><br/>But i'm sure that if anyone reads it, they'll totally disagree which is cool...i'd love to hear anyone else's thoughts!

The special effects were excellent but that does not make a good movie and more time should have been used on scripting the plot and storyline, other than Rose running round calling out for her daughter. I was waiting for things to actually start to happen and take off, but it just didn't happen with this movie and just dribbled along until the end.

","Stupidly violent; and apart from that, stupidly senseless; and then, as it wears on, stupidly pretentious in a garblemouthed, muddleheaded way. Or, in other words, like a video game. It's presumably made for gamers who get off on watching a child tortured and burned black, and then still living and still suffering: gamers who in watching her feel no pity or sorrow but think only: Wow, how cool. No wonder parents are down on these things. <br/><br/>This movieization of one of them has a single virtue: an eerie setting, or sequence of settings. But it's used by the director to show off how slick he is rather than to involve us, so that we never get a sense of being with the character, or of feeling with her, as she does what she does--which is to perform childishly repetitive actions such as running through street after street and building after building, meeting horror after horror and discovering the occasional clue or object that allows her to go on, all without rhyme or reason. Or, in other words, like a video game. <br/><br/>The actors are all pretty stiff, except for Alice Krige (who's certainly come down in the world since Chariots of Fire). But then the script was impossible to begin with, a product of the kind of mindless, heartless inexperience that is normally available only to children and the incurably childish. After this movie I'm prone to concur with Krige's character: a great big purge of the vicious may be just what this culture could do with, right about now."

And the only good thing about the movie was the beautiful house that the family live in. We unfortunately get a brief glimpse of it in the end. The movie was such a waste of my time.

","You know when you are watching a bad film when your eyes wander to the cinema bannister and you begin to think about how much fun you would have sliding down it. No, I haven't played the game and if it's anything like the film (which it probably is) I am not likely to either. This is one of the most boring films I have ever had the misfortune to witness. Its just rubbish from start to finish. It felt like one of those dreams we've all had (ok, some) where something exciting is taking place and then all of a sudden we are rudely awoken. Well I was rudely awoken to the last 90% of this film. I would have left but I was with others and didn't want to spoil it for them. I only learned later that they too were in agony. Surely the cast and crew of such bad films must go home each night and lie awake wondering how they got into such a mess. Honestly. Then again, I did say it was a CURE for insomnia didn't I. Who knows? Who cares? The only reason I would ever sit through this again is if I had to research depression."
"bonnerc1","1","4","9","3 May 2006"," Possibly the worst film I've ever seen!
","This movie was, start to finish, a piece of crap. I realize that a one star rating is extremely harsh but I can't, in good conscience, bring myself to give it anything more. It had little to offer in the way of plot. The story was extremely simple and boring. The film makers produced two interminably pointless hours of vacuous gore in place of truly scary material. The acting was embarrassing and saturated with cheesy, over-dramatic clichés. When I was a little over halfway through this atrocity I was ready to walk out but I made the mistake of giving the film the benefit of the doubt and hoped that it would actually get better and maybe offer something stimulating. However, the ending offered the viewer nothing. Because the movie's conclusion offered nothing significant, they should have ended it several times earlier (they had plenty of opportunities) but for some reason the filmmakers thought it was necessary to draw the movie out for two pointless hours. It may remain loyal to the video game but as a stand alone film it's absolutely god awful! It blows my mind that anyone could enjoy something that stupid. Middle-school age kids will probably eat it up. If you are over the age of 16 do yourself a favor, avoid an insult to your intelligence and skip it. This only succeeds in lowering the standards of cinema in this country. Overall, it was profoundly mind numbing and outrageously hyped."
"MJoel","1","4","9","25 April 2006"," What a waste of film.
","I was very excited to go to this film, because I am a huge fan of ""Silent Hill: The Room"", but have never played the first game. Still, I was hoping to be just as scared as I am when I play the game.<br/><br/>Let's put this on the table right now . . . I HATE this movie. I don't just dislike it, I genuinely DESPISE this movie. Why? Because of many reasons, but let's talk about a few right now.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a confusing plot. The reason why the mother and her child are even going to this town is never fully explained straight out. The film drags horribly. My dad fell asleep, and I nearly dosed off a couple of times myself, because it just wasn't scary. It didn't have any of the trademark horror that the games have. Instead of the sudden fright in quiet, dark and enclosed locations like in the game, it's traditional and predictable Hollywood buildup with over-the-top effects instead of what should have been focused on: frightening the audience.<br/><br/>The one good actor in this film is the beautiful little girl who is the prime center of the movie. She herself does a fantastic job in my view, but the rest of the acting is SOOOOOOOOO BAD! I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. Whatever you do, please do not go to this. Anything else is better."
"dooleysunshine","1","4","9","24 April 2006"," So bad
","I have just been to see Silent Hill and I have to say that I was this close to getting up and walking out of the cinema. You could tell in the first ten minutes (probably less) that it was going to be bad but having paid £5.95 to see I decided to stay.<br/><br/>What a mistake that was. It had the potential to be a good film but was ruined with all the stupid creatures that come out at night. And what was with Pyramid Head?! Why did he have a large pyramid on his head? What was the point of him? And where did he get that giant knife? It was bad enough those silly creatures were in the film, but they weren't even explained in the end! They were just there for (not very good) scares.<br/><br/>I can't get over how bad this film was and I urge you to spend your money on something better. Maybe fans of the game will like it but then they clearly have bad taste. Besides them, I can't see who could possibly enjoyed this film."
"BartonHick","5","4","9","22 April 2006"," Did they cut the wrong scenes?
","I would describe Silent Hill like a roller coaster that just gets over way too soon. The film sets you up to expect an entree and instead gives you one very tasty but very small hors d'oeuvre. With the movie clocking in at 2hrs and 7min, you might be wondering why I describe the movie as too short. The problem is how the attention is focused.<br/><br/>The majority of the film takes place in fog world (or ash world or haze world or whatever else you want to call it), and occasionally the town of Silet Hill gets transformed into a very dark nightmare. OK, sounds like Silent Hill. The movie for the most part is portrayed like the game: running from location to location with clues-check. Camera angles pulled straight from the game but tasteful and not overused-check. Props and sets straight from the game-check. Twisted creatures-double check. Early on, the balance of fog Silent Hill and dark Silent Hill is good. The dark scenes are perfectly done, intense, and seem to promise bigger and better is coming, then it doesn't.<br/><br/>A good comparison would be Aliens. Picture the movie this way-the first half is great, intense at times and setting up the bigger encounters later. Then we get to the point where the hidden plot is revealed and (Aliens spoiler warning) Sigourney Weaver and the others get double-crossed. Image at that point in the movie, the focus shifts to Ripley's confrontation with Carter (Paul Reeves) and gets stuck there, almost forgetting the Alien core of the film. Silent Hill left me feeling like that.<br/><br/>The dark scenes felt like setups, not good, long, intense scenes of survival. Silent Hill has always been about the balance of puzzles and fog world with intense survival within the dark world. The player is strained with their own adrenaline, anticipating the next encounter. The dark scenes are there, yes, but not nearly enough in the film. The whole stay one-step-ahead-to-survive feeling is rare, and the frightening anticipation of what is coming is almost nonexistent. The movie uses it sparsely, instead preferring to just jump straight to the nightmarish scenes and villains. The Silent Hill game has always focused on anticipation and messing with the imagination, not the gore and action-and that's what sets it apart from other survival horror games.<br/><br/>What do we get in its place? We get scenes that focus on the story way too much and are actually repetitive. The history of Silent Hill has always been a dark undertone to the game franchise, not the primary focus, and much has been left to the imagination. Not with the movie. The movie gets stuck in the story and has doesn't step out to entertain nearly enough. I heard the film was originally over three hours long and was cut down. I can't help but wonder why they didn't do more cutting of the story scenes. Also, did they cut the wrong scenes? Did they remove the good dark scenes the movie setup up, leaving instead the overblown story section? My friend, who didn't play the game, repeated what has been often said by Hollywood-video game movies fail because every gamer comes in expecting to see 'their' movie, not what is made. No, Silent Hill fails to deliver because it doesn't deliver enough of what the movie is supposed to be: scary. I thought the first half of the movie was perfect, the director nailed it. Then it gets lost and ceases to frighten. That's why it failed. However, at least there is a movie here and not some flashy drivel for people with ADHD like other game to movie adaptations. Acting ranges from good to passable. The dialogue is poor at times but passable. I felt the Sean Bean scenes were a good addition and not the culprit for the movie getting lost. Special effects were superb. The story was really quite straightforward and maybe too straightforward. I don't know how some people have been confused by this movie, even if they did not play the game.<br/><br/>My verdict: If you like the Silent Hill games, give it a try and see the game on the big screen. Just expect the scares to take a back seats to an overdone story. If you didn't play the games, see it if you want to see a movie and nothing else appeals to you. Otherwise, wait for the DVD. In the meantime, go rent the Silent Hill games and play them."

","It was refreshing to finally see a director bring a video game to the movies the right way, and that is purely for the fans. Gans has managed to completely capture the esthetic terror of Silent hill. From its disturbing creatures to it unreal sets, the movie Silent Hill is the Game. Although it displays wooden acting in several parts from some of its key characters, I find myself not caring as much as I would with other genre movies. This movie has everything in it from the game that the fans love. The hell world, the darkness, the fog, the siren, PYRAMID HEAD!, the music and sound was pure silent hill as was the cinematography. If you are not a fan of the games or hate gore, you probably won't like this movie. Some reviewers are already puzzled from the movie and therefore rate it poorly, which is fine because this movie is not for the average moviegoer. It is for the fans of the games, people who know that the way silent hill works is to keep you in mystery forever, which is pretty freaking scary."
"lilith0601","10","4","9","21 April 2006"," Tense, Darkly Beautiful, Intriguing -Anything but Silent
","I am a big fan of the Silent Hill games, and this movie did not disappoint. Though the trailers seemed lackluster, the film itself is creepy, edgy and downright frightening while looking darn good -even if the look is ""Modern American Hell."" The movie starts off with a mother driving her young daughter to the ghost town of Silent Hill in an attempt to solve the problem of her daughter's strange sleep-walking. Upon reaching Silent Hill, the mother is thrust into a strange environment that soon becomes darker and more dangerous...which she must explore to find her wandering daughter.<br/><br/>This film is a great horror film: the tension runs high throughout, the danger is believable and imposing and there is a dangerous plot to uncover. Overall, the look of the movie is amazing. CG and real-life effects blend seamlessly to create the frightening environment and breathe new life and detail into some of our favorite monsters from the games. There is gore, to be sure, but the gore is not so much shocking as compelling in the way it heightens the mood. The sound, as well, is superb. The soundtrack does more than add some occasional creepiness, it really dramatizes all scenes and fans of the games will experience occasional flashbacks (whether pleasantly so, or not).<br/><br/>The only real drawback to this movie is that it may be difficult to comprehend, for some. For those devoted to the plots of the games, the story of the movie is very familiar and clear. However, those who have not played the games may not expect a need to bring their brains to a horror flick. There is exposition, and plenty of it (a bit too much, for my taste) so anyone paying attention will leave the theater with only a few questions in mind, if any. As anyone familiar with tales of Silent Hill will know, the need for audience comprehension is crucial in piecing the plot together, and not all answers will be blatantly stated. (This is unlike most films, which require no imagination or intuition of its audience) If you are a fan of horror movies or horror games, definitely see this film. If you like it, play the games...just make sure you have a soft hand nearby to squeeze or a fuzzy blanket to cower under when the denizens of Silent Hill come out to welcome you."

Good acting, well shot, great music (basically music from the games soundtracks, aside for a few additions) and disturbing atmosphere (which is a good thing!). All in all, I loved this film, and I think it is a movie anyone can enjoy, whether they have played the games or not, but, I think playing the games will make it far more enjoyable and easier to understand.

Whether you've played one of the games or not, you're in for more than a treat and it's nowhere even near Halloween.<br/><br/>I cannot express in words how very much impressed I AM of how well they took story, music, and atmosphere that made Silent Hill such a breakthrough series, and transferred it and connected it into a two hour well done movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects are astounding. But to a fan of the series such as myself, it's almost breath taking how real they made it all seem. To go through the Midwich Elementary School, then the mall, and finally to the hospital kept making my eyes grow wider and wider because all these were familiar surrounding brought to life.<br/><br/>Couldn't be any happier with the soundtrack. Melissa Williamson has the most alluring and hypnotic voice in the biz today. Every song that played from the game, every sound effect made the hair on the back of my neck stand up because THAT is what helps Silent Hill be absolutely disturbing and riveting. It's the reason why everyone should own a surround sound system and no lights in the room...<br/><br/>I shouldn't even have to explain the Red Pyramid Head appearance...<br/><br/>And to sum it up, Silent Hill is definitely worth your $7.50 on a Friday night opening day. Heck I might even watch it again on my day off...<br/><br/>PRAY for a sequel..."

The monsters were masterfully done and impressive (but don't expect to see a lot of them) and they were as disturbing as ever.

I hear people complaining that they don't understand it, but I, along with the few people I went with (who haven't played the games) did, and it wasn't that complicated if you pay attention. The thing I really loved about this film is that it's unique. There are few movies that compare to this in originality.

Doing such a thing to a child is ""that bad"" and it causes all that much. Yeah right! What fanatics were allowed to write this story anyway? Didn't they have any margins that they should write it within? It's almost a sidenote that the script has NOTHING to do with the games that this crap is based on."
"Maciste_Brother","3","3","6","11 May 2007"," Overkill!
","Watching horror films these days is a very frustrating thing: the majority of horror films fall into two categories: PG-13 horror, which can only be described as anemic and lifeless, with almost no originality to them. Then there are a few R-rated horror films made these days, which, unfortunately, are also anemic and unoriginal but contain more gore and violence, often uninspired gore or violence. To make matters worse, most of these horror films, whether they're PG-13 or rated R, are remakes or sequels of those remakes. Originality is a thing of the past in the horror genre. So when something quasi-original comes along, such as SILENT HILL, I'm almost shocked. I have to pinch myself in disbelief. An actual original horror film made in 2006? No way! But (and there's always a but here...), as original a film SILENT HILL is in comparison to most of the unoriginal crap being made these days, it's sad when the whole damn thing just doesn't work or it's not successful at all. In fact I believe that the director, writer, whomever, went overboard with their attempt to bring this video game to the big screen. SILENT HILL was trying way too hard to set itself apart from other horror films. This unfortunate attempt will only drive audiences towards more safe, middle-of-the-road stuff churned out by Hollywood.<br/><br/>As unique as it is, the film is not 100% original. It obviously borrows elements from other films or books but it's the treatment of these horror ideas that sends it into the ""are you kidding me?"" category. To complicate things, the script doesn't make any sense at all. Not on any level and yet we see a startling amount of horror imagery and violence just for the sake of showing horror imagery and violence, which usually doesn't bother me, but in this case because the screenplay made so little sense that a detachment was created between the story and the video game horror visuals. SILENT HILL ends up being just a collection of hallucinatory imagery and ideas stitched together by a weak and obvious plot line. The disconnect was startling. I watched the film avidly and yet with a distance. I cannot say if it's good or bad because honestly, I can't even start to ponder what they were trying to achieve here. It's not frightening or stomach turning and yet the excessive amount of attention and details spent of the visuals was unpleasant: so much imagery with so little meaning to them.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with SILENT HILL though was the mother's motivation. Like so many other films made these days, such as DARK WATER or THE FORGOTTEN, we see a mother who, in this case, acts in a totally illogical manner. Her adopted daughter is having nightmares of a city called Silent Hill and decides to bring her daughter to that town for...what? Answers? Anyway, the reckless mother ends up in Silent Hill, which exists on a different dimension or plane of existence. This is when the daughter disappears and from then on, we see the mother trying to find her daughter in this deserted Twilight Zone city. The mother goes through one horrific encounter after another, most of them unexplained, and yet she still searches for her daughter. The mother literally goes through hell to regain her daughter, almost totally oblivious to the bizarre world she's in. The only thing she cares about is ""Where's my daughter?"" So for the next hour, we hear the mother scream ""Sharon!"" while a thing with a Pyramid head and a huge knife tries to kill her (and that lesbian cop). Insects eat the surroundings, like LANGOLIERS. The mother meets this evil religious sect. With everything going on, I completely lost track of the story. Eventually we know the adopted daughter's mysterious past (flashback made to look like it was shot with a super 8mm camera...why?) and then the climax comes along and I was like ""What?"". A bed with a burnt little girl lying on it, the bed surrounded by ""living"" barbed wire and the bed appears from a hole in the floor of the church where the burnt girl starts killing everyone, a la Carrie, stabbing people with the barbed wire, including the head of the sect, who is ripped apart from the living barbed wire that stabbed her through the vagina? Got that? This is just horror overkill. By that time, with the orgy of images and ideas, there was just no point of reference anymore and things occurred just because the director or writer wanted them to occur. I seriously wondered what was the point of all of this. I'm glad computers have made it possible for filmmakers to show imagery which are as far reaching as the human imagination but then if such imagery is devoid of meaning, what are we left with? <br/><br/>The entire film felt like it was imagined by the fevered mind of a 9 year old trying to cram as many ideas as possible into one weak story.<br/><br/>Is SILENT HILL original? For the most part, it is. Unfortunately, it just didn't know what to do with its originality and what it ended up with was a wonky film with no logic or point to it at all and it's basically a catalog of horror visuals signifying nothing. A pity, really, considering the glut of remakes and sequels made these days."
"lordzedd-3","8","3","6","31 March 2007"," Stayed fateful to the video game
","Okay, my brother has played two of the four video games in this series and I watched them as he played them. This adaptation of the video games stays fateful to the video game. They created new characters, but some of the situation is similar to the first video game. The acting and the effects are incredibly cool. I love the creature effects and the story does work. Now there are some character issues. Like the Rose character in my book is a bit of a wussy, all she does is scream and scream. The characters in the games would kick ass, not scream like a four year old. Also, without giving it away, the climax of the movie is confusing and somewhat disappointing. Let's hope that they pick it up in the next movie. 8 STARS."
"xo_hugs_n_kisses_xo1394","8","3","6","28 February 2007"," One of the best movies i've seen...
","I like the movie ""Silent Hill"" because it makes you think about whats going to happen. Rose(Rhada Mitchell) brings her daughter to Silent Hill to unfold her mysterious past. When Sharon gets lost, Rose goes in search for her not knowing she's soon going to find out about a girl named Alessa Gillespie who looks exactly like Sharon. I cant explain the whole movie very well because I don't fully understand it. All I know is, if you got to blockbuster and rent this movie, you will NOT be disappointed one bit. The plot line is a little confusing and the makeup is very good. There are some bone-chilling characters in this movie. One of my favorites is the creature Rose and the cop discover at first. He has a huge hole in him and no arms or face. This movie is definitely one you'd like to go see if you like suspense. :)"
"roger-406","3","3","6","13 October 2006"," A real yawner
","It was difficult staying put watching this yawner. Right from the start, it looked pretty cheesy. There is a very early scene where Rose's husband (presumeably it is him) runs across a busy road at night. The cars look extremely artificial and my son and I chuckled as we saw that scene. Later when the 'zombies' of Siltent Hill first appear, it is loud laughter at watching these comical figures limp around. The acting is excellent, the story and special effects bring this down too many notches, however. The film is dragged along with extended scenes made way too long. The film could easily have been compressed into 45 minutes. Spend your time elsewhere, not on this film."
"Misanthropic_Disease","8","3","6","27 September 2006"," In what's taken from the game, this movie can't be wrong...
","In all my life, this is the only movie I've seen the day of its release, and one of the very few I've been that eagerly envisaging to see. Sure, this was mainly attributed to my infatuation for Konami's 4 excellent games, being the most freaking and disturbing legacy in video games's history. I think no movie ever came close to their level of terror.<br/><br/>As soon as I knew about it, I went to the official website, which by the way is a piece of art, watched the trailer and the screenshots, and got really impressed by the faithful design and atmosphere. I've been pleased to see a cast without any damn huge Hollywood stars, still, the delicious Deborah Kara Unger and the overlooked Sean Bean were there to sustain least known characters. Then came D-day.<br/><br/>Let's say it, although my rating is of 8 stars, I was disappointed. The fact is that I had just discovered that the movie wasn't a direct adaptation of the video game quadrilogy. Some details had been changed unnecessarily, in fact it's mainly inspired from the first game, with some totally dislocated secondary elements from SH2 and SH3. As the film begins clearly like the original game, the male character, Harry Mason, changed of sex to become Rose. Movie makers explained this by telling that his personality was more the one of a female. So what? A man has some female characteristics, while a woman also has male characteristics, and it's part of a normal personality... why change that? Anyway, originally, Mason was traveling with his little Cheryl, which then, became Sharon. Why? Who knows, especially when it's that close phonetically! The translation to the big screen is full of annoying differences, while some details didn't changed, like Brahms, the close town from where Cybil comes. Keep in mind that if I was to describe every differences, this would no longer be a review! But for those who know the original games, especially the first, the need to remake the story becomes quite obvious. The original complexity, and sometimes the ambiguity, of events and relations would be unbearable for the usual occidental customer, who prefer to sit on his brain and get lazily entertained. Amazingly, it seems that lots of peoples didn't understood the plot, even with the useless, disappointing and cliché B&W flashback explanation sequence near the end, gently told by the evil Alessa!<br/><br/>Still, the main strength of Silent Hill is its unequaled atmosphere, its settings, and it's out-of-nowhere psychologically disturbing, twisted dark creatures, and totally unforeseen horrifying elements, like the dead end cutted-off roads, the school's second hellish dimension with bloody-rusted wire-netting walls, and on, and on. Although some obvious changes have been made, this, let's say it; most important part of the games, has been incredibly well rendered! To my opinion, just that worth for half the job. There is so much detail, so much work behind all of this weird world, it's mad to even just think about reproducing it! And most of it has been made from scratch! Only very few scenes takes place in real-life locations, all located close to Toronto, Canada. Even the early scenes after the disappearing of Sharon, on the foggy road, where Cybil and Rose meet again, have been done in a huge studio, with real asphalt and a fake mountain! In this department, I have too much to say. I love the creatures, especially the superb and faithful appearance of red pyramid. Wonderful make-up, not only for him, I mean everyone; the gray child, the 20 latex nurses, etc.<br/><br/>By the way, although my girlfriend especially loved them, I really think that the nurses aren't as cool as in the game. This, only because their faces are somehow not only missing, but twisted and grayish, like to remember severe fire burns, from the big fire... And this story of fire is also another divergent point, like if this was specially placed to explain the town's desertion and misty atmosphere, but also to give sense to some designs, like those of the nurses faces, but also for the graychilds twisted heads and incandescent kind of wounds, which are by the way very impressive, great digital work! The transition between the two dimensions, mainly involving computer imagery, is also really, really astonishing and beautifully wicked! I have to stop there for this point, as I said earlier; too much to say!<br/><br/>Personally, I would have preferred least plain dialog, and more mystery and ambiguity. This sure is the main weakness; the remake with a different and simpler script; more explanations than we needs and too much peoples, mainly because of the religious fanatics still in the town. Remember the loneliness of the games, which build a good part of your terror? Furthermore, it really gets annoying to hear ""WITCH!"" ""THE DEMON!"" or ""BURN HER!"" this break the original mood to something else, and that's too bad.<br/><br/>Anyway, the cast is excellent, I was insulted to see the name of Jodelle Ferland (Sharon/Alessa) mentioned so far in the credits: She's the actress to remember, so young and so professional, she's a pleasure to watch and hear! Otherwise, every one of the main characters, Rose, Christopher, Cybil, Dahlia, Christabella, Anna, are very good, honestly, but they are adults with experience and knowledge in addition to their talent, in opposite to the young Jodelle. I hope to see her again! Kim Coates in the role of Gucci is flat and ordinary. Otherwise, it was nice to see Deborah K. Unger in such a different role, and in two radically different states.<br/><br/>Well, I hope it helps! Silent Hill succeeds by it's unrivaled effects and atmosphere, which should be considered as the center point of the film. Put aside some unnecessary and tedious scenario bits, and focus on the quality and sickness of this trip between reality and hell.<br/><br/>But for God's sake, try the games!"

","I have played with pleasure Sillent Hill 2 and I have recently started Silent Hill 1. When I saw the movie I was totally impressed. It gave me the feeling that I was there, in Silent Hill, the one I was so familiar from the game. The houses were like the ones from the game, the music was most of it exactly like the one from the game, even the fog. The movies seems to fallow the story from the game and I have recognizes many of the scenes from the game and many characters and monsters too. Even though I have finished Silent Hill 2, the movies still creepies me out and it still makes me wander of the now information I have found about Silent Hill from it."

","When my boyfriend showed up with SILENT HILL I was NOT a happy girl, but as usually I let him put the DVD on, and sat back ready to cover my eyes. NOT ONCE did I shut my eyes, I WAS MEZMORISED! The stunning visuals, the twisted creatures, the captivating portrayals of all these amazing characters is almost TOO MUCH to take in over the period of time alloted while viewing a movie. I WILL ADMIT that some parts just CREEPED ME OUT, I mean horrifying is not a strong enough word for what I saw! Skin melting off of the heroine as she burns alive, children dying ruthlessly as a town full of maniacal demon like residents chant as if this were a normal thing...some of it seems like it could almost give a younger viewer or a more vulnerable viewer post traumatic stress! BUT TO PULL THIS OFF! PURE GENIUS! A brilliant plot, A PLUS! Twisted hideous monsters to scare the crap out of me, GRAND JOB! Edge of my seat nail biting suspense- SUCCESS! And perfection on the casting of characters who build on you and feel like you have known them for a lifetime by the time the credits roll. I am NOT a video game player, never have SEEN OR KNEW this was a game and I ADORED IT! Before this the scariest movie I would see was the Final Destination Series...But now, if more movies can promise to deliver all the things that SILENT HILL brought into my living room...I am second guessing my dislike for scary movies. This was more like art than anything. One last footnote, if you are a fan of Tool Videos...this reminded me of a Tool video, but a billion times more creative and well done, with an actual plot, and wonderful storyline. I LOVED IT!!!!"
"lestersbabie01","2","3","6","24 August 2006"," Great location and effects but...
","I thought that Silent Hill was a great movie. The special effects and the plot twists and turns were great. But I felt that the end was a big let down and ruined the whole movie for me. I've never played the game so maybe that's why the ending didn't make sense to me. But when a movie is going good and just stops without ending, that ruins the whole movie for me. I will avoid other movies by this writer and director to avoid being disappointed in the future. I wasn't sure what the ending meant and it's the first movie that I've actually sat still to watch for a long time. I assume that it ends the way that it does so there can be a sequel, but I'm not really sure."

","This is a really well made movie. All effects, both sound and movie really brings the feeling together. They have really recreated the feeling from the game! Small details as the high-pitch 'tv-ish' noise they put on during all flash-light scenes, or the constant discoloring of all scenery to really make everything creepy, all add up to the right feeling of the movie. The actors are convincing and the story line is good. Some scenes are very strong and nasty, so it's nothing for light sleepers. Once again, this movie is about the feeling...it just feels so damn dark and mean... I recommend this movie to all fans of the game, and everyone that like good horror/fantasy flicks."
"antti-niemela-2","9","3","6","16 August 2006"," Creepy and atmospheric - Truly worthy of the Silent Hill title!
","After a really shaky start and some really appalling acting in the opening scenes the movie (a homage to the bad acting in the first game perhaps?) quickly redeems itself and hits you in the face with the city many of us have come very familiar with in the past years. With an added freshness and a new twist. The movie captures the essence of the games perfectly. It uses genuinely creepy atmosphere instead of shock-horror. An atmosphere that never really is lifted, but alternates between absolute nightmare of the Darkness and a feeling of general uneasiness and unsafeness of the Limbo. The very thing that made the game so effectively scary. The story itself is as mysterious as it should be, complex and not-all-there. Though what I found captivating in the first game was that the story was not told in whole and that you had to piece the hints together yourself to get the grand idea of what the heck you just experienced. The movie, obviously, is made to be more easily understandable, while still requiring you to use those precious braincells that normally are left in limbo with horror movies of this scale.<br/><br/>Music was spot on most of the time. Most of the tracks were directly from the games and rest were original, strangely not by Akira Yamaoka himself considering how deeply intertwined his music is with the franchise and how much Gans himself admitted to liking his works.<br/><br/>What I found slightly disappointing was how little screen time the Red Pyramid had in the movie. Since he was such a pivotal character in the second game, and hands down the coolest bad guy in gaming history.<br/><br/>A slightly biased 9 out of 10!"
"Bataeu","10","3","6","15 August 2006"," Grinning from ear to ear...
","I was a bit cheeky and decided to download a DVDRip of Silent Hill in my impatient anticipation of the Australian release of the film. I finally watched it last night and must say this is the best video game to movie transition I have seen. People who have played the games will most certainly recognize scenes/camera-work that is similar to the game. When Rose first ventures into Silent Hill and everything changes for the first time, it is scene for scene remade from the video game. The camera-work is the same, the events that occur are the same and the music is the same. As in the first game Sharon leaves clues lying around Silent Hill in the form of pages from her scrapbook which Rose must follow to find her. The movie is gleefully gory in small doses, as the film revolves more around Rose finding her daughter than the director trying to gross the viewers out. The movie is more of a horror/mystery than a full out horror film. There are scenes that cut back to Rose's husband trying to find both his wife and daughter and at the same time trying to unravel the mysteries of the ghost town, but never so many to make the viewer think, ""come on, get back to Rose, her story is more interesting!"" If you've never played the Silent Hill games, don't worry. You don't have to have played the games to know what's going on. If you have played the games, then you'll be grinning from ear to ear with the many references to the people, places and creatures that lurk within Silent Hill.<br/><br/>10/10"
"aimless-46","9","3","6","9 August 2006"," Some Explanations for Those Who Have Already Watched It
","For a truly unique film experience check out ""Silent Hill"". As a fan of the games I expected to be impressed but anyone looking for innovative film-making and extraordinary (WOW) production design should find this film fascinating. I am firmly convinced that Gans and Avery have hit a home run here. <br/><br/>For those who have never seen the game, ""Silent Hill"" is the best ever survival/ horror game series. It is difficult and confusing (a lot of mazes and D&D-like details) so expect major disorientation at times during the film-which is a bit like actually playing the game. <br/><br/>The acting was convincing, the editing extraordinary, the atmosphere was perfect, the creatures were amazing. Not 100% how I visualized it before viewing but even the differences tended to work in favor of the film. Be prepared for some serious blood. <br/><br/>The town itself looked and actually felt familiar, unlike the mess they made of ""House of Wax"". This is definitely the sort of film best seen on the big screen with a theater sound system. Everyone should be totally creeped out. <br/><br/>Enough said, more at this stage might spoil things so read on only if you have already seen the film or if you don't mind some spoilers. <br/><br/>Dahlia Gillespie had a daughter (by an unknown father) named Alessa. Alessa became the town outcast until a bunch of religious nuts (led by Christabella) decided she was a witch and must be sacrificed to keep evil out of Silent Hill. Dahlia went along with this because she was afraid of her own damnation for having the child. But the ceremony went wrong and the nut cases were not just killed but sent to a netherworld between heaven and hell. <br/><br/>The dark side of Alessa ended up in the same place but she was split into duel entities and the good part stayed in the normal world where she was adopted by Rose and Chris, and named Sharon. Sharon's sleepwalking is caused by her connection with Alessa who wants her to return to Silent Hill. <br/><br/>On the way to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon arouse the suspicions of a female motorcycle policewoman (Cybil Bennett). This happens because Cybil has been extremely protective of children since she saved a little boy from a psychopath. Cybil follows them to Silent Hill (once a coal mining town that was abandoned because of a burning seam of coal under the town). At the town limits a mysterious girl appears and both vehicles crash. When Sharon and Cybil regain consciousness Rose is gone. <br/><br/>As they explore the abandoned buildings they discover a church with a warning siren where the religious cult hides when Alessa (presumably) causes a darkness to take over the town; for some reason the darkness and Alessa cannot enter the church. It turns out that Alessa sent her Sharon identity back into the world of the living to bring back someone (Rose) who can take her into the church where she can finally exact her revenge. <br/><br/>Everyone is dead in the netherworld of Silent Hill, even Rose and Cybil-they don't know it yet but they died in the accident-because you can only enter the town if you are dead. Alessa needs Rose which is why she died, it was just Cybil's bad luck to have been involved in the accident. <br/><br/>The tip off to their being parallel towns comes when Rose's husband Chris enters the real Silent Hill and finds nothing supernatural in the place; although he senses a connection with his wife and adopted daughter, he finds no tangible sign of them. Rose passes right through him and the ending scene of Rose and Sharon in their home is blurred, but the scene with Chris in the parallel home is completely clear. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"sefirosukuraodo","10","3","6","8 August 2006"," Not made for the average Horror viewer
","I had gone to see this movie on opening night. The seats were packed, the crowd was rilled, and the popcorn vendor had gone clinically insane, crumbling under the pressure. I left that theater truly impressed; though the film was based on the game, and through trailers and news it looked as though the storyline would be ripped right out of the thumb twiddling fixating series known as SILENT HILL, but the minds behind this project have truly made this their own. But soon afterward, reading reviews, I found that not everyone was able to enjoy the film. I began to read every review I could. Pam Grady simply knocked the film in every way possible. From Radha Mitchell's performance to the CGI. In actual fact, not much CGI was used in this film; most of the creatures were people, dancers and such, in make up and/or suits. The problem: most people just didn't get it. Roger Ebert (Ebert & Roeper) isn't a favorite critic of mine, though Ido respect his opinions, reason being that he can back up his reasons with compelling arguments. He often gives a horror film low marks, so when I began reading his review on SILENT HILL, I was expecting a constant hacking, much like the fore-mentioned Pam Grady's review. However, I was surprised to read that he admitted to his readers that he just plain and simply didn't get it. And that's the problem; Temporal Dynamics isn't something a lot of people had ever heard of. The fact that this version of Silent Hill had three layered dimensions isn't hard to conceive, correct? There was the version Sean Bean and Kim Coates explored, which is like a desolate American Wasteland. Then there is the fog-filled world, which is home to what appears to be a sect of 'god fearing' witch hunters, who believe they are living in a post apocalyptic era, and of course the ""Darkness"", that dimension which appeals as eye candy for the viewers. The whole movie is filled with compelling performances, such as Anna. It wouldn't be a SILENT HILL without an odd character, and we can see that Anna's character is lacking in the psychological department, but there seems to be an ignorant child-like state to her. Of course I do love Laurie Holden's take on Cybil Bennett. I won't go further into detail as not to release any spoilers for those who haven't seen the film yet. The only disappointment I had been met with was Akira Yamaoka. C'mon, man! I mean the music was good, and some of the music had been revamped (example; ""Innocent Moon"" from the SH3 OST, with a cello duet). I was expecting for a whole new soundtrack to blow my mind away... at least one new track. I was also curious as to how he'd stand as a film composer. Guess it'll be a long time before we see that happen, if we ever do. All in all, this is one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time, and we all know that 2006 was lacking in good horror. Good enough to earn a sequel (But I beg you, Roger Avery, DO NOT touch any of the game story lines, and oh GOD please not the comic books! Keep it original, keep it fresh...) So to all you nay sayers and newbies, give this story a chance, and don't put too much thought into something simple, but keep an open mind to the ever so compelling richness this film has to offer."
"Salazar_Slytherin","10","3","6","6 August 2006"," The PERFECT game to film translation!
","I'll be perfectly honest: I am a pure, obsessed fan of the Silent Hill game series. I have collected all the games, both in their PAL and NTSC incarnations (European and North American versions), collected the ""Making of"" documentaries that exist so far, have been collecting the comics, collected the soundtracks (except for the first game because I'm looking for a real Japanese import, not a Taiwan or Hong Kong bootleg), looking forward to at least collecting if not playing the up-coming Silent Hill Experience and Silent Hill Origins for the PSP, and anxiously awaiting the DVD release of the new Silent Hill film on DVD. It was Silent Hill that made want to get into the voice-acting business thanks to a strong inspiration from Aussie singer and voice actress, Donna Burke, who voiced Angela in Silent Hill 2 and Claudia in Silent Hill 3, and from Heather Morris who voiced lead character Heather in Silent Hill 3 and, supposedly (the voice actors were not credited, and IMDb can't always be trusted), voiced Eileen in Silent Hill 4: The Room, and Monica Horgan who voiced Mary and Maria in Silent Hill 2.<br/><br/>From the beginning I had faith in Roger Avery writing the script after reading him confessing that he was a die-hard Silent Hill fan (though definitely not up to my level) and learning that a director called Christophe Gans - also a confessed big fan - was selected to direct the horror epic. I went to see Silent Hill on opening day: April 21 2006 here in Scotland. I LOVED it, I went to see it four times in the cinema, and waiting patiently for the DVD release.<br/><br/>The film is loosely based on the first Silent Hill game. In the game, widower Harry Mason decided to take a late holiday/vacation to Silent Hill with his 7-year-old daughter, Cheryl, to the quiet sleepy town called Silent Hil. On the way, a figure suddenly appears on the road, forcing Harry to turn the wheel, crashes and gets knocked out. He awakes to find Cheryl missing and wanders into the fog-choked town of Silent Hill to find his daughter. With help from a police officer, Cybil Bennet from the next closest town Brahms, a terrified nurse, Lisa Garland,and a mysterious Prophetess-of-Doom type character called Dahlia Gillespie, and after following a trail of blood and mutilation through a dark world of Gothic imagery, a place that exists between reality and hell and inhabited with horrific creatures and monsters, Harry discovers the truth. <br/><br/>In the film, Rose DeSilva acts against her husband's wishes by deciding to take her troubled daughter, Sharone, to Silent Hill due to frequent sleep-walks and mutterings of the town's name. On the way, a figure suddenly steps on the road, forcing Rose to turn the wheel, crashes and gets knocked out. She awakes to find Sharone missing and wanders into the fog-choked town of Silent Hill to find her daughter. From then on, the film mixes story elements from the first game and liberties that Oscar-winning writer Roger Avery (Pulp Fiction) made. Only fans will know and separate the film and game differences and similarities as the plot flows differently from the game, including new characters.<br/><br/>Robert Rodriguez who directed the hit graphic novel adaptation, Sin City, called the film a ""translation"" rather than an adaptation. The same can be said about this film. It is literally Silent Hill ripped straight out of the game and made physical. The camera angles and movement, the lightning effects, the visual effects, everything is so beautifully recreated from the game. Add to that, all the music in the game comes from all the four Silent Hill games that exist so far, making the film experience all the better.<br/><br/>The cast is also very good and manage to pull everything. There are two people that steal the show from everyone else. First is Canadian actress, Deborah Kara Unger, who plays Dahlia Gillespie as a mother whose heart has been broken beyond repair, and she plays her so beautifully. The second is Pyramid Head, the Red Devil and Judge who appeared only in Silent Hill 2. The way he was brought to life in the film was so spectacular it was unreal. He looked EXACTLY as though he had been kidnapped from the game and given flesh and blood only to appear in the film. His look, design, and especially movement, were all perfect.<br/><br/>There is probably only ONE criticism I have and it's the fog. In the games, the fog is real mist, in other words it's water vapour which effectively creates a claustrophobic environment because you can't see very far what's infront or behind you or even what it is approaching you. Furthermore, it is what makes Silent Hill unique. Finally, it is what separates the real normal life from the cursed nightmare parallel dimension. In the film, however, the fog is actually the smoke and fumes from a great fire that happened years ago, while still separating the real world from the nightmare world. So changing the fog to smoke and ashes didn't do well for me. However, this is a small thing that is completely overshadowed and blown away by everything else. <br/><br/>Personally, I am forever grateful and thankful to Christophe Gans and Roger Avery for bringing Silent Hill to life. Gans' direction was so perfect it's not funny! I am sure that he will return to direct an inevitable sequel and I can't wait to see how he'll do it because Silent Hill 2 the game is his personal favourite. I only wish that I could thank him personally, as well as beg about auditioning as an extra or something. Silent Hill is truly a masterpiece of translating a game to film, and I can't wait for it to arrive on DVD.<br/><br/>Thank you Mr. Gans and Mr. Avery."
"dan_m1987","10","3","6","5 August 2006"," You owe it to yourself to see this movie. Seriously, this movie is unbelievable! See it now.
","I will say that this movie is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the best video game/movie adaptation out there. Anyone who has played either the first or second games in the series will love this movie instantly. Locations, characters, monsters, music, events, and even camera angles are dead on, with only a few differences. The main character from the game, Harry Mason, is replaced by Rose Da Silva, but otherwise, the movie usually sticks to it's source material very closely. For those who like the conventional horror movie, you might be a little disappointed, but Silent Hill's horror is identical to the games in every sense. While conventional horror games/movies have surprising scares, Silent Hill uses atmosphere, noise, and suspense to keep you on edge. During certain parts of the movie, the area is near pitch black, and noises from creatures, the environment, or just noise from the music will give you chills and make you anxious. Overall Silent Hill is an extremely good movie which separates itself from other video game movies by being good for a change. See this movie as soon as you can, you'll never hear sirens the same way ever again..."
"musashiden111","7","3","6","2 August 2006"," Good movie, story doesn't match the games plot though
","This movie wasn't horrible. It wasn't even bad, if you didn't play the games though. For fans of the games, one comes to expect a certain level of psychological horror that doesn't come by very often. The first downfall of the movie is the storyline. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit cliché compared to the video game's plot. Why Christopher Gans would opt for a town full of crazed witch hunters and not one full of crazed townsfolk all trying to open the portal to hell, is beyond me. The hook for the game is knowing that every story, news clipping, etc you'll come across is of someone pulling some sort of crazy and disturbing crime one right after another. Then this director comes along and screws that and humanizes the town. Hell, he even got Alessa's age wrong. In the first game she looks at least fourteen. Here she's six. The ending sequence where Alessa basically explains everything in one shot seems a bi like the writers ran out of ideas. And no offense to Radns Mitchel, but the main character should have been a man. The connection would have been stronger if it were a father-daughter relationship rather than a Parent-Child one. It just seems weak. The cliff hanger ending could have used work as well, but that's what sequels are for. The red Pyramid was great though. Should have been saved for no.2. Samaiel would have worked here more. Good, but could have been better."

However, having played (and more or less liked all of them) the movie was a perfect way to relive some great moments! <br/><br/>Sure, the story was somewhat adapted to suit another media. Sure, some things were explained outright that were left for the player to figure out by himself in the games...<br/><br/>Still, nothing detracted from the original source material. Everything in the game payed homage to the games, showing that the makers surely knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>I hope this flick encourages those who haven't checked out the games, to do so! Rare is that game that makes you want to (and yet causes you to be afraid to) find out what happens next!<br/><br/>I would so love to see my favorite of them all, Silent Hill 2, adapted to a film..!"

","I haven't seen anything this terrifying in the last 15 years - in my opinion, the best horror movie ever, no contest. Visually it's mind-blowing, and psychologically it really gets under your skin.<br/><br/>Very convincing actors, and I love the way they filmed it, with the camera twisting at nearly impossible angles, like it did in the game. The sound effects are as gruesome and twisted as in the game, and music is the same type of beautiful mellow electronica with those occasional disturbing dischords - but all done in amazingly spatial and immersive surround sound.<br/><br/>The games were scary, but they pale in comparison to this experience. Like many have said, easily the best movie ever based on a game.<br/><br/>Keeping my fingers crossed for a follow-up, and another game!"
"usmc_kill","10","3","6","23 June 2006"," If you haven't played the games, you will like, if you have, you will love it!!
","I was skeptical on my way to see this movie, as I am with most game-based movies but I was very pleasantly surprised in this case. <br/><br/>Silent Hill has an original and inventive story line, yet effectively embodies so many stylistic elements from the games, particularly Silent Hill 3. The sets, props, monsters, and even the characters carry the same distinct flavor that I experienced while playing games.<br/><br/>The acting was not stellar, but it was a minor deficiency, barely noticeable amidst the plot situations and clever intrigue. Any screen writing that can do that is astonishing. Not to down-play the actors, after all there were nothing but character actors in the cast. I'd have to say that Alice Krige (Christabella) delivered the best performance of the movie. Even as a character actor, she manages to make each of her performances unique and distinct from one another, just as she did in this film. Strange how the villains always tend to be the most memorable.<br/><br/>I can see how not having played the Silent Hill video games could diminish the overall experience of the movie. Without that background experience the plot might seem a little obscure. Even so, the basic elements of an instant cult classic are there for all to enjoy, and I think most of its audience will walk away fully entertained."

","This Movie was visually disturbing and jaw drooping. I have seen it 3 times and I am still not sure about the ending. For a video game/horror movie it was very well written and visually appealing. The atmosphere it created made you feel like you were in the movie. I am hoping with the DVD release it well have comments from the writer and director about their take on the ending. So far I have heard many opinions about the story line and ending but nothing concrete. <br/><br/>However, some people complained about the plot. Come on it's a horror movie; and that is what a good horror movie does; it makes you really think about what is going on. Most horror movies don't do that you never really connect to the characters and the movie is all about sex, drugs and gore. Which is nice sometimes. Don't get me wrong this movie was extremely nightmarish (as Julia in Hellraiser II said as she looked at bloody body in a mirror.) but it also had that desperation and helplessness feeling to it. You really started to feel for the characters from the very start of the movie; for example. Laurie Holden character (Officer Cybil Bennett) . I started to feel emotional connected with her character in particular the moment she came up to Sharon in the car. He is an exert from the movie from that spefic scene.<br/><br/>Officer Bennett ""hey there. Is everything all right?"" Sharon ""I don't talk to strangers"" Officer Bennett ""good girl"" <br/><br/>Right there gives you depth about that specific character and later on in the movie you really have strong feelings for the characters and if you have seen the movie you know what I am talking about.<br/><br/>In my opinion the plot did its job it makes you really concentrate on the underlining meaning while making your jaw drop and freaking you out; To me that is what a really good movie is about.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, do so. Many, many people loved this movie, I for one. This movie is a great subject for discussion. Talk with others who have seen the movie; Get their views and opinions and find out what they thought the meaning of this movie was.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Silent Hill is no longer in theaters; which is a shame because you don't get to hear the gasp or see the other audience members cringe and squirm in their seat. Once it is on DVD buy it, watch it with friends and talk about it after with them.<br/><br/>On a related note (yes I am well aware that I am rambling, but I am extremely fascinated and intrigued by this movie.)<br/><br/>I have tried to play some of the Silent Hill games; keyword ""Tried"". The game was very scary and very intense! However, it was extremely very hard. I couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. All I had was this stupid pipe, had no clue what to do, were to go and I kept dying. The ""beings"" and ""creatures"" that killed me over and over again were very impressive, original and very disturbing. (I said to myself while playing Silent hill 2 ""what were these people smoking when they made this game). However, you can only die so much before you give up. So I gave up and stopped playing (a big mistake on my part). Now that I have seen the movie I am running out to get them all and give it another go.<br/><br/>The one thing I really hated about this movie is that everyone loved it so much. I know what you are thinking, ""that is a bad thing, why?"" Here is what I am getting at. Now everyone and their mother went out and bought the Silent Hill games and now it is extremely hard to find 'Silent Hill 1' and if you do find it the game is way out of price range for most people so now I am majority bummed. <br/><br/>From what I have read online a lot of stuff was taken from Silent Hill 1 and 2 i.e. music, visuals, camera movements and disturbing images to name a few. I wish to experience what most of the gamers who played the series felt while they played Silent Hill. <br/><br/>I have read some of the reviews for this movie on the web site after I posted my first draft of this review. I was extremely impressed that before I even read one review many of them were almost identical to what I had written. Some of the negative reviews really got me ticked off. People saying, ""oh the plot didn't make sense so they hated it or it wasn't like the game. First off if it was identical to the game you would know exactly what is going to happen. Think of the movie this way; Stonehenge is very appealing but no one understands what it is about or why it is the way it is. But people love it never the less and come from all over the world to see it. Some movies can still be really wired and messed up for example, Pulp Fiction. That movie was messed up as all hell but is still very popular and has won an Oscar! Some of the reviews stating if you never played the game you can't truly appreciate the movie. I never really played the game but I am sure there isn't as much of an emotional tie to the characters in the game as in the movie."

","My review is a biased one, I feel I must say firstly, being a fanatic of the games since the first was released I appreciate all the subtlties that Christophe Gans incorporated into the story and locales used in the film. <br/><br/>Regarding story, Silent Hill offers a decent plot line with enough intruige to keep one entertained; personally, I think it was brilliant the way the whole thing folded out, reaching a climax that some might say is over the top but I thought was the cherry on top of the cake. The effects were incredible, the monsters, environments, mist effects, etc, were all spot on.<br/><br/>All in all, if you loved the games, then you will love this movie.

","This film was brilliant I wasn't to sure before I went to see it because of problems adapting video games into movies but this film has shot to No1 of my favourite films. I will admit that this is because I am a fan of the games which I loved. Then I had seen the trailer but didn't want to get my hopes up but it has everything the pyramid head the weird clues the strange story and the grotesque monsters. It even has the strange worlds that the people cross over into. Sean Bean's character is slightly distanced from the world the others are caught in and does seem out of place in the film but I think this actually keeps the viewer grounded in reality. Also having pieces you could spot from the games was great without it feeling like it's there just to be pointed at and say look it's from the game. I can not express though how much I enjoyed this film. Also this is how I understood the ending in which once you have entered Silent Hill there is no escaping from it, it won't let you go. Also it leaves it open for another film which would be great. 10 Out Of 10."
"Coolyoshi64","3","3","6","16 May 2006"," Video Game to Movie Translation Fails Again
","The popular video game horror series ""Silent Hill"" by Konami has a serious cult following, and of course, with something like that, you're going to have purists who are going to pick apart this movie piece by piece. But judging the film as a stand alone work of art, Silent Hill failed miserably in so many places.<br/><br/>The first five minutes of the movie, I knew this was going to be bad. The acting was terrible right off the bat, enough to make me cringe at how poor their execution was. As you are submerged deeper into the movie, it feels more and more like a film you would see on a lazy Saturday afternoon on the Sci-fi channel. Pardon the visuals, which are the only positive about this film. In fact, the visuals are excellent, and reflect the video game extremely well. However, unlike the video game, the movie failed to create a tense atmosphere that would provoke fear or anxiety, probably because the movie basically tells you when its about to try and scare you. The cinematography is traditional, and the movie relies too much on the cliché ""jump out and scare you"" technique. The soundtrack, which used ambient beats and sounds straight from the game, was well done, until the effects were used over and over again. The plot is very abstract, which one might expect, but since I was too busy laughing at the poor acting and the attempts to get my heart racing, I couldn't appreciate it much. I also didn't like how the ending hints at a sequel, because it takes everything it just told you in the film and throws it in the garbage, and consequently, it felt like a waste of two hours. Thank God for student discounts.<br/><br/>Pass up on Silent Hill and wait for another horror movie, like The Omen. Or go out and buy the video games."

","In my opinion Silent Hill is the best video game movie ever. I can't believe how crappy movies like Final Fantasy and Resident Evil turned out to be. The movie completely follows on the scary feel of the game instead of turning it into a cheap action movie(Resident Evil). I think most people who dislike this movie or don't appreciate it that much haven't experienced the video game so aren't prepared for the movie. The psychedelic trips with things like evaporating walls, spawning monsters, and walking through a door and ending up in a place far away are all derived from the game which makes you say ""It's just like the video game!"" a thousand times when you had a fat energy drink and you see the movie with some friends. The movie will seem a lot better if you take the time to play Silent Hill 1 or 2, which are the scariest F***ing games ever. I also noticed some people who played the game but still hated the movie, insulting some of the poor acting. You guys are fags. When you played the game did you judge it by the acting in the movies or the terrific story and game play?"

Yup they definitely did a good job of keeping true to the games. *poke poke, doom and RE!* Alessa and the pyramid head were brilliantly portrayed as well.

The monsters were a great success, I think the entire audience screamed at the images shown at the beginning when she went down that long staircase and saw some horrible human like creatures.

","True disciples of the Silent Hill video game revolution will gleefully immerse themselves in the film and it's haunting visuals, and perhaps come away with better understanding of a plot which I felt was muddied by the horrific creepiness of gameplay. After reading Roger Ebert's review of Silent Hill, the film, I'm convinced that people who are not gamers may not get it.<br/><br/>There's been a rash of movie releases taken from popular video games, like the Resident Evil series and House of the Dead. House of the Dead, the movie, is as boring as the first person shooter on your console at home. Resident Evil was much more entertaining, turning the game into a less creepy action film. Silent Hill is the perfect combination of gore and creepiness and stays true to the game, down to some of the most horrific creatures I've ever attempted to kill on PlayStation2. Problem is, some of their creepiness is lost on the movie because movie goers won't get the same rush gamers do in the midst of battling deformed nurses or giant, musclebound creatures with big machetes.<br/><br/>Silent Hill's dialogue and the reaction and action of the actors in the film was as benign and unbelievable as the characters in the games. This is something the producers could have managed to beef up to make the film more terrifying and believable. While trying to stay true to the game, the film took the very element an interactive game usually lacks-actor believability- and did little to enhance it. Silent Hill, the movie, would have received a higher rating for me if the actors were allowed to show as much horror and disbelief as a gamer gets when they play the game.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of horror, you have to see this movie. The effects and the insane plot are enough to keep your interest. But to truly appreciate the film, I think you should play the games first. I swear, I couldn't play them alone."

The ending isn't supposed to give you closure, it's supposed to leave you with questions.<br/><br/>The movie has a few jump-in-your-seat scares, but it's more about the creepy feeling it gives you and the way it gets under your skin.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to any horror fan.

"beefu_mastah","10","3","6","24 April 2006"," This movie was great and i'm tired of the haters.
","First of all, what you need to know about this movie is that <br/><br/>1). It's supposed to be a series; and <br/><br/>2). It's NOT supposed to be scary. <br/><br/>The games were never that scary, and they never tried to be. Silent Hill has always been wrongly labeled as ""Horror"" even though it was never supposed to be horror per se. It's supposed to be disturbing, and it's supposed to make you uncomfortable. The movie did this perfectly and if you did not play the games, you should not see it. Most of the people who hate this movie didn't play any of the games and therefore will be confused. The movie was filled with so many references to the games. Even the possible 'toxic fumes' explanation was a reference to the first game in which the worst ending was a concussion dream explanation. Much of the dialog and visuals were all references to scenes in the game, and even the camera positioning was supposed to remind you of Silent Hill 1 and 3. As for the series remark, Christopher Gans is planning one or more sequels, so the direction of this movie wasn't supposed to answer all your questions. Again this is just like the games in which, even after 4 installments, there are still many mysteries. The first movie in a series is never the best. All in all though, not only did this movie look great and give many things for fans to enjoy, but it has a much better story then people give it credit for and all of the characters are well written, well performed, and sufficiently explained. If you have played and enjoyed the games, go see this movie, you will like it. If you have not, you may still enjoy it. Don't go into the theater making the mistake of expecting a straight horror with monsters jumping out at you and scenes trying to make you scream. Go in expecting to be disturbed. The atmosphere of this movie is great and there are hardly any downfalls to this amazing movie. This is by far the best video game-movie adaptation and one of the best movies i've seen in years. 10/10"
"poppa_pump2","3","3","6","24 April 2006"," A bad movie, an even worse interpretation of the source material
","For the people who say this is the best movie they've ever seen, etc, I say to them...this must also be the only movie you've ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie on its own makes no sense. If you go in with a knowledge of the series its even worse because Gans changes so much of the story you can't figure out what's what.. The entire plot is full of holes and time line problems, not mention atrocious dialogue and bad acting from Radha Mitchell. It might have been that her character was written just that poorly, but she certainly didn't do anything with it to make it better.<br/><br/>The movie does have its bright spots. Gans did a wonderful job with the sets and with the creatures. Those were spot-on, and probably worth the matinée admission for fans of the game series. Just know that the outcome will not resemble what was presented as the story in the game, and no matter how many ways you look at it...it will not make sense. The little girl did a good job in this one as well, aside from playing Sharon like a whiny 3 year old instead of the 9 year old she was supposed to be. That was probably Gans' fault though.<br/><br/>Easily the highlight of the movie was the Pyramid Head character. Unfortunately he was on screen too seldom and with no explanation as to what he was or why he was there, and he pretty much was wasted in this one.<br/><br/>I think its fair to say that Gans and Avary almost entered Paul Anderson territory with the treatment they gave to the SH story. Almost. Anderson's butchering of the Resident Evil story was still worse though, but Avary seemed to want to give Anderson's screenplay a run for the title.<br/><br/>Finally, for the people who say that a good movie will leave you wondering at the end, will leave you to your imagination to fill in the blanks...well, kind of. Think of Memento and Sixth Sense, movies that did this well. Those had good scripts and good acting and good directing. Silent Hill leaves you guessing because it had none of those elements, it makes no sense at all. It contradicts itself, it talks circles around itself, and no amount of spin can change that. Its just not a good movie. It deserves every bad review it gets. The fact that the studio refused to advance screen it for critics should be clue enough that even Sony knew this movie was bad.<br/><br/>I can only hope that there is a movie version of Silent Hill 2 made, and whomever helms it LEAVES THE STORY ALONE!"

","Hey people this film is amazing if you are fan of the silent hill series. I can see how some do not like this because the closure to film is a bit sketchy. If you want to get freaked out and have some gore then go see this. Definitely go see this if you loved the games because it is so enjoyable. Probably the best ending violence scene of any horror movie.... GO CHECK THIS OUT JUST TO ENJOY. Do not criticize unless you have seen this movie. It may not have the best storyline for the non-gamer but it does stay true to the game unlike Resident Evil and others. The critics have been very crude to this film in which I believe it is the best video game adaptation turned film. If you think its too much money to go see then go to a matinée or something it will not disappoint the sound is so loud and it makes your cringe."

",">>Major Spoilers Ahead<< This movie is probably the best I've seen this year, and definitely the best game>movie adaptation.<br/><br/>The acting was a bit rusty, but, hey, if u played the games u'll know that the acting is bad.<br/><br/>Th game starts off well, were we first find out that Sharon sleepwalks, and that she keeps mentioning a place called Silent Hill.<br/><br/>So, Rose, the woman who adopts Sharon, takes her to silent hill, disregarding the protests of her husband.<br/><br/>And so, the whole horror thing starts.<br/><br/>Those who have played the games will recognise the monsters and music immediately and know wat kind of meaning the monsters hold.<br/><br/>The Grey Children - Represent the children who bullied Alessa wen she was at school.<br/><br/>The Patient Demon (Straight jacket monster) - Represents suffering, as they rive as in pain.<br/><br/>The Nurses - Represent Lust, hence the big breasts and the short skirts.<br/><br/>The Janitor (Colin) - This dude ain't in the game, but represents the tortured soul of the man who raped/beat Alessa as a child.<br/><br/>Pyramid Head - Manifestation of fear and guilt.<br/><br/>I think the whole story had religious meaning, with the thorns at the end (crown of thorns anyone?) the cults mentions religion, the church, heaven and hell, etc.<br/><br/>I knew this movie wouldn't be taken well with the audience, and the box office from the start, i just knew it, but i liked it and recommend it to those who like a good gore movie, and those who like a movie that makes you think.<br/><br/>Wat I would change - The whole scene were Alessa explains everything to u, u could include it, just don't do her speaking over the images, let the audience figure it out for themselves, that would of been better.<br/><br/>The Ending - This is my interpretation of the ending, urs may be different, thats the magic of SH ^^.<br/><br/>I think Rose died wen she crashed her car, and she is now in purgatory.<br/><br/>Lets think about it, there are three realms of SH, Heaven, Purgatory and Hell.<br/><br/>Heaven is the SH that Chris is seeing, basically the same as it really is, Purgatory is the foggy world, were Rose is trapped, and Hell is the dark/nightmare realm.<br/><br/>Rose died in the crash, and she now wonders Purgatory waiting to be judged, same with the cult members and Cybil. Why they are in Purgatory is unclear yet.<br/><br/>Thats my interpretation, urs may be different, which is fine, thats wat SH is all about.<br/><br/>Thnx for reading.<br/><br/>Go watch the movie with a open mind, those who haven't played the game may get a bit lost, but its got a great gore factor, which is always good, ^^.<br/><br/>9/10, the acting could of been better, and the story could of been improved, but overall great movie, cant wait for a sequel."
"sandplasma","7","3","6","22 April 2006"," A good film with some faults. Worth it.
","I must agree with the previous comment. The movie does a good job in most areas and can stand on its own. Knowing it was based on a game may help it with younger audiences but I believe older audiences who have never heard about the game will also enjoy the film. The film itself was a bit long but that seems to be alright since the movie gets better in the latter half.<br/><br/>The acting does get a little worn by the middle of the movie and one can see very cliché and cheesy lines filled with no emotion by the main character. This was about the time I thought to myself 'oh no..it's going to be a bad movie..' I am happy to say however, that the movie did get a lot better towards the middle and end. I recommend it to anyone seeking a drama and not so much a scary movie. Although it has its scary parts it does a better job of giving great visuals and creating a sense of mystery more than anything. Do Enjoy."
"JasonMovie","8","3","6","22 April 2006"," Everyone should see this movie!
","RESIDENT EVIL - very popular series, very bad movie.......FINAL FANTASY - most popular series ever, highly disappointing film ...........DOOM - highly acclaimed action series, by far the worst game-movie adaptation yet ...........SILENT HILL - very popular horror game series...very satisfying film...whew, finally! I saw SILENT HILL on it's opening night at the 7:30 showing with a half-full theatre. I've always liked going to movies on opening nights with a lot of other people - no real reason, it just seems to, and I'm sure a lot of people agree with that unexplainable feeling, enhance the experience of the film. This is especially true when it comes to horror movies.<br/><br/>SILENT HILL is not totally a horror movie - I would personally say it's mainly a thriller/suspense. However, it does have its shares of scary and disturbing scenes, to which I will touch on later in the review.<br/><br/>As far as the fans of the SILENT HILL video game series go, I'm positive just about all of them will be very pleased. The movie looks, sounds, and overall feels dead-on to what the games had. Especially as specific as camera movements - in certain scenes that happened in the games, the camera tilted a certain way, and was done perfectly the same way in the film. Even the famous, and undeniably erie, music from the SILENT HILL games was used in the film. I'm telling you, if you're a fan of the series, this film WILL NOT disappoint you.<br/><br/>For those of you that have never played and/or heard of the series, that's perfectly fine - all that means is that you're in for a very unexpected surprise! It has it's creepy moments, it's drama moments, and it's downright scary moments - guaranteed to satisfy any boyfriend-girlfriend couple looking for a good scary movie with friends.<br/><br/>Of course, I must say that this film has its weaknesses. By no means do these weaknesses completely ruin the film - in fact, they merely put small dents in it. But the fact is that they are there, and unfortunately, they are rather obvious. These weaknesses are almost entirely in dealing with the film's storyline. What the film did was, take several chunks of story lines from the games, and put them together with some fill-ins to make a completely new storyline.<br/><br/>While, unlike basically all the other film-adapted games, SILENT HILL sticks almost entirely to the story of the games, it is a rather incoherent one. The first hour of movie, expect NOTHING to be explained. Which is OK, because too much explaining early on ruins surprises that could occur later in the film. However, as the film goes further and further on, it's harder and harder to follow exactly what is REALLY happening, and WHY. It's not really a confusing story, its just hard to piece together. Unless you're an absolute die-hard fan of the games, and played through them enough times to be able to write your own book about them, you'll be fairly lost, while not entirely confused, if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Now, to sum it up - THE GOOD: - The movie sticks to the game series. I can't stress enough how good a job they did of this. If you've watched the other films that are adapted from games, they are completely ruined by making up their own story lines and making the film look nothing like the game. SILENT HILL is an almost mirror image of the games, and, while a tad incoherent, the story is very true to the games.<br/><br/><ul><li>It has a plentiful share of shocks and scares. Some scenes are filmed very creepy, using limited light and deteriorating, dark backgrounds. Other scenes are just downright disturbing, and could leave you with a rather unpleasant feeling in your stomach. There are at least three or four scenes I can remember seeing half the audience gasp and cringe at.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music. That's all I need to say about that. I guarantee you'll dig the soundtrack.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD: - Incoherent story could turn some people off who don't like trying to think about it and figure it out.<br/><br/><ul><li>The acting, while for the most part is quite good, is sometimes a little awkwardly wooden.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, and I highly suggest seeing it. Don't let any bad reviews of the film stop you - that's really the only reason I can think of for this movie not doing as good as it would be able to.<br/><br/>You want a good horror flick, this is the one to see until the summer blockbusters come rolling in. And if enough word of mouth goes around, I could easily see SILENT HILL being a failry big money-raker."

And hurrah for another woman lead, even though Sean Bean is adorable. <br/><br/>Let's keep him for the sequel... please!<br/><br/>Everyone in the theater was quiet as death throughout the whole feature, with an occasional gasp and ""oh my God"" by the graphic extremes by these talented artists who created a very realistic version of a well-loved game (if you never played the game, take a week-end, pull all the blinds, turn the sound up on the TV, and scare the tinkles out of yourself).<br/><br/>One last comment... I will never hear emergency sirens in the same way again."
"sonofffej","Null","3","6","22 April 2006"," I have just seen this movie...
","...and I am amazed. Finally, someone in Hollywood took the time to research the source material on which their movie was based. Not only is it a good expression of the themes and ideas found in Silent Hill, but it is a good movie on it's own. The sub par acting is forgiven, perhaps even OVERSHADOWED because of how excellently the story played out. The direction was excellent, the action was intense and surreal, while still maintaining a fearfulness to it. Everything gory was over the top. The ending left me with chills. I was thinking maybe the fumes were causing hallucinations, or perhaps the ""darkness"" chose who could see it, but Silent Hill being an allegory for Hell or purgatory really blew me away. Worth seeing."

","For the first time in cinema history has there been a movie that was so good... AND especially and most notably a milestone, and most probably a benchmark for any and all future game to movie adaptations. For a person who has religiously played all 4 games, and to have a notable knowledge of the game info, this game was the best that i could have ever hoped for and more. I had been waiting for even the idea of this movie being made for 6 years since i played the first silent hill.. BUT many say that people didn't like it or aren't going to like it because they didn't play the games. I disagree. The people who aren't going to like it, are the people who don't want to spend their time trying to understand a movie. People who though the matrix ending was stupid need be weary of this movie, because if you cant understand the meaning in all it's glory of something, no matter how simple (the matrix) or how complex (vanilla sky) then you will really not like this movie. however, if you do understand these types of movies where there is a deep passion for one thing. an emotion, a statement, or a fact.. then you will absolutely LOVE this movie for everything it stands for. these people regardless of who they are may possibly want to explore the games if they have not. and for us who have. we have found what we always wanted."
"tfujishinaf","10","3","6","22 April 2006"," Screw you naysayers! I Loved it!
","Not only was it by far the best game adaptation yet, it was suspenseful, intelligent, violent, and visually stunning. I read the reviews right before I went to go see it and I watched in disbelief. I can't understand why so many people didn't like it. I, for one, played the game so I remembered some of the characters/events and I had a better grasp of the storyline. So I suppose that is why I didn't have trouble understanding it but even my girlfriend (Whom had never heard of Silent Hill before) didn't get lost at any point of the movie and also loved it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is a great ""must see"" movie that you can enjoy even if you never played the video games. Also if you hear anyone saying they didn't like it spit in their face."
"adema29x","10","3","6","22 April 2006"," Finally a video game adaptation that doesn't suck!
","I can not help but give this 10 stars, the film does perfect justice to the game. The entire opening sequence reminds you of playing the Silent Hill games. I am amazed that people say this is a terrible movie, if you understood the story of Silent Hill as us gamers do you would probably love it as much as we do. Another thing I would like to point out is that if you personally believe this is a bad game adaptation and that it is horrible, you obviously haven't seen House Of The Dead, Alone In The Dark, or Bloodrayne, yes all Uwe Boll films. Back to Silent Hill though. The film captures the feeling of the game perfectly, and it amazes me how nearly every building exactly duplicates every detail of its video game counterpart. The school and the hospital especially. And while Pyramid Head has limited appearances he still seems to steal the screen. Awesome! A great film for fans of the games."

"smokeyeupatorus","8","3","6","22 April 2006"," Finally a good video game to movie translation!
","Let me start by saying that while I am a fan of video games, I have never played the Silent Hill game. Regardless, I found Silent Hill (the movie) to be quite entertaining, and well worth the price of my matinée' admission ticket.<br/><br/>French director Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) delivers once again! After wading through years of good video games turned into bad movies we are finally rewarded with SH.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. SH does have it's fair share of hiccups (most notably some moments of stale acting and/or weak writing), but on the whole these things did not ruin the movie for me, by any means. I may be in the minority on this, however, for the three friends that accompanied me to the flick commented that it did have a tendency to bother them.<br/><br/>SH has a very stop-and-go flow to it, which felt almost like 'levels' in a game, and much (if not all) of the action was very video game esquire. I feel this was deliberate and added to the whole experience but it may bother many movie-goers, especially those who don't play video games.<br/><br/>Now, with those minor complaints out of the way let's get to the good stuff.<br/><br/>Gans gives the audience amazing visuals which includes amazing sets, creative and interesting (and sometimes dizzying) camera-work, and beautiful/horrifying makeup and CGI effects. Nothing lacking in this department at all! <br/><br/>The action in SH is quite intense and generally very nightmarish. There is a handful of jumps, a healthy amount of gore, and a whole lot of creepiness. Trust me, you'll get excited every time Gans let's you know the action is coming (which he does through use of a cool little effect, which felt almost like a 'loading screen' but much more exciting). More than once I found myself laughing out loud in moments of pure joy at the horror that was on screen. It was a blast!<br/><br/>By far though, my favorite element of SH was the fantastic sound design! Your ears will not be disappointed! Chilling screams, whining metallic screeches, and of course the unearthly creature noises. From what I understand sound was very important to the success of the SH game and this is definitely reflected in the film. SH delivers big time in the sound department. I was blown away.<br/><br/>I give this movie two thumbs up. Despite it's flaws, it still beats 95% of the horror I have seen in the past few years. Go with some friends, and without too many expectations and I guarantee you'll have a blast. If nothing else, it is worth the price of admission just to witness this one great scene (once you see the movie you'll know which scene I am talking about!) Kudos Christophe Gans! I loved Brotherhood of the Wolf, and I loved Silent Hill. I am eagerly awaiting his next project. Go see Silent Hill! Pyramidhead rules!"

You will definitely be buzzing about this one for days afterwards. And I know I am going to go see it again. Many things stay true to the game, including the opening which always begins the same. The movie is scary in a creepy sort of way and doesn't degenerate into cheap scare tactics. It uses pure disgust to instill fear, and the fact that you often don't know what is going on adds to the fear. The only thing I am leaving you is: Beware the barbed wire. Ugh...

Most of the recent horror/thriller movies have been mildly entertaining, but this film definitely does not fall into this category. Throughout the movie, I kept wondering many of different conclusions, all of which were wrong. You never know who's correct, who's evil, or who denies the truth. BEST $8 I've ever spent on a movie!

","Let's establish this--I loved The Ring. This movie is, however, an abomination. It has just enough perverse artistry to sometimes be effectively sadistic in it's imagery. At other times the movie moves tediously over familiar gound. There is some adequate acting, but in my opinion the main character is weakly acted. If you'd like seeing people torn apart in the Coliseum, go to see this movie. Some scenes in this movie are the equivalent. It should be rated NC17 for VIOLENCE, but a guess a rating of R just for violence should tell you something.

","I have been a fan of horror movies since I was a little kid. I have seen all types from gore feasts to slasher flicks and everything in between. I found Silent hill to be confusing with no clear plot. The special effects were not badly done, but it takes so much more to make a movie worth watching. I found the foggy setting much more likely to put me to sleep then cause a fright. In fact I had trouble staying awake through the movie and was thankful for the caffeine in my soda. The movie was much to long and slow paced.<br/><br/>I'll admit I have never played any of the Silent Hill games so my opinion is from that perspective. I would think that any movie based on a different medium be it a book, game or play should be able to stand alone without prior knowledge of it's origins and still entertain the watcher. If done extremely well, have the watcher seek out that which inspired the film. Guess I won't be going out to by any of the games."
"senorsolo007","3","4","10","23 April 2006"," There was a good series here. It's gone now.
","*Be forewarned, spoilers herein* As a fan of the series, I was excited about seeing this movie. I've always been fascinated by the plot lines of the Silent Hill games (especially 2), and was intrigued about what this movie would bring to the Silent Hill universe.<br/><br/>I sat down and loved the first half-hour. It was tense, but not over the-top. It had beautifully, absolutely stunning cinematography, and a plot that could have gone somewhere interesting. Aside from a soundtrack (taken almost completely from the Silent Hill video games), it was all downhill from there. Quite simply, I hated this movie for the very reason that I'm sure many fan-boys will love it. It's intense, gory, pulse-pounding, sports familiar locales and enemies, and is in-your-face.<br/><br/>The plot is, in large part, taken from the original Silent Hill video game, which, in turn, took most of its plot from classic horror movies like Rosemary's Baby. Echoes from past horror movies have, of course, been completely removed, such that the plot is gutted, and almost completely revamped. While this does not bother me immensely as I was never terribly attached to the Silent Hill 1 plot, it is troublesome in that it is replaced by something far worse. I was never captured by the plot of the original, but the one in the film was a shadowy reflection of the first game's depth.<br/><br/>Many of the creatures from throughout the games pop up, especially from 2, for some inexplicable reason. The most memorable of these is Pyramid Head, who quite literally destroys a character in possibly iconic scene, in his attempts to hunt and kill the lead. But wait. Pyramid Head was an executioner, wasn't he? This is more like torture. And wasn't he supposed to hunt those who have sin or some sort of inner guilt? The main character just doesn't have that.<br/><br/>In fact, the main character has just about nothing going on, personality-wise, except for her drive to find her daughter. In fact, I didn't feel any real connection to any of the characters, which I should have, even if only to make their gruesome deaths somehow important or impacting for anything other than shock value. For a series that is all about interesting characters that have a purpose, the ones in this movie sure did disappoint.<br/><br/>For the main character, there is little to no character development, really, other than the fact that she is willing to make a deal with the devil to save her daughter. Who is also the devil. Except not. Sound confusing? Well, yes and no. It's easy to figure out what it means, except once you do, you're very let down. Forget the hours of thinking back, trying to figure out what it meant; all it does is take things from past games and splice them, clunkily I might add, together.<br/><br/>Basically, the intention of the movie is for the audience to absorb the atmosphere, some of which, I will admit, they got right. But they added one unforgivable thing, beyond any other flaw in the entire film: gore. The Silent Hill series, at heart, is not a gore-fest. When James sees Maria executed by Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2, it shows almost nothing, focusing more on, for example, how her hand goes limp as she tries to reach through the elevator door. In the film, characters can be burned alive, ripped in half by barbwire-like metal vines, grabbed by said vines and wrapped in them until the character dies, stabbed in the throat, or have their skin literally ripped from their bodies.<br/><br/>Let me tell you, folks, this was not fun to watch. Silent Hill should be a psychological horror, focusing on how the atmosphere itself is unnerving, and what will be done to the characters if they're caught, but without actually showing it. Less is always more in a horror movie. And with a movie like Silent Hill, it could have been terrifying and still pushed its limits, without copping out by avoiding the gore.<br/><br/>For my money, it didn't evoke any legitimate thought, was too much about the gore, and just plain didn't captivate me. Three out of ten stars. Save your money and go buy a used copy of Silent Hill 2 on PS2, XBOX, or PC: it'll cost you a couple about the same as a movie ticket, and you'll get an experience, rather than this ill-equipped knockoff."

","You know... I wrecked my car on the way to go see this movie. It was just a scratch, mostly, so I was still able to make it to the showing, but honestly, I think I should have taken it as a sign. Come to think of it, I almost wish the wreck had been a lot worse-- I might have been out thousands of dollars or dead, but either would have been better than seeing this movie.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that, had it been made 20 years ago, would have made for a great episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. In all honesty, the only reason I gave it a second star was for the humor value provided by the fact that the actors were actually trying to take the script seriously. Personally, I don't think I could have said, ""They used to say this place was haunted. I think they were right"" with a straight face, but then again the character that said it looked like a clown anyway so who could tell the difference? The rest of it was mostly similar to what you'd get if you recorded somebody running around in the video game and looped it. There had to be about a good hour of just watching characters walk, run, look around, and generally do other pointless crap that doesn't need an entire scene to demonstrate.<br/><br/>Absolutely awful. I only recommend it to people who aren't paying for their own ticket, in which case they can mock whoever did pay for it shamelessly."

"cyanidecyanide","1","5","14","22 April 2006"," Copious use of plot holes to disguise general lack of substance
","I missed the first 5 minutes of the movie, but I think I was able to follow all the movie just fine. It appears that I must also provide the following disclaimer, ""I haven't played the video games (and personally, now that I know its based on a video game, that would have been enough of a hint to avoid this movie)"". While I do like a movie that doesn't surrender its content to the viewer without some mental effort....this movie is far from that. Without giving away too much of the plot, this movie uses too many glimpses of a plot line and never delivers. It throws in token opportunities to leave the viewer with a sense of reasonable uncertainty but then aborts on the follow-through. Case example-at one point the main matriarch of the sanctuary/church warns the protagonist to not trust anything the ""demon"" will tell her. But, when she then immediate goes and confronts the demon (this is within minutes of the warning) she takes all that the demon tells her as complete fact without even struggling with the concept that it could be a lie (and, of course, the demon is telling the truth). I wonder if this was purely out of convenience, like the developers of the story don't want to now deal with this uncertainty at all. I expect this out of student-directed grade-school plays. The timelines also don't match (I can't expand on this without ruining the plot), character responses to presented situations lack any authenticity, pure cardboard (over-reacting, huge under-reacting, loosing track of their main motivation in the face of minor distractions (for instance, I am looking frantically for my lost child who I think is in immediate mortal danger....but I decide to search the school's records of a school she has never been enrolled in)). Further, the use of plot twists and clues is ridiculous. At one point, the protagonist finds a piece of a hotel room key in a rather bizarre place. This seems to have an unquestionable significance to the protagonist, indicating that her child MUST be in the hotel. The protagonist's husband, while searching for his wife, directs his efforts into discovering the old police records for the town, and immediately focuses his search on a barbershop (it is presumed) largely because it was owned by the deceased father of a police officer that is initially trying to help him. Low and behold, it is the right choice of action, because the barbershop files hold cornerstone evidence on the whole situation....how clever that husband of hers.....<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, wait for this one on the DVD rack.<br/><br/>Cyanide"

","I awaited Silent Hill with muted expectations: it was a video game movie, but it had received decent user reviews from this site. Let me spell it out: This might be the least entertaining movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot is confusing and convoluted, and most people in the audience, from what I could see, were lost in the first half-hour. The performances are barely satisfactory, meaning that they are the highlight of the film. The timing is very slow and methodical: there are no sudden frights, like in a slasher movie. This may work in some films, but it doesn't in Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The setting is remotely creepy, but nothing that hasn't been done before. The special effects are nice, but not worth wading through the rest of the movie. And the ending is, in a word, disappointing. To be honest, the movie worked better as a comedy. There were some parts that were funny, but weren't meant to be funny.<br/><br/>In conclusion, although this is a pretty bad month for movies, Silent Hill stands out as the worst of the worst. Instead, rent a classic film, and remind yourself why you go to the movies in the first place."

Sorry I just didn't get the point of it. It really wasn't worth the money to go see it. The woman didn't have to memorize very many lines. Her main line was this....,""SHARON!"" I strongly believe that the cop was compromised. I didn't really see the point of the husband, I mean seriously now.....what did his character really bring to the movie?

","Someone owes me $9.00 and two hours of my life back. I gave this a one, because I couldn't give it a zero. I've gotten pretty used to Hollywood taking creative license with video games, but this one should have been titled ""A Movie That Has A Thing or Two In Common With the Game Silent Hill."" I bet that was the working title, but some exec. said it was too long, so they shortened it to Silent Hill. I can remember playing Silent Hill. I can remember being so scared that I had to sleep with a light on. This attempt at suspense and gore is laughable at best.

"drcaswell-1","2","5","14","22 April 2006"," I'm sorry if you wasted 127 minutes of your life.
","I'm sorry, perhaps everyone who has commented so far saw a different movie then the one I wasted eight dollars on. I contemplated following in the footsteps of the ten or so people I saw walk out of the theater. Here's why you shouldn't waste your time and money.<br/><br/>First I'd like to start off with a comment about the acting in this film, which was both wretched and sad. I did not once believe the emotion that any of the actors attempted to convey, especially the female police officer. The only actor I'll give credibility to was Sean Bean, because he had one of the smaller roles in the film and he is all around a good actor.<br/><br/>Aside from the incredibly sub-par acting, the story line (oh, the storyline) was the same old regurgitated nonsense that I've seen in every ghost movie since The Ring. Not only was the storyline unoriginal and mind numbingly dull but there were incredibly large plot holes. I got so flustered with the pitiful attempt at a plot and the major lack or suspense and ""scare factor that I stopped caring entirely.<br/><br/>Ooo I enjoyed this little excerpt I found in the trivia section of the IMDb page for this disaster of a movie. Contrary to popular belief, Silent Hill hardly uses any computer generated imagery. The most notable use of CGI is the fog that drenches the town. Most creatures are live actors covered in latex and makeup. <br/><br/>And on this matter I am speechless because there are scenes in this movie that including burning child like creatures, a 12 foot pyramid head pulling the skin off of a woman in one clean motion, holes in the floor that appear to lead to a ""hell"" like place, bottomless canyons that stop the characters from escaping the town and (my favorite) and endless amount of barbed wire that whirs through the air in the ends maiming and killing people in the end.<br/><br/>This is not movie trivia....this is called a lie.<br/><br/>In conclusion please don't waste your time on a movie that attempts to scare you and be creepy because it'll just end up disappointing you and possibly ruining your night, as it did mine. Everyone in a movie theater should not laugh during a serious scene because the acting and screen writing is so pathetic as everyone did when I saw this film. I don't care if all you gamers out there that think this was a great Game crossover film get upset with this comment because you shouldn't be focusing your efforts on getting mad, you should focus your efforts on why you liked such a pathetic and feeble attempt at a film.<br/><br/>This is not a movie that makes you think, this is not a movie for the hardcore horror fans, this is a film for the simple minded sheep that pack themselves into the theater to see whatever trash floats in every week. I'm sorry if you found this film any good, I really am. Maybe someday you'll grow up."
"Irishinvazion","2","5","14","22 April 2006"," Am I the only one?
","""Are you kidding me?"" That's all I could think after watching Silent Hill on opening night. I guess I can't complain all that much. I didn't exactly have the highest hopes for this movie. Most movies that are modeled after a popular video game end up sucking in a hardcore kind of way (see Doom,Tomb Raider, Super Mario Brothers, Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat,etc). The only thing that fueled me to spend some cash for the viewing of this movie was the fact that I love the Silent Hill games. I was wondering how Christophe Gans would translate the eerie feeling of hearing your radio go off...or the ""holy crap"" feeling of hearing a siren blast a warning to you that trouble was near. As the lights dimmed and I became engaged in the movie...I quickly learned that the acting was going to be far below par for a major Hollywood Blockbuster. Jodelle Ferland(Sharon) is one of the worst child actors I have ever had the displeasure to watch. Laurie Holden's (Cybil) acting left something to be desired. I could list all of the actors/actresses.....but it would all end up the same. Just poor acting all around.<br/><br/>The only excuse the actors could possibly have for their terrible performances would be to put it on their writers. Never in my day have I laughed so much at the dialogue in a movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for anyone...but just be on the lookout for some of Cybil's ignorant observations. The monsters aren't scary...not at all. I really did laugh out loud at the sight of some of the creatures. Don't worry though...it's not like you are going to care if anyone dies...you might actually cheer. If you are a fan of building up a character for an emotional attachment....you will be depressed at the result in this movie. I can't blame the director or the writers for this...because they had to take a game that took about ten or more hours to beat...and stuff it into a two hour flick. The game allowed you to care about your character because you were the character. The movie didn't have a certain ""spark"" that would allow you to feel for the people and what happened to them. The movie just felt clunky....as if it had something to say....but just couldn't spit it out.<br/><br/>Now that I've given you the bad part...I will try my best to shine some light on the good. The art design and special effects were very good. I thought at some points it felt a bit cartoonish...but not too much. I would also like to give props to Gans for taking on this task. Silent Hill is a very hard concept to bring over to the silver screen. He took a shot at it....though I felt he came up short of his mark. I would say that's about it on the good content. Sorry guys....it's just not that good.<br/><br/>This movie's overall lack-luster performances and B Flick horror creatures will more than likely leave you disappointed. The writers in this flick made George Lucas look like William Shakespeare. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone...UNLESS you are a DIE HARD Silent Hill fan. I still think even the most loyal of fans will be disheartened at the outcome. Let's just pray that someone in the not-so-distant future can take a good video game and make it into a great movie. That being said....don't hold your breath......."
"drowbot","1","5","14","21 April 2006"," All Style, No Substance
","Loved the games, very disappointed with the movie. The visual style & effects were dead on, but they totally left out a plot and the acting was less than amateur. This movie was terrible & my wife & I want our $16 back. The set design & costumes were the only high point of the film. But I think the creators focused so much on matching the eerie feeling of the game that the whole movie just became an excuse to show off the excellent visual design, with a lame attempt at a plot tacked on to the end. I never thought I'd say this, but Resident Evil 2 was a better video game-to-movie conversion, and I hated both of them. Save your $8 and rent one of the games. You will get a lot more for your money."

","I hate to say it, I really do, but it must be said; this is not deserving of 8 dollars and a night, possibly not even worth a rental even if you are the best fan in the world.<br/><br/>As a fan of Silent Hill I came to this movie expecting a great thrill ride, one similar to Jacobs Ladder (which is much better than this, WATCH IT). I wanted to hug this movie so tight and defend it so vigorously that I would fend off all critics even if I knew it was bad for a movie, but good for a video game movie. I can't do that. Half way through the beginning I chuckled at the girl's bad acting, then again at the flimsy reasoning to go to silent hill. And then with horrible lines during the middle like ""Everything is going to be okay,"" after Pyramid head just tried to kill them, or the ""What the F**K is going on!!!"" outburst that isn't fitting of Silent Hill's subtle nature.<br/><br/>And then there are the long scenes of our heroine who is just exploring again and again and again through fog, the underground *otherworld*, and then the hospital. The music rarely helps either, and instead of adding to the atmosphere it takes the audience away and isolates them.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that it tries to emulate the games in *every* way, and doesn't realize that its a movie and that there are many things that can not transfer from the game to a movie ADAPTATION.<br/><br/>Of course it does have its upsides; the music is good if you ignore whats going on in the movie, Pyramid Head is awesome (though really pointless), and the sets do have a silent hill feel to them.<br/><br/>Still its as coherent as this review is and is not worth seeing... here's to hope that Silent Hill will not be revived anytime soon as a movie. Its sad so very very sad... Team Silent better deliver with SH 5 or this franchise is dead.<br/><br/>So when thinking about going down to Silent Hill for some fun and relaxation remember I warned you."

","The Silent Hill movie is getting a lot of 9's and 10's from reviewers on this site. I'm not sure why.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the games. A *HUGE* fan. A huge, huge, huge, huge fan. But I was VERY disappointed with the movie.<br/><br/>Yes, there were some good things in the movie. There were some excellent ISOLATED SCENES. There were good visuals HERE AND THERE. The soundtrack was USUALLY good. SOME OF THE ACTORS did well. I'll admit all of that.<br/><br/>But.<br/><br/>The other 75% of the movie was lacking. I'm not sure why people are saying the movie was ""faithful to the games"" when the plot line was completely INCOMPATIBLE with the one in the games. Some characters were the different, and some characters were the same but the events surrounding them were different. But either way, it just didn't match up to the well-established story we know and love.<br/><br/>There were also a lot of moments where the atmosphere was not at all like what the games give us! The games are about loneliness, and isolation. In the games, there are never more than three people (or monsters) in a room at once. No, that's not because of technological limitations -- it's because the designers deliberately planned it that way. The movie, on the other hand, has several crowd scenes. In case you missed it, I'll repeat that -- CROWD SCENES. IN SILENT HILL. What??? Silent Hill is not supposed to be a place where you have a room with twenty people in it. Nor it is a place where you have a hallway with twenty monsters in it. That's ridiculous. It ruins the whole effect.<br/><br/>And speaking of ""ruining the effect,"" let's talk about how often this movie has us LEAVE Silent Hill. The games remove us from the setting SOMETIMES, and VERY SLIGHTLY. The movie, on the other hand, removes us from it FREQUENTLY, and VERY SEVERELY. Right after a creepy scene in the foggy snow, it will suddenly cut to a screen full of bright green trees and blue sky -- two things that have NO PLACE in a Silent Hill movie.<br/><br/>Like I said, the movie did a lot of things right. But not nearly enough to carry the weight of the entire movie. I found myself shaking my head and sighing JUST AS OFTEN as I found myself impressed, if not more so. It does do a lot to make fans of the series happy, but it also does quite a lot to make them furious. The bottom line is, the Silent Hill series is something I love and feel protective over, and when people sully its good name I feel offended. Five stars out of ten."

Apparently, if you are a geeky fan boy who spends their spare time playing video games and want to watch a game re-created in movie form; you will probably enjoy this movie.

"schultzclan6","5","3","7","31 August 2006"," Stupid, unintentionally funny, but still enjoyable
","Upon being in a basement in my friend's house at midnight, I was forced to watch a horror flick loosely based on a video game. I had never heard of ""Silent Hill"". I am not a fan of horror, but this film gave me a whole new perspective of what horror is about.<br/><br/>Although I simply do not scared easily, the element of fear in the beginning was so tight that I was almost freaking out while the movie unraveled. A lady named Rose is bringing her daughter, Sharon, who needs to be institutionalized, to a haunted area named Silent Hill, the place of her orphanage. She is supposedly drawing disturbing images on the way there without recollection of drawing them at all, while at the same time, a cop is ""stalking"" them.<br/><br/>Once Rose arrives in Silent Hill, things changed for me. It was eerie bright, and Sharon was lost. As she follows her daughter, things go dark and creatures begin attacking her. This is where I believe the element of fear was now lost, as my friend and I laughed at the creatures. Things were pretty confusing, especially when the armless man popped out and dead janitors and bugs. Why this is all happening was not clear to me, but kept me interested. As I watched, things seemed to be slowly unraveling, as the cop and Rose team up to find Sharon and escape the monsters of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Once Rose, the cop, and a new cast member Anna enter a church in which the monsters cannot habitate, the movie seemed to slowly transfer from horror to action/drama. For me, this is where I lost the movie and the potential it had seemed to go to waste. Christians that spoke in poetic literature said that Rose and the cop needed faith of God to destroy the demon that held her daughter captive. I being a die-hard Christian, was delighted that Christianity was playing a role in horror. However, I was in for a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>The moment the leader of the church saw Sharon's picture, she yelled ""Witch!"" and starts attacking with her ""electricians"" and ""principals"" for no apparent reason. The cop tells Rose to go on alone while she takes care of the church members. The element of fear was back, but the movie was still confusing. As the movie unraveled, certain things made sense, but the story was extremely complex and I can still not understand due to the fact there were some plot holes the size of craters.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the film for you, but I will tell you that the movie lacks intelligence and some of its potential is laid to waste. They mock Christianity by making them ""witchunters"", and the creatures there are outright hilarious, and I couldn't help myself from laughing except for one scene of creatures that freaked me out. There is also some unnecessary language that occurs randomly, and there are some extremely disturbing images, such as people getting ripped to shreds.<br/><br/>Not to say the film had its good points. For some strange reason I was enjoying myself, and the action was fantastic. I also liked the music, but other than that, most of the movie just played out its lack of intelligence and wasted most of the potential it had. Overall, I found it a fun film. It gave me a new respect for horror in some ways. 5.4/10"

But by the end I was sourly disappointed, most of the sets were good, in fact all the ones that weren't in CGI were good. I am not a fan of CGI in any film, and in this film it was used way too much, there were some creatures that could have just been actors with good make-up and costumes on, but instead money was wasted on bad CGI. The acting on the other hand was good, most of the cast are women, and there are some parts where their screaming is a deafening scream, way to loud to be able to stand for any length of time.<br/><br/>The story was set close to the game which is always good, but nothing was properly explained as to why it happened. If they thought explaining it some more in a sequel was a good idea, I recommend that they don't and that they make sure everyone soon forgets about this film.<br/><br/>Directing was okay, but the way the camera was used in some parts was completely wrong for this type of film, and even more-so for the mood that they were trying to set. The real make-up that was used looked very good, but overall this was not a scary movie, did not keep me on the edge of my seat, and nothing really happened until the last 45-30 minutes, which is terrible for any film, but certainly one that was 2hr 15 minutes long.<br/><br/>Do not watch if you like to be entertained."

","I have to say that Silent Hill movie has one the most idiotic scripts I've ever seen in the movies. Mind the 3d effects, computer graphics and beautiful nature/ghost city, and you don't have anything that remains. <br/><br/>There is just not a bit of logic in the entire plot. The characters act stupid and talk stupid.<br/><br/>The movie is not scary by any means, it is just crazy, dumb and boring. If you can turn your brains off while you are watching the movie though, you might even enjoy the soundtracks and cool monsters. Our friends and I, after watching this movie, were completely shocked and glanced at each other - we couldn't imagine that someone can produce this kind of garbage and actually trying to advertise it."

","This movie was a travesty. plain and simple. Firstly, the movie is convoluted and lacks unity. While affectively tying it together (for the most part) at the end, throughout the movie I found myself ready to leave the theater multiple times, because the same phenomenons continued to occur without explanation. This movie is not appropriate for anyone who has issues with gore, seeing as some of the images portrayed would send the hardest 'nam vets crying home. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the movie does keep the attention of the viewers, and does have a very interesting summation.. I also felt the ending was particularly unique, though abrupt.<br/><br/>Another major flaw was the poor ""explanation"" if it can be called that, regarding the futures of the two main characters. Considering this movie was fairly lengthy, I feel the director did a poor job of managing the time and omitted what could have been vital information pertaining to the plot in favor of flashy and, frankly, disgusting, ""thrilling"" action. <br/><br/>If your in search for a ""Saw"" style movie, with lots of blood and distorted bodies, this may satisfy your appetite, but if your interested in a more coherent, developed movie, that won't cause post traumatic stress disorder, I'd advise you to keep on lookin'."

","Lamentably one of the worst films I have ever seen. Anyone who describes it as anything but ""poor"" or ""ridiculous"" obviously needs help. The plot stems from a series of ""Why on earth would you do that?"" flaws and the ending makes ""Hellraiser"" look evocative. The only scene of remote interest is the beginning, and even the use of primordial child screams seem clichÃ©d. ""Silent Hill"" tries too hard to inspire a reaction in an audience who are essentially there for a quick scare.<br/><br/>If you want to suggest this film as ""arty"" perhaps you need to redefine the word, this film does little to interest the audience and it felt like no time had actually elapsed between scenes.<br/><br/>The only remotely ""scary"" part of this film was releasing that you had sat down that long watching such an abhorring film.

I did however, think it was like the games, but I just didn't get the same eerie, creepy feeling from the movie. I was also very unimpressed with the acting in this film. It seemed too fake. the most important thing for an actor to do is make you feel like your in the movie, or you can somehow relate to him/her. I felt nothing in this movie. I think that with a little more thought this movie would have been awesome, but it looked like they just threw it together!

A terrible Science horror fiction supernatural, stupid effects, mind boggling, BORING, lame attempt of a movie. Seriously, the acting was 3rd rate too. You'd expect better from Radha Mitchell but it's like her heart wasn't in the role. Some scenes reminded me of the game, that was the only good part when they go in the school etc but overall, this was an embarrassment to be honest, the storyline lacked any sort of real conviction.<br/><br/>If there was a vote for the worst movie ever, Silent Hill would receive it hands down.<br/><br/>GIVE THIS A MISS!!!"

","This film really was an awful attempt at transforming a computer game into a film. Firstly the acting was at times laughable - Sean Bean can't do an American accent, the little girl was clearly told to try an copy a similar role to that of most small children in current horror films, and instead of coming across as scary and weird - just looked ridiculous! The soundtrack also was timed in poorly, and wasn't suitable for this style of film. Lastly why the hell were the towns people talking like they were from the 1800's when they had been in this town for 30 years - surely they would be from the 70's????? and not talking in stupid riddles as well as using words such as ""thou"" or ""thoust shall not"". In the screening I watched 12 people left at different stages of the film which clearly shows how much this film stinks."

","***Contains Spoilers*** Okay, I know I'll upset those little game-crazy fans out there who ""love"" this woefully BAD film. I had not played the game, nor did i know this was based on a game when I went to see it. It simply looked like a good horror flick and I wanted to see it. Boy, was i in for one of the WORST horror film-going experiences since...BOTH versions of the EXORCIST prequels (""THE BEGINNING"" and ""DOMINION"") or last year's ALONE IN THE DARK (also shamelessly based on a video game, I understand). HORROR FANS--Be WARNED! While the film started off interestingly enough (especially once the lead actress got into the town), it soon started getting silly when these ash creatures start popping up and attacking her...and then are suddenly gone. HUH? I figured it would all be explained later on and I stuck it out. These creatures (and several others) were never really explained--they just WERE.<br/><br/>And, whoever the money people were who backed this...didn't they bother to READ the script? The town was abandoned over 30 years before...apparently just after the religious fanatics burned the one little girl (Alessa) as a witch. The girl doesn't die (or maybe she died later in the hospital???), but her anger and hate conjure up a demon (is this right??) that waits 20 + years to give birth to Alessa's daughter (!!!!???) and then leaves her at an orphanage for a couple to adopt. HUH!?! What kind of crap is that? The religious sect was interesting, especially since they were in whatever dimensional version of the town they were in. But when it was explained they were dead...and then Alessa's spirit (and her look-alike demon clone) comes and kills them (but they were already dead to begin with-burned to death in the fire they tried to kill Alessa with), the film just falls even flatter on its face than it already had! The non-ending has the heroine and her daughter returning home--but are somehow still trapped in another dimension (how they got there is not explained), leaving room for a (please God, NO!!!) sequel.<br/><br/>Video game players may get this, but as a film---it SHOULD stand on its own and NOT be propped up on the hope that its audience is familiar with the game it's based on. The ash creatures, acid-spitting blob people, brutally tortured guy in the bathroom and guy with a huge sword may mean something to game players, but to those uninitiated with the game (i.e. any fool unlucky enough to stumble into the theater expecting a coherent fright flick) only come away shaking our heads wondering what the heck those things were, why they were there and how they got there.<br/><br/>The film does have some things going for it. The transition between real world and other world is handled well. There is some truly horrific imagery in the film. The acting is fairly tolerable (especially Alice Krige). It had the ability to be something really unique, instead of just becoming an incoherent creature-fest. (When the lead meets the nurse mannequin things in the basement...I almost expected the creatures to break out into Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video! Ha!).<br/><br/>The film runs an agonizingly long 2 hours and 7 minutes...agonizing because it looses any coherence very early in the story and drags on and on. The person I saw it with was actually so bored, he fell asleep briefly (O' if only I'd been so lucky to have slept through this stillborn stinker, too). It's such a shame that such a great looking movie had nothing interesting, original, or intelligent to say.<br/><br/>This film was #1 at the box office last week, but it's take was only in the mid-$20 million range. Respectable, no doubt, but certainly NOT ""blockbuster"" by any means. I saw this Monday, and there were 25 or so people in the theater. Obviously word is getting out about this terror-turd. If it's NOT off the Top 10 list after next weekend, it surly will be by the following.<br/><br/>NOT even worth a DVD rental! My 2 hours and 7 minutes are forever lost in the otherworld purgatory known as SILENT HILL. SNORE!!!!!"
"jbertalmio","2","3","7","24 April 2006"," A major fan of the series highly let down by the movie
","This post might take about 2 and a half minutes to read. Take my word for it now, it's about 2 and a half minutes longer than you should spend on this cinematic abomination.<br/><br/>So, where to begin...how about the running time? That seems to tie into all the other fallacies pretty well.<br/><br/>The film is 2 hours and 5 minutes in length (but don't worry, it only feels like 3 hours). The first 30 minutes and about 20 minutes towards the end were semi-decent. But outside of that action, which is conveniently all shown in the trailers anyways, there is no single redeeming quality to the storyline. I guess I can understand the writer's desire to have a decent plot, so I didn't fault him for trying...at first. The problem with a horror film trying to take on a complex story line is that it takes away from the reason movie-goers paid to see it in the first place: The Horror.<br/><br/>What began (and I use ""began"" very loosely, as the madness set in about 17 minutes into this snore-fest) as a decent concept quickly took a wrong turn down a dirt road that ended in a cliff. Silent Hill ignored all the ""Bridge Out"" signs and floored it, taking the viewer on a ride into the depths of hell. Now, I don't mean that it was hellishly scary. It was literally hell sitting through this film. Somehow the writers managed to take a pure and simple plot from the video games, and turn it into a mind-boggling labyrinth of bore that would make a David Lynch story look like an R.L. Stine novel.<br/><br/>Nothing in this movie made sense. First the town was supposedly burned down, then it was overrun by religious fanatics, then the Grim Reaper became a good guy, but that was only a ploy to get to the other bad guys. 90% of the ghouls/zombies/demons in the movie were never explained. Somehow killer beetles were worked in, but they had human-like faces. And then a dead girl became a telekinetic...<br/><br/>But I digress. I will only give Silent Hill credit for one thing, and one thing only. The cinematics were stunning at times. During some of the monster attacks and abandoned town scenes the visual are truly stunning. However, for the rest of the film that just doesn't matter, as it's all so pointless and mundane that seeing a cool camera angle of a book store just loses any meaning.<br/><br/>The characters were pitiful. I honestly don't even know why Sean Bean's role was even in the movie. His worthless character alone added a completely unnecessary 35 more minutes.<br/><br/>I went into it expecting something groundbreaking, and I was especially excited because I love the games. I give it a sorely disappointed 2 stars out of 10. And, yes, I did ""get"" the ending. But by then I just didn't care.<br/><br/>2 out of 10...that's a whopping F- for all you scholars out there."
"Oneohtrixxx","10","3","7","22 April 2006"," Well Done Adaptation by an Underrated Filmmaker
","Nearly 5 years ago, Christophe Gans created cinematic gold with Brotherhood of the Wolf, an excellent but rarely viewed film. Beautiful settings, colorful characters, and an excellent plot that resolves very well.<br/><br/>Now, with Silent Hill, Gans has upped the ante and delivered far more vibrant characters, and settings that are all as crucial to the story than the characters are. Although it is much more accessible than Brotherhood, it is not a film for everyone. Gans definitely struck gold by creating a film for video gamers, but so much for video gamers that general film goers may become confused when the film ends. I am a fan of video games, and I have played the Silent Hill games to completion. This review is from my perspective, as a gamer and film lover.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell is wonderful as Rose, and a very underrated actress. Pitch Black and High Art were all very good films, but she really shines here. Rose's emotional turmoil when initially searching for her daughter within Silent Hill quickly transforms into determination as Rose deals with the evil that awaits her. Jodelle Ferland is great as Sharon and Alessa. Hopefully we'll see more of her in the future, as she is a fine addition to the few child actors who exist in film today. Laurie Holden as the female police officer Cybil is the perfect tough chick, but also portrays a caring and strong-willed individual. Sean Bean is a tad underused in the film, but the scenes with him and Rose in Silent Hill were very well done. The rest of the cast helped to serve a purpose in the history of Silent Hill, especially Kim Coates as the cop aiding Rose's husband in finding her and their daughter.<br/><br/>The film itself is not the typical ""Boo"" scare horror film, but rather an entrancing thriller, with a dash of hellish adventure. The surreal creatures are a highlight of the film, most notably 'Colin,' the Silent Hill school janitor turned contorted freak bound in barbed wire. Pyramid Head was a fine addition, a villain most Silent Hill gamers will recognize. His two big scenes are incredibly frightening, with the latter concluding in a very gruesome way. One major complaint from most viewers will be the ending. I enjoy films whose endings are left for the viewer's interpretation, and Silent Hill is no stranger to having a shocking and confusing ending. From my interpretation, the ending had to happen, and when you see Silent Hill, I guarantee your interpretation will be different.<br/><br/>Christophe Gans has made much improvement in his film-making by creating such a shocking, disturbing, and hauntingly beautiful film."
"dusk_whisper","3","3","7","22 April 2006"," Okay. Last night I went to see the Silent Hill movie- or at least, the film that was calling itself Silent Hill.
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Okay. Last night I went to see the Silent Hill movie- or at least, the film that was calling itself Silent Hill. <br/><br/>I really don't know what to say. I was let down on virtually every front, even after knowing about many of the millions of changes Gans had made before watching it. <br/><br/>I managed, eventually, to come to terms that Harry, LISA (Hello favourite character) and Kaufmann weren't in it. I managed to come to terms with the fact that he'd taken monsters from SH2 and leaving out most of the monster from 1, I managed to come to terms with the fact that he'd added an 'evil' Alessa, etc, etc. From the interviews, and how much he went on and on and on about loving the games and playing them for hours I truly believed that -somehow- he would make it so that none of those things mattered. <br/><br/>I was wrong. VERY wrong. <br/><br/>To the film's credit, the monsters, aesthetically, were beautifully done. But again, aside from the grey children and the janitor, none of them had any meaning with respect to the characters. It hurt the movie a lot more than I thought it would, for me at least. Also, the first little bit once Rose had entered Silent Hill was pretty good, when the grey children appeared and when she first wandered around the town. It really looked like Silent Hill. <br/><br/>The part where dark Silent Hill failed was that there wasn't enough of it. I mean, the needn't have gone all out and made it DARK dark Silent Hill, but just visually blacker. She spent too much time in church, in foggy SH and with other people. I never got the feeling, so intrinsic to Silent Hill, that she was going deeper into anything. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, the plot and ""symbolism"" (if it even deserves to be called that), were so blatant and in your face as to be irritating. *Cue giant cross behind Rose* *Cue psalm- repeat until brains of audience explode* *Cue cliché and tedious speeches about cult that bares no resemblance to the actual cult from the game*<br/><br/>I thought when he said one of the themes was going to be motherhood that it would be deep and rich and SUBTLE ( a word Christophe must never have heard of in his life), and instead the movie was littered with overused, overly dramatic crap that could have come out of a dollar store paperback. It was really laughably bad- not to mention the constant reiterations by Rose that "" Everything's going to be OK."" -_-<br/><br/>The most interesting character, in my mind, was Rose's husband- and he was also very well acted. I think Dahlia was fairly well acted as well, although her character was completely COMPLETELY different from in the games. Here, I would like to bring attention to the interview with Mr. Gans in which he said something like, "" You can't just put a girl in Jill's clothes and expect her to be the character."" I can understand developing the character more, I was all for that- but she really was NOTHING like Dahlia in the games. <br/><br/>Another unwelcome and badly done addition was the evil Alessa- who succeeded at being everything but frighting, with tacky lines that rivaled even Rose and Cybil's. I don't think it was the actress's fault. It was just a BAD idea. <br/><br/>Reversing and mutilating the cult from SH was also a big mistake, as was changing Alessa's back story. The cult was so much more subtle and mysterious than that in the games. It was powerful and creepy and interesting. Christophe just turned it into an excuse to go on his own personal tangent about themes that, if present in SH games, are always below the surface rather than screaming in your face as if you don't have the brains to figure it out. <br/><br/>The story was very predictable (not just for fans of the game, my friend, who hasn't played them, thought so too) and the constant barrage of 'fire' imagery and references was too much of a good thing. If they'd have kept it minimal it could have been powerful...but no, like with the religious aspect it was everywhere in the most obvious ways. Explaining the story in one huge lump was unsuccessful too, and didn't give you any satisfaction as to figuring anything out (not that there was much to figure out). If Rose had traveled (mostly) solo, and -slowly- found things out, it would have worked much better. You know, like in the games?<br/><br/>I could say more, but as it is I'm likely to get flamed to death for this. As such, I would like to say that I was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the film. I really trusted Gans, but he changed Silent Hill so much that it wasn't really Silent Hill anymore- more like his own personal playground where he randomly placed stolen locales and creatures. Silent Hill watered down with extremely bad plotting super-imposed over it and all the meaning sucked out. <br/><br/>I'm VERY disappointed. I knew he was going to change things, but I didn't expect him to change everything. Did he even -like- SH1? <br/><br/>If you like the games...I wouldn't go see it. But that's my opinion."
"robertmfreeman","8","3","7","22 April 2006"," A unique existential horror film
","The Silent Hill video games are most well known for the brutal, horrifying gore and violence within its dark industrial landscape. This is not, however, what makes the series unique.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is unique because of its existential introspection. Throughout every game, the story focuses less on the monsters around them, and more on the human characters that unwittingly created it, and are now trapped within it. It is not the monsters that pose the greatest threat to the characters, but the guilt and darkness within their own hearts. This brutally honest introspection is what made the second Silent Hill game both a hit with the survival horror crowd, and artistic, introspective people as well.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, the movie, continues to blur this line between 'rubber monster' horror and art, and succeeds in creating a wonderful movie in the process, by combining amazing visual effects (both through the bizarre monsters and the eeire abandoned, ash covered town of Silent Hill) and complex, flawed characters.<br/><br/>Everyone, for their own reason, deserves to be in Silent Hill. There are no true innocents in this or any other Silent Hill story, as even the children involved have their own dark past.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't exactly follow the traditional story of Silent Hill, but it perfectly recreates the look, feel and style of the series, creating imaginative and disgusting abominations, and a cerebral story that slowly unwinds, ending in a bloody climax that satisfies all, from the loyal Silent Hill fans, to the critical thinkers and to slasher-flick fans just out for a good time.<br/><br/>This universal appeal of Silent Hill is ultimately both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. Although appealing, its impossible to take the movie completely seriously. Vividly beautiful and tragic scenes are coupled with scenes of ridiculous gore and latex monsters. Don't get me wrong, this is quite possibly as good a slasher-monster-horror story can get, but it's ultimately still a slasher-monster-horror story, and cannot transcend the gap into cinematic art.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the creators weren't necessarily attempting to make classic cinema any more then they were making a cheap, brainless horror flick. They made a Silent Hill movie. It wasn't cheap or lazy, but on the other hand they didn't take many risks either.<br/><br/>It's still the best horror movie you'll see this year, and possibly even decade. Go see it now, you won't be disappointed. Don't make Pyramid-head come get you. ^_^ After viewing Silent Hill the first time, I ran into some friends on the way out who were on their way in, and happily purchased a ticket to watch it again."
"vdeogmrlr","7","3","7","21 April 2006"," This is the first time the following statement makes sense...
","""One of the best films this year is a video-game movie!"" <br/><br/>Silent Hill is the FIRST good movie based on a video game, it's not only good, it's great! The sets are done perfectly to match the ares from the games. The story is believable in the Silent Hill world and it works great in the movie world. All of the acting is done well except for Sean bean's character. The monsters (when there were any) looked great but they were sectioned off into scenes like the slither-man scene, the bug scene, the roach-men scene, etc., and the nurse scene reminded me a lot of a Marylin Manson video but they made the nurses ultra hot in a way only the Silent Hill people can make them. The soundtrack is from the same guy who does it for the games so you know it's good, they even play the intro song for the first game during the Tristar logo. The mood was set perfectly just like in the games with the fog, ash, etc. and they even gave it the grainy look from the games too. There are a few really good surprises in the film, the only one i'll give away though is that the nurse from the first game makes a small appearance.<br/><br/>Now, instead of kissing it's ass all the way, i'll note the substandard parts. Sean Bean's character was only added into the script because the company didn't like the fact that the movie was all female, and it shows. During the unraveling of the history of the town, it kind of looses a little steam because they had a ""Crucible"" thing going and it seemed like a different story altogether. There was only one cheesy scene (Rose walking through the townspeople to get to Christabella).<br/><br/>I give the movie an 8/10 and will own it when it comes out on DVD."

","The ending is nothing like the game, and it doesn't even offer a decent resolution. There's a scene in there that's going to offend many women, and likely a few men, and I'm not the type to be easily offended. The beginning is great, sticking to the plot, making sense, kind of suspenseful. But as it drags on the film only deviates and begins to make less and less sense to the audience. You can only guess, really, as to what they're trying to do. It sucked. The most disgusting image that'll offend some in the audience is when a woman is suspended by her arms by barbed wire, and two strands (The woman is wearing a dress) Slide up her dress, and a shower of blood falls from the top of the camera and down, eluding to some pretty disgusting stuff."
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","6","2","4","16 April 2020"," Overrated, but still watchable
","Taking a trip together, a woman and her daughter trying to see if they can help cure her illness are involved in an accident outside the town of Silent Hill, and once she finds a small group of survivors inside the town helps fight off the creatures lurking in the shadows to save her daughter.<br/><br/>This here does have some great parts to it. One of the better features here is that the film is filled with some completely outlandish and quite unearthly creatures. One character is attacked by a horde of gray-skinned mutant children with glowing orange wounds on the skin. Two more are approached by a bizarre, gray character with no face or arms and moves as though its bones are misshapen and spew acidic ash when wounded, while another creation crawls on its stomach with its feet bound up in an arch over its back alongside the giant metal-gate headed being and the mutated nurses to make for a genuinely creepy assortment of creatures living in the town. Also rather enjoyable here is the highly-energetic action scenes throughout here. There are plenty of quite jolting scenes in here, the highlight is a marvelously creepy scene where one character must try and squeeze their way through a corridor full of mutant nurses. When she realizes they're drawn to and seemingly activated by her flashlight, she turns it off and they mostly go motionless. She then slowly and cautiously must walk through them in the hallway, with most frozen and holding scalpels, but some slightly leaning in as if trying to sniff her. After one becomes agitated and twitches, it then lashes out, missing her but slicing the throat of another and This causes all of them to be lash out and strike each other, with her barely avoiding being cut. Another scene with a creature trapping two in a small room with a super-long blade, followed by a large swarm of flesh-eating beetles. There's plenty of big attack scenes in here to provide some thrills and plenty of really quite nasty and sadistic gore scenes which are all quite impressively rendered and look great. This here did have some good points although there were many problems with the film. One of the problems is that this might be confusing to people who aren't familiar with the game. Most things are left unexplained and there were times that any sort of explanation would've been better than what was offered. Not saying anything about what is going on with practically anything in the town at all, which is a complete mystery and there's no back-story given for anything or anyone. The incredibly confusing ending is one of it's biggest flaws, as it's so completely confusing and hard-to-understand that its inclusion leads no answers. Also quite damaging is the film's over-extended running time. This is mostly conveyed with the husband's useless, bloated scenes that add nothing to the movie but information which is given to us in the journey anyway. This is a movie that could benefit greatly by having about twenty or thirty minutes cut out of it, and it wouldn't be too surprising if that would've made the film any different. They have no effect on the outcome of the happening at all, and it's inclusion, along with the different plot-holes and confusion, really lower this one highly.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children in danger."

","Silent Hill is a movie you need to watch twice to fully understand it. I liked the film as it has lots of plots you have to put together in order to understand it as Dhalia claims Rose's daughter is hers which later on figures out is partly true. There are some mistakes in the movie like it wasn't shown where people live but as everything is empty, it guides out the sect church is not only the shelter, it's their home as darkness happens very oftenly. So whenever they live, there's a question how do they get their food. It was little explained in the hotel part but 30 years after there were no food left so even the film is not about the food you can not miss this part out. When the Rose came on the gas station, around her neck is the locket but when she was entering the town, she was wearing a pendant. Why is Rose unconsciousness if the vehicle hasn't collided in the rocks? Greatest mystery is tho took the Sharon out of the vehicle, was it Dhalia or the Alessa's dark side? In one part you see Sharon is hiding in Dhalia's apartment when fanatics are looking for her. So why she hasn't look for her (foster) mother and why was Dhalia in the town at that time? It's a little unexplained as Alessa hasn't hijacked her as the Sharon was found in the apartment later on.<br/><br/>I liked the end as the Silent Hill is just an ordinary abandoned town for unexpected visitors but you noticed on the end she is driving the same road which was cut off when the Cybil, police woman wanted to get back in the police station located in Brahms. When they entered they were in the second dimension so they couldn't leave the town afterwards. When the Alessa killed those fanatics, evil won that time and you can reassure that as Dhailia asked Alessa what have you became? She didn't forgive those people, she treacherously killed them. Rose is going back from the town with Sharon but you have to keep in mind, when she was in the underground Alessa's demon merged with Rose so Rose became immortal as the priestess Cristabella stab her in the heart but she wasn't killed. Demon took her soul so when she got home trough the road, her soul was trapped in the Silent Hill. You may notice the weather outside, it's foggy while her husband is waiting her the same room but in the other dimension when is sun. It's explained in the school part, demon does not want them so the school is only abandoned and there are no people. That's the reason entering the town was possible for them but was closed for the Rose."

The fog, the darkness, and the woods really put that slow scare factor. The creatures are really creepy, especially that Pyramid Head. His giant sword seems to pop up to the screen, even if this is a 2D film. The nurses are otherworldly, and their groans tingle my hair. The siren creeps the hell out of me. It scares me somehow now when I hear that kind of siren.<br/><br/>There are some gory scenes, but this is more of a psychological horror film. This really reminds me of a J-horror film, with its background music. Highly recommended for Halloween!"

","This is definitely the best horror film to come out between 2000-2013. It's damn fine for a video game adaption, the best for that matter. As a huge fan of silent hill and horror in film, this film deserved a bigger fan base.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into the plot, I'll leave that for anyone who wants to view it. The atmosphere and camera work are spot on, some great stuff for a horror film. The soundtrack is some of the best music I have ever heard in my life. They took a bunch of music from separate games, and put it into one amazing soundtrack. Too bad they never released a soundtrack for purchase, they makes me sad, I could listen to this stuff for hours. I sit through the credits every time I watch this film, how many films does any one actually look forward to the end credits, just this one. Songs include: 1. Tears of 2. Laura's theme 3.You're not here 4. wounded warsong 5. Promise(reprise). I highly recommend you-tubing these songs. These songs have so much emotion to them, they are sad, depressing, but enjoyable to listen to. They really make me think.<br/><br/>The film is 2 hours long, probably the only horror film that actually deserves that kind of runtime. I will admit, the scenes with Sean Beans character slow the pace down quite a bit, I'd like to see a cut with that just stayed in Silent hill the whole time. The visuals and sets look great, it's the real deal. The acting is a little iffy at times, Jodelle Ferland really didn't sit well with me at certain points. I don't know, she did a good job in Case 39 though. Pyramid head didn't get much screen time, I wish they would have unleashed him at the end climax. The Colin monster was pretty sick the first time I watched this, you would not want to get caught by that.<br/><br/>The sequel was very poorly made compared to this, even just frustrating at how they squandered it. Here's high hopes to a worthy third film."

","Oh, Silent Hill. A masterpiece, very close. An excellent standalone film, depends on your outlook. Deserves a lot more respect and love from everyone, even beyond horror fans and fans of the game, absolutely. <br/><br/>While only familiar with the game, the movie as a standalone film is very well done. As many reviews have stated, the atmosphere is haunting, making you want to take a trip back to Silent Hill whenever you get a chance. Its creepy, mesmerizing and intriguing all at once. This is not, per se, a horror movie. There is some violence, some rather gory scenes, but nothing too over the top or torturous or that we have not seen before. Rather, its a fantasy tale told with elements of horror. Yes, that does it justice. It's a complicated plot, that only becomes clearer with more viewings, and even then, you're better off reading forums and Q&A's for the many ways you can interpret the film.<br/><br/>Is it flawed? Unfortunately, yes. For a horror movie that runs for two hours, believe it or not, I found it short. The first hour flies by, making the viewer beg for more but the second act is rather slow and the third act is rushed. The time management of the film was poor, and if it had a stronger more engaging second act and more developed third act, this film would be superb and a true gem for Hollywood. Unfortunately, it was overlooked and went terribly wrong by promoting itself as your average horror film for gorehounds and horny teenagers. There is no sex. No jumpscares. No blood and guts throughout. Rather, what we get is a genuine scary fantasy film with a creepy atmosphere, great plot, amazing visuals, intriguing characters, and layers of complexity.<br/><br/>To sum is all up, it is what I call a beautiful horror film, or a fantasy tale with some horror elements mixed in. It's flaws lie in its ""target"" audience. If you are looking for a film to delve into and explore for two hours with an open mind and willing to understand, definitely add Silent Hill to your must see list. One of my favorite movies of all time, yes, of all time. If you're looking for a quick entertaining horror flick with gore, nudity and a spoon fed plot, don't view this film and give it a bad rating. It definitely deserves something higher than a 6.8 (current rating now), and closer to an 8. Good job Silent Hill, restoring our faith in Hollywood once more."

","I've been waiting 7 years for SH the movie. The film almost succeed, but was not able to create true FEAR. But, it's difficult to do so when you are not playing the game; & when your leading actress is not able to deliver all the goods. Who's to blame? Christophe Gans!!... Sean Bean is a better actor, why does he have to play a supporting role? Harry Mason was right there under our eyes... the Director should have kept us under constant fear and uncertainty: we don't have to understand everything to appreciate a film.<br/><br/>The reconstruction of the ENVIRONNEMENT is excellent; the Editing is very good; the acting is acceptable (par la peau des fesses...) Not enough BLOOD, VIOLENCE and CONFUSION.

","I've never heard of the games but I just saw the movie...and it was pathetic It starts off with an interesting enough premise: a young girl has recurring nightmares about a place called Silent Hill but also sleepwalks so her parents are understandably distressed. (Adopted) Dad wants to keep taking her to the professionals even though the ""medication doesn't work"" while (adopted) Mom decides the best idea is to take her on a road trip to Silent Hill - a recently deserted ghost town.<br/><br/>The locals of the neighboring town deny the existence of Silent Hill, as per usual of hillbillies in a horror movie. Meanwhile Dad checks out the place on the net and goes to rather extreme measures to stop his family going i.e. canceling their credit cards, and its here the story stops being a story.<br/><br/>After an hour of a woman running around shouting ""Sharon"", some weird cgi, a cop running around shouting ""Rose"", and her husband running around shouting ""Rose"" we learn the cgi comes in waves and there's only one place that is safe from it.<br/><br/>The only storyline is a five minute speech by a ten year old girl saying she was raped and shunned by religion, then the scarred remains of her kills everything.<br/><br/>It seems you could only enjoy this movie if you're a fan of the game or easily spooked by creepy confusion."

But when she narrowly avoids a shadowy figure on the road and crashes her car, losing track of Sharon, she begins to explore this unknown place. But Rose has unknowingly entered a plane trapped between heaven and hell, a place filled with death and horror.

If Lewis Caroll ever came back as a zombie, this is what he would make! . There are some bland moments, (in some scenes I just wanted another monster to jump out and start tearing people apart), but since the movie is 2 hours long, there are more demons than dullness. And just as much drama, the plot is excellent (a bit far-fetched and provocative for some, though)! Welcome to Silent Hill, and prepare for a trip you will never forget...."

","this film has a very suggestive title. silent hill. yes, suggestive. i think though i would have preferred the title hushed hill, which is more suggestive and tickles the chill bones. it starts with harry crashing his automobile and his daughter goes missing into the foggy void. he has to find her, but first he must find the 3 keys. the film awakened my creative juices and i dug up from under my bed a book i had started many moons ago. it was called hushed hill and was about a man who gets lost in a foggy void. he meets two friends, one of whom had died in a spectacular boating accident. they have to find his daughter because he lost her and his wife will be mad. in chapter one there are skeletons, in chapter two there are beast-men, in chapter three there is Dracula's son and in chapter eight there is a plot twist involving mad dogs and the town turns into a red blush populated by moth monsters. i am currently in the process of suing the makers of this rubbish film they stole my ideas which were based on a computer game and i know how they did it a man in a black suit cast an invisible fishing line into my head and hooked out the whole of my plot to hushed hill. i cannot tell many people because he has threatened to erase memories of my one and only love, paul."
"rglong-1","6","2","4","23 October 2006"," Overrated by moviegoers, underrated by critics
","Critiques of this movie are all over the board, but most are polarized: Critics hate it, moviegoers love it. The reception probably suits it. The fact is that the movie has ups and downs, and it happens that the ups are very good and the downs are laughably bad.<br/><br/>The bad news: The story and dialogue are insufferable. The director and writer claim to have met the challenge of translating an already vague video game plot so that non-gamers can understand it. They failed miserably. The movie's storyline is even less coherent than the game's. The biggest mistake is probably that after two hours of confusion, the movie comes to a full stop and the audience is forced to sit through a catch up scene in which the entire story is laid out all at once. The violence is entertaining, but seems over the top and out of place considering the Silent Hill games are always more subtly eerie than overtly gruesome. Overall the acting is bad; the lines are B movie material; Sean Bean's role in the movie is pointless and distracting; and although the plot centers around an evangelical Christian-like cult of holier-than-thou witch hunters, the movie wastes its opportunity to tap into Americans' current fears of religious fundamentalism or to make any meaningful social commentary.<br/><br/>The good news: The movie looks fantastic. Few people want to sit through a movie whose only merit is its special effects, but in Silent Hill's case the effects, environments and creatures are so excellent and intriguing they become the movie and truly overshadow its weaknesses. The movie is at its best when nobody is talking, when we simply follow the lead character Rose as she wanders aimlessly through an endless nightmare, like Alice in a dark and twisted version of Wonderland. As stated above the social commentary falls flat, but if you look hard enough, there are some nice underlying themes centered on both the dangers of blind faith, and of giving in to revenge. The story feels like it would have had more promise in the hands of another writer, and perhaps could be elaborated on in a sequel. The director is up to the challenge of being faithful to the look and feel of the game in every detail, right down to the perfect recreation of scenes and camera angles from the games.<br/><br/>Some critics have compared Silent Hill to an Uwe Boll film, and that is beyond unfair. This movie is not great, it isn't the amazingly successful video game adaption fan boys have been wishing for; but nor is it terrible by any means. In short, the director and art department deserve medals, while the writer deserves to meet his doom at the hands of a vengeful Pyramid Head. Depending on whether you can forgive a terrible script in favor of marveling at some truly amazing visuals, you may either love this movie or hate it - or join the tiny, elite, third group of moviegoers who recognize the movie has strengths and weaknesses that make it average out to, well, average."

","""Silent Hill"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Christophe Gans <br/><br/>Starring: Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Jodelle Ferland, Deborah Kara Unger, & Alice Krige <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for strong horror violence and gore, disturbing images, and some language) <br/><br/>I'll be perfectly honest with you. I do not have that much experience with the ""Silent Hill"" video games. I have played the third game and have beaten it twice, but I have yet to play the first two and probably never will. Fans of the game may, therefore, consider me unable to review the movie accuratelyor, at least, accurately for them. So, this review is specifically for those with limited or no experience with the video games. If you have played the games, then reading any further will probably prove to be useless to you. If you choose to continue reading, please do so with the knowledge that I did not go into this movie with the knowledge that you, no doubt, have. ""Silent Hill"" is a strange movie. It is a grim, violent, and deeply disturbing horror movie that takes its viewers onto a roller-coaster ride into Hell and rarely lets them get up for breath. The problem is that ""Silent Hill"" hardly ever gives its audience a chance to even understand what is going on, while they are taking this ride, making it all seem far less effective. How can we be terrified of something if we have know idea what it is, why it is there, or what its intentions are? This is the question posed by ""Silent Hill"", concerning the dark creatures that lurk in the shadows of the town. What are they? Why are they evil and disgusting? In ""Silent Hill"", they are because it makes them seem more terrifying.<br/><br/>Rose Da Silva (Mitchell) is worried about her adopted daughter, Sharon (Ferland) who has begun to sleep walk and talk about a place called Silent Hill. Rose's husband, Christopher (Bean), feels that medication is the proper treatment, but Rose wants to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, in hopes that something inside of her will snap back into place or whatnot. Rose, of course, takes Sharon, but, on the way, is involved in a car accident that leaves her unconscious. When she wakes, Rose finds Sharon missing, the road behind her now divided by a huge, endless canyon and ashes falling from the sky like rain. Rose makes her way to Silent Hill, but, instead of help, she finds years of buried secrets, undead monsters, and an obsessed religious cult that will do anything to keep its past hidden from outsiders. The plot sounds simple enough: a woman and her daughter find themselves trapped within a hellish world and must find a way to escape. The problem is that the movie wants to make it seem more complex than necessary. Everyone has a back story and hundreds of secrets are exposed, but none of them do much in explaining what exactly should be explained. It relies on its audience to piece together the impossible to connect pieces of a puzzle, just when they think they have everything put together, the last three minutes swoop in and smashes the puzzle to pieces again.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong. I have no problem with movies that choose to make their audiences think. However, I do have a problem with movies that make their audiences think and then never give their audiences a basis on which to do so. Thus is the problem with ""Silent Hill"". The entire movie seems to be exposing pieces of the puzzle, but, in the end, you realize that you have two-hundred puzzle pieces, all from different puzzles and none from the puzzle you are trying to solve. However, ""Silent Hill"" still won my approval for its technical prowess and its overall disturbing and terrifying mood. The movie looks wonderful and the special effects are absolutely amazing. The creatures are brought to life with stunning detail and the sets are hauntingly flawless. The movie, as I have said, is terrifying and kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I had no idea what was going on. The performances are good enough, with Radha Mitchell being the highlight. She practically carries the movie and does a nice job. Sean Bean, whose character was actually absent from the original script, has a minimal part but does with it what he can. Laurie Holden was also good, but I didn't buy her two-dimensional character that came off as artificial and laughably clichéd.<br/><br/>If I had been a die-hard fan of the ""Silent Hill"" video games before I watched this movie, I may have loved it. As it is, I simply liked it. It was scary, grim, and deeply violent, but I had no idea what was going on half of the time. Why do the creatures exist? I don't know. Why did the ending occur as it did? I have no idea. What exactly did the ending mean, concerning the fate of our characters? I haven't the faintest shred of a clue. It did not make sense, but, for most horror fans, this will not matter. They will just want to see the violence, the gruesome and deformed creatures, and the hellish underworld formed whenever the lights go out. As for casual movie-goers and people who have never played the video games, ""Silent Hill"" probably will not cut it. They will most likely not like the overly-complicated plot that does not explain anything that it really should have and they will definitely not like the inane ending. But, it is still a fairly innovative horror movie and has plenty of thrills to go around.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""Silent Hill"" is a good horror movie that fans of the games will love.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)"
"myrkeyjones","10","2","4","5 September 2006"," Dark, disturbing, operatic and powerful
","Christophe Gans has created a visceral masterpiece. The film has been roughly described by many as Alice in Wonderland meets Dante's Hell, and this is a very appropriate description. The film is simple, it's a journey that satisfies a humans gnawing curiosity about evil, deep down we'd all want to know what purgatory looks like without ending up there. A talented cast including the always great Alice Kridge, Radna Mitchel and Sean bean, and great writing from Academy Award Winner Roger Avery (Pulp Fiction) make for a sublime cinematic trip. Yet i can say most of the credit must go to the awesome production designers who have created a visual feast for the eyes. At times the film can divulge into directors self indulgence but after all the overrated tripe, Hostel, Wolf Creek, Haute tension and a couple of unnecessary, terrible remakes, Silent Hill undoubtedly stands as one of the best horror films of the year."

","I saw the movie last night. I have not had a chance to play the game as of yet, but I plan on buying it on PS2 this weekend. I get the feeling that Rose, Sharon, & Sybil B. died when their vehicles crashed on the road. They probably did not know they were dead. I can recall Rose's husband arriving at the bridge & being told that his wife's Jeep Liberty was up ahead. We never saw Rose's husband witness the condition of her post-crashed vehicle. I kind of figured she was dead toward the end of the movie when she drove across the missing bridge & went home. Something just did not seem right. Is anyone willing to confirm or deny my suspicions?"
"rhyatt1","3","2","4","25 August 2006"," Daaaa this movie bites and stuff
","I don't understand all of the good reviews for this movie. I've played the game a little, but I'm not an expert on it by any means. So I have an outsiders perspective and a little bit of an insiders perspective. Either way you slice it, this movie bites.<br/><br/>For one thing the CGI was horrible, as it usually is in most movies. Why not just stick a freaking actor in a rubber monster suit and have him shuffle around? It's cheaper and better on the eyes. The first two monster scenes with the little screaming green guys and the armless monster on the road, were so fake that I felt like I was sitting around an apartment watching some sad-ass loser play this game. And everyone knows that watching someone else play a video game is the most horrible and boring experience in the world.<br/><br/>Besides the horrible CGI another problem was the way the story was told. I appreciate them getting to the meat of the story quickly, but when the first scene immediately shows a girl running around the woods and then collapsing after muttering about Silent Hill, and the next thing you know the mom is suddenly going there, it seems rushed.<br/><br/>Plus the whole deal about how the town has been ""abandoned"" for years is way too hard to go with. So an entire town is just sitting there with houses, stores, restaurants, schools, etc, and nobody is doing anything about it? At the very least, looters would come by and steal crap. At the most there would be an expose on CNN and the mayor of Silent Hill would be interviewed and asked the tough questions like why wasn't he taking steps to get the town back to an inhabitable state. Sure I know that it's based on a video game, but if you're going to base the story in the real world then it needs to make some sense.<br/><br/>Another issue I had was the focus on the little girl. Sure, I assume it's from the game (I can't remember because even though I said I played the game a little the truth is that I played it for about 5 seconds and then I made a Michelena dinner and went to sleep on the couch) but I'm sick of scary movies relying on little kids to give people the creeps. The Ring already played out that angle and ran it so far into the ground that it's totally useless anymore. Kids aren't scary. That's all there is too it. If a little kid is giving you mess just kick him down some stairs and call it a day.<br/><br/>***Spoilers here*** Also the whole story revolving around witchcraft is about as un-scary and as uninteresting as possible. Witches aren't scary. Witches, kids, and the Frankenstein Monster (that's right, Frankenstein is the scientist, not the monster you tard) are the last things you should use for cheap scares. Luckily Frankenstein's Monster didn't make an appearance here, but there is a possibility of Silent Hill 2 so hold your breath.<br/><br/>So why is it that after being killed by the witch hunters the little girl was able to make a deal with the devil and get revenge? Does that mean if a guy is hit by a car he can work out a smaller contract with the devil so he can get revenge on the person who hit him? Is there some level of horrificness that your death must reach in order for you to make a deal that allows you to get revenge in the afterlife? And why was the mom able to arrange a deal where she let the demon enter her so she could bring it to the Sanctuary? Isn't the nature of demons that they don't usually have your best interest in mind? I guess she found one of the good ones. It seems like once she helped the demon/devil or whoever it was, he would then say ""well thanks for helping, I really liked how we came together as a team there...man, the looks on the faces of the townsfolk were priceless when they realized you had brought me in with you... uhhh anyway I guess this is where we say good bye.... and of course by good bye I mean I'm going to have to kill you now. so I guess you should close your eyes or something... unless you want to see it coming. I don't know, you tell me what you want."" Obviously I've raised a lot of questions in this review that need to be answered. Also I've formed the pilot of my new sitcom about a demon who has to share an apartment with a guy because of a zany twist where the demon sold his soul to the guy by mistake."

","My wife and I saw the film with no foreknowledge that it was based on a video game. And just as well: any film should stand on its own merits, not what it was derived from.<br/><br/>The story, while not incoherent, was a tad illogical. A woman has a young daughter who sleepwalks and who mentions a town, Silent Hill, while in a trance. So the lady decides to take the obviously disturbed young girl to Silent Hill, despite that her husband doesn't think it's a good idea (to the point of canceling her credit card -- and how did she pay for the gas?). At a store, she asks the lady behind the counter about how to reach Silent Hill, and was given an evasive answer. So a lady cop approaches her outside the store, and asks if everything is okay. The mother doesn't ask her how to get to Silent Hill or anything like that, but takes off.<br/><br/>For no known reason at the time, the cop follows her (and why not interrogate her at the store?) and after stopping, the mother gets away, reaching Silent Hill, but getting knocked out in the process. When she regains consciousness, she discovers her daughter is gone, and settles on the strategy of running through the streets of the town at random, calling for her daughter, who of course doesn't answer.<br/><br/>Eventually, she's joined by the cop, and the two of them hunt inside deserted (?) buildings for the daughter, but with no coherent plan. They first encounter some sort of monster, but rather than regrouping and getting backup, the two press on.<br/><br/>Eventually, they find some religious fanatics who take shelter in a church, and the mother ""goes underground"" to reach the Demon. There, she's exposed to an Answer that's supposed to be Profound, and she returns to the church, not in time to save the lady cop, but in time to save the daughter, and to attack the fanatics (who are the real sinners, get it?) with killer barbed wire.<br/><br/>Interesting CGI visuals, silly plot. I suppose if you're into the game, it means more, but for pure moviegoers, it leaves a lot to be desired."

","Sharon(Jodelle Ferland)is the adopted child of Christopher and Rose Da Silva(Sean Bean & Radha Mitchell). Sharon sleepwalks, and during her ""away period"" speaks of a town called Silent Hill. Rose, against her husband's wishes, decides to find Silent Hill and possibly awaken memories Sharon might have of the place. As Rose is driving to the town she spots a girl in the middle of the rode and crashes. When she awakens, Sharon is gone. She sets out to find her but instead finds a sleepy ghost town with no one in sight. Where is Sharon and what is this place? As she searches, Rose uncovers some disturbing creatures at the heart of the town..and this strange woman, Dahlia(Deborah Kara Unger)who tells her about the darkness..perhaps this is a description of what Rose saw before meeting this woman. Christopher, very worried about his wife and daughter, goes to find them and instead drives to a cavalcade of police cars. Officer Thomas Gucci(Kim Coats)takes him into Silent Hill and it looks nothing like the town Rose is inhabiting. Why is this? There's this cop, Cybil Bennett(Laurie Holden), who had seen Rose and Sharon at a gas stop and decides to pull them over to further check them out when Rose decides to make a run for the town instead of the cop ruining her plans for entering Silent Hill. Cybil, after Rose had visited Silent Hill, hand-cuffs her for supposedly harming her missing child. Cybil had a wreck on her motor cycle and as she goes to take Rose back to the town of Brahams nearby, the bridge leading there is gone and there's this massive gap of nothingness. Cybil and Rose are trapped in this place..Silent Hill is a paradox opposite reality. Obviously the key to the paradox is how it was created and who was the creator. Perhaps the answer comes in this young girl deemed a witch by the name of Alessa(who looks identical to Sharon..coincidence?)who was badly harmed by fanatical types..wolves in sheep's' skin. Who can Rose trust? This might determine how she will find Sharon. Rose and Cybil both are nearly killed by the darkness which seems to have all sorts of malformed demons who carry insects at their feet. Anyone who goes near them are viciously killed.<br/><br/>Through Thomas, Christopher learns subtle truths about what happened at Silent Hill..the fires that torched a town taking many ""innocents"" with quite a few vanishing. Thomas informs Chris that his father owned a barber shop in Silent Hill and was killed. He also lets Chris know fanatics hurt a little girl. He won't divulge everything and Chris tries hard to gain knowledge about what caused the fire and who caused it. And, his search is also for how all of this relates to his little girl. While his search may yield limited results, it's Rose who is facing it head-on in the ""other"" Silent Hill. She'll uncover a treasure trove of demented truths about a certain sect who hold up in a sanctuary which is a safe haven from the darkness. Strangely the darkness doesn't harm Dahlia. The sect seems to have a leader, Claudia(Alice Krige..who is creepy), who might or might not be a source of help to Rose. Cybil realizes Rose is legit and releases her from the hand-cuffs. Will Cybil and Rose find Sharon? Is Claudia and her group trustworthy? The sect seems to evoke strong religious beliefs..is this a revelation of fanaticism? Those who are not familiar with the video game may have a hard time sitting through this film..the developing clues and characters that come into the picture might just be trying for the ""unadorned."" This film, at it's core, is about one mother's quest to find her daughter in the heart of a dark world. She will understand the hate that created this world and meet it's creator. The why and how of Silent Hill and it's omnipresent evil are opened to Rose on her quest to find Sharon. As the actress who portrayed the eerie Dahlia, Deborah Kara Unger, describes this film..""It's Alice in Wonderland meets Dante's Inferno."" That's about as accurate description as one could ask for.<br/><br/>I think the casting is great particularly Mitchell as the weary mother desperately searching for her child and always in danger against a foe she does not understand. Holden is good, as well, as the officer trying to help her in that quest. Krige is very good as a woman who may or may not be the reason behind the creation of the paradoxical Silent Hill, and Unger is quite interesting as Dahlia, a woman that looks like a haggard street hobo with secrets buried deep claiming Sharon is her daughter. The camera-work has a stunning flow reaching around every corner and following the characters as they uncover disturbing things. The visual effects, especially in the gruesome climax, are state-of-the-art and effective."

","Horror game franchise comes to life on the big screen, and the flavour of the games is well captured.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, as a game, always preyed on our deepest darkest fears. It projected an innate wrongness and the monsters in it were designed to defy what we had come to expect from horror - add to that a wretched doomed atmosphere and hideous graphics which propagated a genuinely sinister and foreboding facade. This was the strength of the Silent Hill games, and any successful movie would have to go to town to create the same effect.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, as a movie, succeeds superbly at this, certainly for the first half of the story. The locations, the events, some of the characters and *even* some of the camera shots are dead ringers for the game, and those familiar with it will find themselves totally engulfed in the Silent Hill world.<br/><br/>The buildings, the monsters, the foggy town, even the change to Dark Silent Hill are absolutely bang on the money and make afficionados feel completely at home.<br/><br/>The story is close to the original game; a woman, Rose (Where it used to be a man, Harry Mason) drives her daughter (Sharon) to the town of Silent Hill but has an accident. Her daughter disappears from the car (In exactly the same way as the game) and the movie is then her hunt to find her.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie you'll notice homages to the sequels of the original game - and all of them are very convincing and clearly time has gone into producing a movie with this level of accuracy to the games.<br/><br/>As such, Silent Hill was a serious horror game and the gore factor and hideousness of monsters and deaths is exactly what you expect. There is even a fair bit of imagination going on to give it a creative edge.<br/><br/>The acting is staple, without being anything outstanding, but what else would you expect from Hollywood horror? Sean Bean has a rather small role as the husband/father and it seems slightly strange to see him in this kind of movie, and putting on a pseudo-American accent which never convinces. As Rose, Laurie Holden does a fair amount of screaming and looking panic stricken - exactly what she needs to do.<br/><br/>The direction is very good indeed - it's a fast moving film and never slows down unnecessarily. The special effects are also very impressive - lots of CGI went into this to create convincing monsters and atmosphere effects, and they work very well indeed.<br/><br/>Overall, as a story it's not bad although there are several comical leaps of logic - but you'll forgive them. It does lose its way ever so slightly in the second half where it goes for maximum confusion, but in a way it's actually the best method because the game went the same way in terms of plot. It just perhaps doesn't translate to the big screen so well. But the makers did as good a job of making it as simple as they could while remaining faithful to the game.<br/><br/>Horror fans will get a fair kick out of it although recognising it's not the greatest horror one will ever see, and devotees of the games will certainly enjoy its accuracy."

There's something so utterly sick about the monsters of Silent Hill that makes me all giddy inside.<br/><br/>Also, the film makers made a move that has unfortunately not been done enough in other video game movies in my view, which was using the games' soundtracks. The music in this movie is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>Having said this all the only real disappointments for me were Sean Bean's character who didn't get to do much during the entire film and the ending which was too ambiguous in my view and didn't have the level of closure I had hoped for.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a brilliant video game movie, and probably the first one to have taken a major leap in its plot writing."

","I expected really goofy, coming from a video game and all, but it was OK. Lots of metal+unskinned flesh monsters, visceral emotions linked with females and their mother-child connections, insane cult worshipers, this film has it all.<br/><br/>The plot is a little confusing, though, and it is all because the story would have been really simple if at all logical. The atmosphere is good, with creepy bloody networks growing all over the place after a strange siren call and a constant ashy rain. The idea of a ghost town sitting on top of perpetually burning coal mines is not bad either.<br/><br/>All and all, I think it is a movie that was intended to both audiences, male and female. Alas, women will not watch it because they don't get married in the end and men won't get it because it's all about mothers trying to find their daughters.<br/><br/>Besides, once you see Alice Krige having a part in the movie, you know where evil is at :) In conclusion, I think it's a fun flick for horror fans. Could have been more gory and less ""devily"" and with a little less female screams, but all and all it's OK."

","To stay awake mostly. Also to try and piece together the rather illogical plot and the idiotic character actions throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I gave up after a while, just letting the visual ""goodness"" wash over me. But there isn't much substance to Silent Hill. More like substance-abuse. Not since Event Horizon have I seen such relatively unnecessary levels of gore. And it's not as if it really adds anything to the movie other than to give it a distinctive visual style.<br/><br/>Forget the ""plot"" which, in the end, is a risibly simple witchcraft/vengeful spirit affair. Forget the characters, which quite frankly evoke no feelings of sympathy whatsoever from the viewer. Take away the graphics and the laughably (though unintentionally, I'm sure) monsters and there is little left other than the tale of a mother trying to help her daughter.<br/><br/>And what a mother! Hmmm! My daughter's having nightmares, drawing strange pictures and sleepwalking. What to do? I know! I'll drive across country to the town she's drawing and then.....oh well, I'm sure I'll figure it out when I get there! Oh no! A cop is pulling me over for some reason. She'll no doubt know I'm a raving lunatic who shouldn't be in charge of a kid and try to stop me! What to do? I know! I'll drive away at high-speed and REALLY give her a reason to chase me and arrest me! Ha ha! I've lost her...oops! Lost control of the car too! Clunk! And it all kind of goes (Silent) Downhill from there. I'm sure fans of the game may have more insight into what the Hell was going on, but I didn't. Why did the mad guy have a weird triangular head? Why did he have a blade six feet long and two feet wide? Why this? Why that? Why bother? It's a mess really which I don't think even game-conversion king Uwe Boll could have made any worse. In fact, I suspect he'd have done at least a much more amusing version involving visibly blunt Dural swords and maybe a cameo by a has-been star for good measure. As it stands, not really worth getting excited about unless all you want is eye gore/candy.<br/><br/>Silent Hill? Silent and Deadly.....deadly tedious, that is. Avoid it. It makes sniffing your own sweaty armpits a preferable experience."
"jamesonnephi","9","2","4","5 June 2006"," The Art and Philosophy of Silent Hill
","This film was not simply a video game adaptation, nor a horror flick. It was the artistic collaboation of three continents. The original concept, from Japan, laced with so much Eastern philosophy and pulling liberally from the deformist movements of the mid 1900s, i.e. Francis Bacon. Directed by a Frenchman, student of literature. And written by one of the most influential American screenwriters! There is so much depth to this movie that I think a lot of people are missing. The expressionism, the manichaism, duality of existence. The greatly misunderstood aspects of personal mental divergency and its artistic relation to the physical. (this film being one of the best representations I've ever seen of this very interesting concept of the visual being a allusion to the emotional state, and not being the actual events in occurrence but more, an ocular presentation of an otherwise inperceptible mental condition(I'm sorry, but NO, the whole point of it was NOT that they were just ""in hell"")) And it is my opinion that this dilemma of misunderstanding/disdain is due solely to the laziness of the viewer. They have not taken the time to understand what this piece is trying to get across while still making it entertaining. Those who believe that they should be catered to in their indolent state, thinking to themselves that they should comprehend something just because they ""played the game"", yet they have never picked up an item of literature, or strived to understand differing artistic expressions. With no comprehension of anything intellectual, they goff at something amazing, and ultimately, they sound utterly ridiculous and unenlightened. We must build up and support those who attempt to show us something that challenges us and forces us to try and attain another point of view for seeing this frail human existence. Most want to be fed, to be told what to think, told exactly what this ""movie"" is supposed to mean. And this is because they are unwilling to put any effort into the edification of their being. Lazy. and obese. Living of the fat of a land that is draining them of their potential. An opportunity to think for themselves and find a meaning to their pathetic lives. Something more than a damn video game!"
"johnjacos","3","2","4","21 May 2006"," physically appealing, but ridiculously confusing
","Silent Hill was one mess of a movie, but perhaps it's because I have never played the game before. in fact, i had no idea it was based off of a game until i read its reviews. nonetheless, i get a feeling that whoever the director is did it for just the gamers, and not the non-gamers. which if you think about it is quite crass because non-gamers constitute a huge stake of revenues.<br/><br/>the movie starts out unbelievably slow (except for when the daughter is about to jump off of a cliff), and then it gets fast all of a sudden. i do have to give it to the special effects guy, the movie was visually appealing for a good part (especially the end, it was quite impressive) but throughout the movie, you get a sense of trite and cheesiness. it came to a point where the yelling and screaming and loud noises was unbearable and annoying, but again, visually it was really appealing, especially when pyramid head tore that girl's flesh out.<br/><br/>this movie is also ridiculously hard to fathom. the ending more so than ever. at the end, rose and Sharon make it home, but daddy (sean bean) is in a different world than the one that rose and Sharon constitute. now, i'm not a gamer, so i don't know what the hell is going on, and i think that after paying 7 bucks, i would appreciate a damn explanation.<br/><br/>so my suggestion, if you're a gamer, please go and watch it, as i've read good reviews about it, but if you're not, please DON'T GO WATCH IT, you will have no clue what's going on, worse yet, it might be more trying than an accounting final exam."
"cosmic_quest","7","2","4","18 May 2006"," Captures the eeriness and fear of a real horror flick
","I've never played the video game 'Silent Hill', which this film is based on, so I came to it with a different perspective of someone looking to see a good film rather than expecting a faithful adaptation. But I can quite honestly say how refreshing it is to finally see a horror film that is actually a horror, with not a psychotic serial killer or air-headed teen in sight.<br/><br/>The film revolves around Rose Da Silva, whose eight-year-old daughter Sharon is being plagued by episodes of sleep-walking that are leading the child into dangerous situations. In all of her dreams, Sharon mentions 'Silent Hill' and her mother's research leads her to discovering this place actually exists in the form of an abandoned town with an eerie history. Rose determines that to cure Sharon of her nightmares, they must go to the town but, on arrival, their journey then takes a terrifying turn. After being knocked unconscious upon crashing her car, Rose awakes to find Sharon missing, and so she is forced to travel deeper into the horror that is Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell, who played Rose, really captures the spirit of a mother determined to find her child no matter what the consequences are to herself. Laurie Holden's Cybil Bennett, the policewoman who comes to Rose's aid, was a surprising character as while she first came across as a buff masculine she-cop, she quickly revealed herself to be multi-dimensional in the form of someone who feels protectiveness, caring, pain and fear. And Alice Krige was just excellent as the loathsomely arrogant Christabella.<br/><br/>What is truly brilliant about this film is it works hard to create a chilling atmosphere of a desolate town that is other-worldly and disturbed, which leaves the audience terrified before anything even happens . The visual effects as the town falls into darkness were top-class and I loved how they used actors for the roles of the zombies rather than relying on CGI. Other producers could learn a lesson or two from 'Silent Hill' as the traditional approach of actors in make-up was far more effective and creepier than computerised monsters that tend to leave audiences nit-picking rather than petrified.<br/><br/>The only real let-down was the last scene as 'twist' endings have been so over-done that to see one in a film that was unique in every other scene, it was rather a disappointment. That said, the solid script, interesting characters and visuals combine to create a film that is tense, chilling and terrifying. 'Silent Hill' is not just for fans of the game so don't let that put you off if you're on the look-out for a decent horror film."

"tecxx","9","2","4","16 May 2006"," intelligent, high quality horror
","After watching several awfully bad video game-to-cinema-flicks like doom or alien vs predator, i didn't expect much from this one. How wrong could i be! It is rich in detail, contains countless of amazing shots, plenty of gore and a really scary atmosphere. Exactly like the game. The story is logical and interesting to follow, and the blending from reality to the completely insane and freaked out surreality work pretty well. The effects are simply stunning! What i also liked a lot is that the amount of violence is concentrated on special moments only. No mindless kill-one-after-another-in-the-most-violent-way-you-can-imagine like many other movies do. Silent Hill builds up the scariness slowly and painfully and then suddenly lets all hell break lose. There were some occasions in this movie where i sat there and said ""whow"". This doesn't happen very often... Also i'd like to note that i've rarely seen such a violent movie, not because of the amount of brutality shown, but especially because of the witch burning scenes. Pretty disturbing! One thing i didn't like is that the scary atmosphere was disrupted several times when the story switches back to Sean, the father of the missing girl and the police officers. It seemed a bit like a gap-filler. Maybe it also was on purpose for people to relax, but i wouldn't mind being scared for 90 minutes straight.<br/><br/>Also the German-translated voice of the girl in the last parts of the movie (i've watched it in Austria) feels misplaced. It sounds too much sci-fi, like the representation of the computer in resident evil.<br/><br/>All in all i can recommend anyone who likes horror movies to go and see this one."

","Just saw it this Sat. night with a friend of mine. I hadn't had any preconceived notions about the film because I never read a review of it nor anyones user comments before seeing it. My only prejudice could be based upon the preview, and from that I got a movie that looked to be promising but had the possibility of letting you down. For me it ended up being both. It was very promising in that I actually found myself getting really caught up in the storyline; It succeeded in drawing me out of my reality (knowing I was sitting in a theater watching a screen) and into the fantasy of the story and characters. Yet there were a few parts (most taking place in the beginning of the film, and a couple of times near the end) that had me wincing in pain, and it wasn't because of the gore. Mainly it was just the amateurishness of the acting, particularly of Jodelle. I loved the way she portrayed evil Alessa, but when it came time for her to act scared and frightened as the vulnerable Sharon, I just couldn't help but chuckle a bit. Instead of coming across as such, she more so sounded cheesy and B grade. Other than that I say this is by far one of the better horror films to hit the silver screen in the past 5 yrs. Two thumbs up"
"SuperBaes","8","2","4","3 May 2006"," Utterly shocking
","I went to see this movie, knowing nothing about the plot and having no idea that it was based on a video game. I loved it. The plot is simple enough to follow while at the same time being complex enough to justify the conflict. The characters, while all static, were made essential to the storyline, thus rendering them valid. The use of allusion, cinematography, and, above all the MUSIC from this movie were all superb.<br/><br/>One thing did bother me, though: ""I think this place is haunted."" It comes at an odd time and seems to snag the forward momentum of the movie for a moment."
"Irishize","8","2","4","3 May 2006"," For Silent Hill Game Fans & Those tired of predictable ""horrors""
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film. The games (I had only played SH1 & 2) were outstanding cinematically for their time.<br/><br/>The film did not disappoint. As a big fan of the games himself, the director caught the emotions of a gamer (in a darkened room with the sound turned up, seeing for the first time one of the many unsettling visions in the game). If you've never played the games though, then this film is probably not what you would expect when you read the word ""Horror"" in relation to the usual flicks.<br/><br/>Its more of a creeping/what-the-hell-IS-that?-film than a jump-fest.<br/><br/>In summary, I think the director maybe got the balance wrong in terms of including knowing nods to the gamers watching, while neglecting the first-time viewer. It could've done with more jump-out-of-your-skin moments (which are also present in the game).<br/><br/>But all-in-all, game-to-film conversions are still the poor cousin of ""proper"" films.<br/><br/>This is the best one out there so far."
"hideous_monster","10","2","4","2 May 2006"," Captured the Atmosphere as Well as a Movie Possibly Could.
","In a survival horror game, you're alone, and you learn by picking up text-based clues. That would be frustrating and boring in a movie. So you have to have more characters for dialogue. In theory this would take away from the feeling of isolation you get in the Silent Hill game. And it did a little, but luckily it wasn't so bad. Here's why: The Silent Hill game didn't draw most of its feel from isolation. It drew it from atmosphere. Earie atmosphere. Sounds, music, and grotesque visuals. Having to force yourself to except the fact that you're now in a world where normal rules do not apply. It's the sort of experience where the terror doesn't cause you to jump out of your seat in shock, but the feeling of utter helplessness creeps into you as though you were soaking it up from below like a sponge. In short, the game isn't entertainment, it's an experience. That's something the movie captured beautifully. It took the storyline of the first game, added some monsters from the second, changed some characters, and mutated the plot a bit, but kept the basic idea behind Silent Hill games. Some might be bothered about the things they changed, but honestly I have no problem with them, because only two out of the four games followed the same storyline, and included the same characters. The other two were totally different, but still good. In fact, the most celebrated Silent Hill monster is from number 2, and that game strayed so far from the plot of the first, that it might as well have been in a different series. Silent Hill is my favorite game series, but if the movie were really bad, I would know. This movie was true to the game. The games had multiple endings, but generally you could count on the end of a Silent Hill game having an ending that is neither happy nor tragic. It should leave you with a feeling that though not everything turned out the way you would have liked, you're content, because that awful, awful place is behind you, and you'll never have to hear those sirens for the rest of your existence. It was a very large relief that the Silent Hill movie had a truly Silent Hill ending."

","Those who have played the Silent Hill video games will recognise that the subject matter is quite difficult to translate into a film. However, it is handled superbly here, and the director does a fantastic job ensuring that the film can be watched by both long term Silent Hill fans and those who have never heard of the games.<br/><br/>The movie has a strange, almost surreal, quality to it which is exactly how it should be. If there are any weaknesses then it would be how little personality the lead character Rose is given. It is a testament to Radha Mitchell's acting skills that we, the audience, still invest in her character Rose with the little that we are given to go on about her.<br/><br/>There are some wonderful moments of horror here. Those who prefer their horror to be more along the lines of 'run, hide, be killed' variety may find themselves irritated by the surreal nature of the plot line. Those who enjoyed films such as Jacobs Ladder will come away thinking this is certainly one of the greatest horror films made this year. The playground and hospital corridor scenes alone are worth the money for anyone seeking a dose of terror.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend seeing Silent Hill. It is the only film that proves, in the right hands, a good computer game can be translated into a good movies. Some will loathe it, others will love it, but there is no denying its ambition, imagination and appreciation for the source material. In about 10 years it will most likely be regarded as a cult classic."

The monsters were realistic and the most scary thing there is the pyramid guy with the cleaver. It's really similar to the game.

"Polaris_DiB","7","2","4","1 May 2006"," Pros and Cons
","This was an interesting experience for me as it's the first time I've ever been in the position of a video game fanboy seeing a movie adaptation of something I've gotten really into. Considering the overall history of video game movie adaptations, I was worried, but considering how cinematic Silent Hill was, I figured it wouldn't be that difficult to pull off. However, when I saw the trailer and noticed that there would be a side-story involving people outside Silent Hill, I was heavily disappointed because one of the key things that makes Silent Hill the game so great is the fact that it feels utterly futile to think of any world outside of it.<br/><br/>Well, my disappointment was misfounded, they actually did that side-story pretty well, and it didn't affect the overall grade of the movie at all. All in all, this movie exceeded my expectations for it, though it still left me craving for a little more.<br/><br/>A big dilemma in the creation of this film is the fact that it seems almost required to hold some of those coded horror-genre elements that tend to be a turn-off to even the average film-goer: horror-film style acting (sure they can scream, but can they pronounce emotion otherwise?), some very campy dialog at points (Cop: ""They say this town is haunted."" protagonist: ""I think they're right."" Audience: ""Ughhh...""), and the decision over what would be more scary, to actually show the terrifying elements or allow the audience's imagination to go wild. Sometimes it was successful, sometimes it wasn't.<br/><br/>I can say this about it: it could have used a bit less audio, both in terms of dialog and music. Sometimes it just felt like the music was making it less scary, and some of the expository dialog was pretty much unnecessary: most of the dialog between the male cop and the husband, or that moment when the protagonist looks at the smudge on her finger and says ""Ash..."" Yeah, we know it's ash. Now on with the imagery and off with the sound! Also, Pyramidhead's appearance was glaringly gratuitous, for no other reason than the plot didn't fully develop his character and thus he was pretty much there for the Silent Hill gamer fan to say, ""All right now on with the good stuff!"" It must be noted, however, that it was some very, VERY good stuff, so his appearance wasn't totally wasted.<br/><br/>But all in all, it gets enough of the mood, enough of the setting, and enough of the imagery in that it's a pretty decent film. Enough might not be enough in that I would really like some more... *HEAVY DUTY SPOILERS HERE* For a film with skin-ripping and barbed-wire raping, it seems to be pretty needlessly reserved in other parts, like pretty much refusing to show the entire crucified janitor *YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW*. I did hear that a lot of the film had to be cut merely to give it an R rating. Thus, for once in my life, I'm actually more interested to see the Extended and Unrated DVD that inevitably will come out.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

The tale was much like the video games (yes, I play the video games). Yet, it was far more disturbing and a lot more confusing for those who have never played the game. The most sickening part of the movie was.... well, the whole movie. I must admit that I am a connoisseur of horror flicks, and I am not easily frightened. This movie by far did its job in creeping me out and making me think of the most gruesome and terrifying things while I was trying to get sleep.

","I have gone to see Silent Hill three times so far and it keeps drawing me in. I have been a faithful visitor for a long time and to see the mirrors from game to movie are incredible. I have noticed a lot of bad reviews especially ones about how the movie wasn't scary enough. Well, guess what. That has never been the premise. Silent Hill (for me and the others I discuss it with) has always been a psychological journey. Yes, there are monsters, but they are there for a purpose. The most prominent issue with the game is the feeling of isolation. Now of course, you could not have Rose running around for two hours by herself. How the cult was brought in and helped to explain some of the history was brilliant. And the ending was classic to the games. It made you come to your own conclusion and want to see it again for more clues. I know some people were upset at changes but after all, anything that is transferred to screen gets a makeover. Even if it wasn't based on a video game, it could stand alone as a beautiful horror film. My only lament is that Pryamid Head was not on screen more. Casting him as the ultimate executioner was perfect. I did feel I was walking through Silent Hill during the movie. Scenery, monsters, music, characters, all flowed nicely. I really enjoyed the left, right, left, right sequence. All of us who have played remember doing that at three am trying to help James figure out where the hell he left Maria. I knew this movie was not going to be accepted by everyone but? That's just the way I like it. Like another reviewer said, if everyone liked it, it wouldn't be Silent Hill. I commend all involved and cannot wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>Addendum to my post written on Sept. 05, 2006: I have noticed quite a few people have assumed that all of the monsters were CGI. That is not true at all. I bought the DVD and had the privilege of watching the six part documentary where it is shown that the characters were actual people. Yes, there is some CGI, that couldn't be helped. But think of what was done before this. Aren't you glad that CGI exists? It always amuses me when people complain about special effects in a movie. Oh well, you can't please everyone. And who would want to try? It seemed to me that the cast and crew (from what I saw) put their heart and soul into this and it shows. When the right setting could not be found they built it. Does that sound slapdash to you? I was very impressed by the amount of detail..Although my one complaint with the DVD is the lack of special features. One can only hope for a Special Edition to come out around Christmas. But I stand by this original post above and I do look forward to another journey back to Silent Hill."
"Spirit_Uk","9","2","4","29 April 2006"," Good take on Silent Hill, only one problem.
","For those fans of the Silent Hill games, I can say I recommend this movie. The visuals capture the style of Silent Hill almost perfectly and are commendable for that. However, do not expect this to be an exact replica of the games, there are only a few similarities in the film storyline to the game, such as characters. There are some religious references, but unfortunately the background to Silent Hill's story is not used to its full extent.<br/><br/>Regarding the film itself - it is quite simply what I would call a modern work of art. Whilst not perfect, and definitely not action packed, it has a certain style which most films lack. It also provides the viewer with food for thought, as there is more than just a little morality involved. <br/><br/>There are some forgivable flaws involved, and there is only one significant flaw - changes to the games basic script effectively renders sequels based on the later games more awkward, almost impossible.<br/><br/>Regardless, Silent Hill is not your traditional horror story. This is not another Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead. It relies upon imagery heavily, and is infinitely more psychological than the 'jump at something jumping out' used by traditional horror films. I recommend it heavily as both an introduction to the games and to what I hope is the first step by films into a deeper more thought-provoking kind of horror experience."

","What to make of this odd big-little film. It's clearly a Lynchian nightmare-scape, but it offers one too many clues to its unraveling in some of the most boring exposition put to film ever. Like DOOM, it makes the unappealing choice of translating the game to the big screen literally, even lifting camera angles, a startling sense of geography, a sequence of controller directions and more than 45 minutes of running and opening/trying to open drawers, doors and bathroom stalls. In that way, it's like nothing I've ever seen before. Not a good thing, because it's absolutely unnecessary as is the Husband's story, which eats up about a half hour too and reveals nothing we couldn't have assumed from Rose's story. <br/><br/>The positive side is that it's beautiful and atmospheric in an almost masochistic way. The demons are to die for, the locales are devilishly delightful and the story is an interesting one (albeit told in a bland way). <br/><br/>Sadly, it's just too unintentionally hilarious too often, and it really ruins the experience (unless of course you came for a good belly laugh or two). Of particular note is the frequent uttering of ""Everything will be OK"" at two of the most inopportune times ever. Now, maybe on paper, this was supposed to sound like ""denial"" but on film, the actress and director play the lines straight, which just hurts. I wish Silent Hill was a better film, because all the workings were there. But as is, it's going to be more of a curiosity than a classic. Much like ""The Brotherhood of the Wolf"" Gans has yet to make me care about his movies as anything more than abstract art."
"grislygus","8","2","4","28 April 2006"," Not Religiously Dedicated, But Respectful.
","A word to the wise: It is best to watch this movie if you have played Silent Hill and understand its concepts and subtle nuances. If not, you will miss a few key themes.<br/><br/>As its own entity, the movie is very cool. However, they did change the plot specifics, though the themes and elements remain intact. The film makers obviously understood the story of Silent Hill, and dedicatedly included direct nods, themes, gameplay elements, plotpoints, and a special cameo role.<br/><br/>The mood and look of Silent Hill is captured perfectly, including very good instrumental numbers. The monsters are great, and gore isn't overused (though when it occurs, it's extreme).<br/><br/>Now, only two things really bugged me. First, the movie beats you over the head with religious symbolism. Second is the gratuitous stupidity on the part of the main character.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any Silent Hill fan. It wasn't as religiously devoted to the source material as I hoped it would be, but I was very satisfied by the fact that the film makers obviously understood and greatly respected the series."
"platinumnexus","9","2","4","28 April 2006"," Silent Hill - Best Game to Film Crossover to date!
","Do not take my vote as a good thing. If not a fan of the original silent hill game for playstation then this may not be the movie for you. For me this is the best game to film crossover. Resident Evil was a survival horror game turned into an action movie, Alone in the Dark was just rubbish acting and all i have is words to go by with the Doom movie as i have not seen it yet.<br/><br/>Anyway... The film retains many of the characters from the game and being a fan i found it amazing to see it in a film with real people. however for people who don't recognise the creatures and have not played the game before may find the movie boring and think of it as too drawn out but for fans this is a brilliant movie, recognising the story and the creatures inside it. People may be going to the cinema looking for a scare-fest. If you've played the game don't expect to be scared, all features are used in the game but better and people who haven't played the game will easily notice the CGI which just spoils the scary atmosphere of the movie. Overall i find this a great movie with a solid story and good acting.<br/><br/>Good Points: = Good Acting = Solid Plot = Retains many of the great features of the video game<br/><br/>Bad Points: = CGI easily noticed = Movie drags, Parts could have been cut out<br/><br/>I tried to give as best a review i cud but me being a fan of the silent hill games, you may find my opinions bias..<br/><br/>I hope you find my review helpful THIS IS MY FIRST REVIEW :)"
"fabeb","7","2","4","28 April 2006"," scary stuff!!
","I have played the game and can not recall the mum looking for her daughter- It was always James in search of his daughter, so myself and my girlfriend came to the strange conclusion that it was perhaps some sort of prequel??<br/><br/>At the same time we found the film to be a bit of a mind bender and you really have to concentrate to keep up with the story, there will be times when you recognise scenes from the game and even the camera angles are reminiscent to the game itself, which caused some confusion and lead us to the prequel theory but all in all an enjoyable movie. The film has plenty of white knuckle moments and also that creepy feeling that something is behind you! :s Yet it still manages to keep a good script. The sound effects were amazing and will freak you out just as much as when you were playing the game."
"Mykewood","8","2","4","28 April 2006"," Very good movie on several levels
","This movie is somewhat different from most horror movies. It doesn't follow the typical patterns, other than the main character (the mother, Radha Mitchell) being a complete moron. Like most main characters in horror movies, the decision making & danger recognition parts of her brain must have been surgically removed. (I don't think this is a spoiler, but just in case, I checked the box) Just to give an example: If your daughter was having nightmares about a town that she could never have possibly been to, & then you find out the town is real, & it's know to be a ghost town where all the inhabitants died in a fire! & is thought to be one of the most haunted towns in America; WOULD YOU TAKE HER THERE?!?!?!?! But other than that... This movie is well thought out. It leaves a lot open to interpretation, which in my opinion is always a good thing. If you enjoy movies that will have you discussing the possibilities afterwards, check this one out!"

","I feel like I am the only one who could make any sense out of the storyline. I admit that some things were a bit sketchy, but it made up for that with some outstanding visuals. I never saw a town disintegrated into a good representation of hell. The use of the barbed wire was a good effect too. As a reply to another comment that I read, I did hear people say that it was stupid as I walked out. All that I can say to that is that you have to really pay attention to what is going on. Apparently, some PEOPLE are not capable of that. If you are one of these people, then don't bother (I am not suggesting that any of the readers of this comment are unintelligent). In my case, I thought it was strange at times, but still very cool."
"thejenigma","8","2","4","27 April 2006"," While it wasn't a perfect movie, this is one that I'm glad I saw
","The streets are abandoned and choked by a dense, everlasting fog. Ash ominously falls from the midday sky. Rose (Radha Mitchell) has entered Silent Hill searching for answers but now she must find her missing daughter and escape before the Darkness of Hell claims them both.<br/><br/>Director Christophe Gans does a great job transferring this supernatural town from the Playstation console to the Silver Screen. Having kept relatively true to the original video game by Konami, Gans has managed to please the game's fan base and captivate new viewers alike.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a veteran of the Silent Hill video game series to enjoy its adaptation. In Silent Hill, nothing is as it seems. Upon first entering the town, the viewer is greeted by a strong sense of emptiness and loneliness. When the main character begins to wonder what could have happened in this silent town, that's when it happens. A deafening air raid signal floods the town and everything goes straight to Hell. Literally.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is an excellent all-around horror movie. The visuals are stunning and the utmost attention is paid to even the smallest detail. Each set is disturbing in its own waywhich is exactly what the creators intended. Almost everything seen in the movie is made by hand, with very little computer generated imagery used; which adds a lot to the realism of the visuals. While not the main focus of the film, there are a few very, very gore-filled scenes which even the most hardcore horror fans can appreciate. While most movies will cut to another scene when something really gruesome happens, Silent Hill makes you stay and squirm.<br/><br/>The music score which haunted the video game version of Silent Hill also makes a return. It drives each scene with excellent timing and pace. Few music scores have the ability to increase your heartbeat like this one. The tension and fear in each scene is amplified by the music that compliments it.<br/><br/>The storyline of Silent Hill is about 70% mystery and 30% horror. While some viewers may find the plot confusing, if you pay attention to the details the film presents, you can easily figure out what's happening. Pushing the storyline along are many great actors. Each actor embodies their character so well that the viewer shares in their fears, ambitions and even confusion.<br/><br/>As every movie before this one, Silent Hill is not perfect. For instance, the pacing of the movie is highly inconsistent. It feels as though the beginning of the movie is rushed so that we can get to the ""good stuff"" in the middle. Also, midway through the film, the character Rose transforms from a scared, confused victim to a hardened, determined heroine. While this was to be expected, it happened in the span of two scenes and felt rushed. Another complaint I had was some of the dialogue. In the beginning of the film, before they venture into Silent Hill, the dialogue was corny at best and there are a few lines here and there throughout the movie that made me wonder what the writers were thinking.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with very high expectations. Happily, I wasn't let down as badly as I thought I'd be. While it wasn't a perfect movie, this is one that I'm glad I saw. If you are looking for a good horror or mystery movie and don't mind a little gore (or if you enjoy it), go to your local movie theater and venture into the depths of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Grade: B (8/10)"
"BadWolfX","10","2","4","27 April 2006"," Silent Hill Rocks!
","Okay, first Things first. This movie rocks. All those people who hate it, its because you didn't understand. Meaing you didn't listen. Anyway, review.<br/><br/>From the beginning, Silent Hill shows you that the film will be the great. The main characters are fairly introduced and you understand them. But the action really kicks off when she gets to Silent Hill. When shes running down the alley, it really reminded me of the first game. The grey children are great and portrayed magnificently and their screams are fantastic. The School scene is greatly portrayed and looks like it did in the game. The film really kicks off when the school gos alternate. The Janitor is so creepy, even if its in for only a short period of time. And Pyramid Head is great in the two scenes hes in. The Nurse scene is great and the gore is great in that sequence. Not too much no too little.<br/><br/>The finale in the church is spectacular. The portraying of Cybils burning, the Bed-Bound Allysa and the ending are great. Sure some people may not understand it but you couldn't expect everyone.<br/><br/>All in all this film is awesome. Okay, so the dialogue is a little eek and Christabella is slightly over-top, but the rest of the film overshadows it. A Favourite and Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Ten Outta Ten!"
"petrinurmi","9","2","4","27 April 2006"," Satan of Silent Hll
","In semitic mythology the fallen angel (known as Satan) loved God. He loved God so much that when God created a man and asked Satan to bow to him, Satan refused. He'd kneel only in front of God himself and nobody else. That is why God casted Satan out. So if we follow through this mythology, Satan is God's most loyal servant, although misguided.<br/><br/>In many cases literature (Faust, Paradise Lost...) has recognized Satan as a sympathetic, deeply troubled figure. In the movie Silent Hill, Satan is portrayed extremely sadistic but also like a person who knows what it's like to be bullied. That is why Satan identifies so much with the unjustly accused little girl. And that is why Satan understands the mother too. In fact, Satan condemns people in this film in the same way like Jesus condemned those heretics in Jerusalem. The difference of course is that the motivation of Satan's actions comes from the girl's hatred. Hatred is Satans's fuel that burns as it's shown metaphorically in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie leaves you with a certain kind of justified feeling of Satan's maneuvers. I mean, I would like to believe that Satan prefers the most harvesting among the people who justify their evil actions with God's will. If you think this way, Satan does God's dirty work. With the kind of people as our leaders today, at least we should hope so."
"hambrehorst","9","2","4","27 April 2006"," Yes.. It has been done
","It must not have been too hard seeing that the Silent hill games are more intelligent and has more depth than almost any movie out there, but this movie pulls it off. If Boll would have gotten this mission he'd have ruined it and dragged the game along with it. (.See Paul A's maculation of Resident evil. a game not really ready for a movie and especially not by Paul.) No this has an intelligent, beautiful and artful foundation and Gans has along with Avary and Boukhrief really done their best to pay respect to this mythos and earned a part of it.<br/><br/>2 hours could not really tell a story like a 17 hour game could though, and being a sucker for darkness i would have enjoyed an even darker tone just because Silent hill is that dark, it has possibilities to go anywhere."
"Cormano-wild","9","2","4","26 April 2006"," The Silent Hill That Roared
","There's good reason to be afraid if you go to see ""Silent Hill"". It was directed by a relatively untested Frenchman entirely new to the Hollywood scene, its producers refused to screen it to American critics, it's received schizophrenically mixed reviews, and, worst of all, is based upon a video game. Scary stuff.<br/><br/>However, I'm willing to bet that if you approach ""Silent Hill"" with an open mind and some basic literacy in Japanese horror, all those middling fears will be entirely subsumed by the far greater terrors which await you in the town of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>For Silent Hill proves to be quite the eerie place. A small mining town abandoned long ago since the town's coal mines caught fire, slaughtering most of the town's inhabitants and igniting ashy infernos which continue to cover the town in soot to this very day, it's the kind of place you'd never consider visiting. Unless, that is, your adopted daughter keeps screaming the words ""Silent Hill"" in the midst of dangerous sleepwalks and you, the concerned mother, decide to take your daughter to the source of her nightmares to puzzle the whole thing out.<br/><br/>Which is precisely the situation Rose (Radha Mitchell) and her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) soon find themselves in. Rose soon begins to regret her decision when she crashes her S.U.V., is knocked unconscious, and wakes up to find her daughter missing in a town populated with supernatural beasties. Throw in Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), a kind-hearted cop sucked into Rose's hellish ordeal, Christopher (Sean Bean) as Rose's distraught husband in search of his missing wife and daughter, a puritanical cult, a healthy serving of altered realities, and some of the most terrible depictions of diabolical evil committed to the silver screen, and you've got one terrifying, if slightly confusing, film.<br/><br/>Indeed, so satisfying did I find the film that I have difficulty understanding the negative press which has assailed ""Silent Hill"". Sure, the acting was not the best at time, but in an R-rated horror film, who cares about the acting as long as plenty of people get brutally eviscerated by demons from alternate dimension? (Warning  ""Silent Hill"" is not for the squeamish.) All that I can imagine is that some American viewers could not understand the movie because they are unfamiliar with the fundamental tropes of Japanese horror and video gaming, both of which heavily influence the film.<br/><br/>So, a crash course. Japanese horror might be better compared to American suspense thrillers in that the fear derives not so much from monsters behind doors and excessive gore, as from the unknown. Hence the predominance of ghastly little girls, for what can be more foreign to your average living male adult theater-goer than the mind of an undead female child? So often in Japanese horror films, what goes on is deliberately confusing, for if it could be easily understood, it would not be as scary. Further, the Japanese often focus on the emotional manifestations of terror such as ghosts and poltergeists, than concrete, physical bogeyman, such as serial killers.<br/><br/>So if you go to see ""Silent Hill,"" just remember that you might not see everything you might want to see, and so you might feel a bit confused. But stop to feel for a second: Are you afraid? If so, ""Silent Hill"" has done its job, and I'm willing to nominate the film for Employee of the Month."

","Thoroughly enjoyed this film and can say I agree it is the best game to movie port I've ever seen. The acting was spot on and the monsters and effects all very true to the source material, unlike Resident Evil. The feeling of dread when the sirens start to sound can only be matched by the dread felt in The Descent - another excellent horror. I loved the Pyramid head character but felt he could have been in the film more, at the expense of much of the scenes involving the remaining locals of Silent Hill. However, use of these characters did go some way towards explaining the origins of the town. The ending was perfect as it matched the game's confusion in just over what happened. Such an ending is perfect for post film discussion. Sequels will hopefully be forthcoming and should be based on Christoper's attempts to find out what happened to his family. I'd like to see a sequel concentrate on the prison found under the lake in Silent Hill 2."

If you saw DOOM or House of the Dead you know how bad a video game movie can be. <br/><br/>The gore wasn't overdone and yet was plentiful enough to create a good horror pick. I also enjoyed the fact of them incorporating all of the usual characters and environments you would find in any of the Silent Hill games. You knew eventually you'd see the next monster and the graphics didn't disappoint, especially for not using a lot of CGI. I was overall pleased. I even found myself scared and jumpy just as the games make you feel. They really caught the scope and strange feelings all the games create."

Just imagine Heather from ""Silent Hill 3"" when she discovers the ill horrors of the dead town, and there you have Radha Mitchell as Rose; a truly perfect acting woman in the tradition of Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory in ""Resident Evil"". On the other hand the church-people she meets could get on your nerves. Especially when you dislike the occult."

","Now I know that a lot of people don't like this movie, but overall when compared to other video game based films (I.E. In The Dark, Doom, Bloodrayne) this one can easily be seen as above the norm. Its original because unlike basic horror movies it presents an eerie feel that isn't based on dumb moments that attempt to make you jump. Instead it focuses on the the disturbing, like the Silent Hill games. The acting in this movie was pretty exceptional for the talent they had, although at some times the constant screaming by Rose gets annoying. Seeing a bit more of the fighting in the movie would have been good, considering that in the games you get to beat the creatures with lead pipes and shoot them with a variety of weaponry. Overall, however, I think that the movie provides a good introduction into the world of Silent Hill and should be seen by every moviegoer interested in a new type horror experience."
"ddowsing-1","7","2","4","26 April 2006"," the best game-to-film adaptation yet
","i am a huge fan of the Silent Hill series and as such was anticipating the release of the movie; and here is my opinion.<br/><br/>the look of the games has been captured beautifully. all credit to Gans and his crew for actually taking the time to capture the tone and feel of the games. When Rose entered the 'alternate' Silent Hill for the first time i grinned like a Cheshire cat because it was like being in one of the games. All the little details of the games are there; from the way the monsters cause static on the radios (this isn't consistent however), to the fog that continually shrouds the town (the falling ash was a particularly nice touch i thought) and the way the monsters react to torchlight - such as in a textbook scene involving the faceless nurses - all create a world fans of the games will feel right at home in. <br/><br/>The monsters too were spot on. Not only did they look cool but they were also genuinely unnerving. Memories of the first monster you meet in Hill 2 came flooding back to me! They even have that gooey/silvery sheen to them. The scene in the hospital with the army of faceless nurses was incredible. Again, it was as though we were in the game. I couldn't help but let out a cheer when Pyramid Head first makes his appearance because he looks perfect. A much better job then the appalling Nemesis attempt in Resi 2: Apocalypse. The only let down is that he appears three times then vanishes; however take my word you won't forget him. <br/><br/>The music is also excellent. Fans will spot the theme from the original game as well as the Hill 3 song that plays over the credits. The music creates a genuinely foreboding and, sometimes, melancholic atmosphere. This was probably helped by the inclusion of the Silent Hill music team who worked on the games; so once again well done to Gans and co. for paying attention to the source material and those who created it.<br/><br/>There is some great camera work too. Certain camera angles are reminiscent of those used in the games while others, especially those used during the 'alternate' scenes, are quite unsettling. Silent Hill feels huge and the protagonist so much smaller. <br/><br/>The characters and actors however are my main problem. First off there are too many of them. Every so often the action will cut away from that of Rose and Cybill to focus on the rather pointless characters of Sean Bean and Kim Coates. They are not needed and add little to the story. I say this because Silent Hill the setting is so well created that i didn't want to leave it. However there is a good section with Chris (Bean) and Rose in the school. Also the film loses it's edge a little with the introduction of the citizens. By all means Silent Hill has it's odd citizen to pass on some cryptic message or information, but by having a whole army of townspeople the sense of isolation and of being alone is somewhat lost. The citizens are a cult as per most Hill story lines and are therefore integral but maybe there could have been less of them. <br/><br/>It was an interesting move to exchange a male lead for a female one but it works well. In a similar way to Alice in the first Resi film, Rose is a new character in a familiar setting. It allows for some carte blanche with the storyline of the game and also keeps things fresh a part of the Hill world. Radha Mitchell does a good job even if in the middle of the film she seems a bit wooden. Laurie Holden as Cybil does a superb job. She looks like Cybil and ultimately kicks arse. She plays the character in a really tough manner which again leads me to wonder why Bean's character was needed. I am a Sean Bean fan but his performance was uncomfortable because he attempts an (embarassing) American accent throughout the film. Sean Bean is one of these actors who does not need to adapt his accent in a film! (see Sean Connery or Brian Cox also). <br/><br/>So why 7 then? The film looks great, sounds great and feels great. The only real let down is the sheer volume of characters which towards the end hamper the film's edge. Plus at times the acting can be a bit wooden. However as a game-to-film conversion it has set a new standard. Directors and studios can no longer slap a gaming name on a sub-par movie; they have to understand and appreciate the detail and character. Go see it! I know i will again."

","OK so I went to see Silent Hill, having never played the video games, and I had no clue what the movie was about (hence no preconceived notions, bias, etc).<br/><br/>To all who say that this is a horror movie: NO. This is an intelligent, psychological thriller with gory overtones. There is a difference.<br/><br/>At first, I was like ""Ok, so this is like a typical creepy movie."" The beginning was slow, it had the creepy little girl that had night terrors about Silent Hill, etc etc. But as the story progressed, it became apparent that it was so much more than typical creepy movies. While I did not jump a single time during the movie, I was thoroughly creeped out through the whole thing: the special effects were so realistically gory. The armless whatever-they-were's, the dead guy all bound up with barbed wire, the chick getting her skin ripped off, and the crazy occult-leader woman getting torn to half. So if you don't care about the intelligence of the movie and just want a gore fest, then go see it.<br/><br/>Radha Miller was fantastic. I've only seen her in Pitch Black, so it was cool to see her in something else. The chick playing Officer Bennett was a good actress too.<br/><br/>The downsides: I seriously could not stand the little girl playing Sharon's because during her ""evil half"" scene, she went on and on about who she was and stuff (the morbid little girl act getting pretty stale after the first 10 minutes) and during her ""good half"" scenes, her acting was just flat out unconvincing.<br/><br/>The one girl that got her skin ripped off was annoying in that she had that severely-disconnected-thought-processes aura about her (but I attributed that to the brainwashing of her cult).<br/><br/>And really, the plot was pretty far-fetched. While the plots of most movies like this usually ARE fantastical, this was just too much of a stretch: but the individuality of the storyline made up for it.<br/><br/>Overall however, I really enjoyed this movie. I think anyone that likes gore, really really weird occult stuff, getting creeped out, and/or just having a good time, should go see it. :)"
"amazing_sincodek","9","2","4","25 April 2006"," Not a fantastic film, but ""it's almost like coming home again"" for fans.
","As a movie, Silent Hill is no masterpiece. I cannot argue with critics like Ebert who give it one and a half stars. Truly, the characters are flat and predictable, the dialog and acting is sometimes laughably awful. When I saw the film, the audience seemed to often mistake poor writing for comic relief.<br/><br/>I can honestly say, however, that I enjoyed every second of the film, and not just in a superficial, ""oh, that was kind of cool,"" sort of way. I thought to myself, but hesitated to admit for fear of sounding like an angry 13 year old goth kid, that I had never felt so comfortable as I had during the last 30 minutes of the film. But then I saw that another reviewer had felt that watching the film was ""almost like coming home again,"" and honestly, that's the only way to describe it.<br/><br/>The images of decaying restrooms, the raining ash, and the hyperbolic violence, good, and evil, will all strike a deep chord in fans of Silent Hill. The acting, the script, even the story become irrelevant: it is the world itself that is important, and this world is recreated so perfectly it alone carries the film onto a high pedestal in the eyes of long-time fans."

","Firstly I would like to start by saying I did play Silent Hill the computer game once but was too scared to go-on. Call me a wuss but it just seemed like it was meant to be a movie.<br/><br/>And thank-the-sweet-lord it is not even close to the crapness of other video-game/movie conversions : Tomb Raider and the dreaded Resident Evil to name but two.<br/><br/>This film is the first in an incredibly long time that literally had me griping my seat at the cinema and trying to control my racing heart.<br/><br/>It has everything, a great plot, its brilliantly directed and the screenplay is fantastic. It's so moody and eerie you can't escape the horror of the characters. Some scenes will make you shiver.<br/><br/>The cast are great too, adding to the emotional depth of the film. I have to say this film will sound like any other horror when you describe it to your mates as it is quite gory. But really it has so much more than gore, and the gore it uses is tasteful if that makes any sense! It goes with the atmosphere of the film.<br/><br/>All I can say is that if you have been put up by recent awful horror films such as Hostel, Silent Hill will give you hope that not only can horror films still be scary and gripping and exhilarating, but computer game adaptations CAN work!"

I am aware that to someone who has never seen or even heard of the game it may not be the easiest to follow along with, yet Resident Hoebag came out back when I was in AIT and everyone swore to jebus that it was the best movie of the time?

It is visually accurate to the game, it has a good solid plot which combines the story elements of the first two games.<br/><br/>Another thing that got me exited while I was watching the film was that they used a lot of the Music, sound effects and memorable shots from the game series. It really made me feel that the director had taken the time and care to research these things.<br/><br/>Although I didn't really see the point Cybil Bennet being killed towards the end, it seemed such a waste. I also didn't get how Sean Bean's character fitted into the story, he seemed a lot like Harry Mason but seemed utterly useless.<br/><br/>But overall it was very dark, very visual and extremely enjoyable.

"debtheikari","9","2","4","25 April 2006"," Great movie, even better video-game movie
","This movie has hit the bulls-eye in nearly every aspect that makes a movie a good movie. What makes it even better is it accurately goes along with the video game which it is based off of. The actors are perfect fits, even with a few cheesy lines here and there, the actors did wonderful jobs of portraying the characters and displaying the story for you.<br/><br/>The movie has lots of creepy action, it keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what will happen next to the characters. Even with all the scares and action, very limited amounts of CG was used. Nearly no CG was used on any of the characters and environments. It was mostly makeup and latex which created Silent Hill's horrific creatures. This was a plus as too much CG can often ruin a movie's personality.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is slowly fed to you throughout the movie, letting you pick up the small bits and pieces on your own and piece it together for yourself. That is until the end where it shows you the whole puzzle at once. This was the movie's main downfall. Many pieces of the story were not laid out for you before it tells you the whole story all at once, it ends up being slightly overwhelming if you didn't pay close attention or had no background on the story of Silent Hill. The director could have done a better job with spreading the bits and pieces out for you beforehand, even if it was done in a subtle way.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is exhilarating to watch. You get to learn the horrible story of a little girl's past, while enjoying being terrified of the creatures in the hell that is Silent Hill."

"BurntFilm","8","2","4","25 April 2006"," Silent Hill appeases the horror gods . . .
","Silent Hill screams horror with 3-D sound, trippy scores, and imagery that leaves bloodstains on your psyche. If you love the surreal, I can guarantee Silent Hill will be worth your while. <br/><br/>I like it for its sincerity to the genre, as in, Silent Hill is a real-deal horror show. The characters, for the most part, seem genuine enough to feel dread for them--and for myself, all in the dark . . . in the theater. (Glad my lady was there to protect me.)<br/><br/>There are some seriously cheesy parts, though, but the ""good"" parts almost make you forget about them--cheese in movies is inevitable, right? <br/><br/>The imagery and atmosphere of the film is very Alice and Wonderland-y. In the theater I noticed some people hated the film, but the majority enjoyed it and were generally rapt--and horrified. I believe this movie is a love/hate affair, which makes it far from mediocre in my book. <br/><br/>One word sums up Silent Hill for me: phantasmagoria. It's fantastic, it's gory, and I want more of ya'."
"ninfank","10","2","4","25 April 2006"," Great Movie!
","I'd like to begin by blatantly stating that this movie is excellent. It sticks closely to the game and gives a sense of nostalgia as careful detail was taken to be true to the game (which I appreciated in a BIG way after being horribly disappointed by Resident Evil and Doom movies). This movie is not a horror film nor is it a slasher movie. If you are looking for such movies, watch something else. This is, as fox_hound put it, a nightmare drama. The film -- and the games themselves -- are all based on atmosphere. Noises like small children and metal scraping/grinding in the background make the hair on your neck stand and give the games a creepy atmosphere. The scenes are not meant to startle you, but rather keep you on the edge of your seat and fully involve you in the story. There's a reason many people say they can watch someone else play Silent Hill but can't play through it themselves -- it is the atmosphere you experience playing the game. For those of you who have played the game, you will be turning to your buddies frequently in excitement over noticing a detail from the game they've placed in the movie. For the sake of not spoiling a single moment I won't delve into anything -- though I'd like to argue those who thought it was bad because their reasons are void and misleading. So if you enjoyed playing or watching the games or you are just in the mood for a nightmare mystery/drama, this movie is an excellent choice. I went with 4 people, 3 of which played the games and thought it was amazing, and 1 who asked at the end, ""What? That was based on a game?!"" (she still enjoyed it, however) So if you haven't played the games or don't know anything about Silent Hill, keep in mind this isn't a slasher film and just enjoy the movie for what it is -- a mystery set in a creepy atmosphere aimed at making you think to understand what is going on. Enjoy!"
"ravvo99","9","2","4","25 April 2006"," It is legitimately good, but you have to get 20 minutes in
","This movie is legitimately superb at what it sets out to do. It intends to be a horror movie which really gets under your skin and scares you and bothers you. The people who feel that this is a horrible movie are either 1) trying to compare this movie to classics and missing the intent of the movie or 2) are, to borrow a mencia term, ""dee dee dees"". I feel that Sean bean's character is pretty much used for exposition, but besides that there is no glaring flaw int he movie as a horror movie. It has one of the most enveloping atmospheres. You will be sucked head first into the movie. The story, monsters, and characters, while adapted straight from the the movie, are all fitting and NO ONE will be lost because they didn't play the game. I'll repeat this again. you DO NOT need to play the game to understand this. As a matter of fact, if all you know is that ""silent hill is a town where hell and earth can exist at the same time for some reason"" you may be better off than people who know everything about the game, because the movie is quite clear in what everything means by the end. You have to wait till the end for it to be spelled out explicitly, but if you pay any attention at all, you'll start piecing it together by the 40 minute mark. Horror movies don't need this masterpiece academy award winning writing, their intention is to get you in the story and disturb you at some core place, not to win an academy award for best picture. It does its job better than any movie in years, bar none. And thats all that matters."
"johnnyneurotic","9","2","4","25 April 2006"," Holy crap
","Okay. So I've seen the movie twice in three days now. The first time I couldn't wipe the crap-eating grin off of my face. Fantastic. It seemed to me like a fusion of the 1st and 2nd installments of the video game. For instance, the scene at the end where Alessa rises up in the bed is similar to James's wife in Silent Hill 2, but the mother daughter plot is very much Silent Hill 1. Pyramid Head is most definitely in it in some brief but satisfying moments, but the purpose of his presence isn't made, which leads me to believe that they'll either have an explanation for him in the future, or Chris and folk knew they had to get him in because everyone loved him and couldn't wait for him (or because there will be no sequel and not showing him ever would be inhumane to fans). Personally, I'm wondering how they would go about doing a sequel, since the third and fourth installments are pretty distanced from the others. For that reason though, it's feasible for them to do it without creating some crazy plot-holes, but it'd have to mean no more pyramid head, since he's not involved. So parts of the movie I questioned the second time around. First of all, there are a couple of lines when the script gets bad. For instance, the comic relief about the town really being haunted. Also, when the lead actress has the white radiant light behind her after she enters the church. Her speech starts to seem a little awkward with the lighting for some reason. Cybil's make-up, as well as the nurse with the jacked-up eyes. I've seen better. Cybil probably needed more swelling and less cuts on her, and the nurse seemed like an excuse just to squeeze in some extra gore, which at the time was totally unnecessary. It really could have been a lot better. Hell, I would have been happier if they'd just caved her whole face in. Other than those moments, the movie was fantastic. Best video game adaptation EVER. And a fantastic drama/horror film. The R rating was well deserved and there's no way they could have pulled it off without it. I'm so buying the DVD when it hits stores."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","9","2","4","24 April 2006"," ""The bad place"" horror formula has rarely been better
","Sharon is a young girl who is having recurring nightmares about a place called Silent Hill. Her adopted mother, Rose, has become increasingly worried as the nightmares have become more intensive. In effort to get to the bottom of the whole situation, Rose decides to actually go to Silent Hill to see for herself what could be frightening Sharon so much. Much to Rose's terror, nothing has prepared her what is idling beneath the surface in... Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Director Christophe Gans, who previously made the viscerally intense horror flick ""The Brotherhood of the Wolf"" shows the same promise as a horror director with this film. Eerie tracking and overhead shots, good use of darkness, and a good development of the story as a sickening secret is revealed. Rose's first encounter with 'the darkness' in the town of Silent Hill is a terrifically pulse pounding scene and from then on the terror barely lets up. It is only matched by the spectacularly brutal climax and it is the best 'bad guys get killed' scene since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Also in a good move the film doesn't go overboard with gore by choosing to show it in certain well cut moments and that makes the climax sheer heart pounding horror fun. The film is even comparable to John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" in terms of mixing suspense and gore.<br/><br/>Props also go to Roger Avary for writing the script which is a near perfectly executed masterpiece under Gans's direction. Avary hasn't really full submerged himself in the horror genre before the making of this film, but with these results, the genre has a great new writer, who puts together many classical horror ingredients in a nice new feast. The film's music, by Jeff Danna and Akira Yamoaka (who also did the game series), is also eerily effective.<br/><br/>Great stuff all around. 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R: intense horror violence/gore and some profanity"

","I have been a huge of fan the Silent Hill series since the first one came out. The only one I didn't truly love was #4, it wasn't the same game or ""feeling"" as the others. I still like it though. I went and saw this movie with fear and excitement. I didn't want this to be a ""lets make some money from fans of the game"". I saw it the second day it was out due to work schedules. The crowd was very well behaved through the entire movie, (which is normally one thing that ruins all movies for me.) I normally tend to not like most movies I go see...I guess I get my hopes up, or its because a lot of ""great"" movies are not at the theaters. The last serious horror film I saw that I enjoyed fully was the 80's remake of The Thing. I'm 21, and the first time I saw this was about 7 years ago. I'm a big fan of both of Rob Zombie's films as well, but those don't really fall into the horror genre for me. For horror, I have turned almost entirely to games. Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Fatal Frame, Doom, Alone in the Dark....these are games that have more time spent on the details of being creepy, dark, scary, and entertaining than most scary movies today. If there is not some massive amount of nudity, disgusting rape scene, 50 ""boo"" moments, or someone dieing every 10 minutes, then it ""sucks"" to the general public. Right when the movie ended, a lady behind me said ""I don't get it"". I turned around and said, ""go play the games"". She took this like I meant ""the movie sucked compared to the games"". I just looked at her blankly and said ""I understood it just fine"". This brings me to finally saying I thought this film captured the game in so many ways that it boggled my mind. At many times, I forgot many of the creatures were costumes and not CGI. The story made sense to me, maybe because I know the games front to back, or maybe because I can recognize that the movie Hostile is 75% lame porn, and 25% ""we did this part to make the movie gross and creepy"", and not a horror movie. I'm not a Genius (sarcasm) movie reviewer like Ebert, but I can tell you that out of the more than 25 reviews I have read for this movie.....all but 2 actually put any thought into what the movie was about and what the end meant. I fully enjoyed this movie, and recommend that anyone that wants to see a very beautifully disturbing film, please go see it. If you have trouble understanding it, then give it some credit and THINK about what it might mean, and not just say it ""sucks"" because you don't want to. thank you - Scott"
"timofyu","Null","2","4","24 April 2006"," Good, but something's missing...
","I adore SH games, and I enjoyed the film. Especially in this foggy night of north London, which coincides with the atmosphere in the game.<br/><br/>But there is something missing in this film adaptation. SH horror is fundamentally based on psychological aspects toward heaven and hell inspired from film Jacob's Ladder, blended with Demonology and dark American folklore flavours. The filmmakers paid a lot attentions on the look and camera work to re-create game-play stimulation, but missed out the suspenseful sound effects and the true essence of the game - the ambiguity relations between characters and monsters, the hidden puzzles of mysterious Silent Hill nature, and the dark humour towards the whole insanity, those made the game appealing. Besides a cinema experience would never be the same as a single player gaming experience, therefore the film seemed less shocking nor scary for me.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I think the film is still pretty enjoyable. I also respect it as a filmmaker's contribution to the original SH story, appears to be intriguing and entertaining. Although I felt that Yamaoka should have composed a new set of soundtracks instead of using all the songs from the game series."
"lallen3-1","10","2","4","24 April 2006"," Excellent Stand-Alone movie!!
","I think the movie was great by itself, it stands on its own. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the name changes with only certain characters and not others.. The story of Alessa is a great one, but the film tweaks it quite a bit. Overall I think it's a great first movie and I hope to see more movies and games. Perhaps the next movie will be more like SH2. I think I would have liked the movie a lot more if I had not played any of the games, but I think it could be considered another way of telling the same story. If a sequel is made, I can only assume it'll be better than this film in that this movie was most likely a learning experience."
"SqueakyG","7","2","4","24 April 2006"," Why critics hated it, but I think it's pretty good
","SPOILERS are found throughout this review!! For a Silent Hill fan the first half is incredibly faithful and pleasing, taking you through the exact same locations and delivering the same unnerving tone of mounting terror; but the second half sadly goes a bit mental and spoils things. People who are unfamiliar with the games may have the opposite view: the first half may feel far too slow and boring because it won't evoke fond memories of playing the game, and the second half is when things finally get interesting.<br/><br/>Even a fan has to admit that the faithfulness is taken a little too seriously. The plot often plays out too much like a game: Rose finds clues, which lead her to more clues, and so on. Every demon encounter feels like a boss battle; every location a ""level"". Trouble is you're not playing it, and games aren't quite as fun as a spectator. That's not to say it doesn't work as good horror. I think the film is very successful at capturing the tense unease of playing the game. I don't find any films ""scary"", but this one comes closer than any other horror I've seen in recent years. The phases between foggy and dark dimensions are handled really well, and cause a Pavlovian response when you hear the air raid siren: you fear the coming darkness because you know how twisted and sick its world is... and you fear Pyramid Head. I also think this is the best a horror film has ever succeeded at making you feel you're in a nightmare. Usually when a horror movie character goes down into the monster's lair you think, ""Don't do down there you unbelievable cliché!"" But when Rose ventures deeper into the hellish industrial world of rust and flesh, it feels like when you're in a nightmare and you can't resist the pull of what you know will terrify you.<br/><br/>So yeah, it works as a horror film. It's like the other Japanese remakes, except without the... you know... dullness.<br/><br/>Sean Bean's subplot comes in for criticism because it feels tacked on and superfluous. Indeed it is: the studio demanded a subplot for Rose's husband because the script was all-female without him. Some of his scenes are completely extraneous and hurt the film, but I wouldn't want to remove it because it adds the extra dimension - literally - of Christopher searching for his wife in the real world while she is trapped in another.<br/><br/>And all the cute little things for game fans to pick up on? You get Midwich Elementary; Pyramid Head and the huge mega-machete that he drags around; demon nurses; scenes and camera angles identical to the game; Brahms,Toluca Lake and street name references; and the nurse Lisa Garland has a small but faithful part towards the end.<br/><br/>But I'm done aiming this review at fans - it's time to address why most people don't like it. A lot of critics just didn't understand the different dimensions characters found themselves in, both literal and figurative. This is odd, because it's nothing film critics haven't encountered before in successful examples of the genre. I believe these critics - who are able to appreciate films like Jacob's Ladder and Mulholland Dr. - are unwilling to give Silent Hill the same artistic credit purely because of its video game origins, which is narrow-minded. On the other hand I can't blame them completely, because Silent Hill is often let down by bad acting and scripting that unfortunately puts it in a league below other subversive horror cinema. It's nowhere near as bad as Paul Anderson or Uwe Boll's dreck, but it's somewhat spoiled by some tacky production elements.<br/><br/>It's true the film has some unintentional comedy - the kind of moments that are usually ironed out with test screenings. Some of it is cliché and bad character motivation. Motorcycle cop Cybil looks like the T1000 when we first see her, and her arrest of Rose is irrational and silly. Dahlia looks too ""made up for film"" to be believable. Some lines of dialogue just sound corny, especially exclamations from Cybil and some lines from Sharon (though Jodelle Ferland is a great little actress in general). The scene where the demon nurses twitch into life and start moving rhythmically made one guy in the audience start singing ""Thriller"", and I'm sure that's not an isolated case. The film reaches unfortunate heights of cheesiness when the cult starts screaming for witch burnings. In fact the entire climax of the film is spoiled by over-theatrical dialogue delivery. The big ""explanation scene"" from Alessa is a bit overdone and patronising too, rather like a Bond villain explaining his plans too elaborately.<br/><br/>Time to wrap up. I call this a successful horror film, but I have no idea if you will. Fan opinion shows that what is engrossing and scary to one person looks stupid to another. Scenes that made me tense might make you roll your eyes and laugh. I think the first half sucks you into a very palpable nightmare, and the second half tells a good consistent story for those willing to comprehend it. Kind of like the town itself, Silent Hill exists between two worlds. A little too artistically and thematically rich for average moviegoers, but a little too mainstream and goofy to be ranked alongside the cinema it hoped to equal."

","OK, I'll admit that the movie had its problems, for example that stupid little girl that I hate like nothing else, but I don't get most of these critics. They didn't play the games, don't know what the series is about, and then they write harmful reviews? No thats an understatement, they write reviews that completely butcher the movie for fans. For example, how are they to know that nearly ALL of the music is from the game? Or notice familiar areas from the town? I just want the critics to not ruin it for fans when they don't know whats going on. <br/><br/>They also complain that there's to much CG in the film, but the monsters were people in costume. Most of the computer graphics were used for the fog and Barb wire part. I read the reviews for this movie and I just don't understand what their crying about. <br/><br/>I've played all the Silent Hill games and loved them(I'm a guy so I don't use the word ""love"" often)and I got excited when i noticed things from the series. So, if you haven't played the games, don't ruin the movie for fans because your the one whose lost and confused. I really don't think your qualified."
"vilkit","10","2","4","24 April 2006"," some people are never satisfied, however i was completely satisfied
","When i first saw the trailer for Silent Hill, i immediately noticed a short audio sample from the game near the end of the trailer.. Besides the scenes revealed in trailer which got my hopes up... this short audio sample relieved a lot of the worries i had about the Silent Hill movie.<br/><br/>It seemed, at that moment that movie was in good hands. They were being faithful to the games in both visual and maybe even more importantly the audio department. From what i had also seen in the trailer, the film didn't have any of the trademark cheesiness of other video game adaptations seen in movies like street fighter, resident evil, or tomb raider. If i didn't know any better, i wouldn't have known this film was based on anything except an original screenplay. But of course, trailers can be very deceitful sometimes..<br/><br/>Opening day, i was skeptical once again. I heard bad things about the movie from film critics, but i decided to put that aside, along with any positive or negative preconceptions i had about the film. I'm pretty happy to say that, that this film met and exceeded my expectations. The trailer didn't lie, and my months of waiting were not in vain.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier the music in the movie. it's pretty breath taking.. and it really adds to the whole 'Silent Hill' experience. The films producers and directors really went out of their way to capture the essence of Silent Hill, both in art style and presentation.<br/><br/>The great thing about the music is that all the music are compositions from the game's soundtrack. So for the film, there wasn't necessarily a need for a composer.. Just an arranger. Just the best and most appropriate tracks from the Silent Hill games to integrate into the film. The great thing about the soundtracks for the video games themselves, is that the composer doesn't write generic run of the mill video game music. He writes dark atmospheric trip-hop esquire instrumentals. Using original compositions from video games into its film counterpart is unprecedented. They should be applauded for this as well.<br/><br/>It really adds to the authentic feel of 'Silent Hill'. I never felt once during the film that it was like a 'Hollywood' version of Silent Hill, i felt like it was a genuine Silent Hill experience. From the visuals, the twisted camera angles, the monsters, the characters, the storyline and the dialogue.<br/><br/>Its all extremely true to the game. I remember reading about the movie months ago, and i was pleased to learn that the screenwriter (half of the writing team of pulp fiction) sat down and played all the Silent Hill games before penning the script for the movie. It really shows. The guy has the Silent Hill feel and universe down real tight, and the director captured the essence of the game perfectly. (He even inserts obscure Silent Hill references that only the most attentive will get) I was pleased to see some of the most awesomely gruesome death scenes I've ever seen. and I'm really happy that pyramid head made it in the movie. He's certainly one of the most memorable villains I've ever seen. I hope we'll see more of him in a hopefully inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>Now besides the 100% loyalty the filmmakers had to the game when translating the game's storyline, atmosphere, feel and music.. The movie itself is executed beautifully. You can walk in and not know a single thing about 'Silent Hill' and still appreciate it.<br/><br/>What most people don't realize is that Silent Hill and the games that spawned it.. Is that it was never intended to be a 100% horror. It is also partially a mystery. There are always open ended questions and unanswered questions. You will leave the theater wondering exactly what just happened, you'll think about all the clues, all the bits in the storyline and piece them together to make sense of everything.<br/><br/>Some of the chief complaints of this movie by 'reputable' critics is that they didn't understand it, or that it was too confusing, or that it takes itself too seriously. I applaud the filmmakers FOR taking this seriously, for making a real effort at faithfully adapting a video game to the screen without compromising its essence making a 'Hollywood' version of 'Silent Hill'. It is okay to not have the entire plot and the loose ends explained to the viewer. its okay to leave the theater figuring out the movie.<br/><br/>I heard somewhere that this film was actually 3.5 hours long initially, and they cut it down. I'd love to see the full cut of this film. This is a film that may do even better on DVD because its one that requires repeated viewings to appreciate. Perhaps movie going audiences have been so spoiled by horror movies with contrived plots, or movies that focus exclusively on gore or torture scenes without so much as a thought to the storyline. If you're one of those people, you won't enjoy those movies.<br/><br/>And for the fans of the games that didn't enjoy this film and are complaining. Please stop being so fickle. When a video game movie is typically released it is unfaithful adaptation of the game (Street Fighter Anyone?), and the community raises hell. Now that the video game community has a film that 100% accurate and faithful to the games, they still have the nerve to complain? We are sending mixed signals to Hollywood.<br/><br/>Watch this movie to simply appreciate it for its musical score, or its visual presentation, or its great storyline. Or all of them. Whatever you choose, you'll be satisfied.<br/><br/>Avary/Gans did a wonderful job, thank goodness the film was in such able hands.<br/><br/>Favian fav1an at yahoo dot com"

Perhaps if I had, then this review wouldn't sound so clueless, and I might have enjoyed myself much more. But to clear one thing up about the above sentences, I did play the very first ""Silent Hill"" game when it came out in 1999 on the Sony Playstation, but for only about 10 minutes before I took the disc out because I was so terrified of it... and nothing had happened yet!<br/><br/>Flipping through the pages of my March '99 issue of Official Playstation Magazine, I'm reminded of my first frightful moments playing that game, even though nothing had happened. There's a wonderful interview with the game's Japanese developers, and the review's author Joe Rybicki obviously seems pleased with the game - its twisted story, atmosphere, scary touches, and disturbing music and sound effects.<br/><br/>But I have to look at the movie a little bit different. It's directed by a capable Frenchman, Christophe Gans (of 2001's ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""), who keeps a strong bit of tension in the opening 45 minutes but lets it go when more characters pop out of nowhere and the story could have used some more polishing. Dread, fear, and paranoia grip Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) when her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) mysteriously disappears in the ash-tainted, fog-drenched ghost town of Silent Hill, West Virginia.<br/><br/>Hot on her trail is cop Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), and so is husband Christopher (Sean Bean), who seeks to stop Rose by any means possible. See, daughter Sharon has a problem with sleepwalking at night, and is always whispering into her mother's ear the eerie name ""Silent Hill,"" the haunted West Virginia town abandoned 30 years earlier where the fires in the underground mines still burn. So Rose searches, but even as the sirens blare, the town goes dark, and she quickly learns that this town may not be abandoned.<br/><br/>For a movie based on a video game, this is good despite my objections to the story and pacing. I think Roger Ebert has a bit of a problem with movies based on video games, since he rated ""Doom"" (2005) and ""Resident Evil"" (2002) both with one star. I do tend to equate ""Silent Hill"" with those two films, in addition to ""Mortal Kombat"" (1995), the best video game adaptation, since they are all decent efforts.<br/><br/>But with ""Silent Hill,"" if you could stand those aforementioned efforts without gagging too much, then ""Silent Hill"" should grow on you, terrify you (somewhat), and make you edge and squirm in your seat. There's a strong visual sense going about and in remaining faithful to the overall tone of the games, there are some genuinely shocking and gruesome sights and very few cheap scares. And it might just become the second best video game adaptation that this viewer has seen. Having to go on Rybicki's review, I'd say that ""Silent Hill"" is probably the most faithful game-to-film adaptation ever made.<br/><br/>That's the ""Silent Hill"" treatment; just don't let the ""darkness"" get you.<br/><br/>8/10"

","If you can push out all those expectations before you buy your popcorn and don't focus on the breast shots of the female actresses, you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>Silent Hill's first few scenes had me cursing myself for giving it a chance, then it turned the tables and Christophe Gans skill really shined through. The special effects were done tastefully as you can with the gory background of what the silent hill video games are. The creature actors were absolutely amazing, giving me chills just to see them move. the movie was not at all a ""film"" or a fine piece of dramatic cinema, more so it was an extremely well made video game adaptation. All viewers will be entertained and Resident Evil/video game fans will be enraged that Gans didn't take the Resident Evil movie to where Silent Hill has gone.<br/><br/>Female actors were good at their scared/confused, ""not knowing what the &*#$ is going on"" rolls, but did poorly when deeper, more specific emotions where at play. The opposite was true for the male actors, when there where times the father (Sean Bean) was supposed to be confused or was supposed to hold continuity with his general character, he fell short, seeming inhuman. Not fitting what i would think a father would act like in that fictional situation, I should say. But in specific scenes, portraying specific emotions, he was extremely convincing. Take when Sean Bean was walking through the school with the cop (Kim Coates), ""She was here! --- I smell her cologne."" when the mother (Radha Mitchell) is right there crying in the darkness."
"nice-pics","7","2","4","24 April 2006"," So, let's see Gans' cut
","Silent Hill - both the film and the games - have atmosphere, creepy locations and characters suffering hellish torment. What the film lacks is running time. The tension and horror needs buildup, and that's why I'm looking forward to The Director's Cut DVD. Read on IGN about the original cut being some 3h+ (!) Just toss the the exposition scenes thus retaining the sensation of... a perfect mind f**k. The theatrical cut is a letdown. Perhaps Sony got scared and demanded a more coherent version for those who didn't grow up with Alien, The Excorcist and The Thing. I still have the original PlayStation game lying around. Funny to think the fog was added due to the technical limitations of the console but then ending up as one of the main purveyors of fear."
"warkiller2003","8","2","4","24 April 2006"," Good Movie
","Good movie to say the least. Played all the games and true to its nature, it is graphic and for the most part, you really don't know what to expect. Ending has a nice twist for those of you that have played it....Not what you would normally see :) If you haven't seen it yet, please go right now! Alls I gots to say is it does have content and a lot of it. People that haven't played the game may not pick up on the small things but the ones that have surely will...Caught myself smiling and shaking my head at parts of the movie cause they actually did pay attention to the small details.<br/><br/>...It is a slightly different story from the current Silent Hill line up but just like resident evil, you can't really have an exact take from a game cause, to quote director of resident evil, ""Why not just play the game again?"". This film will not disappoint...stop reading this and go watch it."

","I am one of the biggest silent hill fans I know of, only second to my best friend. I was anxious about this film. (Really anxious)I love these games so much and was prepared for a let down...I could not have been more wrong. This movie is the most perfect adaptations of a game I have ever seen. I was truly impressed. The atmosphere is haunting and even the town was constructed right out of the game!!! Silent Hill is 100% true to the franchise that I love in every respect. I cant say enough praises about this movie. I want to thank Gans for making something like this with the real fans opinions at heart. Thank you so much for having a passion about a project like this instead of just doing it for Hollywood sake."
"kratos_god_of_war08","8","2","4","24 April 2006"," Greatness
","This movie was so awesome. I love how they put together Pyramid Head. Freat story, great characters. A must watch for Silent Hill fans. Christophe Gans, rules. I hope to see a sequel for this title. Town is creepy, the monsters are disturbing, and the atmosphere is great for the setting. There were a few gaps. The story was slow at times, but a side from that Silent Hill, deserves to get its props. I did want to see Pyramid Head more, but maybe he will come back in the sequel. The ending was really good. This out did Resident Evil, and Alone in the Dark. They should have nothing to say about this movie. CHristophe is even a fan of the game. ALmost perfect movie."
"barrito444","5","2","4","24 April 2006"," Good intentions, questionable execution.
","I remember when I heard about Silent Hill being made into a movie and thinking, ""wow, what a great opportunity to make a video game movie that isn't a mindless action flick."" However, I also felt skeptical thinking, ""but it will probably miss the point of what makes Silent Hill great and use a prepackaged set of horror clichés to sell tickets."" Then came the teaser and following trailer for the film. My hopes sky rocketed seeing how well the settings and atmosphere was being portrayed. But when I finally saw the film, the more and more I think about it, the less I enjoyed the final product. What went wrong? Gans had it right converting the eeriness of the town and even kept some of the locals absolutely identical to their video game counterparts. What he didn't keep was the plot, and thats where the train wreck takes place. It turns out that the director still felt the itch to mess with Silent Hill's central story. I can understand the need with changing a script to do better in the film medium, but this change is so fundamental, that you can safely say that the game and the movie are completely different tales. On the technical side, the movie suffers from the fact that, despite being a full two hour movie, Silent Hill barely has any character development whatsoever. Dialogue is minimal and the quotes are pretty forgettable. Also, in spite of creating said changes to the plot, the movie is still stuck using video game logic to advance the story. In a game, its perfectly natural to impulsively pick up objects from strange places and make wild assumptions based on vague clues. In movie logic, this doesn't make as much sense, which throws off the films believability. Finally, the film misses out on a big factor of what makes Silent Hill unnerving. That is the overwhelming sense of loneliness and helplessness. This does not translate in the film. There are many secondary characters assisting the main protagonist and barely any time is spent in the Dark World, where most of the real horror takes place. The movie could have been great but because of odd writing decisions, an unfocused plot, meandering characters, a pointless side plot about a coal fire, and bad lines makes this an utterly average movie."
"afsan-1","7","2","4","24 April 2006"," Very Scary
","Loved this movie. Never played the video game but enjoyed the movie. Some of the scariest moments in a film I have seen in quite awhile. While I thought the movie could have been a bit shorter, and while parts of the movie did not always make sense to me (like the ending), I was hesitant to leave my seat for fear that I would miss something. I absolutely agree with another reviewer who said that using people as the creatures was a lot more frightening that using CGI. Some times the old way is the best way. I would love to see a sequel made from this film. I know that they are several video games in the series so there has to be more than enough material."
"tjewu","8","2","4","24 April 2006"," Best video game/movie adaptation yet.
","I went to see Silent Hill this weekend and obviously went in to the theater with a pre-conceived notion that it was going to suck because history has not been kind to video game movie adaptations. But the movie was pretty good for the most part and I was very happy that the director actually kept true to the theme of the game. The acting was not the greatest, but the setting and the atmosphere felt very much like Silent Hill the game. When the main character is running around looking for her daughter and all there is in front of her is fog was great and when she got to the end of the city and it was just a cliff that was awesome. The best part was how the director did the transition into the dark side and then used awkward camera angles to show disorientation and confusion...it was great. There was a decent amount of blood to the film as well, not overdone, but just enough to make it belong. Sure some of the dialogue was cheesy, but that was OK because it is still a horror movie in the end. Paul Anderson and Uwe Bol (well, Uwe bol should not be allowed to make movies period) should take notes from this director and learn how to make a good game adaptation into a movie. This director actually looks like he has played the game."

","warning, this contains spoilers... so.. read it if you dare.. o__O' It was so pensively deep in thought as well as mysterious with horrifying thrillers!! Ekk, it was at the same time... somewhat beautiful at the end.. and sad.. very depressing.. damn I wished that policewoman didn't died!!! I feel sorry for the husband.. @__@;; but then again, the story was very intense and I really liked it.. although I don't watch horror movies.. because I hate them ~__~;; but I watched this movie because my little cousin wanted to.. and i wanted to join along, but not because of the movie but because he's my friend, too.<br/><br/>The thing is that, I don't play the game, so I don't really know everything, but I understand the glimpse of the setting and the monsters.. yeah.. they're undead and weird and all that.. blah blah blah.. same old... scarily boring and all that-- so what? they are identical as the ones in the game, I've seen a few from what I saw when my cousin was playing... which was why i also liked it..<br/><br/>the director really followed the detail guidelines of silent hill, regardless which version... then again, they all look the same to me.. haha.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't that scary to me, but it was sure full of suspense, and thrillers, which was nice... because I don't want to not sleep at night XD .. unlike something like The Ring.. when the ring takes like 3 movies (or 4?) to cover the story while silent hill takes one and it was comprehensible and very good... the horrifying moments weren't supposedly to target at the audience but more to the actors which is what makes it more realism, but the thrillers had its purpose to scare the audience a couple of times... hehe..<br/><br/>in conclusion, I enjoyed it very much, my relatives were satisfied and they loved it... except we cried for the police woman ;o; ... she was such a nice person.. at first, I thought she was old.. because her voice sounded like an old woman. She was wearing a helm and shades which I could not distinguish her figures until that zombie attacked her with its acid spit, then she had to remove the helmet and she was very pretty with blonde hair..<br/><br/>the thing that caught my attention was that the movie consist more of women than men, finally some justice to this world of men! women needs to be recognized as equals and see fit in society and later on just see each other as the same... ! woot-- I don't know...<br/><br/>but if you like silent hill, and a very good story line... go watch it..<br/><br/>I was into the story rather than the monsters and the blood. I also thought that this had to do with a religious background.. because I was always seeing something in the movie that had to do with.. uh.. the bible or god, or something, because they kept showing small hints of these quotes from the bible, I'm not familiar with the bible because I'm not Christian.. or religious.. at the end, the religious cult were the evil ones who ruined silent hill and they brought themselves to damned!! good thing they all died-- muha hah ha except for the grandmother and the girl and the main char which is a good thing..<br/><br/>oh, here's a spoiler, if you don't understand what happened at the end, they're dead and live among the undead. That's why the husband don't see them but they're there but he feels their presence... Sharron is possessed by the demon and rose is just .. uh.. happy that she's home-- Here's what happened: rose (with the fogyish background) opened the door and walked inside... her husband (in the vivid of colours background) was on the couch and sleeping until he was awoke by their presence and saw the door opened but no one else... Sharron (with the fogyish background) walked to her room with an evil smirk...<br/><br/>there u go."

","This was the only video game adaption i was actually looking forward to watching on the big screen. Of all that came before it wherem to be honest, poor, albeit Super Mario bros, street fighter, and the god awful House of the dead. I have been a fan of the games since the first came out on play station, and absolutely loved the eerie atmosphere and cheap scares it delivered by the boat load. So as soon as i heard that this was to be the premise for a big budget movie i was both enthralled and worried, worried that they would make a mess of such a good basic idea. The idea of a parent and young daughter in a car, when suddenly they have a crash, parent wakes up to find the daughter missing so she looks for her around a deserted town, with scares a plenty. The movie writers decided to go too much in the same direction of the game, with the darkness taking over the world, little blobs moving and huge people with metal pyramids covering the heads whilst wielding huge, and i mean huge swords. This comes across a bit daft in films and reminded me a little of the hell-raiser films at one point. When you think about it, it doesn't make much sense at all, and going into the whole, good/bad soul of a young girl and making them alive just isn't comprehend able. Some of the dialogue and acting is horrible as well, just wait until Radha Mitchell finds her daughters pictures of burning buildings and witches in the backseat of her car and her daughter going ""it wasn't me, i don't like it mummy, i don't like it"" it went through me, horrible horrible acting. The ending is strange as well, and i believe i heard at least 10 people ask ""what the hell was going on"". The movie did have some good scenes though, for example the group of nurses who are drawn to the light is brilliantly set. The town of Silent Hill is spot on as well, it does look the part, and the buildings themselves have their own and great personality. The movie is quite entertaining but too me it was incredibly disappointing, if David Fincher made this i believe it would have been amazing. This movie will be a hit and adored with all male virgins though, so if it gets a high rating, the virgins have seen it and voted"

","The early reviews are already in, and it's absolutely no surprise that all these aging, mostly white, mostly male film ""critics"" are tearing into this movie for making no sense. I take their word on the film no more than I would take that of my parents. It isn't for them.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" is a horror movie, but not the kind most of us are used to; where the Big Scary Deformed Killer spends 90 minutes slashing up teens. If this film has any cinematic precursor (other than the games, which are very cinematic on their own), it would be ""The Exorcist"" ... where the film isn't a constant onslaught of fear or images, but has several valleys and peaks on its way to a climax that is more emotionally powerful than visually stunning (though I think SH might have done both... though the result is far, far less powerful than The Exorcist).<br/><br/>The audience isn't supposed to know what is happening any more than the characters do. The audience is not supposed to know what these things are, where they are, what they see. I was a bit annoyed that the two female leads (Rose and Cybil) didn't communicate more once they realized what they were facing, and more so that whatever terrifying image Rose would see, she would be completely emotionally recovered in the very next scene. There was zero growth to her character, which means she isn't the protagonist. Unless she = us, but that's if you're reaching.<br/><br/>Despite these trifles, and despite a staggeringly weak ending, the meat of the film is terrifying and creepier than any CGI-effect or masked killer. I haven't played the games, merely asked a lot of questions in the weeks before the films release-- and I still had no trouble understanding anything before me, or at least understanding it as well as the very confused lead characters.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" is a vision of Hell that is more real and compelling than anything I've ever seen... though admittedly, I'm not a 50-something fat white guy who writes movie reviews for a living. Thank God."
"sacredmonk","10","2","4","23 April 2006"," Best Movie PERIOD
","Okay, so some have said this is the best video game adaption made to date, but I'm going to go one step further, and say this is the best movie to date. The movie wasn't another pointless ""let's just shoot everything in sight throughout the whole movie"" type of thing. This actually had substance. In fact, the main character doesn't even wield a gun throughout the whole movie. If you're looking for an action, this might not be your movie. Perhaps you should try one of the other mindless movies. Silent Hill was a bit odd in some parts. There are about two scenes where it seems like something pointless is thrown into the movie. I mean they're like two second things and don't waste time, but still make you go.... okay....... The rest of the movie however is brilliant. It is shockingly eerie, and scary in a strange sort of way. It's not a jump horror film. There aren't creatures that just jump out at random times to scare you. Instead the movie is like a bad dream. The effects and visuals of the movie are so realistic you may have to remind yourself you are in a theater. I think there could have been a tad bit more monster appearances, but the ones they did throw in satisfied me equally. I now have a new favorite movie."

","Silent Hill is about a woman named Rose (Radha Mitchell) who loses her daughter in the deserted town of Silent Hill. Slowly as the movie progresses Rose learns the truth behind the town and the reason's for its nightmarish qualities.<br/><br/>First I will focus on the negative points of the film. The acting of some was sub-par and the script was terrible. Some of it made me cringe because of the absurdity of it. However, when pitted against the rest of the film these few flaws aren't really that big of a deal.<br/><br/>The film had quite a few redeeming qualities. The first half an hour or so blew me away. The visual imagery was stunning, the atmosphere was outstanding leaving me with an immense feeling of dread and hopelessness. The only thing that I would have preferred would be having more of this ""dark"" version of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Many critics criticize the story claiming that it is confusing and that they can't understand it. To me, that is one of the qualities that separates this film from many other cookie-cutter films that come out now-a-days. Rather than serving you the plot on a silver platter, Silent Hill gives you the clues and expects you to put it together. The story really isn't all that confusing if you pay attention.<br/><br/>The ending is another part of the movie that is heavily criticized as lacking closure and confusing. I must agree that the ending was vague, but I also believe that it was left vague intentionally. The ending, like much of the film, was left for the viewer to interpret. Many people are so used to films spoon-feeding you everything that they can't even begin to imagine having to use their imagination for once. And for those who claim that you need to play the game to understand the movie, that isn't necessarily true. In fact, in comparison the games are much harder to understand than the film.<br/><br/>The film is filled with many religions symbols and themes such as the holy trinity, light and dark, mother and child, and others that are easily overlooked by those who don't pay attention. The creatures themselves are symbolic to the feelings of Alessa.<br/><br/>The film is more disturbing than scary, and it moves at a slower pace than most films. Do not expect this film to feed you the plot, be prepared to think for yourself and piece the clues together. You are given the pieces, now all you have to do is finish the puzzle.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I saw this movie on it's opening night and I left the theatre very very pleased. I've been a fan of Silent Hill since it first came out on the PS back in 1999. When I heard that a movie was finally coming out I couldn't believe it, how could they turn such a horrifying game into a bad movie? there was no possible way and yes I was right, they didn't turn it into a bad movie. Everything in the movie ties in so well with the contents of the game. The atmosphere was very claustrophobic which everyone likes cause it makes it so much more intense. The monsters were well done, most of them actually done by real people dressed in costumes and make-up. The story can get a little confusing (more understanding for people who have played the game) so it's something you really have to pay attention to and when you do get it, you like it and when you like it, you like it a lot. Silent Hill is one of those films where you can't take your eyes off of the screen, you want to know what's going to happen next and you're anxiously waiting for that scare that you want and it delivers it damn good. This film is a must see for fans of the game and or fans of a good horror movie done with amazing CGI, a powerful and emotional story, and anyone who enjoys one hell of a scare."
"lunalelle","7","2","4","23 April 2006"," An excellent transition to a horror film
","****SPOILERS**** Upon hearing that Silent Hill was a movie from a video game, I was a bit nervous, particularly because I was coming to it with high hopes - I wouldn't go to the opening afternoon of a horror film unless I had high hopes.<br/><br/>However, I walked away quite pleased with the outcome - if I hadn't known that this was a video game, I would have never guessed, although I noticed a few video game elements while watching, such as the burning babies at the beginning and the running through the halls.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell and Laurie Holden did excellently - their terror never reached a shrill pitch that some screaming horror films can become. Under the circumstances, they remained remarkably held together with appropriate moments of just giving into emotions that were never unbelievable. Jodelle Ferland was surprising good - I can only imagine what it takes for a girl her age to be a demon. I was worried that Sean Bean's character would be lost, but they integrated him very well, and I didn't feel like he was extraneous to the plot.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics as well as the actors who played most of the creepy people - I was tense the whole way through. It engages me and terrified me without sending me under my seat, and although it played on music sometimes, I never felt it was only the music that made it frightening. There were a few questionable additions to the film that never were explained to my satisfaction, such as the origin of the executioner creature and the bugs. The rest, such as the fire alarm, the burning babies (I loved the inclusion of ""Ring of Fire"" following that...), the walking creature on the street, the nurses, and the burned Alessa all were suitably creepy and pertinent. The barbed wire bit at the end was easily the most gory scene I've ever watched and was really the only part that made me cringe, but somehow, it seemed... right.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is just me, but the ending did not give me a sense of closure. For me, closure does not have to be a period. However, I feel unsatisfied when it's a question mark. I don't understand how the end happens, not even a suggestion of it. So... maybe when the DVD comes out, the ending will make more sense."

","Having enjoyed the Silent Hill games, I didn't know what to expect from this film. After seeing it, I'm happy to say that director Gans hit everything perfectly. The visuals are astonishing--even the critics who hate it agree there. But beyond that lies a plot so deep that a lot of people won't get it. And I think that's fine. I'm glad Gans decided not to dumb down the story for the wider film-going audience. It retains the depth of character and plot that the games are known for and couples it with acting that is, at its worst, still good; a chilling musical score lifted straight from the games; and visuals that rival even mega-budget films. Silent Hill is a must-see. Give it a shot. Don't expect to ""get it"" right away. Just enjoy the ride."
"destroyerwod","9","2","4","23 April 2006"," Cooler Game to movie ever !!!
","To start, lets say I'm not a big fan of the game, played an hour of SH1, played around 4-5 hour of SH2, i really liked the atmosphere and the town etc, but I'm not very patient in video game, not a fan of infiltration or save ammo, in silent hill most of the time you had to watch carefully your ammo and finish monster with the pipe, plus i founded the story in the 2 kinda boring, it did not took place for what i tought, played 6 hour and the guy was still searching for his wife but no story development etc, it kinda bored me. The 1 i simply stopped cause the graphic aspect annoyed me considering its on the old playstation 1 and i tried to play it after the PS2 was released.<br/><br/>This said i still liked the atmosphere and all, and when the movie start i was happy to see it was the same beginning(with the jeep) , the first scene of the first silent hill redone very well and very scary. Sure they changed the name of Cherril for Sharon but well...Harry was changed for that women(who look a lot like Heather of the 3) but in a way it was better i supposed considering the whole mother-child relation of the movie plus a man helped by a women cops...would have be weird in a movie.<br/><br/>Anyway to return to the movie, i found it very scary, i was very nervous every time the horns was heard, the nightmare world was amazing, so scary and disturbing, and the pyramid head was one very cool monster, it was just too bad he was not more present and that he kinda disappear after a part of the movie. Would have like a lot to see him more.<br/><br/>So overall i think even if the story is different from the game on some point, the way they kept monsters, places(school for example) , some scenes, that was really a great movie, and the closest adaptation of a game i saw. And also a very scary movie, i did not saw a scary movie like that in a long time."

","Mind you, I will make my spoilers very mild, but I do want you to be aware that this will have some spoiler elements.<br/><br/>First, I will point out that I had played the games previously, but my boyfriend had no previous exposure, so I am putting both of our opinions here. And we both agree that this is the best video game adaptation either of us has seen.<br/><br/>Now aside from that, it is still a very good movie. It was at times, beautiful, imaginative and horrifying. Very, very horrifying. I do not recommend taking anyone younger than 17 to see this movie. Apart from being the best video game adaptation, it is also the goriest movie I have seen in ages. I really can't think of anything to compare. There is also a character in this that ""dies"" twice. I can't think of any other way to put it, but it was one of the movie's few really cheap shots.<br/><br/>And when I say beautiful, I mean it. Some of the work done with their cinematography is completely unlike anything I have seen before, and it blew me away. The sets are fantastic, and the creatures, though horrific, are stunning in their own way. The sound is nothing short of amazing, and if this film could be considered for an Oscar for sound editing, it stands a heck of a good chance of winning.<br/><br/>The dialogue does fall short at times, but there are very few movies that don't have moments of bad dialogue, for the most part, the visuals take over, and any moment that Alice Krige is on the screen, the words flow as naturally as you would expect from a Shakespearean play. This is not to say the other actors are bad either. They all have their strong and weak lines, and I believe at least the male detective(cop?) was written and acted to sound like a character in a video game. I found it to be a nice touch.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie an 8 out of 10. It certainly does not deserve any Oscars beyond the Visual and Aural qualities, but it is a great deal of fun, particularly if you were a fan of the game. Many elements were changed towards the end of the film, and a few surprises are thrown in from the later games in the series. But at times, it echoed the game shot for shot, something I never thought a film maker would be brave enough to do. If you love the game, you may well find yourself gasping with glee as some of the game's visuals are brought to the big screen.<br/><br/>So if you don't like it, I'm sorry, but I thought it was well worth the price of admission, and highly suggest anyone who likes really, really horrifying movies give this one a look see. And be prepared to want to take a shower when it's all over."
"thirtysecondstomars2005","10","2","4","23 April 2006"," The best Video-Game to Movie Adaptation!
","I went opening night expecting to see a grotesque movie, with dismembered body parts laying everywhere, since this is what the majority of the game is, with the exception that there is monsters that try to disturb you out of your mind. When i got to the movie i was so amped for the movie to begin. When it started it was exactly like the first game... car crash the the main character emerges in the shrewed city covered in fog, Silent Hill. When the siren went off it was definitely the real beginning. The special effects were probably the best effects in any other video-game to movie adaptation. And it wasn't all CGI effects, as many were saying. It was real actors plastered in makeup. The make-up I might add was amazing, the Pryamid Head was by far one of the most sinister in the movie. The blood was almost everywhere, especially in when the ""Darkness"" came, just like the game. The storyline had a few holes but none that made the movie hard to follow. And the ending was completely and utterly fascinating. This movie wasn't about the monsters jumping out at you, no instead you basically seen them or heard them sliding around somewhere outside the doors. Overall this movie was all about the disturbing images, not about the blood and guts as I wanted to see, but overall was very pleasing to see Silent Hill in the big screen. Even the distorting camera angles and lighting were in the movie.. Even when the actors, well actresses, were holding just a flashlight or lighter it still gave the effect that they were alone when they were not. The acting was great, even though most of the actresses only had a few lines like.. ""OMG"" ""WTF"" and the famous.. ""Don't worry... momma coming!"" and ""To get you daughter back, you most face the Darkness of hell"" or something like that. If you liked the games, you will enjoy this movie more then the average movie goer, since u know what to expect. This movie makes you think and the ending is a cliff hanger... (I wonder what they will do for the second?)"
"sonofatari","9","2","4","23 April 2006"," Great film, I wish there were more horror movies like this (and games for that matter.)
","I went into the movie as a pretty big fan of the games. I never actually beat the first one (which the movie is mostly based off of, but changed in some areas) but I have actually played all 4 and beat 2 and 3.I read a plot summary of the fist game before I went so I could understand it a bit more, and I'm glad I did. The stories in the Silent Hill games where always a bit confusing to me and it took me playing through multiple times and researching on the internet to figure out some things. The movie actually explains what's going on better than any of the games did, but I'm sure many people who have not played them will still be pretty confused. I did understand the plot pretty well, but just because I read the summary of the game a few hours before I went to see it.<br/><br/>The town was recreated perfectly, as were the monsters. I wasn't that scared of it (I hardly ever am when I'm watching horror films) but there were a few times when I was a bit on edge. I think the game was a lot more terrifying because you were controlling the character, and not just watching him/her. I think that most people will find it genuinely terrifying though, it's a really refreshing take on the genre, relying a lot on atmosphere and not so much on the jump out of your seat type scares. Visually the movie is quite impressive.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the games is the music and sound. The music/sound is designed by Akira Yamaoaka, who also had a pretty big role in the making of the film, so he was sure to integrate it perfectly into the movie. Music from all the games was taken and even remade to make it sound even better. I noticed added instruments and better EQing. This is one of the strongest points of the whole series in my opinion.<br/><br/>The director's aim was probably to cater more to the fans while keeping people who haven't played it still in mind. If you are a fan you need to go see it, I guarantee you there will be places that you will smile and think ""I remember that."" This doesn't mean it's not a good movie to anyone who hasn't played the games though; I just believe the fans will appreciate it even more. There are a few things to nitpick that I didn't think were perfect, but there always are.<br/><br/>Great film, I'd recommend it."
"huxleyhobbes","8","2","4","23 April 2006"," Pretty decent piece of film.
","Having been a rather hardcore gamer for most of my life, I have been rather disappointed by most of the movies based on games we've got so far. Though Super Mario Bros. has a certain charm. Anyway, along comes Uwe Boll and makes things even worse than they already were, and pretty much destroys any chance they have of being taken seriously - when Resident Evil is the best you have, it's a pretty sorry state of affairs. I've not seen DooM, I should note.<br/><br/>And then along comes Silent Hill. And, by some strange contrivance of the universe, it's actually a rather good film. The problem is, however, that there are certain points where things could have been done much better, and because we are being served a very nice dish of movie-based-on-game, it's rather saddening to have to endure those missed opportunities.<br/><br/>I felt the first half to be the strongest - that was when the mystery and confusion existed, and the unknown is always scariest. Once things ramp up, whilst it is well executed, it becomes less and less scary. The major problem I had was with the denouement, which I liked in narrative terms, but which I thought was poorly told.<br/><br/>Special mention should go to the special effects department, which I hear tell was mostly the work of prosthetics and makeup, with remarkably little CGI involved. They have created an incredibly good-looking world (Well, as good as Hell can look.) and they deserve a great deal of credit.<br/><br/>I don't know if I voted correctly in giving it an 8. I think a 7 might be more appropriate. But I can see a genuine effort to make a good film here and in large part it succeeds. I didn't have the heart to vote lower, to be honest. I recommend the movie to fans of the game (Most accounts from real fans, rather than people who've casually played like me, indicate a great deal of enjoyment.) and to ordinary folks who want a pretty good, fun movie."
"housethepain","10","2","4","23 April 2006"," Creepy works
","This is one of the creepiest movies to date. If people are hung up on the game to movie adaptation they would first need to understand how hard it would be to do this film. The camera angles and the scene matched the entire beginning scene. When she sees the corpse on the chains to the little monsters attacking her before she wakes up in the city. If this movie followed the video game to a ""T"" it wouldn't have been good; we all know the dialogue in the original video game sucks (i.e. ""Radio? What going on with that radio....I'll go see what's wrong with that radio, hmmmm"" HAHAHAHA) This movie may have been a little long towards the end, but it didn't lose its creepiness at all. It is too difficult to scare people these days because we've seen it all already, but can we at least agree that if we were in Rose's shoes we would have been flippin out when the janitor crawled out of the stall all gored-up and looking for meat? Lighten up and enjoy the movie for what it is worth. I heard someone agree that people sound lame when they assume the director and producers of a film didn't accomplish what they were intending...How dumb does that sound? Anyway, check out HIGH TENSION sometime, I thought that was creepy too...I guess you just have to have more of a cathartic experience and less of a critical one to enjoy a movie like Silent Hill. I just want you negative pundits to think about being in the midst of 30 dead zombie nurses with knives looking to kill SOMETHING, and tell me you are NOT creeped out."
"jamiehavill","6","2","4","23 April 2006"," Visually stunning in every way. Technically average...
","I have just been to see this film with a group of friends. It's worth noting that I'm an nineteen year-old male, I've experienced (to some extent) the 'Silent Hill' trilogy of games.<br/><br/>Firstly, I need to say this - ""Silent Hill' is GRAPHIC. There are four or five memorable scenes that will stay with you for some time. The nature of these scenes means that the graphic violence is to some extent necessary, but man! This happens to be the most graphically violent film I have ever seen. With some extremely disturbing and hard hitting scenes.<br/><br/>Moving on, the screenplay is average. The acting is sub-par, (except a stunning performance from Jodelle Ferland), the camera-work is nothing worth talking about. The story is extremely slow and never really gathers momentum, it's almost a struggle to piece it together. <br/><br/>I noticed that during the first 10 minutes of footage in and around the town of 'Silent Hill' you can see how Christophe Gans aimed to film using an overhead third person view of the protagonists. It's very well executed and gives a real feel of the games. It would of been interesting to see more of the film in this way.<br/><br/>Now for the strong points. The visuals of this film are incredible; Graphics that I never thought possible, and have never witnessed. Never in my life have I witnessed such stunning computer generated special effects. A scene I noted in a bathroom when the walls began to peel - it looked simply stunning and so, so real.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the most intense films I have ever seen. The character design is a thing of beauty. From the enemies, down to the what we could call the ""goodies"", all costume and set design was thought about in great detail, and it pays off very well. To tie in with this the musical score and sound effects are PERFECT.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend you see this film at the cinema. It is not for playback at home. As I say I highly enjoyed watching this at my local cinema, just be prepared for an uncomfortable ride."
"yashiki","Null","2","4","23 April 2006"," People like this? Are we all talking about the same movie here?
","I'm mystified....totally mystified that anybody could possibly get into this story. Terribly acted and written from start to finish, to the point that I actually wanted to cover my eyes and ears not out of fear but out of embarrassment for the actors. I kept thinking ""that person is the worst actor in the movie"" only to have someone else show up and be even worse - really, this is the most massive, across-the-board display of awful acting you're likely to find outside of a porn video.<br/><br/>Yes, I've played the games, and yes, they were really scary, but the movie only recreates that feeling briefly at one or two moments. The rest of the time it's far too tedious and awkward to be remotely exciting or even interesting - I couldn't lose myself in the story enough to be scared, and I tried, I really did. The makers of the game understood what makes a situation scary, but the movie never quite grasps it. It's 2 hours that feel like at least two and a half. The scenes with Sean Bean (who looks like he really misses Middle-Earth, where his acting style made sense) feel as tacked-on as they apparently were. And don't even get me started on the whole ""Did you follow all my clues?"" exposition sequence - the worst narration I've ever heard in my life. Wow. Just...wow.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and I've seen ""Master of Disguise."" (No, I don't remember why. Maybe someone dared me to.) Maybe the target audience is so used to the bad voice-over acting in the game (""Radio...what's going on with that radio?"") that the characters' reactions in the movie actually seem believable by comparison - except they don't, even by that standard; they're that bad. I love video games as much as the next person, but if their net effect on American culture is an increased tolerance for steaming piles like this one, maybe they are bad for you after all.<br/><br/>p.s. What's with that random shot of the bushes outside Sean Bean's front door? Is there some ""symbolism"" I missed? Is it maybe an acknowledgment that watching plants grow is about as entertaining as everything else we've just seen? Just a theory."

Just a bunch of zombies or demons or crazy people out to kill. This movie is how horror films should be like. It brought in a great story and an amazing look. The CG and live action mesh was perfect. I have never seen another movie nail it so well. The graphics did not look fake or computer generated. It looked like it was actually happening.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the silent hill games you will not be disappointed after watching the movie. They twisted the story line around but nothing to big. It still kept the same feel as from the games.<br/><br/>Even if you are not a fan of the Silent Hill games or not even a fan of playing video games you would like this movie. It has a great story line and relatable characters. So if you enjoy horror movies this is movie is one to check out."
"Gawl2007","10","2","4","22 April 2006"," Gans and Avery understand Silent Hill.
","I just have to say that I was extremely impressed with this movie. Not only did the look and feel of the film do the games justice, but the themes of what the town stands for and the ideas behind the tragic tales of those who are drawn to Silent Hill remain so accurate. What most people don't realize is that Silent Hill is the physical manifestation of a persons punishment for their sins. Everyone that is called to Silent Hill has ghosts in their closets and the movie is no different. Hats off to Gans and Avery for really ""getting"" their source material and not flinching from it no matter how many people would just refuse to look beyond the surface. Implied meaning has lost so much impact lately and audiences have requested all the information up front or they won't pay attention. Make someone question the nature of something and its deeper meaning and your almost certain to drive them off. Way to stick to your guns guys. I highly recommend Silent Hill to any abstract thinker that is willing to look beyond the words and really dive into the meaning of what it really is to be in your own living hell, and to really question what we think is right, or wrong.<br/><br/>Mike"
"athosey","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," Best they could have done.
","I think that Silent Hill is the best movie that they could have made out of the video game. Video games and movie are two different media's so it's impossible to make a movie that is just as great as the video game but this movie does the best anyone could. The themes, the tone, the look of the movie are all similar to the game.(The Production design is amazing, and all the music is straight from the games too.) It's a disturbing movie that explores what is really scary, what we fear, and that is what made the game so great. The movie kinda went over board with the gore but I can see that is serves a purpose. The film is disturbing and the ending makes you think, just like the game. The movie is like watching a nightmare, as the game was playing one."
"aljosco","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Faithful interpretation
","Watching this movie I could only think one thing: I told you so! Since I first played the second game (never played the original) I've always said Silent Hill had the production values to make a good movie. I mean think about, how many other video game movies have had great set decoration, decent acting (I point my finger at you, Resident Evil), and a good plot all in a game. Yes the games never had the best game play, but that doesn't translate onto the screen. <br/><br/>So, back to the movie. The is a faithful interpretation of the games. I say 'interpretation' because its still the same plot but the characters have been switched around. Harry Mason is now Rose De Sylva and Cheryl is now Sharon De Sylva. Pyramid head is in it (great addition by the way) and some locations don't look the same. Outside of these, almost everything else the unaltered.<br/><br/>The style of the movie is a delight. The cinematography is calm and schizophrenic when it needs to be. While CGI is used for the mist and decaying interiors, creatures people in latex outfits, with some of them being CG edited. The acting is good, the action is suspenseful, and they're are parts of honest creepiness, thanks to the great sound effects. While it can get boring in some parts, the movie makes up for with great scenes of Pyramid Head and intense encounters with other creatures.<br/><br/>All in all, fans of the series should like this, non-gamers will, and maybe some die-hards. Happy viewings."
"chris_gally","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," Very faithful and yet original interpretation of the source material, but not perfect
","I came in Silent Hill expecting the worst, simply another bad film based on a video game. Instead, I loved the experience throughout, though looking back, the film is actually quite mixed. It has many upsides and some disappointing downsides.<br/><br/>First off, what is Silent Hill about? The Silent Hill games are known for their unique brand of fear. They take you, the player, and put you in the role of a perfectly ordinary human being caught up in a nightmare, as opposed to some bland superhero. Having very little ammunition to deal with a supply of twisted, warped monsters, you have to think as to whether you want to fight, or just make a run for it. Things get worse during the moments when the entire town changes, converting from a foggy, mostly deserted town, into a surrealist nightmare of stylized decay.<br/><br/>The movie remains largely true to this idea. Rose, the heroine, is an ordinary mother who isn't sure of how to deal with her adopted child's sleepwalking and obsession of a certain town, a town by the name of Silent Hill. She decides the best way to deal with this problem is to do some hands-on investigating of Silent Hill itself, and quickly ends up wishing she hadn't after her child goes missing.<br/><br/>Rose is not an action heroine. She spends more time using her wits to survive rather than any weapons; in fact, she uses less weapons than any of the Silent Hill game heroes ever had. This was a great touch, and helped to preserve the Silent Hill concept, rather turn the movie into a generic action flick.<br/><br/>The town itself does indeed change from ""foggy"" to the nightmare rendition. Unfortunately, I felt that the nightmare moments were fewer and shorter than in the games, and that more time could have been spent in them. In the games, it was often a relief when the world changed back from ""nightmare"" to ""normal"". In the movie, it doesn't stay ""nightmare"" long enough for the relief to set in, thus hurting the atmosphere and mood.<br/><br/>But the basic and most important features that make Silent Hill what it is are there. The theme of the game series has been transferred brilliantly. So what of the movie itself? The pacing starts out great. Much like the games, the very first scene doesn't waste time in letting us know we're in for a heck of a ride. The mood quickly becomes subdued and more traditionally expository immediately afterward, and then the plot beings to progress in a more traditional fashion. Pacing is excellent throughout most of the film, except during around the final 1/3 or 1/4. Around there, it seems as if too much may have been crammed into too little a time period, and the plot reaches the climax rather quickly. I enjoyed the climax itself and how it played out, but the film was beginning to show signs of rushing through the story, which was the exact same problem I had with certain other major films (namely, Narnia and the first Harry Potter film).<br/><br/>Sadly, there are moments in the film that seem to be aimed directly at the games' fans, without having any real importance to the film itself. Music from the games is sprinkled liberally throughout the soundtrack, even being used in a few early parts that I felt would have worked better without music. The popular monster Red Pyramid (known also as Pyramid Head) makes appearances, but feels tacked on, put there for the sake of being there.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is somewhat ambiguous, but not necessarily happy. The Silent Hill games had multiple endings which could be acquired by making certain choices in the gameplay, so it was possible to achieve an unhappy or scary ending as well as a happy one. Well, this movie gives us an ending that is closer in line with the negative endings seen in the games. Some may see it as a good thing, others a bad thing, while I personally have mixed feelings on it.<br/><br/>But all in all, I greatly enjoyed the movie. I enjoyed the plot, the presentation and style, most of the pacing, and of course, seeing the town of Silent Hill realized in film. I admit that I saw it from the perspective of one who has played the games, but then again, I saw it with my father, a non-gamer who also enjoyed the experience. Silent Hill is not a traditional film. It's not a traditional story even by movie-making standards, just like the game series is not traditional by video game standards. If you have never played the Silent Hill games before, I invite you to see this film. Please keep an open mind, and you may end up enjoying it like I and my father did."
"stupidcausescancer","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Interesting experience
","To be honest, this film did not reach my expectations, but I believe that had much more to do with my theater surroundings than it did with the film itself. People talking throughout the movie, the sound seeming not loud enough for even an action film (I had went to see the Benchwarmers a a week or two before and did not have this problem, which makes me believe some people complained about the volume level of the movie), let alone to engage you as a intense experience.<br/><br/>That said, when these nuances were not ruining my theater going experience, Silent Hill became a very engaging film. Perhaps the last half hour seemed to really chug ahead as even the theater problems could not keep me from really getting into the movie.<br/><br/>Having not played the games, the movie itself came off as a very different experience. It isn't the typical horror movie...it really does not fit into any genre, it is just a very off kelter experience that takes some guts. Some might not like the ending, and some might say they do not understand the movie, but the movie is extremely straight forward and actually has a pretty interesting ending sequence that I would give more credence to than if it would have been given a nice little ribbon.<br/><br/>The visuals were amazing."
"himdol666","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Good movie
","This movie wasn't THE BEST of the best, but it was good. I was quite satisfied with it. It left me with a few questions & a few confusions but upon relfextion,the answers dawn quite easily. I found the creatures in it a little pointless but,hey,this is a ""horror"" movie. Horror movie is a bad term...it's more of a Sci-Fi Thriller.& for all those who wonder,sci-fi doesn't always equal deep-space adventures. But this movie is not HORROR. Anyways, well I say it was good & worth seeing. I might go see it again,or rent it to get a few things straight, because I missed the first 5-10 minutes of it. Anyways,that's all I have to say.

"andell","4","2","4","22 April 2006"," Looks Great, but Less Filling!!!
","""Silent Hill"" reminds me an awful lot of ""Underworld,"" but with much less fun, and much more blood and gore. Strange that, even when compared to a film which chronicles the BLOOD feud between Lycantropes and Vampires, this atmospheric shocker should still manage to saturate its audience in buckets of gore.<br/><br/>The story, at its base, is about an adopted girl with a troubled past whose Mother decides, over her husband's objections, to take her back to Silent Hill, West Virginia. Along the way, her trip is interrupted by, amongst other things, her husbands phone calls, his decision to freeze her credit cards, and a police officer who is strangely tipped on to the idea that something isn't right when she sees the little girl ask her mother in an upset voice who drew the pictures that are in her sketch book.<br/><br/>Rose decides to bolt it when she is stopped by the officer, and would have kept on going had it not been for what appeared to be another little girl who looked exactly the same who she thinks she may have pasted all over the road. Apparently in the spirit of helping your child, it may be necessary to sacrifice another.<br/><br/>Once in Silent Hill Rose, her daughter Sharon, and the police officer all become stuck in what is allegedly another dimension, filled with giant and ravenous cockroaches, strange creatures of other shapes and abilities, and a group of old Silent Hill residents who apparently are trapped and damned in the dimension.<br/><br/>Some critics have noted that, in spite of the very impressive visuals, Silent Hill does play out like a video game- and they are precisely right. Rose, the officer, and a myriad of others who occasionally tag along are led from room to room, as though they are collecting keys, clues or whatever one might collect when playing the Silent Hill video game- at one point, you half expect to see a couple of icons on the screen indicating how many lives each character has left before they die.<br/><br/>Of course, all of it is a moot point. Silent Hill's trailer, which was played ad nausea in practically every movie I've seen for the past five months, happily doesn't give so much away in terms of the surprises of the characters that are about to come, however the shock factor tends to diminish when it becomes clearer that with each character and each killing the director is merely trying to push the envelope further.<br/><br/>As for the ending, and the ultimate assignment of ""right"" and ""wrong"" which should accompany any self-redeeming horror film, it is so badly handled and so unclear to the viewer (save perhaps for those who have played the game and live for it) that one hardly knows if Rose and Sharon were lucky victims who escaped the horror, or a villainous pair who aided in the murder of the remaining citizens of Silent Hill. After all, they did take the word and opinion of the little girl who was behind all of these creatures. And yeah, she seemed nice enough when she was talking to Rose.<br/><br/>Then again, she does seem to enjoy ripping apart person after person in the gory finale with barbed wire, and she hardly rewards Rose for her love for Sharon...if indeed you can consider Sharon anything but a ghost herself! So to sum it all up, if you see the movie, you'll see a lot of very disturbing and haunting images, and some rather unique characters- however limit your interest to just these areas. Looking for anything beyond these is a fruitless effort!"
"captain_mycaptain","10","2","4","22 April 2006"," Finally, a credible video game adaptation.
","From the moment the lights went down in the cinema, and the now infamous Silent Hill 1 theme song started to play, until the end credits, augmented by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn's fine vocals, this move oozed class.<br/><br/>Based on the survival horror series of the same name, the movie draws elements primarily from the first three games, rather sensibly leaving out the slightly disastrous Silent Hill 4. The majority of the plot comes from the first game, and is faithful enough to said game to avoid offending fans, while prudently altering the elements which would not have translated well to the big screen.<br/><br/>The characters and monsters comprise a mix of canon and original, and the original characters fit seamlessly into the Silent Hill universe. Rose De Sylva, a likable woman looking for her lost daughter, is both convincing and sympathetic, and Cybil Bennet, a cop who also appears in the first game, is possibly one of the best examples of a strong female in Hollywood. Rose's husband, Chris, does an excellent supporting job as the worried husband. But the film is really stolen by Sharon, Chris and Rose's adopted daughter, whose pivotal role does an excellent job of holding the plot together.<br/><br/>The scares and gore are there, but much like the games, they are tastefully done, with more emphasis on the psychological, than the outright shocking. There are more than a few moments which will get even hardened horror fans wincing, and definitely more than a few jumps and scares, but the real fear from this film comes from the beautifully sinister plot, which will leave you feeling vaguely uncomfortable long after you have left the cinema.<br/><br/>The movie is packed full of little nods and winks to the games which will no doubt utterly delight fans of the series, but remains a self contained story within itself, which is beautifully told, with all the loose ends tied up nicely. The film makers had the right idea in working so closely with Konami, as the balance between making a faithful adaptation, and making an exciting movie has been perfectly struck, something which is exceptionally rare, if not unprecedented, in the games-to-movies area of the market.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, the movie, is absolutely one of the best intelligent horror films of the year, if not the decade. It is cinematically beautiful, with a gorgeous soundtrack, perfectly implemented special effects, a heartbreakingly beautiful soundtrack, razor sharp dialogue, and a plot which, unlike so many fright-fests, gets inside your head and makes you really think. It is destined to achieve cult status.<br/><br/>This is not just highly recommended. This is mandatory for any horror or video game fan alike."
"ktr8rmv814","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," What a....
","Great movie. I mean this is just such a great movie. Wow. One thing I have to say is that the trailer deceives a little bit. There was this one couple after the movie that said this was ""horrible, nothing like the trailer."" That's not true, it's twisted, sick, and horrifying. The trailer doesn't show that there are other people living in the town and that they are an essential part of the plot and movie. The movie has great sounds, great special effects. It's twisted... and although throughout the movie there isn't much gore...during the climax of the movie, there so much, almost too much, not Hostel type gore, but the gore that tends to build up tension. The pyramid is really cool to see in this movie. There were a lot of people that didn't get the movie, I did, even though a briefly played it. Just pay attention, especially during the flashbacks because the story unravels pretty fast. The action is great and the movie is filled with atmosphere. I do have to say though, the dialog did get a little thin in some places when Rose said it was going to be OK but there were all these horrible things going on right in front of her and her daughter. I found that was kind of funny. The acting was surprisingly good. The actors help built up tension. The movie also established a great sense of claustrophobia. The ending is quite a surprise if you aren't familiar with the game, which I'm Not. *Spoilers* Some people as well as me, did not get the ending. They manage to get away from the evils of silent hill (Rose and Sharon) and once they are out everything's still foggy. They get to their house and it's all drenched in fog. Then it flashes to her husband and it's all bright. They still weren't in their ""reality"", they were still in the silent hill world. The husband felt her presence and looked to where Sharon was sitting in her world. He felt her there, but he couldn't see, her went to close the door because it had been opened by the ""wind"". Then the shot is outside the house and some sad music plays. Kind of Depressing. All in all this was a terrific movie. I highly recommend it and can't wait for a sequel."

It looks great and creeps along to jumpy climaxes (much like the game) in a set I found to be very reminiscent of that seen in the game.<br/><br/>I found it interesting that all the major characters that are actually in the soup are women. Rose, Sharon, Cybil, Dahlia, Anna and ChristaBella(?), an over-the-top religious cult-leader zealot. Sean Bean's character is really peripheral and has nothing to do with the action."
"jase2002","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," An original thrill-ride thats not without its flaws.
","Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of the games,dig the atmosphere and cower away at the scares.So I'm going to be a little biased when i say that overall,i had a real good time watching this.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Rose (mitchell), Chris (bean) and troubled,sleep-walking sprog,Sharon (ferland). Before i had settled in with popcorn in hand,Rose has whisked her child away to the deserted,mist-filled ghost town of silent hill in the hope of finding some kind of cure for Sharons' deteriorating mental condition.<br/><br/>In no time at all,we're treated to the joys of this forbidden place,and believe me,we are plunged in to this place with a number of goodies thrown our way that will make avid fans drool with ever-growing anticipation.We get the ""snowing-ash"",the mist,music and even sound effects taken directly from the games.Its hellishly gorgeous.<br/><br/>Apart from the main character being female,the first few scenes within silent hill are a carbon copy of the first game.I have to say I've never been more gripped or stunned with the terrifying notion that things are going to become very,very nasty.i mean,as a gamer,seeing all the events unfold on the big screen after years of playing these games,is like reliving my worst nightmare.Its a real feast for the eyes.A siren sounds,and the world is plunged into darkness as it takes hold of everything,including the audience,with it.<br/><br/>As Rose quickly realises that this is no ordinary place,we join her (along with cop-in-pursuit, Cybil (holden)) in a cat-and-mouse chase for her little girl around the town.Scenes travel at break-neck speed as we're quickly swept up in the mystery surrounding the child and how the town came to be.<br/><br/>And that brings me to its flaws.And it has a few,to say the least. First off;the major thing is, to the ordinary cinema-going public,this will confuse the hell out of you.Even fans of the game will find it difficult at times to keep up with the plot as its tossed around in every direction imaginable.It really does go pair-shaped when they begin to explain things.I was thinking, ""Just get on with it!"" many times.<br/><br/>About half-way through the film,scenes start to drag,characters begin to have longer and more pointless conversations,which kind of makes it feel ""top heavy"".This becomes even more apparent when we reach the climax,which when compared to the first hour or so, really does seem over a little too quickly.Not to say that its without its merits,i was just left wanting more. Bear in mind that the running time is a shade over two hours,which is a little more than your average horror film.<br/><br/>Possibly the worst part for me was the acting and (forgive me) Roger Averys' script.It stank most of the time. i guess,from Mr.Avery, i was expecting the pulp fiction of horror films. The characters say the most embarrassing things at the most inappropriate times,and it really does smash the effect of a real intense scene sometimes. There are some incredibly hilarious characters in this.Alessa is directly out of Silent hill:The stage show, Claudia is almost humorous as she creeps hunchback-style around the town, Dahlia and her fellow worshippers often look like they're in the wrong place most of the time and some of the extras really did steal a couple of scenes by standing in the background swaying or grimacing away like they cant believe they're in a feature-film.<br/><br/>Rose and Cybill were pretty much up to standard with the script they had to deal with,Sharon is just about creepy enough and as for hubby Chris,well,sorry Sean,but you just as well have stayed out of this one.<br/><br/>But for all its flaws,the flick just had this other-worldly,epic feel that raised it above your normal horror film.Its original,damn creepy,looks AND sounds absolutely amazing and has plenty of gore, action and suspense to keep it afloat. Ill be interested to see what they do with the sequel...<br/><br/>7/10"
"ZanarkandBlitz7","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Slightly disappointing yet strangely satisfying.
","For me the film didn't quite live up to my expectations, however I agree with a previous poster that people should see it more than once. You notice things that you didn't before and the film ultimately makes more sense. I enjoyed it more the second time. <br/><br/>I have a few gripes about this film. The acting and diolague made me cringe at certain points just because of sheer stupidity and predictability. We didn't see enough of the creatures and the dark world. Sean Beans scenes were not necessary, it only made the film drag on. The funny thing about those senes is that they were added into the script because the studios wanted male characters. For me I think the movie could have been much better had they stuck with the original draft without the men. It would also have been closer to the game because Harry Mason was a widower. Gans did a great job, however I think that he needed more time. I think the film wasn't even finished until about two weeks before opening day. He should have managed his time better or at least petitioned for a later release date.<br/><br/>On the positive side: The visuals were great, the Grey children scared the crap out of me (which is very hard to do). The sound design for this film was AMAZING! The direction was fantastic as well. It proves that Gans can tell a great story visually, but he and Avary should have worked a bit harder on the script. Oh, and Major props to the cinematographer too! <br/><br/>Overall, I think that people need to open themselves up and let the aura of the film overtake them. As a fan of the games I think the film stays true to the story structure of the games, yet it can still be coherent for those who have not played them. Like I said see it more than once and it will make more sense."
"cervantesedge","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," They did it right.
","Silent Hill is a horror movie. This is not surprise to anyone. What was a surprise to me is that this horror movie has something that most horrors don't bother with: a cohesive and linear storyline. Whether you love it or hate it you can't deny that they kept their plot together. That alone is an amazing feat in this genre. For those familiar with the video game the movie is based on, it does its origin proud. Unfortunately while there is some suspense, the movie sacrifices most of it in favor of shock horror, which I'm not such a fan of. But it all fit together nicely so it can be overlooked. Those easily disturbed by gore shouldn't view this. They do some twisted things in this movie."
"kalika_qetesh","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," Worth it if you're into the atmosphere of the game.
","The movie was slower that most horror or action films of its kind. Why? Because it's how the game play was. They had to incorporate hours of searching for the necessary items into a movie and they did pretty well on it. Not to mention it kept up with the atmosphere of the game by making some scenes dark, just like when you were at home playing and sometimes found things sketchy to see. It was a way of letting your imagination be enveloped by the game and let it run wild with the possibilities of what was there. That's not to say that your favourite characters weren't shown. Pyramid Head and the nurses made a great appearance in the film, and they were very well done too.<br/><br/>The music was taken from the games, including the Lost Carol and Michelle Williamson song taken from Silent Hill 3. All in all, I found it to be a great experience and press all Silent Hill fans to go and check it out."
"harsawa","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," As a fan of the series- I was worried. In the end, I was surprised, there's nothing a fan should be worried about!
","Silent Hill was announced awhile back, and I was afraid it was going to be awful. Even though the previews all looked good, I was still afraid it would be another Doom or Resident Evil. Boy was I wrong! The movie has it's problems, but it still ended up being awesome! It did need a little more appearances from the monsters, and the ending didn't do much for me, but when the monsters did appear, it felt like the games! The town was recreated brick from brick and the story is well written (However there are some plot holes that only fans of the series would be able to fill, so if your a regular movie goer check them out!) and transfers well into a movie, with a few changes that don't harm it much.<br/><br/>The movie isn't as creepy as the games, but it does retain a certain amount of that atmosphere we all love. The world shifts and changes, creatures are twisted and yet seem almost human. The special effects are great too! Though some effects (The revenge sequence) were a little too over done. The sound is great! The soundtrack is good, except some of the remixes don't sound as good as they did on the CD's or in the games. Silent Hill is a shocker! A video game movie that isn't B-grade drek that's torture to sit through! It may not be up to the mark, as it will disappoint some, but for me, I was pleasantly surprised!"

","anyone who says this film is crap is not a silent hill fan FACT The film is bit for bit like the games. even parts of the original game EXAMPLE when you play as harry and you get killed and then start back in the cafÃ© is exactly the same except rose wakes in the bowling alley from silent hill 2. the gore is very strong for a fifteen, in one scene barb wire goes up s woman's vagina and tears her apart.<br/><br/>this is the most perfect screen adaptation since sin city<br/><br/>the colours and imagery in the film are spot on. the janitor is just as creepy in daylight as at night and the film really got you thinking that at any moment something might jump out and scare the hell out of you and most times it did.<br/><br/>watch it with a girl you hate and watch her scream"
"luke_carson3000","7","2","4","22 April 2006"," THIS is Silent Hill.
","It's a step up from the other video game adaptations but still missing something...<br/><br/>It captures the essence of Silent Hill perfectly. Needless to say, this movie is a visual treat. The different dimensions are produced with amazing detail. The foggy world excels in creating a sense of isolation and building up the Silent Hill atmosphere. The hellish world is composed of harsh set pieces of grizzly imagery and decaying, rusted environments, creating a sense of chaos over order. The unimaginable creatures that haunt the world are ultimately disturbing, yet have their own charm that makes the audience NOT want to look away from them. The film gives more of a disturbing, skin-crawling sensation through imagery and sound rather than full-on heart pounding scares. It has its moments though. More frantic scares would have been welcome, however.<br/><br/>Most of the acting is decent and, at least, believable. Being more than just a horror movie, more of a nightmarish drama, there's much emphasis on the characters. It's a mixed result; some parts are much better than others. The Sean Bean side story deepens the mystery about the town itself but takes the audience away from the atmosphere and Mitchell's main storyline. Overall, it sets up an artistic contrast and not much else. It is just such a shame that Avery's script is not really as dynamic as I thought it could have been. The characters were not as fleshed out as much or presented as realistically as I would have expected from a Silent Hill adaptation. Most remain a mystery<br/><br/>As for the story, the movie asks a lot more questions than it answers, leaving much to the imagination by simple suggestion. Even with the considerable chunk of information that comes close to the end of the film, much is left unknown. Unless you have knowledge of the games or are a more active and imaginative viewer, the story is likely to confound you. A lot of people just won't ""get it"" and call it ""overly complicated"" or ""messy"". I do admit that the story could have been told in a better fashion but it's a shame its lost on a lot of people because, after much consideration, the story, with its use of abstract symbols and metaphors, much like the games, is actually quite clever. Occasionally flawed, mainly in the script, yes, but quite brilliant. I believe it shows Christophe Gans' artistic flair and in-depth study of the games themselves. However, mainly fans of the games will understand the weird story that is Silent Hill and few else.<br/><br/>It's not without its flaws but its EXTREMELY watchable and more intelligent than the average horror film. It's quite disappointing that it was created by someone with such passion for the games and yet its flaws could and should have been corrected to produce an all-round better picture. Not quite as good as I had hoped but a real tribute to the scariest games of our time."

","This has to be the best movie rendition of a video game ever. The special effects of the movie were far superior to any other video game movie out there at this time. One thing I have to say is that you either have had to already played the game or pay close attention to the entire movie or you will miss out on certain plot themes and or the movie will not end well for you.<br/><br/>I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire movie wandering was was around the next corner and what would happen to the daughter if she was not found.<br/><br/>********Warning********* This movie contains scenes of extreme gore and I personally would not take my children to see it unless you feel that they do not get scared easily or that they are capable of handling violence."
"itsgonnaraintoday","Null","2","4","22 April 2006"," Waste of Money
","I almost entirely disagree with the review I have just read, and therefore am writing my own. Having played the video game a very long time ago, this movie was very much on its own and didn't have to stand up to any scrutiny from me of its faithfulness. The movie would be able to stand on it's own if it weren't for one undeniable fact; the acting throughout this entire movie is atrocious. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy gore, cheap scares, and special effects. The movie was visually stunning, indeed, with characters that were more than just a bit haunting. The fact is, the movie was chilling, but the acting was shameful and the whole movie is just a cat and mouse game until the end. I must say the the ending (with the barbed wire) was probably one of the most disturbing things I've seen in a movie. They certainly did what they could to be grotesque. There are many look-away moments in this movie. However, it just doesn't rack up the points. It bored me, and it just plain wasn't very good. Our local newspaper gave it half a star. I think I might give one star more, but only for its brilliant visuals. Where did you find all of these horrible actors? Rent it, don't waste extra money to see it in theaters."
"mbmckendree","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," If you enjoyed the game...you will enjoy the movie
","I just saw Silent Hill last night and I can not stop talking about it. Not only did it scare the hell out of me and all my friends who saw it, it also made me think about the correlation between the games and the movie. If you played and enjoyed the silent hill games....YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE. It has exact replicas of monsters such as Pyramid Head(Silent hill video game 2) and many other creatures and goons. The demon in the bathroom was scary as hell. But all in all, this movie was amazing, it had great elements of horror, gore, and not to mention a great story. I give it a 9 out of 10 and encourage any horror movie fan or fan of the games to see this movie"

"crazybeaver","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," Great for fans, others........may get confused? (Spoilers!)
","I went into this film pretty hyped. I'd seen the trailers, the 60 sec clip, the posters, its fair to say i couldn't wait, and....i wasn't disappointed! For starters the film looks incredible (thanks to Ganes's amazing visual flair), and fan's will notice endless references to all the games. The story was an amalgamation of all of these (if I'm wrong i apologise as i cant remember every detail of every game), i was constantly smiling over the amount that i recognised. However, the film is not without faults. The dialogue can at times be testing, sometimes only being slightly better than that which is in the game, and Sean Bean couldn't seem to keep to one accent? And the 'Pyramid Head' character only appeared twice. I was interested in how his character was used, in Silent Hill 2 he is more of an inner demon, a representation of your characters inner torment, in the film however he is mearly a tool for death (not that I'm complaining as every time he appeared was definitely high point!), and i really wanted him to pop up one more time at the end, maybe to cull the townspeople who were trying to escape through the door!? But alas, he didn't. Some of the camera angles used are identical to the games, along with music and set pieces, all of which look and feel stunning! I did however feel that when watching the film, that i was only one in the audience who really liked it? Not that they were laughing or talking through it, but the general vibe in the cinema seemed low? Friends that i went with were split in two, some enjoyed it, others hated it (but thought it looked nice). Overall, i feel that fans are going to be pleased the most, others may get confused or bored, or find it hard to keep up with the constant changing of dimensions/silent hills (even though the people i went with had not played the games, they still understood it)? If your a fan, go see it! If not....go see it! It definitely did the job for me, but one thing i will say.......IT NEEDS MORE PYRAMID HEAD!!! ^_^"
"JoachimGCN","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," The first good video game movie since the original Mortal Kombat
","As is evident in my summary, I believe that Mortal Kombat is the only other half decent video game based movie, with the rest being a complete joke. With that being in my mind every time I saw something new about Silent Hill before its release, I didn't really hold high hopes for it before going to see it. I believe that I was dead wrong.<br/><br/>The only thing that really makes the game was done beautifully in the movie, and that's the environments. Anyone that's played the games knows that the areas of Silent Hill are what make it so creepy. The sets of the film were very well designed, and the transition of ""The Darkness"" of Silent Hill were quite amazing. Now, I've never played the first game all the way through, so saying that they stayed true to the first game completely would be hear-say (as I've heard from someone else that they did).<br/><br/>The creatures of the town were designed very well, and the nurses toward the end (can be seen in some trailers) moved the way I remember them from Silent Hill 3. I was only slightly displeased with them because they seemed to ""swarm"" a bit more than they did in the games, but I'm not going to call this a reason to pass on the movie. I must say that the trailers don't seem to do it justice, really. The movie is....a bit brutal at points. Definitely a great movie for fans of the series, or just horror movie fans in general."
"night_wolf873","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," Honestly, best video-game movie ever made!
","This movie is an excellent example of how a game should be adapted into a movie. The story was terrific and actors did a well enough job of portraying their characters. Although I must admit the acting did get over the track at some points, but the actors maintained their integrity almost through out the movie. Judging also by today's standards of what a good horror movie should be this one is far better than any others that I have seen up until now, in game adaptations anyway. Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark are only few examples of horrible adaptations of terrific video-games. The fact that captured my attention was use of real life actors for playing the monsters. It really reminded me of the old days when horror movies used to be horror, not some load of crap. To sum it all up, Silent Hill stands out at the top of the best video-game adaptations ever done.<br/><br/>I recommend everyone to go out and see it."

Well, I went and saw it opening day and I'll tell you it was amazing. First of all, all the creatures were incredible looking. They moved and made noises just like in the game. The transitions between the fog world and th rust world were awesome. It was something I've never seen before in a movie. Speaking of originality, the way people get killed is new. Every death in this movie was one I've never seen before in another movie. There is a lot of gore in this too, but not just gore and blood thrown in it for the hell of it, there is actually a purpose to it. Thats what I loved about this movie is that everything is connected to the big picture.The plot was just like the game and so were the settings(the school, the warehouse, the hospital, the church...).

"dark_dude87","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," My Favorite Movie this Year... so far.
","""Silent Hill"" ***1/2(Three and a half stars out of four)<br/><br/>Rated R: Strong horror violence and gore, disturbing images, and some language.<br/><br/>Reviewed by: Andrew Goodman <br/><br/>I love this movie! To me, it is the best movie this year... so far, and it is definitely the best ""VIDEO-GAME-TO-MOVIE"" EVER MADE! <br/><br/>It starts out with Rose (Rahda Mitchell), and her husband, Chris (Sean Bean) searching desperately for their daughter who has gone for a midnight stroll in her sleep. Rose eventually finds her and saves her from taking a deadly flying leap. Sharon, Rose and Chris' daughter (while still asleep), starts screaming the name, ""SILENT HILL! SILENT HILL!"" This, to me, was the only cheesily delivered line in the film. Sharon has done this many times before, and Rose can't take it any more. So Rose and Sharon take a trip to the hellish town of Silent Hill...<br/><br/>After I saw this movie, I was so jazzed that all I could do was talk about it. I was so relieved that it wasn't a retarded ""video-game-to-movie"" movie. Everything was so perfect! The music was perfect (straight from the games, and some have been re-recorded with real instruments!), the photography was perfect (they used many crane shots to mimic those of the games, and some scenes are almost shot for shot identical to the video game), the acting was perfect (except for the very beginning. The ""Silent Hill! Silent Hill!"" was kind of weak), the dark nature of the games is intact, the occult religion is just like the games, and the disturbing images are not held back. <br/><br/>The movie filled a lot of the plot holes that the games have, when you see the movie you'll know what I mean. It was also VERY intense. It almost has you cowering right from the beginning. The first time that I really got scared was when Cybil and Rose first see the Patient Demon. Cybil kills it, and then looks up a hill next to her to see another one coming.<br/><br/>The film, however, is not without its flaws. With a running time of 2 hours and 5 minutes, many people thought it was on the long side, but it didn't feel that way to me. There were definitely some ""unneeded"" scenes though, such as those with Chris (Sean Bean). Originally, Gans and Avary had an all women cast for the film, but after the studio read the screenplay, they were told to add in another character that was male. The scenes with Chris, while interesting, didn't add anything to the filmÂ… except a longer running time. This is the main reason I took off half a star from my rating.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan of the games, so naturally I loved it, but it's not for everybody. Many might think it's too in-descriptive, too long, too violent, or that it doesn't have a strong enough plot or script. Many film critics are discrediting this movie as being just that, but they are just one point of view. The kind of point of view that prefers the sappy drama/feel good/Oscar contender's type of movie. Don't listen to the media! If you like the games, or are just a fan of horror movies, then go see this movie! Draw your own conclusions of the film.<br/><br/>If you are like me, then once you finish seeing ""Silent Hill"" for the first time, you'll want to go buy another ticket and see the movie again! <br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the film. Later, Dark"
"olly_serial_killer","10","2","4","22 April 2006"," Go and see this movie
","Well I've been a fan of the games since the first. I can still remember what the feeling was like after completing Silent Hill for the first time. After leaving the cinema yesterday, I had the same feeling come over me. This is not like the other computer game adaptations. From start to finish, you can not fault this movie on detail, on music ( which is directly taken from the game. You will find yourself recognising every song if you have played the games ), on visual effects, on set design and the script. This movie is in every way an amazing addition to the Silent Hill family. Its been long enough waiting for someone to take on the tricky role of trying to grasp everything that the games were and project this into a 2 hour movie. I have to say, when the film was over, I wanted to cry as I felt that Gans had perfectly crafted everything I had seen. If you are a Silent Hill fan, this movie will exceed your expectations. If you have never heard of or played the Silent Hill games, this movie is great place to start your interest. I will write no more as you need to see this and make up your own mind. Go see this film, I dare you, Double dare you!!!"

","all of you, fans of silent hill video game, Its really worth your time and money, i love the movie so much. At first i thought this movie is going to be ""crappy"" like any other movies based on video game (except resident evil). this movie has really cool effect, for whoever play SIlent hill in ""playstation"". you guys pretty much know the story (but there is also difference though. but the very first scene, of the movie is pretty much the same with the ""fmv"" you see in Silent hill the game.and the setting, it's all exactly the same.(for a person who play silent hill) remember the Main character went down the ladder, and then he ended up in a dark place with lots of fences, and there is a dead body hanging on the fence? its all in the movie. Plus the the setting at school, its all exactly the same. there are also some nasty part(well if you see it, u know what i meant) but It's really cool. well all i can say is that, the movie was good. to me it's a little bit better than resident evil (but resident evil is also good)."
"tekjock","7","2","4","22 April 2006"," Liked it allot
","Silent hill was one of the first games that scared the hell out of me. There is one scene in the game where you go into the school and there is a locker room and in there is a locker rattling. You open the locker, and nothing is there. After going though the clock tower in the school courtyard and the air raid sirens go off and all hell breaks loose you go back to the locker room (SIDE NOTE: As I got to this part there was a lighting storm and just as this happen there was a big flash of lightning and a big clap of thunder) I digress, now back in the locker room, the locker is rattling, I open it (BAM HUGH CRACK OF THUNDER OUTSIDE) and a body jumps out of the locker. Scared the bajesus out of me. The other part that creeped me out was during day time game play it is snowing (ash) and its foggy and you hear a mild wind blowing. I use to live down by the water, and one morning I go out side, its Snowing, its foggy and all I hear is the wind blowing. Kinda creeped me out, all I was thinking was, OK .... no static on the radio so i'm safe. SO, all in all this game left a good impression on me. After finishing the game I thought they should make a movie about this.<br/><br/>Loved the effects, looked video game'ish in most parts. I was a bit aw struck on how well the area scenery looked like the game, some of the small details were great. The coverings on the fences outside at night, the way the walls in the buildings looked at night. They did take some liberties with the plot, but thats to be expected.<br/><br/>The Monsters were excellent, the puppet nurses looked great, the Mumblers (Demonic Children) were creepy looking, and the best of all the monsters, always one of my fav's from the game, was the Red Pyramid. I thought this baddie was Very Well Done. He looked Killer, very true to the game.<br/><br/>Over all really enjoyed the movie. My friend who came with me did not play any of the games and was a bit confused at the end. So playing the game is a good prerequisite to seeing the movie."
"wilfy914","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Best Horror Film of the year so far!!!
","I've finally watched this movie last night and fortunately I was very impress. To start with I was mostly on the edge of my sit throughout the film. When the lead character Rose Da Silva enters Silent Hill the atmosphere was very intence, it was nothing like the remake of ""The Fog"" which look like something from a Bon Jovi video, it was literary that the whole town was hiding behind this mist. I know it's based on the game ""The Silent Hill"" but had no idea what the storyline is because I only played on a game demo.<br/><br/>The acting was adequate, Sean Bean's acting could of been better, his didn't really need to put on an American accent. The effects were very technicality well done such as the bleeding of the walls.<br/><br/>Not only I found this movie tense and gripping but I also found it frighting disturbing. When watching through and seeing them zombie children, looking all mangled and horrible and the screaming sound they made gave me a cold shiver down my spine. Also when that officer was being burned, it was so graphic, I couldn't really watched.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is literary the best computer game base movie I've since. Unlike ""Resident Evil"" the movie actually sticks to the games story. I think UWE Boll should get some tips from this movie, because I might make his movies exceptional to watch."
"MakoSucks","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," Almost as good as the game.
","After all the hype, ads, leaks, and one stupid poster contest, Silent Hill finally hits the big screen! Silent Hill fans, High-FIVE! This movie isn't a scare a minute, roller-coaster ride through Hell, like I suppose the trailers lead you to believe. Which I think is great for a movie based on a story driven survival horror game. It isn't what Resident Evil was. How it was matrix kicking dogs in the face, and ultra bad ass type characters. This was more story driven, and less action oriented. That isn't to say that Silent Hill isn't scary, creepy, or violent. There are plenty of pulse pounding scenes , some of which I couldn't believe they actually put on the screen, because they were very extreme, sadistic, and not exactly parent friendly. It isn't a fast paced slasher, or like anything as of late that has been released in theaters, but more of a slower paced Japanese ghost story. Its kind of like watching someone playing Silent Hill, except really really fast.<br/><br/>There were a few parts to the movie I didn't like though. The dialog wasn't the good. It was alright, but it just didn't seem natural to me, but its still levels above the games voice overs. Maybe they were trying to stay true to the source material. The story didn't completely follow the games story, but still it is very damn close, which is great, just a few parts stray, and contradict with the game universe, and that bothered me a bit. They tacked on ""ph"" on it, which is kind of a double edged sword. It doesn't make any sense for him to be in this one, but he is one of the better characters in the game, so yeah its bad and good. All very small annoyances, that I can live with.<br/><br/>So I of course loved the movie. It had a lot of envelope pushing scenes that totally amazed me, and was very interesting, and it was based on SILENT HILL! This movie is the best video game based movie I have seen, even better than Mortal Kombat! Oh and of course, it contains some of the best music from the silent hill games, and video games in general!"
"scottyk2","9","2","4","22 April 2006"," A Great Video Game To Movie Conversion ""Roll on SH2""
","This movie I've been looking forward to since i saw it advertised on a Silent Hill forum in the making, So yes i am a huge huge huge fan!<br/><br/>The movie to game ratio is about 75% the characters have been slightly change monsters are great if some are ripped from other Silent Hill games. The biggest thing the creators had to get over to everyone was the ATMOSPHERE!! silent Hill is a game that makes you get very involved wandering the isolated streets etc.. This i have to agree was a shame that as ""Vandwedge"" said was not accomplished going from Evil SH to a relaxing calm view of the ""real world"" but the locations were spot on School, Hotel its a pity the hospital element wasn't explored more as fans will tell you the hospital plays a major part in the stories. The other element missing is the idea of having a small weapon array in the movie rose picks up a knife but alas does not run any monsters through or slice a single creature with the blade, It would have been nice to see the barbed wire wood or pole removed from a wall to eliminate the odd enemy.. The gore factor in silent hill is almost as important as the atmosphere hanging bodies mangled foes etc the movie does handle this quite well with scenes to rival event horizon on crazy deaths.<br/><br/>I saw this movie from a fan point of view BUT i went to the cinema with some silent hill virgins who have never laid eyes on this great game series they all came out saying it was brilliant BUT who the? how the? and that was oh i get it. I found myself explaining things on the way home filling in the bits to make sense this does however differ from the game story so no Samael etc from the game more about the brief reason as to why things are happening. For the popcorn people this is a very hard story to follow, twisting and confusing the hell out of people more so than a regular horror movie. They all said they really enjoyed it even my g/f did and she is not the greatest horror fan so if i was reviewing this from a non silent hill person maybe it should be an 8 as the movie was still a great collection the horror and thriller market but didn't explain everything in depth to help people through the confusing times.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a great success on the game to film ratio from other appalling conversions Mario Bros right up to Tombraider which again could have been amazing. This hopefully is going to setup the next story in the silent hill line up a personal favourite of mine silent hill 2 if this happens then this should be great but i guess we will have to keep our eyes open and see if this happens..<br/><br/>Sient Hill is dark, evil, and an atmospheric movie go see this mysterious tale for yourself. If you can pick up a copy of the game to understand things better do so and play a great horror series in the process. <br/><br/>""Enter The World Of Silent Hill"""

","Silent Hill is place no one ever wants to go to, of course its a place that our dreams express often, our dreams show us a sign and that sign is Silent Hill.<br/><br/>This film was really interesting, a great ending and a great story. I have plaid brief bits of all the games and I know that basic plots, there talented games and bloody brilliant ones to watch. A film would be hard, I knew that, but it was possible. The film deserves a lot of good reviews, the only bummer side to the film is how much CGI they used, but leave that alone and you have a talented film that can impress all.<br/><br/>The stars of the film all heald there own in this film, the one i think that worked the hardest was the little girl, she plaid the role perfectly, a wonderful child actress is coming to our screens, our big screens, she was also in Kingdom Hospital!

"head_hunter66","10","2","4","22 April 2006"," The very least you can say about this movie
","No matter how ignorant you are, and how much you hate Silent Hill... There's an undeniable fact behind this movie: It's the best video game based movie yet.<br/><br/>I understand a lot of reviewers from various website's are giving the movie bad reviews...take your time and read them, you can easily see why they are complaining and if you watch the movie (actually watch it) you'll find their review so off that it's not even funny. Anyways the main reason they are complaining is because horror films these days have a dumb childish plot & a lot of ""boo"" scares. Silent Hill is a total different matter, it has a complex plot and there are basically no ""boo"" scares. A few of the reviewers actually said that they didn't understand the plot (and yet, they still write their reviews).<br/><br/>I wonder if they understood ""The Matrix"" the first time they watched it?<br/><br/>Anyways screw all of that, Silent Hill is a great movie. I don't remember enjoying a movie so much, every bit of it was entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall I seriously recommend this movie for anyone who can handle it."
"druss44121-1","6","2","4","22 April 2006"," Insert clever title here
","Attention all: please welcome video game adaptation number 32, Silent Hill. Here we have a lovely specimen, a film that actually stands out from the pack.<br/><br/>Our main character is Rose, the mother of an adopted little girl named Sharon. Sadly, little Sharon has been acting weird thanks to some high-risk sleep walking. Worse, she keeps mumbling about a mysterious town called Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Rose decides the best solution to cure her daughter is to bring her to Silent Hill and discover exactly what is going on. Of course her husband does not approve, but it doesn't matter since there isn't much time to reflect on the situation at all.<br/><br/>Silent Hill delves right into the action.<br/><br/>In fact, within 10 minutes Rose is already stranded at the mysterious Silent Hill.<br/><br/>While it's nice to not have to wade through pointless exposition that exists only to give the illusion of an actual story, there is no time to bond with the characters at all.<br/><br/>The problem is not so much that we need a half hour of superfluous back story, but that too little time is focused on the main characters as people merely trying to live their lives.<br/><br/>Thus, they become artificial cardboard cutouts. There is never a sense of panic or fear.<br/><br/>As strange and sinister as Silent Hill can be, it's never genuinely scary because there is never any real connection to a human figure.<br/><br/>The acting doesn't help much, either, with Sean Bean phoning in his performance as the worried dad and Jodelle Ferland doing her best ""creepy girl from The Ring"" impression. Lead actress Radha Mitchell plays a convincing mother, though her entire performance is fairly one note.<br/><br/>However, one thing about Silent Hill stands out in an extraordinary way.<br/><br/>Simply put, French director Christophe Gans knows how to sculpt moving images.<br/><br/>Much like his last film, the stylish but complex The Brotherhood of the Wolf, the assorted mix of odd environments and crazed fiends fill a dark void that is anything but empty.<br/><br/>With a surrealist look reminiscent of earlier European horror, Silent Hill is able to stretch out from the screen and into the mind.<br/><br/>Now, it is absolutely true that great visuals cannot make a bad movie great.<br/><br/>To be fair, horror films are hardly heralded for brilliant character development or complex stories. Nevertheless, this does not mean that these elements are useless.<br/><br/>And no doubt, if Silent Hill had a stronger script it could truly have been a brilliant little film.<br/><br/>Thankfully these flaws don't sink the entire production. Even as the vague plot lurches to its halfway satisfactory climax, it is hard to turn away.<br/><br/>This is a movie for the fans, and it includes many horror movie musts. There are especially scenes of great carnage, including a gruesome finale and the untimely demise of one character whose clothes are torn off in one fell swoop, followed by their skin.<br/><br/>Yet, Silent Hill is more than a pointless gore fest.<br/><br/>Although a level of realism is purposely lost, something distinctive is always waiting to echo from the darkness. A curiosity as to what could be around the next corner keeps boredom at bay.<br/><br/>Admittedly, though, the ending is weak.<br/><br/>First we have the wonderful ""Harry Potter"" monologue where most of the story is summarized in a short spouting of clunky dialogue. Then there is the obligatory ambiguous finale that is not so much clever as it is predictable and disappointing.<br/><br/>In some ways, the problems with the plot are because Silent Hill is such a faithful and direct adaptation of its source material. Many videogames are very clearly influenced by films, and what might be original in one medium becomes tired and overused in another.<br/><br/>Still, Silent Hill is an interesting journey that feels dredged up straight from a nightmare.<br/><br/>Gans will not convert nonbelievers to the world of horror, but for those who have played the game or seek something unusual, there is quite a bit to appreciate here.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: It is probably the best video game to film adaptation so far (not that this is saying much), and despite inherent flaws with basic concepts of story and characters, Silent Hill compels attention."
"glendaal","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Even for fans, this is a frustrating movie
","Silent Hill the movie brings the games onto the screen stunningly - in the audio/visual department, that is. The town is crafted brilliantly and the monsters are excellently translated on the screen, even though they get very little screen time and they seem to move on from monster to monster episodically, with no real purpose to their appearances.<br/><br/>The plot of the original game has been butchered, in a bid to appease a wider audience. The result still ends up a terribly confusing mess, and is likely to upset the fans due to its rather flabbergasting changes to the core plot mechanics. All those characters that you know and love from the game are completely different and you feel very little emotion for any of them. This film could have been an excellent human drama, as well as a gut wrenching horror, but in the end it was little more than an ineffective splatter-fest with a simplified, yet at the same time, poorly implemented storyline.<br/><br/>It will confuse the general public, and its unnecessary and sizable changes will do little but infuriate true fans of the game.<br/><br/>Once again it's presentation deserves a thumbs up, and for the first half of the movie, you'll probably be enjoying it immensely. But beware, about an hour in, something awaits around the next corner. A massive kick in the gut. 6 out of 10"
"m3dvol1","7","2","4","22 April 2006"," great video game adaption/ decent movie
","OK, this is a decent movie at best, but a really good game to movie adaption.<br/><br/>It wasn't so scary, but more disturbing. The story is deeper and more complex than most if not all video game movies. That is what makes this movie different from other game adaptions.<br/><br/>The story shouldn't be too confusing if you paid attention. The monsters are from Alessa's mind. The Screaming children monsters, the janitor, etc. They all represent what gave her pain.<br/><br/>Alessa was split into 2. The good side and the evil side. She used Rose as someone to help her get revenge on the cult that totured and killed her. Alessa was calling Sharon to go to Silent Hill, thus bringing Rose along.<br/><br/>At the end, Alessa/Sharon are ""one"" again.<br/><br/>It could have been better, but then again, it could have been worse. So I guess i'm satisfied with the film, but i could've been more satisfied."
"eclipser69","8","2","4","22 April 2006"," Best video game adaptation yet.
","Having been a large silent hill fan, I have naturally been waiting for a few months for this movie to come out. I had expectations. Some were met, some weren't.<br/><br/>This movie does a fantastic job of adapting the silent hill atmosphere to film. The settings, characters and scenes are meticulously recreated in a genuine manner. The imagery is just as unsettling, anxiety causing, and tense.<br/><br/>For the first time ever I have had the movie answer questions about a game which I had played years before. The pacing is interesting, giving you a taste of the hellish side of Silent Hill before rudely yanking you out, as the game typically did.<br/><br/>Complaints though run from character interaction and occasionally acting. Some of the dialogue feels unnecessary and out of place. As well, I believe a general audience might find it hard to understand, possibly even nonsensical if they have not had the chance to enjoy silent hill games.<br/><br/>However, I've never seen a movie like this. It has cinematographic merit for what It tries to do. Its extremely unique and discomforting to watch at the same time due to how graphic the scenes are. I can only hope that Gans will be able to get his hands on future game licenses, because this adaptation was very satisfying and faithful to what the underlying philosophy of the game was all about, as well as other aspects. Despite its problems, it was ultimately a very satisfying, and different type of movie."

","I've been a huge fan of the silent hill series since the first one came out and have played all four many, many times. that said, let me say that this movie is hands down the best game to film adaptation ever, but, not just that, its actually a really good horror movie. players of the games will appreciate the references(and there are many that are quite cleverly woven into the plot)to the games, and i also think that they will really like what has been done with the story. the four games, although somewhat connected(obviously 1 and 3), all have their own stories to tell and utilize silent hill in different ways. the movie does a great job of re-creating that world and giving a story that fits. will it be well-received by the critics? doubtful.(roger ebert already reviewed it, apparently, and it wasn't that good) will fans of the horror genre appreciate the film? i don't see how they couldn't. my girlfriend doesn't like horror movies and we saw silent hill twice on Friday and now shes wanting to play all four games. will fans of the game AND the horror genre like the film? its likely to be in their top 10 favorite horror films of the last twenty years. speaking of 10...thats exactly what i give this movie."
"kitzoarts","10","2","4","22 April 2006"," Silent Hill - Fantastic!
","Silent Hill was fantastic in my eyes. Was without a doubt the best Game to Movie film of all time. I liked the fact that they incorporated some old 80's horror film styles and events into the film without harming the original story line. Had a little bit of ""Evil Dead'ness"" in the film nearing the end.<br/><br/>The most amazing part about this film was bumping into one of the actresses in the film while waiting to get into see it upon its release to screen! She was the Red Nurse that's briefly shown in the film , sadly with a smart part... she was GORGEOUS (both in the film and in person).<br/><br/>If anyone knows the actresses name or remembers what her name was listed in the credits, it would be awesome if someone could inform me as to what her name was. Not everyday do i bump into an actor of a film I'm about to see.<br/><br/>I can't seem to find her on the IMDb credit listing here. Because there is nobody titled ""Nurse in Red"".<br/><br/>Anywhoness, I give this film a 10/10!"
"italiansquare","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," Damn Good!
","I honestly thought that this movie combined the series quite well, while having a comprehensive story, involving plot, and excellent acting. The movie is also excellent for those that are unfamiliar to the series, it's just got that good of a story to it. <br/><br/>There are several scenes that are straight from the game, as well as all the monsters that appear. Fortunately, they are given the same care in translation to film that Sin City did: they look like they just hopped out of the game, most scenes are step for step from the games.<br/><br/>In short, it's a great movie for fans of the Silent Hill series, and it's also a great movie for people who know nothing about it. By far it's the best video game adaption I've ever seen, and probably my favorite one this year."
"howismyfish","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," By far the best video game movie adaptation I've ever seen.
","Silent Hill is a deep and gruesome portrait of motherhood, religion, and revenge. It would be hard to believe that it is a video game movie adaptation if you had not played the game. Indeed, everything, the music, the camera angles, and the extremely disturbing images and demons could have been (and in many cases, actually were) taken straight from the Silent Hill game series.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is not a movie for the faint of heart and may be hard to follow at times if you don't know anything about the games or the story. Playing the games is certainly not required to enjoy the movie, but first timers and people looking for a simple slasher movie may feel left unfulfilled. And, just like the games, it may take multiple viewings to see and understand everything there is to behold.<br/><br/>Overall, the storyline is a little complicated (although nothing compared to something like A Tale of Two Sisters) and a tiny bit unclear at times, leaving some things open to interpretation. The last half-hour of the movie also holds some of the most disturbing and gory images on film. But the acting is solid on all parts, the story, if grasped, is engrossing, the pace is perfect, and the visuals are the best around.<br/><br/>I view Silent Hill as one of the best psychological/terror movies in existence, if not one of best ever made. I would recommend it to horror, psychological thriller, or Silent Hill game fans everywhere."
"yfguitarist","9","2","4","21 April 2006"," Finally a horror movie that delivers
","I've been waiting for this kind of horror movie for quite some time. After being disappointed by the recent horror flicks (Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, Wolf Creek...) I was wondering if there ever would be another movie that suited my tastes. Only a few weeks ago I commented that I would love to see a horror film that isn't restrained, and creepy enough to give me the chills, one that wouldn't feature mindless gore but one that used gore in a horrifying manner (particularly in front of many witnesses), and yet one that blended this with atmosphere, story, and tension without relying on jump scenes.<br/><br/>Tonight (opening night) I got my wish. The first showing (9:40 pm) was sold out so I sat with my friends in a fairly crowded 10:15 showing. There were occasional bouts of laughter at unintentionally funny parts (bad acting, bizarre music choices), but methinks it was mainly to relieve tension, because at several scenes the laughter abruptly stopped and the audience sat in silence or reacted with ""Holy sh*t..."" with mingled screams. This was particularly evident at the finale, which was built up to the entire movie for a very intense scene in which no one laughed and people were shocked at how far the director went. Some special effects early on are fake-looking, but the climax more than makes up for all the other faults. The soundtrack and imagery is beautiful as well.<br/><br/>I haven't reacted like this to a horror movie since I was a child. There are several atmospheric scenes that are nightmarish and reminiscent of Asian horror, and there are scenes that feature fountains of unflinching gore and tension that actually manage to horrify and awe the viewer without unnecessary jump scenes.<br/><br/>My girlfriend commented as we walked out, ""That was such a messed up movie...I couldn't watch it"" and she was one of the ""laughers"". I overheard ""Worst movie ever! It didn't make sense!"" and ""Best movie ever! F*ckin' awesome!"" I'm glad this wasn't a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>I'd say this is my favorite horror movie of all time, along with The Shining, Les Diaboliques, The Eye, and The Ring. I was very satisfied."
"deletedboi1985","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," Beautifully Captured
","The music. The visual effects. The sounds, the path. This movie is the best Video Game To Movie ever made in my eyes. It rocked my brain. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, a lot of Bad reviews have been written for this film, but only because they expected something else, they didn't understand Silent Hill or the story of it. It had some flaws, but it's an amazing film. It stood very close to the game's style and feel, and I am impressed with it very much. Akira Yamaoka was an executive producer too, which is extremely amazing. I recommend buying the music soundtrack, and playing the games, immerse yourself into it. And lose yourself in it's world."
"sabrewing","9","2","4","21 April 2006"," Admittedly, having played and studied the games, I'm rather biased ...
","For the past two months, easily, I've been anxiously awaiting this weekend, and right after I left my work shift, I was off to the movie theater to secure a ticket to Silent Hill. The lights eased off, the screen lit up, and the speakers began to reverberate with the strumming of what will be familiar sounds to SH veterans: the first game's opening music played on a mandolin. A smile came over my face. I know Mr. Gans wouldn't let me down.<br/><br/>And for the most part, he most certainly did not; Silent Hill contains fan service galore, and rewards steadfast players of the games with little asides here and there. Rose Da Silva's sojourn into the titular town to find her daughter Sharon encompasses aspects of all four games and even some of the graphic novels, be they locations, creatures, even something as seemingly unimportant as camera angles or street names printed on a bus route map. Save for one or two instances, I could hear a piece of music being played in the background and instantly identify from which title -- nay, from which situation in which title they originated. And the storyline, that most ballyhooed of problems that is often cited as being so meandering as to be nonexistent, stays true to the source material to a fault. So yes, I can definitely see how the average Joe will be completely stunned and clueless. Thankfully, I am not an average Joe when it comes to this film. Maybe I am just a little fanboy at heart, but I almost found myself wishing that a few extra wink-wink-nudge-nudge's had found their way in. Maybe the hotel room could have been 312 instead of 111, for instance? But then, that's what sequels are for, and Silent Hill leaves the door wide open for one.<br/><br/>Visually, there's no two ways around it -- it's stunning. The crew intentionally kept away from CGI as best they could unless it became necessary to achieve a particular effect, and it pays off in spades. Seeing the nurses twitching in ways that only a human body could manage, or Pyramid Head's Great Knife wagging dangerously in front of our heroines, it was truly a sight, as well as the shifts from Snowy Silent Hill to its dark incarnation. Gans' art directors and crew are to be commended for achieving the look of the games in three dimensions so meticulously.<br/><br/>Now, my own personal problems with the film. I almost wish the subplot involving Christopher and his own hunt for his family had been dropped. It carried a neat parallel with Silent Hill 2, to be sure, but the movie usually came to a standstill when it switched from Rose's perspective in the constantly changing Silent Hill to Chris in his decidedly normal environments. That may have been the fanboy inside me aching to find out what other familiar things would be brought to the screen, and growing impatient when I had to sit through more exposition.<br/><br/>Interestingly, that last sentence might just be the movie's biggest undoing: it feels like a movie made by a fan (which Gans has repeatedly proved to be), FOR fans. Not much is done to welcome newcomers into the fold and show them what all the excitement's about, save for the gorgeous visuals, VERY gory mutilations and wonderfully edited trailer, and that is seriously a shame. Not having any ""hey, see this?"" moments to rely upon, the newbies are left to cope with a story which is rather cryptic in its attempt to juggle multiple story threads, and so far, they have none too quietly declared in other reviews that they have no intentions of doing so, while the rest of us can just look at Midwich Elementary or Brookhaven Hospital and know exactly what the writers are referring to.<br/><br/>So, is Silent Hill worth seeing? If you're a fan of the games, the answer is unequivocally yes. Other people, I can't easily recommend it to, but if you're able to sit back and read between the lines while admiring what Gans' visual team has accomplished, you'll be in for a rare treat: a good video-game adaptation."
"JimmyZappa","7","2","4","21 April 2006"," Well, Pyramid Head was awesome.
","As a hardcore gamer, i'm always constantly on the lookout for THE video game adaptation that will shatter standards, make heads turn, and finally seal the gap that made video game-to-movie conversions impossible to be on par with book and other high quality adaptations.<br/><br/>It's a shame that time isn't here yet. But hey, at least we got a video game adaptation that doesn't suck really bad. Doesn't that count for something? I think it does.<br/><br/>Well, the monsters were cool, scenery was great. And, Pyramid Head was awesome. And...the finale was really awesome. And...that little girl and the cop acted pretty damn good in some parts. And, I have to say, the CG used to creating the atmosphere back and forth was nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>And yeah, those are pretty much all the positive things I have to say about the film. Not to say the movie was blah, however; it was far from it actually. This is probably the third best game-to-movie adaptation i've ever seen. It's just that it's not the second coming of Christ a lot of people made it out to be.<br/><br/>My gripes were that: <br/><br/>(-)Sean Bean didn't do anything.<br/><br/>(-)The main chic...can't act.<br/><br/>(-)Alot of time was wasted trying to create a spooky atmosphere...when in fact, it's not scary at all (and I get scared easily, I did jump once during the nurse part). So to me it was a waste of time doing all those camera shots to try and build up a mood that will never come when they could've been concentrating more on the monsters and the characters (but I can give the dude credit for trying).<br/><br/>(-)Pyramid Head didn't come out that much! That got me off, he had no purpose but to come out running around as if he's saying ""Hey Happy People, i'm from Silent Hill 2!I have no purpose whatsoever in this film, but I have to say that i'm from the game and I like to whack stuff with my big sword that I stole from Cloud Strife off the set of Advent Children! Thank you and have a nice day, as i'm not paid very much to be here for any more than two minutes. So I guess i'll leave now""....and yeah,you never see him again after they go into the church. But he does go out with a bang I must say.<br/><br/>(-)The story was good...but not great as many were wanting it to be.<br/><br/>(-)Most of the acting was so-so but there were some good moments here and there.<br/><br/>(-)And finally, some parts in the beginning...just didn't add up well at all, like the main girl's behavior to just drive off like a goon for no reason to Silent Hill, especially when you see HOW she got in in the first place...I mean, what the...? It would've been better if it was subtly hinted instead of blown out in your face ""It was the Silent Hillz that made me do it!"" But despite these short comings, I throughly enjoyed myself...whenever Pyramid Head came out anyway until we go to the meat that served as the basis for the entire film. I almost fell asleep a few times until the middle of the movie kicked in, but I give the director credit for saying true to the games...visually, anyway.<br/><br/>After Mortal Kombat and next to Advent Children, I'd have to say this snuggles in at third place in my favorite video game adaptation list. I wouldn't mind buying it at budget price on DVD when it comes out and I wouldn't mind watching it a few more times....well, the cool parts anyway. Specifically anything with Pyramid Head. He was too awesome."

","Silent Hill's plot is nothing like the plots of Konami's Silent Hill 1-3 (4 being completely different, so I'll discard it). However, it tries to remain faithful to the (first) games. My criticism is during the ""light"" or ""day"" times, and also during the Christopher parts. It tends to get to slow and a little boring. Then, all of the sudden it speeds up like the micro machine guy who talked really fast. I loved the darkness parts and found some parts to be really creepy (and really bloody and gory, but not disgusting, just like horror films should be.) The music is almost exactly the same as the games. The ending was pretty okay, since I hope there is a (superior) sequel nearby. I didn't hate this movie (like Doom), but it is not one of the best movies I have ever seen, either. I still recommend it to people who have not played the game, as well as people who have. Like books made into films, there will always be changes that one may or may not like. But, I think the movie is still worth seeing. 8/10"

Not only did it let me experience the same emotions and unique environments, it surpassed my expectations, delving deeper into the story of Silent Hill and its past. Going to the film with a close friend of mine who has yet to play the game, i found our constructive criticism was closely related. We loved the salute to 80s horror (via Hellraiser) and especially the unique sense of character development and story elements that helped us believe in such a tail. I have played all four games, and each game allows me to enter this world, a world closely related to that of Silent Hill the film, a feet which on its own is a great achievement."

It is also a great film on it's own for the general audience. In the early points of the film, the movie is in video-game mode which later on moves to film mode. The movie points out everything that was taken from the video game in the early parts of the movie, but once the movie goes further along, it's all about the plot, the performances, and the outcome of the film.<br/><br/>Trust me!

","I have seen many video game adaptations in my time and all have them had failed. I'm a large fan of the Silent Hill series but I didn't really have the expectations this film would be anything better than a standard two-star B rate horror movie. However, from the second the film began, I suddenly realized how very wrong I was.<br/><br/>In cooperation with Konami, this film has managed to combine the best elements of story-telling from film and place it on a setting that is purely Silent Hill as real as it can be. There are no punches pulled; this is it. This is what how it really happens and it is brutal and unforgiving. The film demonstrates the kind of raw emotion and true depth, the horror and the scenes of uniquely moving and powerful suffering that can only be described as demented perfection.<br/><br/>This film shows emotion, it shows depth, it is powerful and moving. It is so much more than just a horror film. This is the dark side of drama, showing us a place where there is an opportunity for an Oscar in the horror films. It's rare that you will cry in a horror movie for feeling for the characters and that the emotional bond can become so strong.<br/><br/>In point of a horror perspective...This movie will shock you and if you think you've seen horror before...well, let me put it to you this way. This isn't a pop-out and scare you film. This will bring your inner-most fears to the surface and show you a kind of Hell. You will be horrified in a way you've never been horrified before.<br/><br/>As for the nudity...There is nudity in this film. I've never seen nudity done so perfect and tasteful as I have with this film. The instance to which I refer is absolutely perfect for a horror film. However, if you're just looking to stares at breasts...you may be better off watching a film like Hostel.<br/><br/>Furthermore, fans of the game, God has come and given you what you've been waiting for. Fans of extreme situations and depictions of suffering like you would find in Strangeland or Hellraiser...Go see this film, there is a new god for you now, his name is Pyramid Head.<br/><br/>All and all, this is a new kind of genre. This is an epic film on scale with the Lord of the Rings to horror. It's an experience that should not be missed. If you are at all capable of seeing this film, especially in theatres, I urge you to do so. This is the defining moment cinema history and Silent Hill will be the beginning of a new kind of film. A great future awaits us all. Thank you Gans, from the bottom of my heart, thank you."
"sfuster","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," oh man, oh man, this is good!
","this is an excellent movie and a treat for silent hill fans. It stays true to the series and incorporates pieces of each video game. It takes plot points, monsters and more from the video game while still staying its own individual story. Its very true to the game, the music, and atmosphere seem to be taken straight from the game itself. However I was disappointed with the last 10 - 20min of it. If i were to say any more it would ruin it for you. In total I thought this movie was excellent, and I'm glad i went and saw it in the theaters (i'll probably see it again) however i will say that if you are not a previous silent hill fan, much of this movie may go way over your head and seem stupid. excellent movie!"
"sonsia","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," Soooo good.
","I'm proud to say that I was at the first local showing of this movie, on opening day. I'm a huge fan of the games, and nearly squealed in delight just from seeing the opening credits with the famous theme song. (So keep in mind that I'm biased.) I hate that the rating on RottenTomatoes is so low, and I'm sad that critics didn't like it... but I'm not surprised. Anyone who's a fan of the Silent Hill series has to be able to wrap their minds around the concept of parallel realities in order to appreciate the plot lines, and I suppose modern critics just aren't capable of that. Yeah, the plot was a little weak - but the atmosphere and the originality, the sheer ART of the movie, more than made up for a weak plot. I applaud Avary and Gans, and hope that bad critic reviews don't discourage them from considering a Silent Hill 2. I, for one, will gladly see it. It's the best horror movie I've seen in a long time, and makes me wish that the Silent Hill team would remake Jacob's Ladder. :) Oooooooh. Very well done! I'm tempted to go see it again..."
"L_Russell2003","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," Fantastic... true to the games, beautiful piece of horror.
","Just got back from watching SILENT HILL. had to come on here and comment. Absolutely fantastic... no qualms what so ever. Loved the Pyramid Head. Brilliant CG animation, not too much or too little. Personally the sound didn't give the same feeling as the games but VERY close. I did have a little problem with the ending as it was a little inconsistent to the games, also i think that for viewers who have never played the games it may be a little difficult to grasp but go and see it none the less. Will definitely be a classic! I will say though, not really for the skirmish... lots of blood. Should really have been an 18... censors kinda screwed up in my opinion.<br/><br/>Really, go and see it... not boring for a second. Not too miss!!!"
"mldarko","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," We've all lost our children...
","I gave this movie a 10. Why? Because it adheres to artistic value and atmospheric disturbance instead of action and music video violence.<br/><br/>While some of you complain that it's changed from the game. That's for the best. After viewing the film, I can't imagine a male character running around and doing all these things that Rose has to do. Secondly, this is a film release, and in case you didn't notice, your PS1 is at home.<br/><br/>The film follows Rose on a hopeless mission to locate her missing daughter. Most of you know this, so I'll move on.<br/><br/>In the first segments of the film, you are quickly thrust into the nightmares of the town. The film quickly establishes the town as a world falling into darkness and Rose meets that darkness head on, almost the moment she gets there. The debut of the Gray Children are utterly horrifying. A high point in this film is the music, which was ripped directly from the game. The only track not from the games seems to be ""Burning Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash, which is heard on an old jukebox in the bowling alley, waking Rose.<br/><br/>This film definitely pushes the gore and violence, but in a creative way. Cybil's death is a long single-take, showing her stages from fighting the heat, sweating and showing exhaustion, and slowly giving in to shock as her skin begins to char. She is far into the state of shock by the time the flames ignite, engulfing her.<br/><br/>The entire hospital basement scene is also nightmarish, and the Red Nurse(Lisa) is a tragic little addition, her movements to hide her face in shame from Rose being inexplicably surreal and odd.<br/><br/>This film is full of subtle scares and nightmarish displacement, and it's exactly what the film needed. It is true to the roots of Silent Hill, although using a modified version of the story.<br/><br/>The ending attack by Alessa will shock you in ""Hellraiser"" type ways, and the final moments of the film are touching in that Christopher can feel his wife and child, but will never see them again or know what happened. They are forever so close, but so far away."

","Few horror films have ever left me anything other than bored. In a genre mainly progressed by developments in special effects, allowing for more visually vivid forms of evisceration and mutilation, something was generally missing: involvement in the characters plight. What if I was there? What could and would I do in that situation?<br/><br/>Then I played Silent Hill. A defining moment in my long history of gaming, one which manifested the dread, anticipation and raw fear I'd expected ever since playing Haunted House on the Atari 2600. What if I was there? What if I woke up in Silent Hill and had to face everything encountered by my game avatar - I'd have bloody well shot myself. Game Over.<br/><br/>So does the film bring the same sense of dread and terror no and yes. Not that it's a fault of the direction, script or acting but I just couldn't get too involved with the lead character, perhaps it's a gender issue or my lack of paternal instinct but I just didn't see the world through the eyes of Rose Da Silva or relate to her motivations.<br/><br/>The story is closest to the original game, drawing visual elements from throughout the series, most notably the foreboding character of Pyramid Head. It may be my cynicism but this inclusion seems like an attempt at crowd pleasing, none of the themes or purpose of the character being relevant to the plot. Still, the arbitrary incorporation of the knife wielding leviathan as a somewhat minor henchman didn't detract from the movie, it just didn't add to it as he would as a central character.<br/><br/>The 'world' of Silent Hill is beautiful in its corrupted splendour, so faithful to the game it'll have fans raising a smile as they recognise scenarios they've played through. The transitions between the light and dark versions of the town are superb, the artificiality akin to CG doesn't hinder, you can almost taste the rust and ash, smell the decay and rot. It's as good as it could ever have been.<br/><br/>S.H. purists will probably have a few gripes about missing plot points and the lack of certain 'creatures', sometimes we're handed exposition on a buffet size plate, especially in the ""Idiots Guide To Why This All Happened"" segment, yet I didn't find it to be of detriment to my overall enjoyment of the storytelling and perhaps it's essential for the casual cinema goer who's not fully versed the towns mythology.<br/><br/>I certainly applaud Roger Avary for many of his decisions in the direction the script takes. It's rare to see a movie with such a predominantly female cast, especially in horror where women are normally reserved for T&A shots or slaughter fodder, the male characters barely garner ten minutes of screen time and are rather ineffectual. I was also surprised that the ""Reason This All Happened"" was true to the original, as the core to why the game is genuinely disturbing I thought it may be considered too strong for the mainstream movie investor. Embellishments to the games outline also kicked against the pricks of conventional Hollywood, especially one event I considered very brave which left me cold and taken aback.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's a testament to the original story, perhaps its down to a well written script comprised of both homage and original elements, perhaps it's the well executed CG or competent direction, but Silent Hill is the first game adaptation I found to be worthwhile.<br/><br/>With the likes of Tomb Raider, Mario and Alone in the Dark it's easy to see why game/movie crossovers provoke a gag reflex of bad reviews from critics and gamers alike, hopefully Silent Hill will pave the way for the genre to be as accepted and incongruous as a book adaptation."
"ehmilio","8","2","4","21 April 2006"," An excellent horror film and the best video game adaptation to date.
","This movie had so much potential to fail terribly, just for being based on a video game, yet it turned out to be the best horror film made in years. The cinematography was splendid, the special effects were top-notch, the story was well thought out, and the music (most of it taken directly from the games) was beautifully executed. The only part that wasn't perfect was the dialog; although the actors were well-suited for their roles, some of their lines seemed unnecessary or over-the-top (an apparently inescapable trait of all horror films).<br/><br/>The violence, gore, and disturbing imagery promised by the R rating are well delivered. The creatures, gore, and violence are all shown in plain sight; very little is left for your imagination to sort out. It is not necessary to play the games in order to understand the story. However, many secondary details are left unexplained (such as the origin of most creatures) for the viewers to arrive at their own conclusions, just like in the games. The important plot elements are explained appropriately, feeding all the important information without insulting the viewer's intellect. Still, I suspect that those who have no knowledge of the Silent Hill mythos may have a hard time understanding the ending.<br/><br/>Fans of the series will recognize elements taken from all four Silent Hill games, especially in the soundtrack, although the movie borrows mostly from the first two. Christopher Gans has shown utter respect for the series and careful attention to details; unlike with most video game adaptations to film, fans will agree that this film managed to capture the essence of the games with great accuracy.<br/><br/>Do expect: -A disturbing, high-tension experience. -Lots of unexplained phenomena*. -A reinterpretation of the first Silent Hill's story.<br/><br/>Don't expect: -Lots of cheap sudden scares. -Fast-paced, creature-mowing action sequences. -A definitive and thoroughly rational conclusion*. -Sean Bean in a groundbreaking role.<br/><br/>*Unless you're an über-fan of the series, in which case it will all make perfect sense."

","to the game, the movie delivers perfectly. I throughly enjoyed each aspect of the movie. There were definite reminders of the games from the radios to the characters/monsters within. The storyline is complex and hard to follow at times yes but when the realisation of what has happened hits you, you are thoroughly hooked in.<br/><br/>The characters were slightly over the top at times and so was the acting, however this only served to emphasise the movies genre, not to say that the movie shouldn't be taken seriously however as the storyline is very very good.<br/><br/>Like the games also the movie doesn't focus on visual horror too much, cheap jumps aren't what the game was about and the movie did not disappoint either focusing on the atmosphere and playing with the audiences emotions.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable horror movie that is story driven and not for those looking for cheap and nasty scares with a serious lack of originality and story!

","Silent Hill is an example of what happens when people take the time to do something right. The production values in this film have not been seen in some time in a horror film. Its an intelligent film which is beautifully shot and superbly acted. The score is directly from the game and it is fantastic.

The atmosphere the movie brings with it is spot on to its video game counterpart which was top notch to begin with. See this film and send a message that this is what studios should be investing in. Films made by directors with a real passion to make a great film instead of cashing in on a name with a disappointing movie which hold no regard to the source its derived from. Go see Silent Hill..and enjoy your stay."
"yakumichan","8","2","4","21 April 2006"," A faithful adaptation
","I walked into Silent Hill this morning with many preconceived notions in my head. The characters should be this, and the town should look like that, and the story should convey both salvation and damnation at the same time. Luckily, the film contains a balance of the elements I expected and new additions to the Silent Hill mythology I'd hoped for. There are times when the movie deviates from the focus of your attention, causing a bit of a lull and a desire to return to the action. If Silent Hill were solely meant to be a horror flick, such respites would be unwelcome. In this case, however, they are necessary to flesh out the story. At its core, Silent Hill is meant to be a psychological journey. The macabre imagery is meant to augment the experience--not sustain it. Though I believe the underlying mystery of the town could have been explained a bit further, the movie remained true to the game in leaving you to figure out some things for yourself. Using the music from the games was an excellent decision and the entire atmosphere of the film is spot on. There are even a few humorous moments and subtle nods to fans of the series. Overall I was very impressed and believe this film to be the most faithful and well done game-to-movie adaptation that I've seen."
"flutter_bi2230","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," excellent adaptation
","This is by far, the best video game-to-film adaptation out there. By far. It's not even close. Forget ""Doom"" or anything directed by Uwe Boll. This film is the real deal. And while it's not a classic, it's certainly an effective piece of horror.<br/><br/>I think that a lot will be made about how the Pyramid-Head plays such a small role in the film. Well...something tells me that we'll see more of him in future installments, if this film does well. What you do see of him in the film, is pretty hard to forget. The only other minor quibble I have is that Sean Bean's side of the story could probably have been done a little better, but that's easy for us to say. A lot of fans may have liked to have seen his side of the story chopped altogether, but I totally disagree. We need a break from Silent Hill from time to time. It's an intense place, and if the whole film had taken place there, it would have been hard to keep the suspense up, without having the film drag. It'll be interesting to see how future installments are handled.<br/><br/>The story starts simply enough, but gets just complicated enough to where you have to think about what is going on a bit. Alessa (the little girl) does explain things towards the end of the movie, but you still have to piece together what happened in your mind.<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly excellent. Sean Bean is fine in his role, he does what he can with it. Radha Mitchell is an excellent, underrated actress. And she turns what is kind of a one-note character into something more. And Alice Krige. Wow. Let's just say that she gets the death scene of a lifetime towards the end of the film. She is simply marvelous. I would like to see her in films more often. She brings so much class to projects like this.<br/><br/>This film has a lot of parallels with the original Silent Hill game for the PS1. The story I would like to see Gans take on next is Silent Hill 2 for the PS2, which is by far the best Silent Hill game that was made. And a truly haunting story that would translate very well to film.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you call yourself a fan of the horror genre, you owe it to yourself to check this film out. There have been better ones made, but this is definitely one of the better ones."

But to my pleasant surprise i left the cinema thinking...Damn, that was worth it. Radha Mitchell puts in a good performance as the mother searching for her daughter in a truly terrifying situation. Jodelle Ferland is suitably creepy and innocent at the same time. However The Pyramid Head is EASILY the best thing in the film, VERY disturbing and pretty much something you don't want stalking you at night!

"Slimjimgrim","10","2","4","21 April 2006"," Best video game adaptation to dateA must see and will not disappoint!
","I have to admit that when I first heard that a Silent Hill movie was in the workings, I had my doubts. To date, movies based off of video games havewellbeen awful (i.e. Doom, Resident Evil I and II  all movies that failed to capture the best elements of the original video game). However, unlike video game based movies of the past, this movie has been made with the close supervision of Konami (the company behind the Silent Hill series). This really shows in the film.<br/><br/>I was completely surprised when I saw the movie because the movie surpassed my expectations. I have played Silent Hill back when it was on PlayStation so I am somewhat familiar with its interesting and bizarre storyline. Director Christophe Gans did a fantastic job of portraying the Silent Hill world that has made the video game series a success. The hardest part of any video game based movie is taking the best elements of the game and making them come to life on screen. Christophe essentially did this with Silent Hill by taking some of the greatest aspects of the game and using them throughout the film. The music is by Jeff Danna and Akira Yamaoka (who originally composed music for the video game series) really set the mood of the film and transformed the atmosphere into one that is both disturbing and creepy. There are times that this movie will give you chills and I am not just saying that as a cliché. I was very impressed with the atmosphere that was created in the film. Yes, CGI is used but it is blended really well into the movie to create that Silent Hill chilling effect.<br/><br/>I can see why people may be confused with the plot but I think that is the entire purpose of it. The town of Silent Hill is a mystery and you are not suppose to know what is truly going on. Perhaps that is the greatest element of the video game series because it is that uncertainty that really makes Silent Hill frightening. As far as for that person who said that this movie was the worst movie everI have no clue what he is talking about or how he can even make that comment. Even if you haven't played the video game or know nothing about the original plot, this movie should entertain you. I saw the sneak peek of this movie and I definitely observed people being freaked out as the film developed. Overall, this film is a must see (whether you are a fan of the series or is just someone being introduced to the storyline for the first time) and is by far my favorite movie of the year."

"padddy5","5","0","0","10 November 2018"," Accurate to the first Silent Hill game, but shares its flaws
","Everyone knows Silent Hill 2 (the game) is the best one. It's a timeless classic, about a man's search for his dead wife in the mysterious, fog shrouded and monster filled town. It has a more psychological, mature and subdued tone than the other games, often almost dreamlike. It would have been a great starting point for a far better movie, but the actual Silent Hill movie, taking its inspiration mainly from the first game, is just okay.<br/><br/>A woman called Rose goes with her daughter to the town, after her daughter begins to mutter its name as she sleepwalks. But when they get to the town, Rose's daughter goes missing, and she encounters a cop called Cybil who has chased her into the town. Eventually they team up to figure out what's going on, and save the missing girl. They encounter a cult, and there's a pointless subplot about Rose's husband, played by Sean Bean, tracking Rose and his daughter down.<br/><br/>The movie more or less captures the surface-level spirit of the games, with great fog and beautifully dressed abandoned buildings. Its handling of monsters is also a cut above what it could have been. Though the CGI is often obvious, given that the monsters are so otherworldly, it doesn't matter as much as it would in a more realistic movie. And unlike the games, monsters aren't really re-used between scenes, and their intent is sometimes more ambiguous than the always-hostile creatures in the games. The acting is also quite good, especially from the young girl who plays Rose's daughter.<br/><br/>However, the movie falls down in a lot of ways. Pyramid Head is underused and lacks the ambiguity of the other monsters (he's clearly malevolent). I wish the movie subscribed to the fan theory from SH2 that Pyramid Head is a kind of helper to the main character disguised as a Big Bad (he helps James in the hospital by knocking him down, drains the water in the staircase of one of the buildings etc.) The cult is also poorly handled, with a lot of generic dialogue about ""burning the impure"" and so on. This is accurate to the first game (though the cult was much lower key than in the movie) but I wish they'd made it more subtle. It forces the entire film into a B-movie mould. The characters, though well acted, are pretty poorly drawn, and again I wished they'd ripped off SH2 more, and made the monsters/events of the town more about the main character rather than who it turns out to be about. Also, the violence is OTT and silly, another element that lowers the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>As for what the movie offers to someone who hasn't played the games: very little. Jacob's Ladder, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, and all the other things that inspired the games, are far better than this movie, so just watch (or re-watch) them instead.<br/><br/>And not to sound like a broken record, but a movie inspired by SH2 would also offer much more to the casual movie fan than this movie. Who wouldn't be intrigued by the simple premise: ""A man receives a letter from his dead wife, asking him to meet her in Silent Hill."" But a movie like what would require a maturity lacking from his one. A movie like that exists only in my restless dreams..."

","Hardly, does a video-game adaptation turned into a feature length film ever sound like a plausibly successful quality project. Silent Hill breaks that boundary by acquiring three well-established actors in Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean and Laurie Holden. Radha by herself delivered an outstanding performance as Rose Da Silva, a role she doesn't get near the amount of credit to which she deserves. Her believability on screen and glowing presence, just totally carried the film, I really couldn't say enough. Another aspect of the film that was endearing is it seemed the story stayed true to itself as if it was in the video game. The faceless creatures were downright terrifying, and Pyramid Head was certainly intimidating. Barring some unnecessarily dragged out scenes and confusing dialogue towards the end, the film Silent Hill is a good sleeper film that delivered a solid story and enjoyable time watching."
"darkreignn","7","0","0","11 April 2018"," An incredible adaption, and a truly amazing film
","""Silent Hill,"" directed by Christophe Gans, who manages to build a convincing and believable mythos by giving viewers enough information to ponder and chew on without discouraging them from further research or speculation to find out more, is a consistently interesting and very effective psychological horror film that will keep you locked in and engaged throughout its entire runtime.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: a little girl by the name of Sharon continuously gets horrific nightmares, and while she is sleeping, she screams out the name of a town, named Silent Hill. Her mother, Rose, in an attempt to find out why her daughter keeps having bad dreams while screaming this town's name, decides to take her daughter there.<br/><br/>It's a straightforward premise, but the film's sense of mystery and dread works so well, and the history and world building of the movie is so effective, that you can't help but be completely captivated and wonder what in the world is going to happen next.<br/><br/>One thing that makes this movie very effective is its set design; it truly is spectacular, looking eerie and hellish for the most part, but full of life when it needs to be. However, what really makes the set design so fantastic is the way the film utilizes it for its visual storytelling. For example, at one point Rose visits an abandoned school that stands dusty and derelict, but on the inside is rich in its history and visual storytelling. Religious quotes preaching vengeance are engraved in the wall of the school, the word ""witch"" is carved on the surface of a student's desk, and a dead janitor is found tied up with barbed wire inside of a bathroom stall, his body twisted and contorted in impossible ways. These sights, taken separately, are all sickening in their own right, and they will make your stomach churn, but you'll find yourself unwilling to look away because of the wealth of information about the town that you'll be getting from witnessing them. However, once these things combine together to form coherency, that is when your blood will really start to boil as the horrifying truth about Silent Hill comes to light.<br/><br/>When it comes to storytelling in general, though, ""Silent Hill"" starts to falter. The way that the stories are conveyed by the clever use of setting and of the different images that are being shown is smart as it lets the audience slowly piece together the story and come to their own conclusions about what is going on. If the film would have left it at that, it would've been a brilliant example of a movie where viewers actually have to watch attentively and pay close attention to what they are being shown if they want to grasp the narrative and understand the story. ""Silent Hill"" feeds us information little by little, in such a way that you really wouldn't know what you are seeing is important until after you've already seen the film, and this is a good thing, as it encourages further viewings to pick up on things that you wouldn't have noticed or fully understood the first time. Unfortunately, one scene of obvious exposition does take you out of the film, as it comes completely out of nowhere and doesn't fit into the method of storytelling that the film was previously conveying. The information that is being explained is necessary for viewers to understand the story, but such a jarring scene should've been kept on the cutting room floor and it really does feel like the producers pushed the director to put that scene in, because it goes against the clever visual storytelling that every scene prior has. But, this was a major studio release, and without the exposition the audience would most likely not have understood what was going on, but it does feel mildly insulting that the studio didn't think that the audience could've figured things out on their own.<br/><br/>While there is the exposition scene that is incredibly jarring and, in this reviewer's opinion, unnecessary, and some cringe inducing dialogue and spotty acting, these things do not detract from the unique horror experience that this film offers. ""Silent Hill"" is a very effective psychological horror film that utilizes clever visual storytelling and that isn't afraid to demand its audience to pay attention and think while they are witnessing the events unfold. If you're looking for a film that crawls under your skin, sickens your stomach, and builds a sense of mystery within you that will keep you invested and guessing throughout, then look no further than ""Silent Hill."""

","Intrigued by a ghost town that her daughter keeps mentioning in her sleep, a concerned mother drives there and finds herself contending with monsters that may or may not be real when her daughter goes missing in this moody horror film. 'Silent Hill' is atmospheric right from the get-go and much of its nightmarish imagery leaves an indelible impression, but adapted from a popular video game, the film never quite gels as a cohesive narrative. While evidently desperate to stop her daughter sleepwalking, Radha Mitchell's protagonist is rather hard to relate to; her decision to break down fences to take her daughter to a town full of toxic fumes never once seems rational, and it is all her own fault that her daughter gets lost. There are some creepy moments to be had as she goes in and out of abandoned, dilapidated buildings for quite a while, but it is not until around 90 minutes in that the film bothers to try to explain any of the bizarre happenings, and when it does, it comes in the form of a monologue that goes on for minutes on end. In short, the mythology of the movie is too complex for its own good. The special effects ridden scenes in the final quarter of the movie also pale against the suggestiveness of the initial shots of the town. 'Silent Hill' has at least a couple of good scares and the music and set design are first-rate, but as a narrative, it comes up a little short."
"filipemanuelneto","6","0","0","5 February 2017"," A good horror movie with lamentable script failures.
","This movie is inspired by a popular video game, which immediately sounds alarms in my head. But I took a chance and I was surprised by the positive. It's not the best horror movie I've seen, but for anyone who does not know the original game, it's intense. The action takes place in Silent Hill, a ruined village that was abandoned in a hurry after a serious environmental incident, and is now haunted by powerful and cruel supernatural entities linked to the village's past. Here, a young mother searches for her missing daughter, knowing only that she went there. The story begins brilliantly and gets better and better as we watch the succession of scary events at that location. It is as if there is a dark and scary alter-ego of the village that only appears at night. The creatures that are coming up are truly the product of nightmares. By day, it's all quiet but wrapped in permanent, stubborn haze. More frightening, impossible. Of course, the film is packed with stately and well-crafted CGI, just like the sound effects. The script, however, lacks solidity and there are several plot holes that the film simply ignores, leaving unexplained to try to tell a totally ridiculous story involving witches. At a certain point, the whole story of the film can only endure if we ignore the incongruities and focus exclusively on what we are seeing. Radha Mitchell gives life to the main character, the mother who seeks her daughter, but does so in such a forced and implausible way that we can only conclude that it was a mistake to put her in that character. Jodelle Ferland gave life to Sharon and her alter-ego Alessa, the great villain. For such a young actress is undoubtedly a test of versatility, but let's face it, they were not very difficult characters. Sean Bean also appears in the film, but his character is so absurdly misused that the actor ends up almost like figuration."

","These days it is very rare that a decent movie is made on a popular video game. In the past many have succeeded and many have failed. Films such as 'street fighter' and 'mortal kombat didn't manage to make cash roll at the box office. The technique behind making a good film is knowing how to present it on screen. A good budget, story and acting are all essential. And appropriate gci if required. This is why 'Silent Hill' was a success. It had all the ingredients that fans of the Knonami game demanded. The theme of the movie is what mainly Asian horror is renowned for. Psychological horror aspects combined with themes of guilt, revenge and salvation is what the movie is about. I was immediately reminded of films like 'Oldboy'. <br/><br/>The director Christopher Gans has done a good job in the making of the film. He has managed to display visuals in a realistic manner and integrating computer graphics to give a haunting atmosphere in the film. All aspects of the game are involved in the story. As stated earlier this is more of a mystery psychological horror. And the viewer is led on a journey to discovering why the main protagonist's daughter has disappeared to. At certain moments I could not help but feel that there were pacing issues. With a running time of 20 hours, the film sure does tend to progress slowly. The second half also feels like a separate film as it turns towards venturing in to the occult. If you have a lot of time on your hands and as well managing to stay concentrated on the screen without being disturbed, then this is certainly worth seeing."

","A creepy dark story that captures you from the beginning to end. I have never played the game, but the DVD extras helps the viewer so much if their confused. The movie is about a mother and daughter who travel to Silent Hill, West Virginia, from Ohio. Radha Mitchell(Rose), is a mother trying to get help/ answers for her daughter, Sharon(Jodelle Ferland). Before they arrive Rose and Sharon get into a car accident, near Silent Hill. A Brahms police officer, Cybil Bennett(Laurie Holden); Is also involved in the wreck. Bennett followed them to Silent Hill, and pulled Rose over because she was concerned for the child's welfare.
After the crash Rose follows a child who looks exactly like Sharon in the town of Silent Hill. Once there Rose is plunged into this strange world of Silent Hill's past. Eventually, Bennett catches up with her and both are plunged into a purgatory type world . Meanwhile Chris(Sean Bean), Rose's husband comes to Silent hill in search of his wife. Once there he meets a Brahms police officer, Gucci(Kim Coats). Gucci explains Silent Hill's past to Chris while searching for Rose, and Sharon. While searching for Rose, Chris seems to sense his wife's presence; but can't find her. Gucci thinks Chris has become hysterical. While Rose, Sharon, and Officer Bennett are in the gray world of Silent Hill. It seems like Chris and Gucci are in present of Silent Hill.Gucci goes on to explain about the coal fire's that still burn some 30 years later, and about the radicals that would have town meetings. They were like the towns cultist with a fanatical leader, Christabella(Alice Kruig. They would meet in the early 70's and try to purge the evil from Alissa, because she was the only child without a father. Christabella would try to get answers from Alissa's mother, Dahlia(Debra Kara Unger), on the father. When it flashes back to the 70's when Alissa was young,you see, the taunts, the fires, and the rituals that were done to Alessia and Dahlia. While Rose and Bennett are in the gray part of Silent Hill, they meet Christabella and the radicals. Rose escapes their wrath while Bennett is eventually sacrificed. When Rose meets Alissa, she is amazed by the likeness between her and Sharon. The only way Rose can escape Silent Hill's dark world is to learn about Alissa, the dark past of the town, and some of town's ritualistic members and their ways.<br/><br/>I love this psychological thriller, the story is different and can be confusing. The history of Silent Hill's past and present, and what the monster's represent is very interesting. I even had to do a little research on the Movie on the net concerning this. The only thing I found odd about the movie was the time-line. Alissa has to be Sharon's birth mother; but there is a plot hole concerning this. Also if Officer Gucci was one of the officer's during the burning back in the 70's why hasn't he aged? The ending was strange, even though Rose and Sharon escaped Silent Hill, they are still trapped a purgatory state. Yes, this movie had some minor flaws; but it is still one of the better horror films of the 21st Century."

"samuelprime","6","0","0","30 October 2015"," The Good's and Bad's of Silent Hill.
","The Silent Hill Movie isn't exactly a good piece of media (In a movie sense), although it was a decent attempt at a Video Game Move. The original Silent Hill Game (PS1) was an amazingly successful game which focused on a more psychosocial approach, rather than a straight out violent approach which games like Resident Evil were doing at the time. This was a risky move as the developers didn't think general audiences would appreciate the settings which the game was trying to envelop. The thing that made the Silent Hill Game rememberable and revolutionary for Horror was that it was more of a feeling, an emotional state. It provided players with something different & unique. It Showed things, rather than explained things (This is one thing the movie does wrong).<br/><br/>First of all, the setting and the general location of 'Silent Hill' is spot on. It resembles the Video Game incredibly well. The music is also commendably. It uses some of the music from the remarkable soundtrack which made the game even more amazing. All the music suits every location, action, etc that is taking place. The characters are decent, they don't really resemble the characters from the game, but are crafted in such a way that makes you actually occasionally care and fear for them. The script is sometimes laughably bad, it just feels rushed together. The 'Monsters' truly mirror the actual monsters from the Game. Most of the time they look scary, and they actually feel like they belong where they are. They don't feel like they're randomly placed there. They look and feel like they have evolved through out time with Silent Hill (The Location) its self. The Plot/Story is where this movie goes wrong... One of the whole reasons the game was so successful was because it didn't explain much, it just did it. So the movie try's to explain everything. We never needed to know the back story, it was incredible enough. Like I said it wasn't good in the sense of a movie. The only reason I rate it a '6' is because throughout it stays true the the actual setting (Including monsters, music, etc) of the game. It just try's too hard to explain it. The story explanation was unnecessary, it doesn't feel like the true Silent Hill."
"aserpentperplexed","7","0","0","21 October 2015"," Mostly Good, With One Big Mistake
","I am a fan of the Silent Hill games. I loved the games' ability to create an overwhelming feeling of suspense, fearing what is behind the fog and yet always being driven towards it. There has always been a psychological aspect to the games, not just in how it plays on the very human fear of the unknown, but also in how the events and creatures that exist in the games reflect the psyche of the main character. Or do they? The thing that made these games stand out for me compared to other games in the horror genre is their unique approach to the blurring of the psychological and the supernatural. That's not to say other games don't do this, just that the way in which Silent Hill does this is a little bit different, it is used to instill a sense of dread and curiosity. I usually found myself thinking a lot about the games afterward, interpreting the plot through a psychological or philosophical lens (although admittedly I try to do that with many games and movies). Part of this also has to do with the fact that many of these games were made to be open to interpretation. There is a vagueness as to the characters and creatures' motivations, but there is enough in the game for you to build off of and form your own interpretation.<br/><br/>This is where I think this film has its one failing. For the most part, the film is pretty good. Without any spoilers, the plot and characters are mostly made from different pieces of the first three Silent Hill games. This is then combined with some new ideas to create a story that is still very Silent Hill, but is also its own unique story separate from any of the games. The casting was done well, all of the actors really seemed to fit well in their roles. No one seemed out of place, and they mostly did a pretty good job acting. And let's be honest: the acting here is at the least better than some of the voice acting in the English dubs of the Silent Hill games, which usually weren't top notch. The visual effects, including the fog/ash and the creatures, were all done well and utilized well to create that feeling of suspense and dread and intrigue.<br/><br/>Where the movie falls apart is near the end. Spoiler-free, a character shrouded in mystery that is pivotal to the plot decides to basically explain their entire back story and how each piece of it relates to events depicted earlier in the movie. This basically removes all the mystery and suspense the movie had built up in one big reveal. It makes explicit everything that should have been left open for interpretation. I feel that unfortunately this important aspect of what makes Silent Hill different and unique was destroyed by this moment. Why did they do this? Did they really just not get that aspect of what made Silent Hill great? Or did they have a test audience full of people who just don't want to think and use their brains and wanted an ending where every detail is explained and laid out for them? On top of this, the explanation that is given for everything is, well, unfortunately pretty generic. It is one that is full of horror clichés, which further removes the identity and individuality this film could have had.<br/><br/>This film could have stood out as something unique in the body of psychological horror films. It at the very least stands out among video game based films, with the only horror rival being the Resident Evil series. But Resident Evil always favored action over thought, both in the games and in the movies. I hoped that Silent Hill would succeed in bringing a little more depth and subtly to the big screen to contrast this, and to do it well. And while they definitely tried, it seems like they chickened out at the last second, and the result is a good film that could have been so much more."

","Don't come to this for any other reason than doom-laden atmospheres in an abandoned town where a girl has been lost and a mysterious siren blares come nightfall, signaling nightmare. Come to it because film for you - and horror - is about exploration in the dark. <br/><br/>Much has been made about how it's confusing to follow, even by serious critics. I'm perplexed at this. It's fantasy, which means you'll have to accept things as you discover them to be, shifts in fathoming, here that we have drifted into this other realm roamed by monsters.<br/><br/>Two things remain to be said. One is that it was originally a video game, they tried to translate as best they could. I find that it works well, even in surrogate form, bringing it in line with the essence of Gothic horror where power of persuasion was derived from someone exploring an old dark house with a candelabra at hand while floors creaked and not the story of explanations about why or where you really 'are'; horror must confound questions of being and psychology.<br/><br/>The other is that Freud has bedeviled horror for too long. We see the wide penetration of mechanistic Freudian thinking every time we see in a horror film some other psychic or supernatural realm someone must enter to apprehend traumatizing evil, no need to look further than Insidious and that whole slew of films that goes back to Poltergeist. Stephen King's whole trade. Texas Chainsaw offered a radically more powerful conception on the other end, and so did Blairwitch, but I harp on this in other comments.<br/><br/>Suffice here to say that horror is a mode of persuasion that floors are creaking as we sense, and here I get the separate twilight zone (a husband subplot to reinforce it) and a story that explains stuff about the elders of the town and a horrible secret from a dark past, repressed and surfacing, all of which don't do much in its favor. In the original format questions of order surely vanished in the air of playing through evil that envelops, or perhaps impressed in a different way, but all told this is ambitious work that retains enough of that gloomy submersion to make haunting spill over, horror I endorse over most of what comes out. The game must have been a trip to play."

","""Silent Hill"" works in a lot of ways, with a creepy atmosphere, unsettling sets and good cinematography at first, but the ending is where the film stops working. It's about a woman named Rose who takes her adoptive daughter to a mysterious town named Silent Hill. 9-year-old Sharon has been mumbling things about this place in her sleep and exploring the little girl's past seems like a good idea since she's adopted and clearly troubled. Unfortunately, when Rose and Sharon arrive in the town, everything turns into a nightmare. The two are separated and while Rose tries to find her daughter she discovers that the town is overrun by hideous creatures. The surviving inhabitants of Silent Hill have gone mad and scramble to survive while avoiding the bizarre semi hourly transformations between the now ruined town and a place straight out of hell. To escape it appears that Rose will have to find out the secrets of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The film is set up like a horror survival video game (which is pretty appropriate considering the source material), with the protagonist finding herself in a location she can't escape, hopelessly outmatched by creatures that seemingly come out of nowhere and running around trying to piece together what is going on. She's trying to figure out how the town of Silent Hill became the way it is, how to escape and where her daughter has disappeared to. Unfortunately, the film doesn't follow through on the premise and there is little actual detective work in the end. You expect our protagonist to run around dodging the locals and the creatures, interrogating and investigating but we simply get an explanation of the events instead of having the protagonist (and the audience) piece it together from clues. Another oddity is that for long periods of time the strange creatures disappear almost entirely from the film. Despite the 2hr+ running time, there's not that much monster horror in this creepy monster movie. It feels like the story was cobbled together from way too many sources and not having played the games, I can only theorize that this is the case. As mentioned earlier, the further the film goes along, the less it becomes suspenseful or frightening. The creepy visuals that were often subtle slowly disappear and are replace with a gigantic set piece that tries but isn't impressive. When we are served the explanation for what is going in Silent Hill, the background stories and the characters delivering them are so broad they're laughable. It's a big disappointment even if you are not familiar with the games because you know there's got to be a ton of material that has been carefully expanded upon and developed over the years; there's no way this nonsense turned into a franchise of video games.<br/><br/>There are a lot of good elements in ""Silent Hill"" and if you're a fan of the games, you'll probably like the movie. It's not all bad, but it doesn't live up to the potential it displays at the beginning and is ultimately a disappointment. (Dvd, October 4, 2012)"

","The Silent Hill video game series has become a household name in its ability to captivate audiences with its symbolism, characterization, dark and at times gruesome subject matter, interesting and complex monster designs, among other things. <br/><br/>This film is a loose adaption of Silent Hill 2, with some major changes present including the main character being gender-swapped and the cult's antics being in the forefront of the movie (I believe you are shown a bit more in Silent Hill and Silent Hill 3 than Silent Hill 2, the latter being more of a ""this is what happened before the game takes place"" where the former two are occurring as you play). <br/><br/>Now, knowing perfectly well what occurs in the games, the scenes felt a little...short at times, not stilted exactly, but a few extra seconds, a bit...more in some scenes could have made it seem more fluid. Now to me the story and execution of said story deserves perhaps 5 stars, but the scenery and sets and CGI warrant an extra star simply because how raw and absolutely life-like it all looked. The abandoned and rotting buildings *look* abandoned and rotting and not something..kitschy or overly dramatic. The wheezy clunking of the rusty machinery in the Other World were artfully recreated in the film and while not exactly *pleasant* to the eye in a traditional sense, were still gratifying to see on screen. There's something satisfying in this odd disintegrating, stripped-away mechanical heart of an alternate universe that is blanketed over by a somber 'reality'.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was beautiful and hit all the right moments, adding to the atmosphere and never sticking its head out too much that I didn't focus what was playing out. <br/><br/>I really have nothing to say on the acting. It wasn't bad. James Sunderland of the Silent Hill 2 video game was disjointed and lifeless, and that would have made for a pretty bad character in a movie, so his gender bent stand-in Rose played the part of a concerned and yet level-headed mother very well.<br/><br/>I will say that I was both saddened and frustrated by the ending. Aaaagh, why couldn't they be reunited?! Despite the husband's limited screen time, I still was hoping that the family would join up again. It's not fair. Damn you, Silent Hill!<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series, don't be too disappointed. The video game script and storyline wouldn't have been able to be translated effectively onto the big screen, please don't delude yourself into thinking otherwise. While I think some bits were sort of ""You didn't really need that"" (Pyramid Head, for example, and the over-the-top death scenes in the finale) overall the film promotes a sort of underlying dread within the viewer while titillating the eye with the visuals of the Other World and delighting the ear with the moody and varied soundtrack. It isn't hard to follow if you're completely new to the series, but the one-off characters such as Pyramid Head will probably make you want to research more about the franchise and learn the more intricate story that can be found in the video games."

Rose decides to go to Silent Hill in an attempt to find answers, but unfortunately finds herself caught up in a living hell.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is one of the much better attempts of the game-to-film adaptations. One of the best aspects of the film is the atmosphere which is nothing short of excellent, especially when ""the darkness"" starts to fall and the warning that sounds out when this is about to happen. It brings about a terrific feel of claustrophobia during these scenes which just adds to the feel of the movie.<br/><br/>The photography is really good as well and brings a really creepy ghostly feel to the town of Silent Hill and the labyrinth of corridors below. The ""monsters"" are also impressive, especially the main one of Pyramid Head. Unfortunately he isn't in the movie for that long which is a shame because this character is so imposing and freaky that it would have been good to have had him in the film for longer periods. But what there is of him is good, though.<br/><br/>One of the main downsides to the movie was the casting of Sean Bean as Christopher Da Silva. Not because he himself was poor but because his American accent was. This is one of those annoying things that movie makers do and is a pet peeve of mine. Instead of getting an American to play the part, they get an actor who is from Yorkshire which is one of the strongest English accents you can get. Anyway, I generally don't mind Sean Bean, but his accent was just a bit off-putting and his own accent still comes through a bit too much. He isn't in the movie for too long at any one period so fortunately it doesn't ruin the feel of the movie too much.<br/><br/>All in all, Silent Hill is a very decent movie to watch. Sit back with the sound up and with the lights off for a much better feel. Definitely recommended."

Also I prefer 'horror' movies with a bit of depth and not just to make the viewer jump out of their seat.<br/><br/>I'm familiar with the first Silent Hill game. I remember it being slightly disorientating, eerie and odd - and this movie definitely lives up to this. However, I found the film as a whole disappointing.<br/><br/>The beginning is done with such pace that it's hard really to understand why they want to go to Silent Hill in the first place (If I had a kid who sleep walked while frantically shouting the name of a place I wouldn't think ""Ah yes, this kid is terrified of something to do with this place, so I will immediately take them there"").<br/><br/>The whole cult thing is my idea of a scriptwriter who has run out of ideas and I thought this was the most disappointing aspect of the film. It takes away from the feel of everything and makes it into a typical film where it's hard to distinguish between the good side and the bad side. To me, the fun is lost.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of Sean Bean, but there is no point to his character being in the movie at all, other than to increase the run time.<br/><br/>The nurses who were meant to be moving creepily towards Rose seemed like they were just waiting for Michael Jackson to arrive so that they could get their 'Thriller' on. This took away from what was meant to be a terrifying moment and made it into a release of tension moment - completely negating what it was meant to be.<br/><br/>The part at the end where the little girl explains everything is just an onslaught of back story and should have come out gradually throughout the film - this should have been done rather than Sean Bean being in the movie.<br/><br/>Pyramid Head ripping off the woman's skin is easily the best and most memorable part of the film and I'm a bit surprised he isn't in it more.<br/><br/>The ending is fine and maybe the second best moment as you can't help but feel a little sad that the people are so close yet so far away."

With Virtually No Contrast to the Real World for the Horror to be Horrifying and Some Parental Behavior that will Distract Your Attention, but that's OK because there is Plenty of Time to Wonder Back into this Murky Movie.<br/><br/>Overlong, at Over Two Hours, this is a Bloated Bore and the Atmosphere of Atrophy Wears Out Quickly.

","(56%) Unlike Super Mario bros, Street fighter, Doom, most of the Resident evil series, well pretty much every video game movie, this at least has some real connection with its source materiel. And although I'm no fan of the game, the tone, visuals, monsters, concepts all have the spooky feel that made the game a hit. The movie though is a bit forgettable and over-long, and the overuse of CGI monsters and general effects is a little excessive which takes away from the quite intense and really quite scary scenes. As a horror this is a decent spook show, and as a video game movie it's really quite good, maybe even the best of the lot, although with that said the competition overall is less than impressive."

About the direction of this movie I have to say that Christophe Gans made a really great job.

"grintemcstinger","6","0","0","10 July 2014"," A step in the right direction, but...
","Being a fan of the Silent Hill games myself and knowing that a lot of fans had nothing but praise for the movie, I had good hopes this one would be finally it - the proof that great movies can be made based on video games. Resident Evil and Silent Hill I though would be good movie material; all one had to do is to produce the uneasy and intense atmosphere they had, but after the Resident Evil-adaptation failed so hard to even grasp what the (early) RE games were about and instead went it's own trashy action route with some minor RE stuff thrown in just so they can call it ""Resident Evil"", I had some reservations for Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Well, my concerns in that regard proved to be unnecessary. Very much unlike the Resident Evil movie, the makers took the material serious and they really stayed true to it. The town looks spot on, the music is mostly from the game, there's the thick fog, the rusty and bloody other dimension, the sirens, the nurses, some famous scenes are replicated from the game with the exact same angle-shots... you get the point. It takes some liberties, especially with the characters, but always in just the right amounts and it felt more or less justified. However, where the movie succeeded with being faithful to the game, it never managed to do something truly great with it. For once the movie explains too much and as a result demystifies a lot of things that would've been better left to the viewers imagination. It explains for example that the whole town shifts to another dimension where the ""real"" world can't reach it. It even goes so far to show how the people outside Silent Hill acknowledge and react to it. In the game that was never explained and it was never clear wherever the main character just had his own nightmare, is going insane, entered a cursed town or another dimension altogether. It also explains the sirens, which is just a minor detail, but again killed something that was far more interesting when left unexplained and used for symbolism. Another example would be Pyramid head. The movie is by far not as ambiguous as the games were and its truly a shame that they went that way.<br/><br/>Another problem I found with this adaptation was the pacing, and this is where I've noticed that a movie would have it hard to do it justice. Silent Hill games are, just the like the name implies, most of the time quiet and have a slow pace. The game every now and then serves you a tiny bit of story, and then lets you wander around the town uncovering bit for bit of the sad and horrible truth. These moments in-between storytelling allow the player to let them sink-in, giving them more weight which is even further amplified by disturbing symbolism and clever level design. The adaptation omits this by having a rather faster, event-to-event pace. This makes things feel a little rushed and cramped, although to be fair, was still pulled off decently, however some of the mood is lost in favor to some adrenaline-fueled thrills.<br/><br/>Speaking of the mood; the movie manages to capture the sinister and sadistic aspects of the game. Its quite astonishing how it depicts evil minds, making me feel almost angered about it. There are some truly wicked scenes which definitely are memorable, but on the other hand it never reaches the more subtle, psychological aspects the games are famous for. It's also really explicit.<br/><br/>Is has a few corny moments and dialog, but they didn't bother me much. Acting is decent for the most time. There are a few scenes where its bad but I guess that has more to do with the writing part, because I couldn't honestly imagine someone doing a better job in these certain scenes. Not a big deal, really. I also would've liked it to rely less on CGI and more on the practical effects, but again that's just another nit-pick.<br/><br/>So is it the best video-adaptation yet? Perhaps, but that's not saying a lot. Is it truly a great movie? No, sadly not. It's ""just"" OK. As far as staying true to the material and not sucking, it most surely has the best ratios. It is notable that effort went into this one and that they actually bothered to play and understand the game, but despite that some things were unluckily compensated and/or could've just been done better. It did not match the uneasy feeling I had while playing the games and never felt as personal to the main character. Still, what's there is far better than any of the Resident Evil life-action movies or Uwe Boll works and I really wanted to rate it higher than I did. If anything it is the best example that shows that there is potential in video-game adaptations when approached serious and without cash-grab intentions only, it just needed more polish. It gets a 6.5 out of 10 from me."

","Silent Hill is one oddball movie. That said, it's creepy, suspenseful, horrific at times, and all in all, enjoyable.

You just want to see that religious bitch get it from the first moment she's on screen, and boy when she does, it's well worth the wait.<br/><br/>I have played the video game, but didn't complete it, as I got stuck in a loop and couldn't get out of it, and got extremely frustrated. That's why I didn't see the movie right away, I was kind of annoyed with Silent Hill.<br/><br/>This is typically not my type of movie. Yes, I like horror flicks, but this is so far-fetched and unrealistic that normally I would steer clear. But I just so happened to watch this one, and it was not bad at all. Worth a view. 7/10"
"theperfectmarysuekiller","10","0","0","18 April 2014"," Despite flaws, it is a good movie
","I am surprised by how good it turned out to be. Originally, I gave it a 5.5, thinking that it was OK, but didn't really scare me that much and left me feeling disappointed. It went up to a 7 because I liked the story, atmosphere and it actually was scary thinking back on it. Also, it managed to be scary without a single jump scare. That alone is pretty impressive. Also, I liked how the characters were set up, and how the story of Alessa was revealed. I knew nothing about the storyline beforehand and was impressed by how they managed to pull all this off. My only complaints are that the film dragged on a bit long. 15 minutes could have easily been shaved off. Also, they put Pyramid Head there for no discernible purpose other than to have him there. Maybe I missed something. All in all, it is definitely a different kind of horror movie that critics have harshly received because they most likely aren't used to horror that isn't high intensity and jump scare laden. I appreciate the film and wish there were more like it, as long as it was edited better.<br/><br/>I liked how they relayed the story of Alessa because it allows for a complex narrative. When it is revealed that things are the way they are because Alessa was nearly killed in a ritual sacrifice, the dark part of her soul manifested and created alternate worlds through her hatred. The image of the nurse she blinded with her bloody eyes is one of the best shots in the film. She is burnt because her mother sought a chance to purify her from her existence without a known father. She was never protected from the bullying of her schoolmates, and all of this contributed to her hatred. However, there was a good part of her soul left, which took the form of Rose's daughter, Sharon. In the end, Dark Alessa enters Rose to enter the church and exact her revenge on the cult. This paragraph was to sum up the plot for those who complained about the convoluted plot.<br/><br/>If you were paying attention, it was fairly easy to follow. Plus, it had a nice atmosphere and great visuals, which helped the film to be memorable. If you don't have any other horror movies to watch, than this is memorable and likable, despite it's flaws. I would definitely like to see a remake with these issues fixed, and I will see the sequel. (At my own risk, maybe I'll enjoy it.)"

","As a game adaptation film this is apparently very good, however I haven't played the game so I'll have to judge this on its merits as a stand alone theatrical production.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a mystery horror film. The mystery is sort of interesting and sort of compelling, till it's all mostly revealed near the end and we find that the driving plot was really pretty silly. As for the horror aspects; it's not scary but it IS gross.<br/><br/>Visually this is a lovely film. The scenes are beautifully shot, the sets are great, and the monsters are fantastic. The scene with the jerky bodied nurses was wonderful, I kept wanting a strobe light to play over them and techno blasting in the background. The constant eerie atmosphere created by the dulled light and twilit colour worked perfectly and gave the film a ""waking dream"" feel.<br/><br/>But, the story just couldn't match the clever visuals and the child actor that played the little girl roles wasn't convincing in any of them. They'd have done better to have an adult play the demon version with the child actor miming along. All in all a good looking film, but long and with a weak story, fine acting from all except the child."

","With more and more video games being made into live action movies, I was actually afraid to see this movie, because every movie based on a video game has been butchered by their movie counter parts. Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil, and Hit-man, all good/ descent video games made into the worst possible movies imaginable. But enough about video games, let's get onto the movie review: <br/><br/>Basic Story Guide: The story focuses on Rose, Christopher, and their adopted daughter Sharon De Silva. The De Silva's are concerned about their child, because at night, Sharon sleep walks, and upon awakening, she utters the name of a town in West Virginia called Slent Hill. Rose, in an attempt to get some answers, takes Sharon to the place she keeps calling ""home."" On the way, a child steps in front of the car, causing Rose to lose control, and crash into a ditch. When Rose awakens, she discovers her daughter is missing. Now, along with the feisty police offer, Cybil Bennet, Rose must not only find her beloved daughter, but piece together what happened in Silent Hill, a past that is as black as the darkest embers from the coal fires still burning underneath this town.<br/><br/>Verdict: As the title of this review stated, I was never a fan of the video games, but I was a fan of the Resident Evil games (there is a method to my madness here so be patient). I absolutely HATED the Resident Evil movies, whereas I love this movie.<br/><br/>Visually impressive, great plot, the acting is a little overly dramatic, and the dialog itself is a little inane. Some parts in the dialog literally makes you embarrassed they even said it. But overall, enjoyable. Don't run to see this movie, but at least watch it.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"

","Coming into Silent Hill I had a small reserve for it considering most adaptations of games to film are typically poorly constructed, however I was met with surprise within the first couple minutes, more specifically when you first are introduced to the character Sharon (the daughter) who is precariously swaying on the edge of a cliff hallucinating a smoldering industrial chasm that seems to sink into a large cavern at the bottom of the cliff until she is tackled and saved from death by the main protagonist Rose. The movie is about a woman (Rose) who has adopted a child (Sharon) that seems to have some underlying psychological issues due to the fact that she frequently screams ""Silent Hill"" in her sleep. Against Rose's husband's (Christopher)will she tries to take Sharon to Silent Hill in attempts to resolve the problem but is met with a gaggle of new issues including finding Sharon after she has run off from a car accident. What made the movie is strictly the aesthetics, Cinematographer Dan Lausten and Production Designer Carol Spier truly flexed their own abilities in this film and Director Christopher Gans was definitely no slouch in keeping up with the original style, texture, and over-all theme that made the game such a success. I was also quite content that they left in a significant amount of the original composer's (Akira Yamaoka) work to help capture the essence Silent Hill while also adding some more popular and well placed songs as well (Ring of Fire by Johnny Cash.) Now of course for the bad. Unfortunately there are couple areas where the film fell short, mostly plot and dialogue. The Plot seem to have a few too many holes in it that might have been placed for interpretation, however they were clashed somewhere between crucial back stories and seemingly useless knowledge that lead to no where in the film which seems to have confused viewers that lack some background knowledge of the game. As for the dialogue, I personally wished they might have stuck to the title a little more in this regard because the dialogue is a mish-mash of non-sequiturs and pointless whining with very little substance filling lulls, so if they had say kept them a little more ""silent"" and let the visuals speak for them instead, the film might have had a better response."

","Betwixt the foggy mountains of West Virginia lies the small ghost town of Silent Hill, a hamlet where ash falls like snow, secrets lie buried, and plot holes materialize like tortured hell-spawn. The story starts ambiguously enough; a pair of doting parents search frantically for their sleepwalking daughter. Once she is found, the story fast-forwards to the mother (Radha Mitchell) driving her daughter to West Virginia. When stopped by a motorcycle cop (Laurie Holden) on the way to the titular town, mother puts the petal to the metal driving with reckless abandon towards their destination. Why the dramatics? Why isn't the husband with them? Haven't they heard of childproof locks? Who knows. Once dear ol' mother gets to the town and daughter disappears, strange, scary, and gratuitously gory things start to happen.<br/><br/>Silent Hill the video game is partially based on the real life ghost town of Centralia, PA where the town's coal mine was ignited in a fire and still smolders today; former residents described it as ""a living hell."" In all honestly I doubt there is better inspiration out there for a prime horror movie so I was puzzled and dismayed to see such a middling movie. Perhaps it was the asinine dialogue which only delineated from the usual moans and screams to explain the questionable logistics of the plot (which was like putting a square peg through a circle). Or perhaps it was the special effects which ranged from superb to laughable. Or maybe it was the lack of restraint on the part of the filmmakers. You can be scary without being gross guys, and I can think of two examples (which I won't divulge here) where they probably should have pointed the camera the other way.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the video game or a gore connoisseur in general you might find something to like in this wicked carnival ride. Maybe you'll appreciate the cavalcade of odd creatures that populate the screen or the soundtrack which was supposedly lifted from the game. But if you're one of those people who can't just shut off their brains to watch a movie, I recommend watching something a lot more stimulating.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

A cop see's the two and decides to investigate after reports of youngster's being killed in silent hill, after a high speed chase they have an accident and Rose wakes up in Silent Hill with Sharon missing. Rose uncovers various parts of what happened to the town of Silent Hill when the great coal fire happened, on a side note: Rose's husband is searching for them when they are missing. Rose also uncovers mysteries of what she thinks is Sharon but it turns out to be her mother Alessa, after they tortured kidnapped and do all sorts of other weird things to Alessa the coal fire begins and Alessa signs a deal with the devil to get revenge on all the people that destroyed her life.<br/><br/>From other reviews I'm reading, I get the feeling that a lot of people question why there is so much dialogue in the film but from what it seems, people still don't seem to know what is happening. Fans of the game will (or should) know but it's nice to see a film that requires a little brain power to figure out what's going on, I'm an adult I don't need everything spoon fed.<br/><br/>Let's clear this up, as soon as they enter Silent Hill they die. The cop the women and the girl all dead. That's why the scene at the end they are both home but they can not see each other. Now that's sorted on to the rest of it.<br/><br/>I suppose some of it didn't need explaining I know what fire is and I know what room to go to when I'm at a hotel, I don't have to reiterate that it's room 111 on my key. I suppose the acting was a little serious but it's not a comedy film so it didn't really matter, the visuals at the time were excellent. I've played the games and to be honest if the film stuck to the game 100% all the time I wouldn't of bothered seeing the movie, I would of gone and played the game (Again). Why am I paying to see someone act out a story I have seen over and over again? Story line is always a big thing for me, the film started off a little slow but once in it hit the spot. The chilling story line is developed and the scenes with Pyramid Head make you think, hope I don't meet him in a dark alley.<br/><br/>This film has a real dark ambient vibe to it, just like the game did and I think it was one of the best Video game crossovers I have ever seen, at least it stayed partially true to the game (Not like resident evil grrr) but made a film for everyone to enjoy..

","The argument over which is the best video game adaptation is a brief one to this point, as until now there are precious few even reasonable efforts available, let me put it this way: <br/><br/>90% of films based upon games SUCK! <br/><br/>The 10% of exceptions are understandably rare, I can only think of Resident Evil off the top of my head (hardly awesome by the way). Hit-man, Max Payne, Street Fighter, Mario Bros, Mortal Kombat - all lousy. (I would definitely check out a Left 4 Dead film though, that seems purpose built for adaptation.) <br/><br/>Back to Silent Hill, the game seemed to cry out for someone to take a crack at it, and while they didn't take short cuts it still feels just a little off - though not much mind you.<br/><br/>The game was all pacing, atmosphere, eerie noises, deliberately poor lighting and of course freaky creatures designed more to disturb than scare, and the main themes are all faithfully executed here.<br/><br/>The film starts with a sleepwalking kid being tracked by her parents and ultimately saved from peril at the last minute, when secured the girl, named Sharon starts babbling ""Silent Hill, SILENT HILLLL""! As this apparently has happened many times before Mum (Rahda Mitchell) is understandably concerned, and does a bit of homework before setting off on a road trip to the titular locale, without telling Hubby Christopher though. This perturbs Christopher somewhat, and he googles Silent Hill to find it has a less than normal history, so he reports a kidnapping and cancels wife Rose's credit cards - I've wanted to do the same thing to my wife many times - but for different reasons.<br/><br/>Thereafter Rose stops to get fuel and finds she has no credit, when a traffic cop checks out her number plates and discovers the kidnapping report, rather than explain herself Rose for some reason drives off from the cop and a dangerous chase in thick fog ensues. For someone gung-ho on helping her kid it seemed like a bit of a stretch that she would so soon put her and her child in danger but movie's need conflict so there we go.<br/><br/>Of course both Rose and the motorcycle cop crash, and Rose wakes up alone on the outskirts of Silent Hill, with no sign of her daughter. Abandoning the car she walks into the town to find Sharon only to find the town seemingly deserted.<br/><br/>Now the video game stuff starts. Periodically sirens ring out in the town, which is a warning to the townsfolk to get inside, shortly after the town goes from light to dark almost instantly, and after that you don't wanna be outside.<br/><br/>It's hard to explain this movie even with spoilers, but as I am determined to remain spoiler-free I'll just say that the remainder of the film involves Rose and the cop teaming up to find Sharon, and coming across both the local inhabitants who spout vaguely religious babble, and other locals who, to be honest, are all quite unique and freaky, and at times offputting.<br/><br/>The film has no major on screen violence, but there are some graphic and intense visuals. The sets, locations and special effects are all pretty top notch and add to building tone and the sense of disquiet. There is a little too much ""look at how clever we are"" camera-work, which is so obvious that it at times distracted me and momentarily took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>As with all such films the movie sets out to wrap all loose ends up, in this case in one long baffling sequence of events. I rewatched the closing scenes again to see what exactly I missed and am sure that I saw what I was supposed to, but I still can't explain why a lot of stuff happened and exactly what happened in the very last frames.<br/><br/>If this was what the filmmakers set out to achieve then I guess that's mission accomplished, if not then I must have missed something. I guess with a film that is all about ambiguity and misdirection it would make some sense to remain vague as to why and how things actually happened, but it left me feeling a little dissatisfied.<br/><br/>One thing that always gets me in these films, at one point the two leads are getting understandably frazzled and one grabs the other and says ""It's going to be OK! WE'RE going to be OK!"" As I recall this was shortly after being confronted by both a huge being wearing an enormous triangle shaped helmet and carrying an equally large hammer, and not too long after being attacked in a small room by a guy with an eight foot sword that can plunge through a metal door! This struck me as more glass half-full than I would be feeling in this situation! Aside from the notably cool closing credits, what impressed me most wasn't so much the film even, but the effort that went in to making an honest to goodness movie. This is no el-cheapo knockoff spat out to make a few bucks from people who don't blink before shelling out $90 on a game, it was a realistic attempt to make something faithful to the source material yet entertaining in its own right. The acting was solid, the production values far beyond most similar flicks and the plot while flawed, at least strived to remain plausible.<br/><br/>Points for effort. One knock though, 125 minutes of largely running around in the mist is just too long! Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. A great example of mood and tone over actual plot and action. This is worth a look and at the very least tries to remain interesting.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","""Congratulations, Rose. You're here. You did it. Your reward is the truth."" <br/><br/>It's not often that video game movies succeed in being entertaining while also keeping in the spirit of what made that particular game successful in the first place, but Silent Hill pulls it off as well as any other attempt that I've seen. It works not only as a game adaptation, but as a horror movie, as well.<br/><br/>I remember seeing it in the theater with a rather large group of friends, and we all (and most of the audience) were pretty freaked out by it. It's not nearly as frightening after repeated viewings, but the spooky atmosphere and perverse creatures remain effective. It certainly helps to know about the mythology of the town and the characters, but not exactly necessary. You'll still get most of what the movie is about. <br/><br/>The pacing is deliberately slow at times, because like the games, the focus is on building almost unbearable atmospheric tension (aided by fantastic music lifted directly from the games). This goes hand in hand with the surreal, terrifying sets and the oppressive darkness that falls upon the town when the nightmare creatures appear. You may find yourself cringing every time you hear the sirens (like I did), wary of what kind of horror Rose (played by the gorgeous Radha Mitchell) is about to have to face next. <br/><br/>On the negative side, the script is incredibly clunky, at times. Stilted and obvious dialogue occasionally draws the viewer out of the movie, and a bit more subtlety would also have been welcome. The villains really are almost comically evil. It's hard to imagine that even they believe that what they're doing isn't horrible.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a gory, intense, nightmare of a movie. Just as a film adaptation of this property should be. It's proof that good results can occur when a video game is treated as more than just an easy cash-grab and is adapted competently."

","One of the things I found good about this film was the opening sequence where a woman driving with a daughter is approached by a female motorcycle cop and queried about if the girl with her is really a daughter. I think that the director caught an element of paranoia that does seem to exist at some levels in terms of how some Police view ordinary citizens. In the film, a dimensional rift opens up, so the cop following the woman and daughter, and the woman and daughter, are all shunted off into another version of Earth, causing the causality chain to be broken, changing what would happen next, since the motorcycle cop was following the woman driving with a daughter, with a view to ""throwing a spanner into the works of a crime in progress"", when there was no crime in progress. The film asks the question, how far is too far?...where local law enforcement is concerned, among other things. I think it is an abysmal thing to do to another human being. I think similar things might also occur in the world pertaining to single parent families, consisting of a father and a son, or a mother and a daughter. If the son or daughter are teens, that could be really, really, ugly. Not only would someone in law enforcement be accusing an older person of being a paedophile, they would be accusing them of being a gay paedophile,and intern they would also be labelling a younger person ""gay and into older people of the same sex"". The invention of the atomic bomb has nothing on what that could do. Personally, I think the female motorcycle cop in Silent Hill crossed the line, and for her dumbness she ended up being a human torch, later on in the film. Lots of thrills and chills and a good ending that I will not give away. Maybe a bit graphic here and there. More than anything, I think the film portrays how our ""good society"" is sometimes like being trapped on The Bounty, with Captain Bligh spouting venal clap trap and calling it brainy."

","The very first thing you'll notice in this film (if you played the games) is that they absolutely nailed the look of the games, the look of the town was perfectly recreated in the film, sadly the biggest flaw of the movie(in my opinion at least) comes from the movie's reliance on copying everything from the game, while this worked perfectly for the look of the town on the other hand the story, monsters and some characters are pulled right out of the games, the problem with this, is that in the games the town (i have a lot of trouble trying to explain this) ""creates"" everything for the people that end up there making them face their own sins and errors in the form of characters and monsters(something expertly handled in the recent SH:Shattered Memories)so that the main character will in the end face and overcome them, or have a mental breakdown and kill themselves (and other assortment weird endings depending of your actions in the game). That problem showed clearly what the producers were aiming for ($$$), not that they weren't trying to make a good movie but that was proof of how much they understood the game's deep psychological themes.<br/><br/>Having said all that the movie had some decent acting and the always excellent music by akira yamaoka(even if much of it was pulled out of the game).<br/><br/>In conclusion its not a really bad movie, just it isn't what it could have been."
"Neurotic_Marshmallow","7","0","0","20 March 2010"," Visually Brilliant-yet muddled and confusing
","The Silent Hill games are one of those works of fiction that I hold in a remarkably high esteem. Even being someone who doesn't frequent gaming, the Silent Hill series is and remains to be the only video games I ever loved so dearly and proof to me that Video games could achieve a level of art. Insult it and if I didn't have the composure that I do, I would probably scold you with unrelenting fervor. But you insult the film. I might join in. Because the 2006 film that bears the name ""Silent Hill"" fails to live up to its namesake and only marginally makes it as a film itself <br/><br/>The film can be forgiven for quite a lot. I found the visuals beyond brilliant. Every monster design was rendered wonderfully. Thankfully, most of it is not CGI,making it more natural and also bizarrely elegant. The town maintained an aura of isolation early on. And the first 20 minutes is a perfect translation of the subject matter. BUT....<br/><br/>We come to the problem that a good portion of it doesn't make a lick of sense. Silent Hill is a series that is built on ambiguity. It's stories are based almost entirely upon the context clues and subtle hints picked up through the countless hours of exploration. Good for a video game. It can be achieved in film,but it isn't done here. Most of the film consists of running here and then there and this offers next to no story development outside of ""holy CRAP what was that!"".While its actual plot is revealed to us towards the end in a remarkably lazy way. It presents its monsters one after another like a nightmarish catwalk. One scene quite literally has a group of distorted bubble-head nurses standing there; followed by them walking in unison while they twitch and convulse almost as if they are preparing for a dance routine. What is also confusing is that a good portion of the creatures have a complex meaning fused to them and their design in the game series. Having little to do with the story and characters in this film. This may not bother the casual viewer but to people more familiar with the games,it'll seem like a hodgepodge of characters thrown in for the obligatory fan service.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is a bit iffy. Most do their job. Some don't even need to be in the film.The performance by Jodelle Ferland irked me. Which is odd considering this girl is a brilliant actress. But her double roll as the mandatory creepy girls seem forced. As if she is straining herself to the ends of the earth to try and be that creepy little girl complete with the voice and everything; Which just comes across as rather goofy rather then its intention of being creepy.<br/><br/>All and all,the film is plagued by its ambition.Its by no means a lazy production. You can see the directer is passionate about the subject matter,but some of the heart of the series is lost in the process. The director veered just too far off the mark with story and pacing-trying to translate the subject matter yet at the same time trying to do something new which made it seem more like an attempted imitation. Its not one of those films that are awful-but rather one of those films that was up to its eyeballs in potential but failed to meet that potential.Its worth seeing for it does have the occasional interesting bits. But still, it is only OK."

Looking for answers, Rose takes Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, despite Christopher's opposition. She reaches the town, but is knocked unconscious in a car crash, and wakes to find Sharon is missing. She is unaware that the town has been evacuated for the past 30 years.

","This movie is the nearly HOLY GRAIL of video game movies. These people actually tried and they actually cared, but if you are a hardcore Silent Hill video game series player, you might find this movie not accurate enough. With the whole Pyramid Head being there (Since he was the symbolism of James' self-destructive mindset due to his regret blah blah blah blah) is a major plot hole.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this movie is that it had a REAL POTENTIAL to be a psychology based film, instead they made it ""LET'S RUN AROUND SCREAMING. OMG SCARY MONSTER KILL IT ARRGH!! BUTCH LESBIAN COP FOR THE WIN (oh she was my favorite character! *cough cough*)"" ANYWAY I think they should've stayed with the pack mentality of the people of Silent Hill, and the corrupt mind of the woman that practically ran the place. In my opinion, that is what makes the movie disturbing at all.<br/><br/>Though the ending made me cringe... and the near ending made me cry. Watch it, and you'll understand why. But in my opinion, if the directors were to get anymore loyal to the video game, that would mean sequels and cliff hangers. Lots of them. So take it for what it's worth, it has to be one of the more loyal video game movie I have ever seen. It blows all of Uwe Bol's films out of the water. (That's because that's Uwe Bol.... *gag*).<br/><br/>This movie is a couple steps away from perfect and loyal to what it was inspired from, but I don't think it's meant to be a carbon copy."
"johnslegers","7","0","0","24 September 2009"," A beautiful film if you have Clive Barker's sense of aesthetics
","The problem with ""Silent Hill"" is that it lacks balance. Some parts of the film are over-explained while others leave you in a constant ""What the f***"". Some parts are just too creepy and shocking, while others get a little boring. Some parts are taken right out of the film, while others seemed added for no good reason. Some acting is very good, while other is very questionable.<br/><br/>This lack of balance is enough to make many people disinterested in the film. Either they think it's too confusing, too gory, too different from the game, too slow, etc.<br/><br/>Although IMO his ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" was most definitely a better film, Gans definitely managed to provide something the Silver Screen hasn't seen in a long time : a dark and genuinely creepy Gothic environment with a Clive Barker sense of aesthetics. Too bad the ""darkness"" had only so little presence in this film, although I guess they had to make it fairly short to make it even remotely possible to survive in there.<br/><br/>In spite of its many flaws, however, I can say I really loved seeing ""Silent Hill"". It's definitely refreshing after seeing all those cliché American horror films or typical Japanese gore."

","I look at Silent Hill the film as another story in the world of Silent Hill the game. It fits perfectly and has the same components as the games, but is more of a new chapter in the universe of Silent Hill rather than a direct adaptation of a Silent Hill story. And to date this is the best game-to-film adaptation that I've seen.<br/><br/>If you go into this wanting a jump a minute horror film, then you'll be sorely disappointed. The reason I love this film so much, is that it's a slow burn that focuses more on the journey of the characters within. I also love the underlying warning(the moral, if you will) about the dangers of religion and blind faith. In that manner, Silent hill succeeds where films such as Stephen Kings The Mist failed.<br/><br/>So if you'd like to see Silent Hill brought to life on the big screen or if you're just into films like Jacobs Ladder, The Nameless, In the Mouth of Madness and Devils Backbone. You'll probably enjoy this one as well."

","I've never played the games this film is based on but I didn't think it would matter. The setting is excellent and the town looks great but it's not long before you start looking around for a plot and start to realise there isn't one.<br/><br/>There are a few freaky looking scenes which are impressive but there's no real tension to it, it feels like watching someone else play a video game. So what if they die, why should you care? None of the characters are very interesting and Sean Bean's character is completely pointless which makes the time-gobbling scenes of him lurking around investigating especially tedious.<br/><br/>What really surprised me about this film is just how shabbily made it is. Once you get past the nice visual appeal you notice that plot points appear without any buildup, are discarded and never mentioned again. This happens all the way through the film giving it an abrupt shabby feel."

","Silent Hill is based on the computer game of the same name- Quiet Hill. I've never played it but I hear that actually this film is based on bits from all of the games, most notable the scene where you enter the sewers and are attacked by hordes of giant spiders. That was very scary in the game, but not scary et al here because it doesn't actually happen.<br/><br/>A woman loses her daughter in a scary town and decides to go looking for her. The town in covered by a spooky fog, and everything is very quiet. She enters the town, while her husband tries to catch up with her a few miles behind. In the town she is attacked by zombies, people with shovels for heads, nurses with bandages for eyes, and wasps with guns for their mouths. She realises that it is all a cult where the children are burned in giant statues made of hay- hence all the smoke and fog in the town. Her daughter is going to be burned and it is a race against time to save her. The interesting part is that only certain times of the day can the monsters come out- a copy of Dracula. When the clocks strikes she knows she'd better hide as that is when the monsters (known in the game as cenobots) come out to play and eat! It gets even more interesting as the husband comes to the town but finds it completely deserted, so we don't know if it is all a dream, or if she is dead, or if he is dead, or if anything is what it seems. The acting is mostly good, and Mr Bean does a good job of playing a serious role for once rather than the slap stick comedy he is used to. The mum (played by Peggy Mitchell)is the latest in a long line of strong female heroines, starting with Buffy. If it had been Buffy, she would have no doubt contacted Giles, worked out what was going down, and fought her way through the bad guys, quipping as she went. There are a few scary moments (like when the woman wonders if she should look into the dirty bath water or not) but I think it would have been better if it had been a Zelda game instead. Imagine watching Link riding Epona out of the forest of his home and out onto a massive Hyrule field, with a score of enemies coming towards him. It would be great to see all the sword fights, but also the boomerang and hookshot too. Silent Hill is one of my favourite games, and this film does the game justice as it doesn't make any sense but has good graphics.<br/><br/>Best Scene- When the wife is walking between all the scary nurses, trying not to breathe or touch them or they'll stab her. One of them farts and she tries not to laugh and be sick. This was completely inappropriate and horrifying."

","A modern twist on zombie films and suspense movies as well as its video game predecessor, Silent Hill is truly a disturbing movie, to put it simply. It seems more like a suspenseful ghost story instead of a flat-out horror film, but overall, it does what it set out to accomplish: to leave the viewer chilled to the bone and mortified. <br/><br/>The special effects were quite awe-inspiring, and were very true and accurate to the classic Konami video game style. During the night scenes, I felt as if I were within the video game itself. The mutated creatures were nothing short of disturbing. They were twisted, yet they retained designs and shapes that could have been (and were) human, adding a touch of reality to them, which movies (or video games) of this type must have if they're going to be convincing.<br/><br/>The set design as well was very striking. I enjoyed the way Silent Hill was portrayed as a quaint, innocent little town, but also as a ruined, blackened extension of hell. In the movie (and game), depending on the time of day, Silent Hill switched between the two appearances, but created a sense of dread in either state. I'm not sure whether much of the sets were digital or not, but they were very creepy either way. <br/><br/>Casting was very good, though I'm not sure what Sean Bean (who I like as an actor) was doing in this. I particularly liked the infamous, slimy, sickening leader of Silent Hill's ""faith"", which is best defined as a sick cult. That is perhaps what made the movie the most disturbing: how evil and disgusting this cult way of religion was, in how they take ""purification"" into their own hands. It was almost nauseating to watch, more than all of the blood and gore that splattered across the screen.<br/><br/>Now, why this film didn't get an 8 from me is because of the storyline. It isn't a bad storyline, but I spotted several gaping holes in the plot, such as when Alessa explains her story to Rose. She didn't say how Sharon tied into it at all, leaving non-gamers to guess. All they had to go on was the resemblance between Sharon and Alessa, which isn't enough to fill in the gap. Not everyone played the video game, unfortunately. Also, the ending is definitely confusing on all fronts. I'm not suggesting it be a happier ending (it's a ""horror"" movie!), but it definitely needed something that wasn't there for non-gamers. Clarification would have been nice, yet I am understand that the entire thing is supposed to be Alessa's doing, but clarification would have helped. <br/><br/>This is certainly NOT a film for kids, mainly because of the frightening nature of the entire story. There are several very graphic scenes as well, including one where a Silent survivor gets her entire skin ripped off and is left to bleed, and one where a police officer slowly gets burned alive. Language is not so much an issue in this film. Definitely not one to show to the kids, but certainly a good midnight ghost story.<br/><br/>7/10, a watchable movie overall, despite its confusing ending and sometimes gaping plot. The video game is amazing, and definitely something to check out."

","I am a fan of the Silent Hill game series (maybe except the 4th part^^), and I was looking forward to see that movie for a long time. The first thing I noticed was that Akira Yamaoka made the music for that movie. And music is one of the most important thing of Silent Hill and its atmosphere. Yeah, this little word: ""atmosphere"". I think the crew around SH ignored that word a little bit. Or they didn't really understand what the typical SH-atmosphere really is. Walking through empty, lost and timeless rooms, hearing the creepy noises coming from everywhere around you. To see the horrifying transitions from the fogged world into the dark world, where the town shows its skeleton and its bloody history. And the awareness, that you have to go THROUGH that hell to get out of that nightmare. In my opinion, they just reached 40 percent of the Silent Hill atmosphere in the movie - maybe less. And in SH there are not the creatures or the special effects the main part, even not the characters (they just give us a chance to see and understand that world) - no, I think it's rather that, what we can't see. Every step you make, that town seems to grow more and more. And the more you see, the more you don't wanna think about what there else could be. THIS is Silent Hill, and I don't know if you ever could put all this into a movie, especially in a Hollywood-movie. For a self-contained movie it has its qualities, but for a Silent Hill movie it is all in all a little bit disappointing. But anyway I liked that movie...<br/><br/>For everyone, that don't know the game series: Don't be discouraged to buy any of the games - in that (I recommend starting with part 2, part 3 is visual the best) you going to understand what I've meant in this comment... ;)"

","Halfway through watching this for the second time (late at night on cable, having seen it a couple of years ago in the cinema when it first came out). I found myself thinking 'I remember this being a lot better'. It definitely picks up later on in the film, with some VERY well shot scenes of creepy goodness. As well as the story coming together in an acceptable way.<br/><br/>Parts that stand out, being the scene in the toilets when 'the darkness' comes, and the paint/reality peels away, and the wired up guy crawls out. The dude with the big sword...the dragging sound was supringly effective. And of course the hot dead nurses.<br/><br/>The bad... The fact that Radah Mitchelles character doesn't seem overly concerned that she's lost her daughter in this demon world. I know I'd be running around in hysterics if I was in that situation. This is especially cringe worthy as it is after all, a film based on a video game, and it really should try at ALL costs to maintain it's credibility.<br/><br/>I also didn't quite dig the characterisation of the cop. When she cuffs Radah's character, and then doesn't take them off AS SOON as she realises that not everything is quite right. (The road that she drove into silent hill on no longer being there). Your meant to like her, and this makes you dislike her, especially if you have a disdain for cops in the real world as it is already.<br/><br/>Overall, it's decent with some great scenes, but the film falls far from greatness all together. Will probably buy it one day when I see it for $10-$15.<br/><br/>P.S. Radah Mitchell's Aussie accent was really obvious, when she was screaming 'Sharon, Sharon!'. Perhaps not the best word for an Aussie trying to maintain an American accent to say repeatedly. And I think I should mention the very opening shot, just of Mitchell, calling out for her daughter, it kind of jolts you into the film in a not-so-blatant way, but extremely effective. (I think her accent was good in that part too, it's more so when she first gets to Silent Hill that it falls apart)<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>(reviewed after second viewing)"

","Now, before I start, I just want to make something clear - I do have the game. I love it. It's frightening in a way that no Resident Evil game has ever managed. Instead of just making you jump every now and then, it taps into your darkest fears, and from experience, the whole series of games has the ability to reduce even the most hardened horror gamers to quivering wrecks. The movie, however, is a little bit of a wet sponge in comparison.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I didn't like it. In fact, I did quite enjoy it. But there was no point in it where I can honestly say I was scared. In a way, it felt like more of a very gory episode of Doctor Who. In fact, there's a few episodes of the revived Doctor Who that have scared me more than this did. For me, it was more like fascination and curiosity. Although, before anyone reads this and then watches the movie expecting to not get scared, don't. I can see very well how people would be disturbed to their very core by this. It just didn't do that for me.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the positives. All of the performances are fantastic. It's very well scripted, and in particular, the different characters from the game work well - I have to agree with another reviewer who said that Harry wouldn't have worked in this. Even better, it's not a direct rip-off from the game, so watching this still won't give you all the answers for getting through the game - in fact, I'd go so far as to say it's almost completely different apart from the concept. As you'd expect, most of the deaths are brilliantly gruesome as well - one, in fact, may actually be my new favourite movie death of all time, even surpassing Erin from Final Destination 3. All I'll say is think of Robbie William's ""Rock DJ"" video.<br/><br/>So anyway, all things considered, it is a good movie, and definitely worthy of being based on the game. But I think it could easily have been better."

Interesting movie, that's meant to be disturbing, not going for the cheap ""jump"" scares or any of the conventional horror movie clichés.<br/><br/>Easily recommendable if you want to see a horror movie that's interesting to watch for more than just seeing whether people die in new and interesting ways. There's actually a plot and some substance here. Hell the town of Silent Hill is the most important character in the movie, and Christophe absolutely nails it. A lot has to be said for that alone. <br/><br/>The creature design is also a spot on representation that's very faithful to the game. I cannot deny that I was very pleased with this aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>For those that are complaining about it not being more like the game, well *duh* it has to be different from the game. It has to appeal to not only those that played the video games, but also the non gaming movie goers as well and I feel like they succeeded quite well.<br/><br/>Not all is well in the ghost town of silent hill, however. Some of the acting from the minor characters in the movie detracted from the overall experience. The minor cult characters, and the detective character's acting was just not up to par with the rest of the main cast. Also, I didn't really care for the ending, but they did leave it open to interpretation, which should please those that were claiming that the rest of the movie was exposition heavy.<br/><br/>Not a bad effort at all. It's easily the best video game movie I've seen and its a good effort from a standalone point of view as well.<br/><br/>For all those hardcore video game fanatics that are desperate for more creatures, more ""dark"" time, and less character drama well there's always the sequel. Now that the town of Silent Hill and its back story have been established there's no reason that the crazy can't be turned up to 11."

","When I first saw the trailer for silent hill, I thought it would be great! Now i don't know what to think.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: I liked how silent hill was more than just a horror, it was a fantasy too. It had some of the best imagery I've ever seen in a horror film - the gray children scene -. This may sound weird but i loved the names of the characters for some reason, I guess cause they weren't your every day names. I loved the atmosphere of the movie, something about it just made me think Jappanese horror meets french drama with a little bit of 1990's look - don't ask why. Also I loved that the horror part of silent hill was meant to look like a night mare because t sure was bazaar enough to be a nightmare. Also the costumes were great. THE BAD: A bit too confusing at the end, could've been just a little more explanatory. The characters sometimes make god-awful decisions. Some of the dialog is very silly like when Cybil the cop sees an armless faceless creature walking towards her she yells""stay were you are!"" for a second there i thought she would give him ankle cuffs and ask him for his license. For a movie that has a lot of creatures in it's first 2-3 quarters it sure didn't have any in the horrific climax, I think some bazaar looking creatures would've gone great with the barb-wire. and finally what bothered me was the last shot of the movie, plants, honestly they couldn't come up with a better, more relevant last shot than some plants in-front of roses house?<br/><br/>So anyway silent hill is a very entertaining horror film although it does disappoint a little."

","When i first heard that there is Silent Hill movie in progress,i was very glad to see one of my favorite games on TV movie screen.So few of months had past and i saw it and was for the first time really happy with a game transfer into the movie.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the movie is awesome and it's mystical as well as horrific.On the other view the script was also pretty good and there is a few of really survivor scary scenes in witch theme of solo girl in dead town is going extraordinary.<br/><br/>Like we all now the acting in horror movies is not first thing that we look ,but Silent Hill was doing very good in that field too.Survivor genre which was introduced in Resident Evil (only Resident games not poor directed movies) is here perfect,the camera is sometimes claustrophobic and it seems that if you what it alone in the dark you would have unpleasant dreams.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping this movie from the score 10 is the questionable ending but still the end solves pretty much everything so many people would like that (i am still in the hole unsolved mysteries and sequels). I wonder why this movie hasn't good a sequel because it seems much better then 90 percent of other survivor-horror movies.<br/><br/>All together the game-players would be pleased with story and directing,and other scary movie lovers ain't gonna be disappointed.So watch Silent Hill somewhere between 23h and one past midnight and i bet you will loved it."

","Had no idea that this was based on a video game until I read some of the other reviews, but it makes perfect sense. Once again, I found myself amazed by the over effusive language on IMDb. This film is ""gripping and exciting and innovative. It's also extremely derivative.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that it's horrible. SILENT HILL certainly has a lot of things going for it. It's got great atmosphere. There are some good performances. There are some creepy sequences. It's got amazing effects (scene after scene of digitally created landscapes and terrifying creatures). It's even got some interesting ideas.<br/><br/>But it's what it doesn't have that proves its undoing. It doesn't have any real sense of purpose. It's as if the writer Avary strung together every excuse for a suspense scene he could think of and director Gans cobbled together sequences from the HELLRAISER catalog.<br/><br/>And to what end? Why has this entire town disappeared from the face of the earth? Why is everyone trapped in this horrific limbo? What has the religious fervor of the town folks and their execution of witches got to do with them creeping about in radiation suits (while carrying canaries like coal miners)? If you expected some type of grand resolution that ties all these disparate points into a nice bow, you'll be sadly disappointed. Instead, what you get - Big Spoiler Here - is a lame explanation involving a little girl wronged. That's right, people, it's THE RING set in West Virginia. All this otherworldly possession, flying barbed wire(?), and creature infestation is somehow the doing of one angry little burned kid.<br/><br/>Which is sad, I must say, because all the ingredients where there to make this big budget spectacle a unique piece of work: a monster movie that worked on a multitude of levels.

"Zombified_660","7","0","0","21 July 2007"," A decent adaptation of the video game, but kind of lacking in areas, relies heavily on totally mimicking game scenes
","Having just re-watched Silent Hill on DVD I'm glad I made the effort to see it in the cinema. This is a movie theatre horror if ever there was one. The set pieces are painstakingly designed to be shown on a large screen with the music and sound blaring out at full whack. On a smaller screen, Silent Hill is an enjoyable and solid addition to the slowly growing 'adapted from a video-game' horror genre, but the loss of the visual excess of seeing it in the cinema exposes a few issues with the film.<br/><br/>Silent Hill suffers the same problems any film adapted from a successful series of books, games or comics does; how do you go about shoehorning in this case a four game series with it's own rules, regulations and atmosphere into one 90 minute film? Writer Roger Avary and director Christophe Gans have done a pretty good job of making a film that feels like Silent Hill, but what they've chosen to omit seems odd.<br/><br/>For instance, there are particular speech patterns that the game characters have, and they attribute to the off kilter, disturbing ambiance. In the Silent Hill games characters often talk in normal voices but with odd tics and mannerisms, and do things like trail off mid sentence and start talking about something else entirely. Everyone in the film speaks like a normal horror film character i.e a lot of redundant 'my god they killed him' type lines and pointless swearing whenever a door's locked or something. In fact all the characters respond to emergencies with a stream of random sh*ts, f**ks and lots of 'C'mon!', which feels less Silent Hill and more Die Hard. Maybe it's just me, but the clichéd script and acting seems bizarre given how perfectly the team have translated the rest of the environment and visual ambiance of the games.<br/><br/>In fact, there's a very random, patchy, almost snatch-and-grab feel to the way it's been adapted. For instance, the film uses a similar plot to Silent Hill 1, but then predominantly uses monsters from Silent Hill 2, and uses the music from Silent Hill 3. It won't make a lot of difference if you've never played a Silent Hill game, but to a fan, it was extremely confusing to be assaulted with Americanised versions of several elements of the game all at once.<br/><br/>The soundtrack frustrates the most. The strongest element of the games has always been their sound and atmosphere, and the fact that the movies soundtrack is lifted entirely from the third game with only a few extra additions feels a tad cheap. Initially you're happy because you settle in at the audio cues, but later, when entire songs from the OST of Silent Hill 3 start pumping out you begin to feel less comfortable and more like the team couldn't be bothered to make their own so stole the ones out of the game. I'm not averse to finally finishing an American horror flick and not getting nearly blown out of my theatre seat by My Chemical Romance (House of Wax, I shake my fist at thee!) or some such, but when the song is something you've already heard and that already means something else to you in a different context it's very irritating and feels like a cheap shot. The theme tune to Silent Hill 3 means to me 'ooh, I've turned on my favourite video game, time to chill out' and I'm happy with that meaning. If they wanted to use it in the movie as well they could have at least remixed it.<br/><br/>These are pretty specialist gripes though, about an otherwise enjoyable and watchable horror movie and despite the facts that some areas of the adaptation are frustratingly handled, this is still a pretty good film. Firstly, although good acting is in short supply, very few scenes are dialogue heavy, and the sparse dialogue is used only to move along the storyline, which is very strong. Also the few good turns in the cast, mainly Kim Coates and the little girl who acts Alessa/Sharon, are excellent, the latter bringing an understated creepiness to her role that no amount of make-up could produce.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that they didn't scrimp on the scary stuff. Without necessarily being a straight 'scary' movie, Silent Hill is packed to the gills with disturbing set-pieces. It also has an impressive amount of the red stuff flowing around for a 15. I remember coming out of the flick in the cinema and commenting to a friend 'whoa, that was pretty harsh, wonder if that'll still be a 15 once it hits DVD?'. Miraculously, especially given that less brutal or disturbing films like Reeker and Wilderness have remained 15s in the UK but been upgraded to 18s for Northern Ireland, Silent Hill is still a 15 across the board, even for the slightly more conservative NI board of classification (buy a UK DVD and it has both on the box). Impressive for a film definitely not for the faint of heart, which involves among other things several cut throats, people being burnt alive and a final set-piece showdown that has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Ignoring my history with the video-games, Silent Hill is a fun genre flick, with convincing monsters, an extremely dark plot and a nice mix of full-pelt action horror and some juicy psychological scares. It won't win any Oscars, but it's a fun ride all the same. It probably won't be a film you'll watch more than twice, as if you own any of the games, well I'd honestly rather play them for 90 minutes than make another revisit, and the cheesiness of the dialogue and some of the acting spoils the dark splendour of the visuals, but watch it once and you'll be spooked and shocked, and hopefully have a good time in the process."

","I have read several entries suggesting anything from Rose and Sharon being trapped in purgatory to that they are actually dead. I have a much different one. Okay so we understand that there is the ""real world"" in Sharon is placed for her safety by The Reaper and then is later adopted by Rose and Chris. Then there is the Silent Hill world in which the townies, nurse and Alessa are trapped. And finally we have the nightmare world created the hell in Alessa's mind with The Reaper's help. In order to enter the nightmare world, Rose and Sharon must first enter the limbo/Silent Hill world. Rose by being a mother really exists in the ""good"" real world as does Sharon/Good Alessa, but in order to rectify the evil acts committed in Silent Hill, they must understand them by allowing the darkness in (Rose when she carries The Reaper into the Church, and Sharon (I believe) when she open her eyes and sees The Reaper). Alessa was not evil, only vengeful and once that vengeance is ended, she is satisfied, but the good cannot return. Rose and Sharon are caught in that same sort of between world--they belong in the ""good"" but cannot return because of the darkness that they carried. That is why they can return home, but never to the exact place that they were before. Hope that makes sense to anyone... what do you think?"

","As a huge fan of the Konami teams work on the silent hill franchise i knew i was in for a real treat on the way to see the screen adaptations of one of the darkest and most moving video games ever.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately a mash up of the second and third game (with a few references to the first). For example the protagonist is visually similar to the girl from the 3rd game, but is playing the story of the first game, with the nemesis of the second game (pyramid head) who i have to add, played absolutely no purpose in this film whatsoever. On that note nearly nothing in the film played any significant role other than to look cool and to be purposefully ambiguous (something which has fooled a lot of naive teens into thinking it's a well thought out story with deep twists etc- just watch the summary of the film by the little girl and you'll see what i mean).<br/><br/>But really i don't think anyone would be watching the film for it's story, it's all about the hellish, Francis bacon come Jacobs Ladder world your thrown into. It is absolutely terrifying and beautiful.<br/><br/>All i all what i mean to say is, if you know anything about cinema you probably will not be impressed by this film. But if you are a fan of visual effects and especially dark, disturbing themes you will adore this movie. And one last thing, if you have played the games before don't get too annoyed when you realise that it has absolutely nothing to do with the previous stories."
"Andrew-Harvey88","7","0","0","11 June 2007"," Take heed Tomb Raider , Resident Evil
","The game to movie transition is riddled with failure as the title suggests and indeed it is easy to dismiss this off hand. Games like this are often viewed in isolation and the gamer will often take from the game his or her's own varying idea , as such they create their view of what the game is trying to say. The game of course is seen through your eyes , you control the character , you understand the motivations that you've created for the actions in the game. This for me is why games fail as films , because it destroys all thats been built between you and the character because it is another's view and they will , with games like Silent Hill find another perspective to explore and for me it can never really recreate the personal experience of a video game because you're no longer in control. They also fail if you decide to change the story (RESIDENT EVIL) so it only really has a base representation of the original story.<br/><br/>A film of Silent Hill is no surprise to me as the game is almost designed to an extent like a film. But one cannot be optimistic that the directors will stay true to the core ideas after all Resident Evil , Tomb Raider, Doom are abominations of films and frankly couldn't have been much worse. Silent Hill is different,it stays truer to game that any game to film conversion , the music is similar the camera work is actually based on camera movements from the game. The core storyline hasn't been changed into some savaged and frankly embarrassing version of the game's story. The lead character isn't a hero - she's a vulnerable women and far from a hero but is motivated by love. Its even set out in the same way , a car-crash on the edge of the town and a missing daughter. Some of the dialogue is strained after all much needs to be included as Silent Hill , the game , doesn't have nearly enough , hence the need for Sean Bean's role and the flashbacks. I genuinely found this film to be so much better than many think, the dialogue as I state before isn't great and I do question the story's use of Alessa and making it about revenge for her bullying - its a cross over of Carrie and the Salem witch trials - and frankly I feel I've heard this before although I did, to the films credit , find her 'sacrificial scene' incredibly disturbing but I felt a lot of the film lacked that genuine fear. It was more just guts and blood which betrays the game's essence somewhat. It does leave some questions but I think the idea that they had 'died' was established long ago and seemed an anti-climax but it fits into the game's storyline of mixed endings being available so it didn't turn into a love fest at the end , indeed it made me feel sorry for Sean Beans character and I could relate to him in some senses.<br/><br/>The film can never capture the fear of playing this game alone at night , the fear of the pyramid head , the static of the radio in a dark corridor, nor does it really try to capture the occult and darker sadistic needs of the human psyche but for me it makes a really decent change to the film/game genre that precedes it and I believe it can stand up on its own as a decent film. I think if you're a fan you'll definitely want to see this."

","For those who have never seen the game, ""Silent Hill"" is the best ever survival/ horror game series. It is difficult and confusing (a lot of mazes and D&D-like details) so expect major disorientation at times during the film-which is a bit like actually playing the game.<br/><br/>The acting was convincing, the editing extraordinary, and the atmosphere oppressive. Not 100% how I visualized it before viewing but even the differences tended to work in favor of the film.<br/><br/>The town itself looked and actually felt familiar, unlike the mess they made of ""House of Wax"". This is definitely the sort of film best seen on the big screen with a theater sound system. Everyone should be totally creeped out.<br/><br/>Enough said, more at this stage might spoil things so read on only if you have already seen the film or if you don't mind some spoilers.<br/><br/>Dahlia Gillespie had a daughter (by an unknown father) named Alessa. Alessa became the town outcast until a bunch of religious nuts (led by Christabella) decided she was a witch and must be sacrificed to keep evil out of Silent Hill. Dahlia went along with this because she was afraid of her own damnation for having the child. But the ceremony went wrong and the nut cases were not just killed but sent to a netherworld between heaven and hell.<br/><br/>The dark side of Alessa ended up in the same place but she was split into duel entities and the good part stayed in the normal world where she was adopted by Rose and Chris, and named Sharon. Sharon's sleepwalking is caused by her connection with Alessa who wants her to return to Silent Hill.<br/><br/>On the way to Silent Hill, Rose and Sharon arouse the suspicions of a motorcycle policewoman (Cybil Bennett). This happens because Cybil has been extremely protective of children since she saved a little boy from a psychopath. Cybil follows them to Silent Hill (once a coal mining town that was abandoned because of a burning seam of coal under the town). At the town limits a mysterious girl appears and both vehicles crash. When Sharon and Cybil regain consciousness Rose is gone.<br/><br/>As they explore the abandoned buildings they discover a church with a warning siren where the religious cult hides when Alessa (presumably) causes a darkness to take over the town; for some reason the darkness and Alessa cannot enter the church. It turns out that Alessa sent her Sharon identity back into the world of the living to bring back someone (Rose) who can take her into the church where she can finally exact her revenge.<br/><br/>Everyone is dead in the netherworld of Silent Hill, even Rose and Cybil-they don't know it yet but they died in the accident-because you can only enter the town if you are dead. Alessa needs Rose which is why she died, it was just Cybil's bad luck to have been involved in the accident.<br/><br/>The tip off to their being parallel towns comes when Rose's husband Chris enters the real Silent Hill and finds nothing supernatural in the place; although he senses a connection with his wife and adopted daughter, he finds no tangible sign of them. Rose passes right through him and the ending scene of Rose and Sharon in their home is blurred, but the scene with Chris in the parallel home is completely clear."

"K_Todorov","7","0","0","20 January 2007"," Decent adaptation to one of the most successful survival-horror franchises
","Video game to movie adaptations have throughout the years received a very negative reaction by critics and moviegoers alike. There is a understanding reason for that, as the genre itself isn't the most popular amongst movie makers and thus often attracting the less talented and low profile directors to it. What did we gain from them? Movies whose quality varied from average to awful, movies that failed to capture the spirit of the games or worse yet, used their names only as a cheap way to attract an audience. Then came Christophe Gans a french director whose previous work included the visually stunning ""Brotherhood Of The Wolves"" and whom declared that will be adapting the ""Silent Hill"" video games series to the big screen. The result is what could be described as the most visually faithful video game adaptation but that alone does not make it a great one does it? No. For that to happen we need both direction and script to succeed in preserving the main elements that made the original work so popular, and it is here where ""Silent Hill"" failed. While Gans's direction could be seen as a perfect fit, Roger Avery's script is an uneven mess which will undoubtedly leave many confused.<br/><br/>Looking at it from the basic outline ""Silent Hill"" follows it's video game counterpart closely. Presenting us the story of a parent who searches for her daughter in a strange, desolate town called Silent Hill. The only difference being that the main protagonist's gender is changed to female, that alone though does not have a huge impact on the story as that is not it's focus. Instead the attention is set entirely on the inseparable bond between parent and child, and the forces that divide them apart. It is here where the need for a solid well written script comes, something that Avery and Gans fail to acquire as we later discover. The pacing is unbalanced with some scenes forwarding the story way too much while others way too little. The last part of the film especially feels over-rushed with its quick and rather weak attempt at explaining what has transpired. What should have been a well structured, plot driven mystery/horror becomes a confusing mess that will leave a lot of the viewers unfamiliar to the original source wondering what they've just seen.<br/><br/>Looking at it from a technical point of view though ""Silent Hill"" is an magnificent achievement in the use of special effects. Few horror movies these day succeed in displaying such effective use of both cgi generated images and costumes. Gans has worked hard in capturing the image of the games and fans will no doubtingly be satisfied in that part. The cinematography is impressive with some great shots during the more ""nightmarish"" parts of the film. There is some fan service done with the includement of one of the series more famous characters that could have been developed into to something a bit more coherent with the plot but still nice to see.<br/><br/>There is my distinct impression that during the production, all things aside, Gans really made only one fatal mistake. He created the ""Silent Hill"" he imagined, his own personal view of what it is all about. You can see that, whether it is the plot, creature design, or his envisionment of how the transformation from one world to another works, he had an idea of how everything there worked. But he forgot the one major thing that made the games so great: ""Silent Hill"" is as much as it is about a concrete plot as it is in the viewers own personal assumptions and interpretations of it.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" might not have been a complete success and it's storytelling might not have been entirely faithful to the original's. But it is a welcome step forward, showing us that it is possible for a movie to capture the visual and atmospheric feel of the game. Hopefully future adaptations can learn from both it's mistakes and achievements."

","I was cursed with knowing early-on that Silent Hill would be turned into a film. My patience was severely tested. But oh hell, yes, was it worth it. Director C. Gans did an amazing job from my perspective.<br/><br/>I played Silent Hill well over 5 years ago and it brought survival/horror games to a new peak, like Resident Evil did. I was hoping this flick wouldn't turn into whatever happened to Doom, and it surely didn't.<br/><br/>I suppose that, having have played the game, will multiply the experience, but for those who didn't play Silent Hill, can most definitely enjoy the movie as well. As soon as the eerie-and oh so familiar soundtrack started rolling, I made a slight twitch, grabbing my seat at the movies. One of many of those moments. The scenes where the Nightmare World kicks in the first time were almost identically set-up as in the game, amazing! Other crucial aspects were preserved. The soundtrack, the eerie ""industrial"" sounds. Other, vibrant sounds that were a horror show on their. Sounds that made you wonder if it were a slow, grinding hellish machine, or a fiend luring in the darkness. The music, the monsters, the scenery, the characters (mostly),... It's also quite an achievement to know that CG (computer-generated) special effects were kept on a low usage, despite the film being graphically amazing. Next to that, Gans made sure he added his own unique and fitting aspects of the story. Dialogue had some pretty nifty quotes here and there. <br/><br/>The storyline is mainly based on the first film, even though we get to see Pyramid Head, who is actually an important character from the second game (but honestly, who couldn't resist using Pyramid Head and his gigantic kitchen knife), but other plot aspects of other Silent Hill movies were included. The underlying ideas of repent, hate, solitude and other feelings that could cause a person to turn into the Devil himself. <br/><br/>As one of the previous reviewers said, I kinda missed Harry... For the first 10 minutes. I kinda got used to Rose without even knowing. <br/><br/>I know I won't have to worry about Gans, perhaps, directing future Silent Hill films. Bring it."

Well, looks like my expectations were fulfilled.<br/><br/>This film is primarily based on the first two Silent Hill games with a few elements from Silent Hill 3 and 4. Surprisingly enough, this movie catches the atmosphere perfectly. The amount of detail in the sets are amazing. Also CGI is minimal in this movie. Only a few of the monsters were made with some CGI effects (the Grey children). If there are any bad things to mention in this movie, then it would have to be the goofs. There were a few major revealing mistakes, especially when Cybil wipes out the blood from her head (the blood is made out of rubber!). The performances in this movie are really good, though Sean Bean and Tanya Allen could have done a better job. One of the best things in this movie is definitely the music, that is composed by Akira Yaomaoka, the man behind the music in all four Silent Hill games.<br/><br/>This is the movie many Silent Hill fans have been waiting for.<br/><br/>Cristophe Gans has really done an astonishing job!

However, being an avid video game fan, I had to see it for the sake that it was a VG movie.<br/><br/>I was impressed. I'm sick of the crap that people excuse for horror and this one finally did something different. It wasn't your average everyday ""I'm doing to jump out and scare the audience while gutting the horny teenager, wow I didn't see that coming"" scary. It was ""oh, my God, what the hell is that walking behind her"" scary. I was creeped out by the movie. My friend is now driving home after watching the movie and is afraid of crapping his pants just walking in the door of his house.<br/><br/>About a month later, I played Silent Hill 2. I immediately recognized the feel. The creepy noises, the eerie hallways, the sadistic looking monsters. Everything. In fact, after watching the movie after playing the game, I respected it a lot more. The monsters were very detailed and very well done. Yes, I'll admit the creepy nurses with the sexy bodies was a little American-horror-ish, but the way they moved still scared the hell out of me.<br/><br/>It did have its flaws. While the movie started out following the game rather closely, the end started to have a different feel to it. It wasn't really the game anymore after Rose finds Alessa in the hospital.<br/><br/>The ending still upsets me but that's okay. I think any ending to any Silent Hill game I've played (SH2 and SH4) has left me kind of feeling bewildered."

It much rather tightens a smoothly woven and absorbing web of sheer non-stop suspense, benefiting from it's origin - a trilogy of already superb computer games - where substantial care had been taken of a steadily rising thrill-factor.<br/><br/>Slick scripting and congenial craftsmanship then condensed into what happens to be one of the most gripping horror movies of the decade. The faint-of-heart may heed officer Gucci's well-meant advise: ""So I want you to go home now, to your nice warm bed, and let me deal with this town and what has happened over the last thirty years. OK? End of story."""

"Luke902","9","0","0","18 December 2006"," Gans and Avary make a good adaptation of a great game
","I am so happy that this movie doesn't suck. With all these other film adaptations of games out there that pretty much blow, especially the ones directed by Uwe Boll, my expectations of ever seeing a good game-movie were, well, pretty low. But thankfully, Boll didn't get his hands on the Silent Hill license. <br/><br/>When I first heard that Silent Hill was becoming a movie, I was a little worried. ""Who will direct it? And who will write it?"" I thought to myself. Then I found out that Roger Avary was writing it and I was a lot less worried. By no means is he a bad writer. But there was still a lingering feeling that it might suck. It came out in theaters and the response was largely positive. Then it came out on DVD and I rented it. Sure enough, it was good. <br/><br/>Being a fan of the games, I was delighted by the story, which has a woman (Rose) looking for her lost daughter in the eerily empty town of Silent Hill. So, it has the first game's story. It also takes a few liberties, but thankfully they are good enough to be welcomed. The story holds up and is appropriately dark.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very satisfied with everything in the movie. Why? Because it's all f---ed up in that Silent Hill kind of a way. The creatures, the camera angles, and the plot. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of the games or not, this is a movie worthy of your attention."
"les_elroy","7","0","0","16 December 2006"," If you like the series, there is something for you in this movie.
","If you already know how much scarier it is to play a horror based game than it is to watch any kind of horror movie, then you know what a daunting task the producers had in making this movie because Silent Hill is one of the scariest games ever made and arguably the scariest of all. I even think it's a bit unfair to expect any movie to match that, but I do expect them to keep trying. Silent Hill the movie will not scare you like the game, but it tries hard enough that anyone who enjoyed the game should appreciate this work.<br/><br/>To its credit the movie was able to do one thing that games (and movies) don't do well or often enough; It was the way the characters evoked emotion and reacted to events and surroundings. When the main character Rose Da Silva is thrust into this world of horror, she is extremely terrified and she has to work to collect herself more than once. I think that's almost how it should and would be. It's not something a normal person would see every day. Of course, the movie was also able to do some amazing special effects as well, such as when the paint peels off the walls and turns to a rusty, bloody, twisted, industrial mess of a nightmare, which is quite impressive considering that the surroundings look dilapidated and frightening enough before the transition even happens.<br/><br/>Although you'll realize very quickly that the story was re-written, you'll still be thinking to yourself that the director must have played the game in its entirety, because you'll notice little details borrowed from the spirit of the first two games. For example, Rose Da Silva is dressed a lot like Maria from Silent Hill 2 in my opinion. For most of the movie she's wearing a dress about the same length, a simple top and nice high boots to go with them. You will also see the nurses looking just as shapely as they do in the game, and their movements look as twisted. The same goes for Red Pyramid with the way he drags around that huge sword. The costume design for the female cop is nothing short of excellent too and the actress who played her did an equally good job. Sean Bean plays the devoted husband of of Rosa very well and I have no complaints about him either. One really cool game like moment is when Rosa is looking at the hospital map and she spends quite a bit of time trying to memorize it like we do when we pull up the map in the game. When traveling the halls she recites out loud what she was memorizing. Works for me.<br/><br/>Another thing I really liked was the fact that they used a fair amount of music from the game, though I truly wish they had packed in even more. It's great stuff and it made me realize that I have to get the soundtracks from the actual games. It's just too good not to have at the ready.<br/><br/>As for the storyline, it is pretty far fetched, but so is the story for the game. I found the story a bit hard to follow in Silent Hill 1 the game, but this movie provides more of a back story that could apply to that game. In fact, I don't really like ""devil child"" and ""witch trial"" type supernatural stuff, but they did alright with it. I liked the story of Silent Hill 2 best, where the main character was truly in his own hell, but you can't have everything.<br/><br/>The reason why this movie loses three stars is because it just can't scare me the way the game does, but no movie can do that. Anything else I don't like about the movie is much less reasonable, such as the fact that at the beginning of the movie, Cybil is wearing very dark shades outside at night or that I wanted more content and story from the games that would make the movie too long. This movie is worth seeing for what was done right and there's enough of that to go around."

I never played to the games, so I didn't really know what to expect and when I got out I had the impression I had seen a pleasant movie yet that I did miss a lot of things. And I was right.

","It was a surprise to me to find out that ""Silent Hill"" was based upon a video game. It surprised me for two reasons: 1.) This movie was well done unlike most movies based upon video games. And 2.) What kind of video games are being made these days? The story in ""Silent Hill"" was good. A woman's adopted daughter keeps having night-terrors and she was frequently mentioning Silent Hill. The mother, Rose (played by Radha Mitchell), desperate to put an end to these night-terrors decides to take her daughter, Sharon (played by Jodelle Ferland), to the town known as Silent Hill in order to find out what connection her daughter has to that town. Once they arrived the eeriness began.<br/><br/>There were several startling and cringing moments. This movie was a borderline between suspense and horror. The creator of this movie was very inventive with the types of creatures that occupied Silent Hill. Even though a lot was discovered about Sharon and her connection to Silent Hill, there were still some unanswered questions at the movie's end. In fact, after Rose and Sharon's visit to Silent Hill just as many questions arose as were answered.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was decent. The scenery and aura created was very fitting. The acting was above average as was the story. As I said before, some things were left up in the air so I gave it a 7."

","This isn't a typical Hollywood horror movie, because it has depressing and deep atmosphere. They sure did good job with this one. I can't blame them for the lack of imagination because this movie's full of it. They sure had the right people to do the job and the right director. They did have a good script and writers.<br/><br/>In the beginning the characters seem a bit superficial and there's not much depth to them at all. When some other movie focuses on the main character's life before the action starts, this movie just goes straight into the action. I thought that i could not relate to the characters in any way because they seemed shallow. But i was so wrong with the movie. Just before the grand final the story gets explained and it's presented in a really good imaginative way. It gives deepness to the story and it gets even more interesting because of that.<br/><br/>They didn't just go and make a movie based on a game, they made a movie of its own and brought something new to it. Some movies based on a game forget to bring something new to the genre and that's just too bad to copy the same old story.

","Game to Movie, a Turn for the Worst. A Silent Hill Review By: Eric Breden<br/><br/>You have just been MF a car accident and you awake slowly, Dougy, barley conscience as you lift your head from the steering wheel. Your attention quickly turns to your daughters safety, when you realize that she is nowhere to be found. Frantically stumbling into the snowy ghost town of Silent Hill you search for any sign of her, but she is lost without a trace. Suddenly you notice that the wintry tranquility isn't frozen water falling from the sky, but sulfuric ash, and there is a loud siren blaring MF the back ground signaling the coming of the darkness. At once, day becomes night and instantly it is pitch black. This is only the beginning, the worst is still to come as you realize what the darkness brings. You have just crossed the thresh hold of hell on earth, and there is no turning back.<br/><br/>Sounds pretty surreal right, not for Rose De Silva and her daughter Sharon. For Rose, crossing the thresh hold of hell and earth is just one of the many problems she is faced with on this dreary day MF Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a very dark, grim film with a rather untraditional storyline. The third of it's kind being directly scripted from a video game, the other two being Super Mario Bros. and the most recent Doom. Produced by Tri-star pictures and directed by Christopher Gans (""Pacte Des lo-ups, Le"" and ""Crying Freeman""), this film has a fresh cast of actors and an excellent filming crew. <br/><br/>This is a story about a mother (Rada Mitchell, ""Man on Fire"" and ""Pitch Black"") on a desperate search for a town called Silent Hill, which she believes could save the life of her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland, ""The Masters of Horror"" and ""The Collector"") and cure her of her illness. This film opens with Rose, Sharon's mother, racing through the night MF search of her sleepwalking daughter, only to find her at the edge of a cliff screaming Silent Hill as she attempts to leap over. Having already tried the cure of modern medication and physicians, Rose is determined to locate Silent Hill MF hope of finding an answer lying within the town. Her search finally reaches an end when she enters the town of Silent Hill with her husband Chris (Sean Bean, ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Goldeneye"") following behind her. Chris is on a mission to stop his wife because he has discovered the truth behind Silent Hill's ghostly past, and he knows that only danger lies MF wait for Rose and Sharon. Once MF the town Rose discovers the reason for her husband's distress, having entered the gateway to another dimension. With the help of a highway patrol officer, Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden, ""Fantastic Four"" and ""Bailey's Billion$"") The only one to have crossed the thresh hold with Rose and Sharon, Rose begins the manhunt for her daughter. To their dismay, Rose and Cybil steadily uncover the truth behind the demise of Silent Hill, discovering that a religious cult murdered her daughters mother MF 1974 unleashing a hellish revenge on the souls trapped inside Silent Hill's own personal hell.<br/><br/>To be honest, the plot of this film is sketchy at best. The director, Christopher Gans, did a very poor job of explaining the plethora of unreal events set MF motion. Too much information was given about Silent Hill's dark, secretive past, and a lack there of where it should explain Rose and Sharon's involvement. Amongst fighting demons and running from the ""darkness"", the storyline fell a bit shy MF the department of keeping the viewer on the same track as the writer. This film was 206 minutes long and I still left the theater believing that there was more to the story to tell, like the director left the ending open for a sequel. Let's hope not. I guess if you didn't play all three versions of the Silent Hill video game all the way through to the end, you won't know what the heck is going on."
"james-list","9","0","0","14 November 2006"," Enjoyable
","Very impressed, I'm not sure why some people are panning it so hard. While a few of the visual cues are slightly awkward, this stands alone as a film, rather than the typical 'film of a game' rubbish we normally get fed. There's nothing terribly difficult to understand here - surely everyone is familiar with parallel/spirit world concepts by now? The dialogue is fairly basic in places, but certainly not bad. We're not in Uwe Boll territory here, not by a country mile.<br/><br/>So, I like it as a film, but it does score even better as a film adaption of a game. The subject matter has been pretty carefully used I thought, enough changes for it to be coherent, the effects are great, and I particularly like the way they used audio from the games, including the theme tunes. The general look of the film captures the general look of the games perfectly. The one weak link I found was the casting of Sean Bean. He's an excellent actor, but seemed simply mis-cast. His character in this film is fairly helpless, and would have been played better by someone a little younger, and less world weary. No doubt he was included to give the film some star factor."
"fred-83","6","0","0","14 November 2006"," nice, creepy atmosphere
","One of the better horror films for a while. It has a nice, creepy atmosphere, an effective music score which adds character. Nice touch to keep it electronic, makes a change from the typical orchestral sound. The film holds up well for the first hour fifteen minutes, then the plot starts to get a little more convoluted for its own good, and the ending just adds layers of more confusing stuff on top of what has come before. Some things do not need to be explained, and when the explanation just makes everything more confusing, better to leave it alone. These faults aside, it is a well made and atmospheric film which brings back fond memories of the good old 80s, when one first encountered Carpenter, Phantasm, Hellraiser and From Beyond. The focus here is more on the dense atmosphere of the decaying environments than cheap shock scares, which is very welcome. I actually came to think of Orson Welles The Trial, which has a similar surrealistic journey through a nightmarish and decayed world, and can also be described as a horror film in a way."

","This does contain spoilers.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of Silent Hill video games I mean I was like raised on them.<br/><br/>I'm a little disappointed because it didn't follow the complete story line of the game. Like for instance in the game Cybil could be saved in the movie the kick-ass cop is killed. The dad was the main character in the game. The daughters name is actually Cheryell not Sharon. In this game Allysa is not Dahlia's daughter but some other lady. The town is far more active in this movie. In the game there's really no one else that appears to be human there. But actually in my opinion this is a plus make the challenge towards Rose more difficult because so many people are rooting against her. That Teddy guy what ever happened to him in the movie? OH well didn't like him anyway. And the nurse Lisa I actually like them not including all the story on her. I thought her role was better in the movie than the game.<br/><br/>But some things should be different otherwise the game would just be based on cut scenes of the game. I hope this movie will have a sequel."
"kinoini","6","0","0","10 November 2006"," For a game to film adaptation, its a decent horror film.
","Silent Hill, is a 2006 horror film based on the video game of the same name. The movie was directed by Christophe Gans, and stars Radha Mitchell as Rose Da Silva and Jodelle Ferland as her adopted daughter, Sharon. Ferland actually plays two roles in the movie, and does a pretty convincing and frightening job. I have never seen the video game. Well, let me rephrase that, I saw a small snippet of the video game years ago while my son was playing. My impression then was that the game was probably the creepiest I'd ever seen. The movie stays true to my first impression. Its really creepy. <br/><br/>For anyone who is a ""SilentHill"" video game fan, and is feeling particularly protective of this movie, let me say that I liked the film, and in no way mean any disrespect in any comments I make here. Its just my honest opinion. So, peace, man, OK? <br/><br/>As I understand it, fans of the game will be pleased with the movie, since it seems to try to capture the principle characters and theme of the game - so I'm told. Having little or no knowledge of the game, I have to say the movie holds up as a straight-up horror movie. That's not to say that there aren't flaws in the story line, but c'mon, what horror movie doesn't have those? For example, if you're all alone, and the basement is pitch black, there are scary sounds coming from down below, and half your friends have already been brutally killed...do you really go to investigate? Same holds true for Silent Hill. <br/><br/>The basic plot is set-up very quickly in the first few minutes of the movie: Sharon is a troubled young girl, suffering from nightmares about a town called Silent Hill. Her adoptive mother, in an attempt to find answers to her daughter's nightmares, decides to take-off for said town. This is against her husband Christopher's (played by Sean Bean) wishes, and he does what any concerned husband/father would do: cuts off his wife's credit cards. Sure, what better way to help get your wife and daughter get back home, but by cutting off their only source of funds. OK, so let's go along with this. I'm not sure what's more horrifying, the monsters in the movie, or the husband cutting off his wife's only means of coming home. Let me ponder on that one. Nope, its a tie. <br/><br/>We quickly find Rose and Sharon in Silent Hill, which is a creepy, creepy town. There they meet a variety of creatures who appear only after a warning siren is sounded. No, I'm not giving anything away. I have to give extra credit to the director and all those responsible for the creatures and sets. They used very little CGI, and stuck to make-up, real actors in rubber suits, and they actually found a semi-abandoned town to fill in for Silent Hill. This ultimately gives the movie an all around real feeling, and for the most part makes the creatures pretty frightening. <br/><br/>I'd have to say despite the story flaws, and seeming lack of explanation or reason for the appearance (or motive) of some of the creatures, the movie is definitely entertaining, and at times, scary. No, not so much that you are ""actually"" scared, but you know, the kind of scared you let yourself get when you're watching a horror movie. I definitely recommend the movie. <br/><br/>The following might be somewhat of a spoiler, so skip this part if you haven't seen the movie...but you might want to read on, if you'd like to get a chuckle during one scene. Toward the end, Rose has to pass down a dark hallway filled with crazy, murderous monster-like nurses. There are probably about a dozen or so of them, and from the neck down, they are all pretty hot, dressed in short, tight (though tattered) nurse's outfits. Though their faces are disfigured and covered with bandages, they still have their nurse's hats on, and are even wearing high heals. Hmmm. Funny, at least to me. <br/><br/>What makes this scene really funny to me is that the nurses were obviously choreographed (in fact they were, you'll discover if you watch the ""making of"" featurette), and their movements, dressed in their sexy outfits, reminds me of Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video. Use your imagination, you'll see. <br/><br/>Watch for Alice Krige as Christabella. She (Krige) will forever be the queen of the Borg from Star Trek: First Contact. No matter how they change her make-up or character, I can't help but see her in that Borg get up. <br/><br/>Lastly, I recommend watching the extras included with the DVD. The ""making of"" is fascinating; especially seeing the actors who played some of the creatures. Watching these people, without the make-up and lighting, is still, well...creepy. They also go into the location a bit, and its all pretty interesting."

The people of the village were like early 1000s burning witches and stuff There were a couple death scenes but not gory or anything like that. I thought the mother was a little whacky as well at the beginning. The reason I am only giving a 6/10 is because of the weirdness at the beginning.

","There is little that annoys me more that a film sacrificing a moving ending in favour of one that leaves it more open to a commercially viable sequel opportunity. Unfortunately, Silent Hill is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean both excel as the troubled parents of a demonically possessed child, whilst Laurie Holden excites both sympathy and respect as the tough cop trying to cope with supernatural events. Also, Jodelle Ferland performs wonderfully as both innocent and demon, demonstrating a truth unusual to an actress of her age, and Deborah Kara Unger is suitably creepy. Alice Krige is competent in her role of religious nut-case but not particularly memorable, seeming reminiscent of Piper Laurie from ""Carrie"" without the horror.<br/><br/>However, Christophe Gans' direction is virtually immaculate. Simultaneously horrific and beautiful, sweepingly bleak shots are mixed together with scenes of horrific violence seamlessly and, unusually in modern film, logically.<br/><br/>All this being said, I was personally annoyed by the ending of the film. Without giving too much away, I must admit that I found the finale of the movie condescending, where none of the rest of the picture had been. In its shameless promotion of itself this film loses much of its impact, a fact which, despite the profit it may achieve by such a sequel, cheats it of a great deal of emotional impact."

It is a major cliff hanger, and not being sure if a second film will be made does leave you feeling like you want to take a sledgehammer to the TV. All in all, a good film. Maybe not good in the way the director wanted,(i.e a good story) but definitely a good one for those who like gore."
"tnzk","7","0","0","16 September 2006"," Pure, genuine creepiness.
","--CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS-- I'm not a fan of horror-thriller movies. This is partly due to the fact that most of them aim for the 'boo!' factor rather than real haunting ideas or good story lines.. Few films have achieved this in recent times (Exorcism of Emily Rose comes to mind), and Silent Hill is one of them.<br/><br/>Having hardly any knowledge of what or how the Silent Hill games are about, I watched the movie with decent expectations. I came out of the theater quite impressed at what the movie has achieved.<br/><br/>The story is essentially about Rose (Radha Mitchell) and her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), taking a vacation to Silent Hill. Ignorant of the town's past, Rose, en route to Silent Hill, has a sudden car crash. Upon coming out of unconsciousness, she finds her daughter has gone. So begins the journey into the dark secrets of the ghost town.<br/><br/>Rose, through the course of the movie, is seen running through a completely deserted town, which is 'snowing' ashes. In the distance of her vision, she sees what appears to be her daughter, and through the course of the movie she is seen chasing her daughter, who seems adamant on always being out of reach. A run in with the other humans stuck in this horror reveals plot points, until Rose must literally go to the root of all evil to find out where her daughter is.<br/><br/>A few times in the movie, things go 'bad'. The first time, Rose is chasing her daughter, who runs down a set of stairs. As Rose follows her, an air horn sirens. Everything turns dark, until it is pitch black. The true terror then begins.<br/><br/>'Otherworld' Silent Hill is the residence of most of the monsters encountered in this movie, and they are genuinely disturbing. The video game is famous for it's fear-inducing creatures, and its film adaption is certainly no slouch. The first monster encountered is arguably the most terrifying. In typical fashion, it creeps up on the protagonist. However, as well as its appearance and cry, the fact that Rose actually screamed at it's appearance is nothing short of terrific. Most other films depict the victim scared of dying rather than an appearance of a creature; in Silent Hill, the audience sympathizes with Rose as it is obvious she is terrified of the creature. In reality, anything that resembled that monster would generate the same sort of results (We wouldn't look with mild terror like Sarah Michelle Gellar did in 'The Grudge').<br/><br/>However, the monsters become less and less terrifying (although more and more disturbing). The last monster Rose encounters before reaching the turning point in the movie was creepy, but somewhat attractive (the male and female audience in the theater were divided in their reaction). Maybe the film was playing on the idea of an 'attractive killer' (certainly deformed), but it certainly got serious when she started slicing and dicing.<br/><br/>The source of these creatures ties in the plot; there's a reason these kind of monsters exist.<br/><br/>Upon its first view, Silent Hill's plot can lose some people. This could detract some people from the movie, and this has raised some negative comments from the film arena, saying that the game has to be played to be understood. This is not really true. One must see this movie several times before understanding, as not all the information is spoon fed. Some links in the movie can be missed upon the first viewing.<br/><br/>The special effects are quite good, making the otherworldly creatures believable, and the make up is excellent.<br/><br/>The sound effects are creepy. Since one of the video game's strengths was sound effects rather than the element of surprise, it is no surprise then that the movie has followed suit. Although it's not particularly memorable, it heightens and compliments the events on screen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb; it really immerses you into the movie. The three 'versions' of Silent Hill each have a distinct look: the 'normal' Silent Hill has normal lighting, and looks quite normal. The 'foggy' Silent Hill looks foreboding. The 'Otherworld' Silent Hill looks dark and sinister, and the unwelcoming creatures fit right into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Christopher Gans has done an exceptional job of converting the game franchise into a movie. The beginning of the trip to Silent Hill is done almost exactly like the video game that inspired it; even the camera angles are the same. After this, however, he takes full control and applies his vision of Silent Hill: never far from the true plot, yet never following it completely.<br/><br/>In its own right, Silent Hill is an exceptional horror film, and a very good game-film adaption. Sadly enough, it even beats Hollywood's own 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'House of Wax'. Unfortunately, due to the modest marketing and it being a cult video game, it will be overlooked in the running for the 'best video game to movie adaption' category.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Now, I'm probably not the best person to review this film. having played most of the Silent Hill series so far, it would in some respects be very hard for the director to live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>But the reason why the Silent Hill series is going, the reason they managed to get funding to make a MOVIE about it, is that the games are SO F***ING SCARY. Silent Hill 2 is one of the scariest games ever made in my opinion.<br/><br/>So would it be crazy of me to expect the movie to be a LITTLE bit scary? Just a smidgen? But no, just like the terrible Resident Evil films, this is nothing more than a pointless CGI fest, with no sense of pacing or suspense.<br/><br/>Boring."
"azderoth","5","0","0","7 September 2006"," Only half of a good movie
","Where's the other half! I saw this with a friend the day it came out. My friend is an avid player of the Silent Hill games, and I'd often witnessed him navigate different characters through the fog obscured landscape that is Silent Hill. So I'm not unfamiliar with the games.<br/><br/>First, I'll say that the first thirty or forty minutes of the movie feature some of the best horror imagery that I've seen in a long time. It's very minimal; It's simply a person walking around in a spooky town and occasionally being attacked by monsters. It works--it's incredibly effective, and I feel like the movie could go on like that (No words, mind you. No dialog. Just ambient music and imagery allowing me to view into a darker world.} for at least another hour before burning into an effective climax.<br/><br/>And then something happens. Other characters show up and start talking and what they are saying is insanely obvious drivel that somehow intervenes with my pleasure of watching the movie, and instead of stopping it keeps going on, with waves and waves of poorly conceived words, and there's even an expository scene in there somewhere but by that time I've given up on the Silent Hill movie. Certainly there were some interesting deaths in the style of Hellraiser, but it wasn't even remotely interesting enough.<br/><br/>So, basically I thought the movie started off great,with some excellent spook-out moments and minimal dialog, then went down Hill from there. I would probably watch it again, just for the visuals--and to watch Pyramid Head tear the skin off of a woman and throw it around."

","Great atmosphere in the entire movie. I have finished the 4 games multiple times and recommend this movie to all the sh gamers The good thing about the plot is that it borrows many things from the games story(names, locations, monsters and even camera movement in some parts!) but has a new unique story line that leaves just enough to the viewers imagination... The only part i missed in the movie were the riddles that made the sh games stand out from the rest horror VG titles.

"selenedm999","7","0","0","5 September 2006"," beautiful to look at
","Although it's a bit short on plot and depth of character, Silent Hill is a gorgeously filmed bit of horror candy, a cut above your usual slasher/creepy-guy-in the woods movies.<br/><br/>To be fair, it's a movie based on a video game, so I wasn't expecting much, and I was pleasantly surprised at how compelling the visuals really are. Not being a fan of the video game, I wondered why the director didn't flesh out the characters more, because there's plenty to work with, but the visual sensibility of the film more than makes up for this flaw.<br/><br/>Most of what makes horror work is the way it compels us, and this movie redeemed its lack of character depth with its questions of what's driving the characters: love, and a real examination of what faith is. The main character's love for her daughter drives her through hell and back, and her faith saves her without being heavy-handed. Although the villains call themselves faithful, their faith is self-centred, controlling, and destructive. My favourite line in the movie: ""God isn't here."" Recommended for a pleasantly scary ride, if you're a horror fan."
"freaky_dave","6","0","0","4 September 2006"," Starts out well only to fall apart near the end
","I enjoyed the atmosphere of Silent Hill and the visuals. It starts off as a mystery that keeps us in suspense for a long while. It works well when keeping us in the dark, making us second guess what's going on. I liked it a lot up until the point where it suddenly starts giving us answers. After that, the movie starts to unravel into a very gory conclusion that simply takes away from the movie's finer points. I didn't mind the ending, but I think this movie would've worked better if it had not given us so many answers. Granted, I have never played the game, so maybe I'm being a little too harsh.<br/><br/>Still on to the plot. Rose (Radha Mitchell) is the mother of Sharon (Jodelle Ferland). Sharon has been going into trances and sleepwalking and muttering things about a town called Silent Hill. Rose, refusing to accept that her daughter needs to see a psychiatrist, decides to take off with Sharon to the town of Silent Hill to get answers, leaving her husband Christopher (Sean Bean)in the dark. Christopher, once he finds out where they are going, goes after them, but neither he nor Rose knows what terrible events transpired at the town of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Soon Rose is looking for her daughter in the town of Silent Hill after an accident in which Sharon disappears. She is soon joined by a traffic cop (Laurie Holden) who while pursuing Rose on a high speed chase up to Silent Hill was in an accident herself. At first the traffic cop doesn't believe what Rose has to say, but together they discover that Silent Hill is not your average town, and suddenly the officer is helping Rose to find Sharon.<br/><br/>I do believe this movie was a little overlong, and I still can't accept the answers we are finally given. But other than that, Silent Hill had a lot of good things going for it. Still can I recommend it after seeing it? Not quite because I think it would've worked better if it had remained more mysterious and less gory. In fact, the last few minutes of the movie would've had more impact had the movie left us more in the dark."

","First things first. As a fan of the games and a fan of the horror genre, I was apprehensive when I first heard about the project. No-one more than me wanted to see this film made - but made well. I was excited to find out that some of the music from the game was going to be used in the film, as the music was one of the catalysts (along with the dense fog and white noise) for the atmosphere and subdued tension within the game.<br/><br/>Then I saw the film...<br/><br/>I have got to say that Roger Avary wants shooting! I have been a fan of his work with Quentin Tarantino from Reservoir Dogs through to Killing Zoe, but saw little of the sharp dialogue synonymous with these movies. Okay, okay, so it's a 'horror' film and the dialogue generally plays second fiddle to the visuals - but that's no excuse for sloppiness.<br/><br/>Sean Bean was hideously under used, the music was often too contemporary, and for some reason three-quarters of the way through, the film turns into an (even more bizarre!) version of The Wicker Man. On the plus side, the cinematography, costume and set design are near-perfect.<br/><br/>On the whole, Silent Hill fans should at least get something from the film; if only the knowledge that they could've done better. If they had payed as much attention to detail to the narrative as they did to the closing credits, we could have all left the cinema knowing the game to film curse had been lifted.

","I'll preface this by noting that I never played the video game... not that it would make a difference in what I thought of the movie. Someone might care about that.<br/><br/>The Good: Interesting visual effects, plentiful gore and shock value, generally good mood.<br/><br/>The Bad: Some really wooden acting at key climactic moments, waaaaay too predictable when a twist wood have been nice. Experienced horror fans will see the ending coming no more than half an hour into the movie.<br/><br/>The Half Hour Too Long: We could have done without a couple of the preachier, hackneyed speeches and the over-the-top pipe organ music. Seriously, some parts of this movie come off as pretentious and just slow the whole thing down. That's too bad; the pacing in this is pretty good, and certainly no time is wasted in getting to the horror part of the story. There's not much build-up at the beginning, so slowing things down with long speeches about faith and deception really don't wash here.<br/><br/>All in all, it's not the worst thing that's come along lately (hint: it's head-and-shoulders above ""Stay Alive""), but it could easily have been a whole lot better and more interesting. Still, some of the best use of barbed wire and hooks since ""Hellraiser,"" the best burn victim since Freddy Kruger, and an ending that won't disappoint gore hounds."

In the movie this mood is practically nonexistent. Messed up by some of the most annoying camera movements I've ever seen on screen, The bad lighting in the dark scenes and the over-kill of CGI, the movie never is able to set the dark mood that characterized the game. add to the mix the nonsensical convoluted story that only makes sense to fan boys and crappy lines like ""They used to say this place was haunted"", ""I guess they where right"", the movie that promised to be so much, just turned out to be a pile of trash.

","Despite being a big fan of Resident Evil, I never got round to playing the original Silent Hill game on Playstation, and have since spent about half an hour playing the sequel, and found it really boring. But even so, I'm rating this movie based on its own merits, and unfortunately; there aren't many. As you might expect, the film focuses on the spooky ghost town, 'Silent Hill'. It has to be said that director Christophe Gans has done a good job with the atmosphere in the town, but he hasn't done a very good job with the implementation of the action, and Roger Avary's story about Silent Hill is not very interesting. We follow Rose Da Silva; a woman's whose child suffers from trauma in her sleep. When the girl begins to scream 'Silent Hill!' Rose decides to take her to the town that she sees in her sleep. However, it soon becomes apparent that all is now well in the ash covered town, as her husband (Sean Bean, delivering a typically bland performance) finds a website about the town that details its strange history, and Rose finds out about the town's abnormal inhabitants when she comes face to face with them herself...<br/><br/>Probably due to the fact that most video game adaptations these days are rubbish, it would seem the team here were keen to make Silent Hill as 'faithful' as possible...and in doing so, have made a film that would have worked a lot better as a game. The CGI doesn't look good alongside real actors, and because a lot of the film features the characters pondering about creepy locations, it can be very boring. This wouldn't have been a problem if you were playing a game and in control of the characters, but sitting and watching them gets old very fast. The film also seems to have put things that I assume are from the game into the screenplay without a lot of point most of the time; case in point - what was that thing with a metal triangle on its head? The fact that the film runs too long ultimately harms it, as the film soon loses it's way and needs to introduce some kind of cult to further the overly complex and uninteresting story, and it all ends with one of the worst special effects showcases that I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not disappointed with this movie as I'm not a fan of the games anyway; but my lack of disappointment doesn't mean Silent Hill is anything but a bad film."

","A woman brings her daughter to the ghost town of Silent Hill, and then loses her. The rest of the film involves the woman following clues to find her daughter while she is followed by a police officer and her husband. What she encounters is both shocking and unexpected.<br/><br/>Director Christophe Gans loves the game ""Silent Hill"" -- and so do a lot of people. But he really loves it, making sure he was the one to get the director's chair by really lobbying the people funding this project. His love shows in the movie ,where he kept many elements of the game, including exact replicas of maps and some of the original music.<br/><br/>Roger Avary, a noted writer and Quentin Tarantino associate, wrote this film... his love of the game is not known to me. But what is known is that he was not capable of writing a coherent story. His first draft was rejected for having no male characters, so he added them in (which makes a world of difference to the story). But no one ever bothered to tell Roger that a plot has to make sense if you want people to watch and enjoy a movie.<br/><br/>This movie is nonsense. Monster after monster is thrown at the lead character, with one having no known connection to the next. One beast has a sword five times larger than his body, making him just absurd. Things appear and disappear at random. Cops chase you and stalk your kids for no reason. You will find every clue left for you -- in order, in short time, in the most random places (a school desk, a corpse's mouth). Trying to tie this all together later on is great, but not when you've already lost half your audience by the time you get there.<br/><br/>There is one good video game adaptation -- ""Resident Evil"" (if there's another one, let me know). Part of what made it great is that the writer did not sit and say to himself, ""how much of the game can I push into this script?"" Movies and games are a different world. The original Super Mario Bros movie is a great example of what happens when you try to put game aspects into a movie in the ""real world"".<br/><br/>So, how can we make ""Silent Hill"" better? First, editing. The movie is over two hours long, and there is no reason for this. Second, and most importantly, reduce the number of monsters. Yes, I like a good monster and even though the special effects and CGI were annoying I liked the spitter... but throwing in ten monsters where two or three will be fine is uncalled for, confusing and bogs down the viewer. If the viewer is me, my ability to believe what I'm watching will die faster than a goldfish in toilet.<br/><br/>I will say the acting was good... except for the little girl. I saw her paraded around the talk shows when the movie came out and she seemed very intelligent and a nice kid. But I'm sorry, she was so fake in the film. Every line seemed so forced. Ugh! Although almost everyone I know likes this film, I have to say they're seeing something I'm not. I want this part of my life back. And while most films can get a second chance from me if they ask nicely, no matter how awful they are (like ""Lady in the Water""), this one never will. I really hope it goes out of print and stays that way."

"andydudey2k4-1","3","3","8","23 April 2006"," No, it's not an accurate movie at all.
","Why anyone would like this steaming pile of dog crap must be on drugs, or never played the games. There was so much wrong with this movie. I can excuse the change of the characters and little minor details as creative license but the storyline is horribly mangled that there is little that could save it. The monsters and town were faithfully translated onto the big screen, but not the plot.<br/><br/>There was no plot. Alessa, in the movies was burned by the church because she was allegedly the spawn of the demon. Then there was a coal fire that was written into the story because the director thought it was cool. She then lashes out at the townspeople by trapping them in a hellish limbo with monsters.<br/><br/>First of all, in the games, Alessa creates the ghost town to get away from Dahlia, not to lash out at some church that burned her from being hell spawn. In fact, there wasn't even a friggin' church like that in the game to begin with. There was a cult, but they weren't wacko puritans like they are in the film. They were concerned with giving birth to a god named Samael, which was nonexistent in this movie. That alone knocks this film to mediocre status right away. If the major plot device in the game doesn't exist, then what good is it? That makes this movie just an empty shell that capitalizes on the shock value of the gore of the series, and nothing more. All the director and screenwriter meant to do by creating this movie was say ""Hey there are monsters, they are scary, let the masses just focus on them, and not the lack of plot."" About half-way, the movie begins to suck. The screenwriter must've realized that the story was too butchered to continue with a bang, so the plot becomes dragged-out, and boring. There was no point for any of the story after Rose and Cybil reach the hotel. And they should've ended it there, but they didn't. At the end, Rose and Sharon are trapped in the limbo world for whatever reason. They must've given up hope in trying to explain anything, and just decided to end the story as quick as possible, no matter the cost of reason.<br/><br/>There were nice little references back to the games which were nice little touches, but they were overshadowed by the sheer amount suckiness. The little 30 second clips of some of the music tracks from the first two games were kinda neat, and the faithful monsters and town give this movie a little boost in the cool-factor, but they alone couldn't save this travesty.<br/><br/>Don't go see this film.

","I have only played the fourth video game for the xbox console and this was exactly like the video game. Obviously the characters were different but the style was the same. You find clues and darkness and noises are a part of the game. Overall it was one of the best horror films i have seen in a long time and the games are wonderful as well. I would say that some of the dialogue in the film is a little corny but the action and the horror is right on. It just has that amazingly weird feel to the whole thing. If you have played the first two games you will recognize a lot of things, and i'm not sure if the story is the same but it was pretty darn good if you ask me. There are some really gory scenes but for the most part I thought they did a good job of making it scary without just putting in a lot of nasty stuff."

Moreover, for more than half the movie, I found myself rooting for the monsters and other assorted oddities to kill off Rose, as she came across as a whiny, know nothing soccer mom who should've left well enough alone.<br/><br/>The only parts of the movie I truly enjoyed were the very beginning where they 'find' Silent Hill and the very end.<br/><br/>There were some parts in between I didn't mind also, but the rest of this movie is DRECK and it ends suddenly, like MANY Hollywood movies seem to anymore.<br/><br/>Sure, the shocker ending was a nice twist, but all in all, save your money for better movies, because this was as horrid a translation as most other game to movie translations go."

"gregsrants","3","3","9","23 April 2006"," Too long and uninteresting
","Question: When should a horror movie be 2+ hours? Answer: Never With all apologies to the Fangoria readers and McFarlane figurine collectors, scary films should not be pushing the envelope with our patience and extending past the magical two hour timeline.<br/><br/>The reason why should be as clear as the nose about to be hacked off the front of your face. It is too hard to keep things hopping, keep thing haunting and keep things gruesome for that extended length of time. That, and keep any of the audience's interest. Hell, even a dreaded visit to the in-laws loses its shock value after two hours. So how long can you sit through stabbings, decapitations and the usual bloodletting before you just feel exhausted or start to edit the movie in your own head thinking of scenes that could have been left of the editing room floor allowing you the extra time to make Smores before settling in for a night of an Extreme Makeover : Home Edition marathon.<br/><br/>This theory seems to have been lost on the producers of the new video game turned movie, Silent Hill. Instead of thinking about maintaining suspense and producing thrills within the control of a good paced film, they instead have put together a mess of film that stretches 127 minutes from curtain up to lights on.<br/><br/>Since it would seem that the screenwriter didn't spend much time on the script, I won't spend much time on its description. In short, a young girl has nightmares about a place called Silent Hill, a town ravaged by fire many years ago. The mother then takes said child to Silent Hill (who wouldn't?). The child goes missing. The mother must enter into the bowls of hell to retrieve her daughter while up against a coven of Silent Hill refugees.<br/><br/>At least that is what I think what happens. As these movies go, this one is a little confusing. That, or I lost interest in trying to figure it all out between highlighting my watch to see how much of my evening was consumed.<br/><br/>For you horror fans, there is some bloodshed to keep you entertained, and for those of you that like weird creatures a la the video game world, there is plenty of that too. What there isn't is interest. I didn't care about the young girl and I sure as hell didn't care about the fate of her mother Rose (whose name if uttered repeatedly as if the writer had a word count commitment on the script and used it as filler). By the time the movie begins to reveal a few things and we find that we are watching less the outtakes from Constantine, but more a cross between The Crucible and The Village, I didn't have feeling in my neck that was struggling not to find a nice shoulder to nap on.<br/><br/>Silent Hill was directed by Christope Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) who looks to have plenty of ideas, but no idea of how to put it all together. His use of color was interesting having the town all covered in a grey soot and the townspeople in fabrics that that shied away from anything that might be found on a rainbow. But this might be more of an adaptation of the game which I have never seen rather than from Gans frontal lobe.<br/><br/>What he isn't able to do is develop any kind of character (his use of Sean Bean is still puzzling), pull off anything remotely terrifying and most importantly, keep a pace that will want us to sit through the scenes between skin pullings and burning at the stakes.<br/><br/>That makes Silent Hill a typical early spring horror flick. It will open big, lose 70% of its audience in week two once word gets out and finally end up on DVD shelves where the young teenagers will eat it up.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

","The previews for this movie looked pretty scary, so I couldn't wait for me and 4 friends to go see it. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Seriously, the movie was not scary at all, in fact, we could hardly contain our laughter. Luckily, everyone else in the theater was also laughing, so it wasn't a problem. The acting wasn't good, but it was probably due to the very poor dialog. If that had been better it would have helped the movie, but even if you attempt to look past it, the plot falls through and at the end we all felt like we had waisted a lot of time and money. I just kept waiting of it to be over, but it kept going for 2 1/2 hours! If you want a good laugh or are a huge fan of the video game, then knock yourself out, but if you want to see a thriller or scary movie, this isn't it. Save yourself the pain of seeing this movie."

The acting was pretty bad and even though there were some creepy moments it didn't make up the fact that it was a terrible movie. The camera didn't know when to stay still. I'm a fan of CG and for the most part it was a descent combination of CG and live action but there were a lot of moments in the this movie that looked like it was done for a video game. It really felt like I was watching some one play the game instead of watching a movie. It moves just like a video game in the sense where if you go around a corner you realise that you need a certain object before entering a room. This movie just goes right in with the other terrible video game movies...at this rate I don't really think that there will be any good video game movies."
"tbaa_andrea","6","3","9","21 April 2006"," C, C+, Warning: Major spoilers at the end of the Review!!
","It wasn't a bad movie, but I have to admit, the video game really drew you in a lot more.<br/><br/>Despite the lousy graphics of the Playstation 1, I still found myself getting chills, gasping and at one point actually screaming throughout the game. Silent Hill 3, great graphics, a better storyline than silent hill 1, decent level of scariness. And this is coming from someone who usually plays a video game until it gets too hard then quits. I'm not what you would call a ""gamer"", but the silent hill games I couldn't stop playing. I still get chilled even the third time around.<br/><br/>This movie... The problem is I think they tried to stuff themes from all three games into one movie. It just didn't seem to fit.<br/><br/>The addition of the ""Father"" character was unnecessary. I LOVE Sean Bean. He's one of my favorite actors and major HOT! but the character he plays... what was the point? What did the ""father"" add to the show? He got about as many answers as the audience did. big fat zero. So in essence, he was kind of just eye candy. But that detracts from the action that could be going on in Silent Hill. Also, The changing of Harry Mason to Rose DeSalva was unnecessary really. I mean, Sure, Harry would seem a bit like a wussy in the movie, but what did Rose do? She didn't fight any of the creatures like he did in the game. Some of the most intense action that drew you into the game was the fighting of the demon creatures. They didn't have any of that at all!! All she did was scream and run most of the time. And the one time she finally gets a weapon, she doesn't use it as a weapon and she drops it along the way.<br/><br/>The demon creatures... they were not used the way they should have been. If you played the game, they were everywhere- They were what caused the height of the scary moments, the scene in Silent Hill 1 the game where you're in a locker room, you open a locker where knocking noises are coming from and its empty so you turn to leave then BAM! that scared the crap out of me! They had no moments like this in the movie. I could count the number of times they actually used demon creatures on my hands, and Rose spent more time screaming and running from them that you never got to really enjoy the disturbing scariness of them.<br/><br/>I also don't understand the separation of Daliah who in the game was the mother of Alessa AND the bad guy- into Daliah the mother of Alessa and Crystabel, the bad guy. That was an extra character they didn't need.<br/><br/>I loved the actors they chose for each role however. They all did a great job. The woman playing Cybil looked perfect for the part. (Hate what happened to the character. That I won't give away but it was stupid). but all in all, acting wise the movie was great.<br/><br/>But writing wise, it seemed to lack a lot. Like I said, I think they were trying to shove all three video games into one movie. They added unnecessary characters, they didn't utilize any of the scary moments from the game that they could have, and.... <br/><br/>Spoiler: WARNING: Spoiler <br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie stop reading! This is about the ending! <br/><br/>The ending made no sense to me at all. are they dead? Are they alive? I mean, it was so ambiguous. In Silent Hill 3, the little girl is suppose to grow up to be Heather Mason who the video game revolves around. I guess if they're dead, and ghosts walking around... they've killed the ability to make that sequel into a movie. So I don't get it. What was up with that ending?<br/><br/>End Spoiler! <br/><br/>so in other words, it could have been worse, but it could have been better. I liked it for the most part... I really liked the acting and the actors they chose, I liked the visuals and the idea of using actual people instead of all CGI for the creatures, but there was so much that the writers dropped the ball on, that While I enjoyed it, I was a bit disappointed as well. C+. (Man Sean Bean is cute.) While his character was pointless, I'm glad he was in it. lol. (Too bad they just didn't keep Harry Mason as the main character with Sean Bean as Harry. That would have rocked!)"
"ola_658","6","6","24","21 April 2006"," A visually stunning mess.
","I had to checkout this movie as soon as possible due to all the dividing reviews and opinions it is getting, I just came back from a early screening and I have to say, I agree with the critics. What was that? Visually the movie was beautiful, but the plot was so stupid and the acting so poor it really destroys all that imagery. I did not understand the end, so she gets her child goes home, but can't be seen by her husband? Why? I thought it was only silent hill that deteriorated? The killing was just over the top nonsense. The first 40 minutes of the movie is pretty good, than it just completely drops the ball and gets silly, silly explanations are used to explain why the town has changed.<br/><br/>If I were to have made this movie, I would have probably based the whole thing around rose and her looking for her daughter, no stupid cult, no stupid husband or pointless police....just her traveling through this twisted town would have been perfect, a sort of Alice in wonderland on acid. I blame most of this on Roger Avary who obviously did not know what he was writing about, except for keeping it simple and linear he puts too much ideas in the movie and it heavily suffers for it. It is such a shame because Gans is obviously a great visual director, but a average story teller, with heavy editing this could have been a great movie.<br/><br/>Very disappointing 3/10"
"Lando_Hass","2","5","19","21 April 2006"," This movie's story is like diarrhea....it's messy, unpleasant to go through, and all over the place
","Let me tell you a little story about today: I usually go for a workout in the morning everyday. Not today. Why? Because I wanted to see Silent Hill before I had to actually go to work, because I wouldn't be able to work out and see Silent Hill and have enough time to get to work. I saw Silent Hill today, I saw it because I wanted to be the first of all the people I know to see it. I went in expecting nothing so that most likely I'd be wowed by anything given such low expectations. Well, let me tell you, bruh, I never went to see a movie at the theater, expect crap, and get exactly that: Crap. That's what Silent Hill is.<br/><br/>Before I went to the theater, I read Ebert's review about how it made no sense. I was like, ""Nah, his mind power isn't as bad-ass as mine, I'll understand it."" I was wrong. Even mind power as bad-ass as mine couldn't understand what the hell was going on in this pile. Let me explain:<br/><br/>The story is based off of the game, the first one, and it does that well. The movie looks bad-ass, the monsters are cool, and it had the perfect atmosphere. What did Roger Avery and Critophe Gans do with all that? Well, Avery wrote one crappy-ass script that made the absolute littlest amount of sense possible. Let me explain:<br/><br/>Spoilers!<br/><br/>In the end, we are told that Sharon is a manifestation of a little girl that was killed in Silent Hill thirty years earlier. Sharon is a manifestation of the girl's good side, and the evil girl in Silent Hill (the one that looks exactly like her) is the evil manifestation. Okay, but here's where I'm confused: How can a manifestation of someone live in a fully functional reality, and how could this manifestation be brought into this reality by an evil manifestation? Now, I'd forgive these things if all this took place in an alternate world, but it doesn't, some of these things happen on EARTH. How? Guess ol' Roger Avery forgot to mention that.<br/><br/>The movie also runs at two damn hours. After first, I was like, ""Damn, two hours, that's great!"" Then I noticed that the movie sucked, which meant two hours of CRAP. The movie is so damn incoherent and all over the place that you don't know what the hell's going on at all. Why are the daughter and mom in Silent Hill? What purpose do they serve there other than to show off the cool monsters? WHAT?!<br/><br/>The movie is also repetitive as holy hell. Let me explain: It's daylight. Emergency horn thing goes off. Cool monsters come. Gets dark. Horn goes off. Daylight comes back. Repeat. That's basically it. While the movie looks cool as hell, it never stops and explains what could be a complex and cool plot. Instead, it just has a plot, and scenes that are more confusing than the one that came before it. What's worse is that none of these scenes explain ANYTHING AT ALL.<br/><br/>People can give their interpretations and THEIR explanations, but the movie itself did not explain jack. If this were a truly good movie, it'd explain what happened within it's run time, while still letting viewers give their own interpretation. That's what Jacob's Ladder did.<br/><br/>Cristophe Gans also said that this is a part of a saga, which is why it made no sense. Come on, bruh, that's no excuse to skimp on a movie's story structure and story development. It's just cheap and it says how clever-less you and the writer are.<br/><br/>The movie also wasn't scary AT ALL. The games were scary as hell.<br/><br/>I should bring this up for fun, too: Roger Avery says that former friend Quentin Tarantino stole all his ideas and took credit for them. After seeing Tarantino's work and Avery's, I highly, highly doubt that Tarantino would steal from a guy who wrote this incoherent, messy, diarrhea-like turd. I hope Avery's reading this part. Now, the movie looks good and follows the game, something most adaptations don't do, but it still sucked. Silent Hill 2 would have made a better movie, just so long as it was handled by a more skilled writer. <br/><br/>This movie...is like diarrhea. It's unpleasant to look at, it's messy, and like diarrhea, it's all over the place. That pretty much sums up the movie and it's incoherent story. <br/><br/>Score: 2 out of 10. <br/><br/>Sorry, bruh, but this movie sucked. Go watch Doom. I'm expecting the following above this review: ""0 out of 10,000 people found this review helpful."" Why? Because those that like this movie don't want to admit it makes no sense whatsoever. My God, how hard is it to make a decent video game-to-movie adaptation? It works for books and comics."

Then, instead of seeking medical attention for the kid, mom decides to take her to a ghost town.

","Silent Hill, the movie, showed such promise. The characters were setup perfectly, and the introduction to the town followed the thematic and psychological elements to a ""T"". However, once the setting was developed, and the first, true ""dream state"" location was finished (trying to avoid the slightest spoilers, here), the psychological elements were completely dropped for 100% nonsensical gore-fest garbage. The Silent Hill series was built upon the deep-seated, often unspoken fears and stigmas that dwell in the hearts of at least most of humanity... The type of horror that begets visceral reactions that can be felt without seeing the actual viscera of the characters in the story. ""Helplessness and hopelessness"", the ""unknown"", ""taboo"", ""caricature/effigy"", the ""abuse or twisting of innocence"", the ""violation of things perceived as sacred"" - all are hallmarks of the Silent Hill games, and all are far more gut-level terrifying than any gore that the special effects team could show on screen.

","First off I have not played any of the computer games, only seen minor sections of one or two, so I went into this film with a completely open mind hoping to see a good thriller/horror.<br/><br/>I would like to think I gave Silent Hill a fair chance, as in I endured it to the very end but I found it to be one of the most boring, nonsensical and above all NOT scary films I have ever seen. I was at least expecting to jump once during this film as I had head from friends that the games were quite atmospheric and gave them a couple of good scares back in the day, sadly not so with the cinematic take on the vaguely related tale.<br/><br/>The special effects were adequate, as you would expect from any film of recent times but the creatures and scenarios created with them failed to impress me in the slightest.<br/><br/>There were also several things throughout the film that just had me thinking the characters were beyond moronic. An example that springs to mind is when pyramid head has two protagonists trapped in a closet. He manages to locate them, and pierce a solid metal door with a sword too big to swing or thrust in any hallway, and is swiftly subdued by a small metal pipe of some kind between the handles of the door. This had me scratching my head thinking A) ""If he can lift that sword he could easily batter down that door"" and B) ""Why the hell doesn't he put that blade to good use and cut the bloody metal pipe!"" But by far and away, above everything else the thing I hated about this move was the ending. What the hell was that?! I came away thinking well are they dead? are they in a different dimension? or just the wrong bloody house (which wouldn't have surprised me). I thought it must have just been me being dense, or that I had missed some kind of key ""plot twist"" but no apparently many of the people I have since spoken to had the same feelings of confusion and mild disgust at the finale of this pathetic story.<br/><br/>I believe this movie can be best summed up by the exclamations of one chav at the back of my screening, when at one point when the screen just goes completely white, he yelled ""WHAT THE F***!!!"". I would not recommend this film to anyone or watch it again if you paid me. A definite must-miss"

","When I look at reviews, I frequently find that movies that are extremely disliked, and extremely liked, simultaneously, by different viewers,sometimes turn out to be classics.Some movies,by being ahead of their time, or for various other reasons,engender strong opinions to one extreme or another (check out ""eraserhead's"" reviews).<br/><br/>But sadly,in this case, ""silent hill"" does not follow this trend.It was so flawed scriptwise that my ""suspension of disbelief"",which should be allowed in fictional works of art,could only hold me for about 30 minutes,after which time,I walked out.<br/><br/>I found, in that short time, six actions in opposition to the actions of rational human beings,mainly involving the mother:<br/><br/>1.Mama drives her very young daughter,in opposition to her husband's wishes,in the middle of the night,to a dilapidated ghost town, in an attempt address the problem of her daughter's sleepwalking,on the basis of her daughter's repeated vocalization of the name ""silent hill"",without first seeking professional help.<br/><br/>2.Mama's desire to accomplish this ridiculous task is so strong that she is willing to endanger both her, and her daughter's lives, by engaging the police in a high speed chase, in the rain, no less.<br/><br/>3.Papa,during these critical first few hours,in which he takes such steps as to suspend mama's credit card,leaves his phone unattended, so that mama gets a recorded message when she tries to call him for help.<br/><br/>4.When mama is in handcuffs, both her and her police chaperon are attacked by a no-armed sub-human beastie.Instead of her responding "" do you believe me now officer?"", which would have put a nice coda on her previous desperate attempts to sway the cop over to her side,she bolts, handcuffs and all.<br/><br/>5.At the roadblock,when the fuzz asks for some form of background as to why the wife left, who she is with, etc... all hubbie can do is to stupidly repeat ""let's start looking"",while turning his head rapidly toward the dark ground under the bridge.<br/><br/>6.How did that girl tied up in the bathroom stay there undisturbed all this time.Did no one ever go to that town ever again?This is probably addressed later,but I wasn't waiting to find out.I hope the writers enjoyed their pot."

","I'm sad to say that I was massively disappointed when watching this feature. It falls incredibly short of the glory of the first two Silent Hill's made by Konami. Anyone who says, ""This movie is like the game,"" is unfortunately, sadly mistaken. I had the same feeling when I watched the Resident Evil movie. Why must movie makers butcher works of originality? If one is to make something and give it a name, it must be called a name which in unique to itself. The Silent Hill movie storyline was mass-proportionately changed from the Sony Playstation's original title by Konami. The main character was not a woman. The little girl's name was ""Cheryl,"" not ""Sharon."" The pyramid-head demon was a nemesis fought by the character(s) in Silent Hill 2, and never even entered the storyline in Silent Hill 1 for Playstation; especially with Cybil the police officer in the same game. There were no cell phones in the original game, because THE YEAR WAS LIKE 1975, right? My advice to movie makers is that if you are going to make a movie based off of a video game or other work of originality: DO NOT CHANGE A SINGLE ELEMENT AND HAVE THE NERVE TO CALL IT THE SAME TITLE!! If you want to make something and change it a little, fine, but for God sakes, don't give it the same name and put it off as the original."

","I've read so many comments calling this film a good or accurate video game adaptation. If it is accurate, then I intend to never play the games. But good? Well, let me put it this way, if the people telling me this film is good told me that the sky at midday is blue, I would get another opinion. To me, there are three kinds of video game film. The good (Resident Evil), the ones that are bad but funny (Wing Commander, Double Dragon), and then there is the kind that Silent Hill are. So excruciatingly boring that they make one feel like time has come to a complete stop. Einstein's theory of relativity is proved here, because having a modeling file poked into my urethra for two hours would seem to take less time than would watching Silent Hill once more. Maddox once wrote of Daredevil that the two most important characters, Transition and Cohesion, were missing. These characters are almost all that Silent Hill has, with Motivation, Background, or Investment sitting somewhere backstage with their fists stuck in varying orifices.<br/><br/>From what I could discern, the plot revolves around an adopted daughter whose constant fits of sleepwalking and cries about a place called Silent Hill drive a woman to take the girl to the town she has been moaning about in a strangely coherent manner. Shortly after arriving there, we are given the impression that these two have somehow entered a parallel dimension in which strange demonic creatures roam the night, and the town is somehow deserted save for a group of cultists during the day. None of the mechanics of the situation are explained to us. Whereas Resident Evil was kind enough to inform us from the get-go that it would be concerned with an evil conglomerate that funds its aggressive incursion into the free market with secret biological warfare research, Silent Hill expects us to piece together the background for ourselves. The problem here is that unless you have played the video game on which the film is based, you are going to have a very hard time understanding the how or why. For two solid hours I waited in vain for something to explain the situation.<br/><br/>What makes it even worse is that when the film does stoop to explaining what on Earth has been going on for the last couple of hours, no real answer is provided. We hear how a girl has been burned to death by some incredibly sick people and that she somehow disrupts the entire spiritual balance of the town around her so that it is sucked into the tenth level of hell. No word, however, is given on what mechanics allow her to accomplish this. It is literally as if the director chose to cut out every scene or piece of dialogue that would allow the story to make any kind of sense. No explanation is offered as to what the various creatures of the Hill are, either. Often, their powers or abilities are displayed only for plot convenience, or because the director thought they might look cool. Look, maybe I am going about this the wrong way, so I will ask you a question about building in order to get my point across. If you build a flash-looking brick house that has three layers of brick all forming an outer wall that little can break through, yet build the foundations out of cardboard, do you expect the house to stand up? What makes it even worse is that a great cast is wasted upon this abortion. <br/><br/>Radha Mitchell, I was against from the get-go for her part in Mozart And The Whale, another piece of garbage written by a screenwriter who simply cannot write. Sean Bean is so grossly underused that you could literally blink at the right times and miss most of his scenes. Deborah Kara Unger and Alice Krige could have made great foils, but the script does not allow their characters a semblance of nuance. Their performances seem phoned in because their characters are cardboard cutouts. Laurie Holden does the best she can with the role of a policewoman, but she ends up bearing the brunt of the nonexistent foundation. Her character has no real motivation to follow our hero and her daughter up the road, and even less to join our hero on what would undoubtedly seem like delusion. None of the characters behave like real people, even when they have all sorts of convincing plot reasons to do so.<br/><br/>All this could have been forgiven, but Silent Hill also suffers from having half an hour worth of plot stretched to a length just north of two hours. The Twilight Zone used to wrap up this kind of plot in around forty minutes or so. I swear, if I had seen that same shot with a silhouetted girl running away from the hero one more time, I was going to burn down the cinema in protest. Speaking of protest, I thought it was a rule in cinema that when you have a vague or symbolic ending, you do something beforehand to explain what your symbology means, or give your audience a clue to react to when the credits roll. Which brings me to summarising what Silent Hill is. Just as Jennifer Lynch tried to confuse us into acquittal with Boxing Helena, Christophe Gans tries the same trick with Silent Hill. Just as Lynch failed, so too does Gans, although the real failure in this case comes from Gans' laziness. It becomes incredibly obvious after thirty minutes that he just did not give a crap about this project.<br/><br/>For that reason, I am giving Silent Hill a two out of ten. I have seen plenty of bad films made out of video games, but this is the first I can officially call boring."
"Bobske_","10","2","5","15 June 2006"," Silent Hill, not so silent...
","Like many of you, I'm a big fan of the Silent Hill games. The creepy atmosphere, the music, the characters and the setting made this game a terrifying horror fest. I always hoped someone would turn this game into a movie. But than again, most video game adaptations were really crappy. I always get the feeling that the people responsible for the adaptations don't really care about the games or even know the games. Tomb Raider 1 & 2 were OK attempts, even thought I think the movies had NOTHING in common with the game except for the heroine. Resident Evil wasn't bad and I actually liked the Mortal Kombat movies. Too bad one of my favorite games, Alone In The Dark, was totally raped. Even when the director knows what he/she is doing, most video game adaptations suffer from a case of bad-scripteritus. I sincerely believe that scriptwriters underestimate the powerful storytelling of some games. OK, Doom doesn't really have a story, but games like Silent Hill do. <br/><br/>I've been a big fan of Christophe Gans ever since I saw Crying Freeman and Les Pactes de Loups (The Brotherhood of the Wolf). I knew that Gans was a gamer and I also knew that he was a big fan of the Silent Hill games. If Gans was handed a good script, this movie was going to be incredible! <br/><br/>Movie fans who have seen Gans' Le Pact des Loupes, know that he can create an amazing movie atmosphere. The combination of great cinematography, great sound effects, well choreographed action sequences, the amazing settings and a good script based on a French legend, make Le Pact des Loupes an amazing movie. Clearly, Gans was the man to successfully complete the daunting task of bringing the Silent Hill experience to the general movie public.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is an amazing movie. The atmosphere is just right and properly recreated onto the big screen by using amazing artsy graphics, great sound effects and recognizable tunes from the Silent Hill games. The movie starts right away and people unfamiliar with the Silent Hill setting or story lines portrayed in the games, might be a tad confused for the first half hour or so. Then again, people unfamiliar with the storyline probably won't be able to appreciate the details and odd characters that inhabit Silent Hill and also might not be able to fully enjoy several ""goose bump moments"" like the first time you hear the siren wail, the crackling of the phone, the terrifying screams of the creatures roaming in Silent Hill or the first encounter with Pyramid Head. Aside from that fact that Silent Hill is IMHO a good recreation of the game, the movie also does well as a horror movie. The gore, the blood, the creatures, the creepy atmosphere and all other things a good horror movie needs, are present in this movie. I believe this movie will appeal to a wide variety of movie fans, or at least I hope<br/><br/>People who had a hard time understanding this movie, probably had a difficult time understanding a lot of other movies. This may sound a little harsh, but it's not that difficult. I actually like the ending of the movie because it leaves some room for speculation and also provides the viewer with a feeling of dread and uneasiness. Hey, after all, it's Silent Hill! This movie makes great use of sound effects, recognizable game tunes and is visually very pleasing. Although the story has been done before, it is very well executed, Silent Hill style. I do hope that some directors *cough* Uwe Boll *cough* take a look at this movie and finally learn how to do a proper video game adaptation.<br/><br/>I do have to admit that I also took another factor into account when I rated this movie. I saw this movie when I was on vacation in San Diego. I had a great time and was in a great mood, so that might have influenced my rating a tad, but after seeing the movie again in my home town I knew that my rating did the movie justice<br/><br/>In short, the best Vid-Adap yet!<br/><br/>10 out of 10 stars."

","This film was abysmal. If you liked the games then go ahead and watch it, but if not then i don't think there's much for you here. The film is comprised of alternating scenes of the lead character screaming (it really is loud, so turn down your speakers) and her husband shouting. Now, the scenes where she is screaming contain all the usual gory monsters and all that stuff, but there's no real horror or fear here. there's no attempt to make the viewer feel uneasy if they've ever seen blood before and, of course, the lead characters constant screaming will stay with you for several hours after you leave. the scenes with her husband are generally quite dull and don't really add anything to the film (since the narrative doesn't really exist). if you've read a blurb/synopsis for this film then thats what happens in the film. there's nothing else there.. at all.<br/><br/>overall I'm giving this a pathetic 3/10 because my ears are still ringing and i got no entertainment from this film whatsoever. 13 ghosts, house on haunted hill, resident evil, et al, all do this so much better so just watch one of them instead."

","As a whole this movie seems to be a thriller. But as the audience is introduced to the plot in its entirety you feel a bit mishandled. The premise of the movie was a mystery to me as I had never played the video game with the same title or even read any reviews beforehand. In fact i was under the impression that this was a zombie movie( an impression that I stubbornly held onto until the point where the girl's skin was ripped off). <br/><br/>I guess that I was shocked and surprised, a little horrified, and for the most part let down. I am what some people might call religious. I am a Christan and I live my life through the understanding given me by lessons I have learned and things I have experienced. Now experience teaches me that man as a whole is evil, but we are redeemed by Jesus. So the idea that an entire community could be cast into hell and tormented by the demon populous is actually based in fact. So although I have to say I received no satisfaction from this movie I can say that it is slightly accurate. <br/><br/>I have to be a little upset that this is passed off as a R rated movie, when in fact there should be a much stronger warning label on it. Being adults we are entitled to watch what we will, but There were children in the theater I was in, brought in with their parents and exposed to scenes of horrible graphics that if I had known existed, I would not have watched it myself. So in the future proper labeling on movies please.<br/><br/>I am a little put off that this is what passes for entertainment more recently. I mean what ever happened to the horror movies that were fun to watch? Ones that didn't have such a deep disturbing spiritual premise that would give grown people nightmares. I remember a time when you could laugh at a scary movie, or leave the theater with a good feeling. Why do we all support movies that are so obviously wrong?<br/><br/>I'll get off of my soapbox now, sorry. Good storyline, excellent acting, way too much gore, and supernatural premise made me sick to my stomach. Next time properly warn us OK?"

","Silent Hill joins films such as Street Fighter and Tomb Raider 1 in the ""crap-films-based-on-computer-games"" hell bucket. Now, this is a horror film, but I feel that the real horror is that I wasted two hours and £5.80 on this.<br/><br/>It felt quite like forever before it got going, and the middle of it is OK. But the end...Christ. The ending really put the nails back in the coffin. Possibly the worst ending to a film ever. It truly does suck. The film generally is just boring with some weird freaky/grotesque images and gore. I very nearly fell asleep twice during this. I only watched it to the end merely in the surprisingly false hope that it would get better. OK, it kind of did in the middle. I even said to the friends I watched it with ""Tell me what that was we just saw for the past two hours"" during the end credits. I had to go to work after watching this but I actually quite couldn't wait for it during. It's really that boring. <br/><br/>The film consists of a woman looking around an abandoned derelict town after her daughter runs for a long long time before finding clues for a sometimes confusing storyline.<br/><br/>The acting in this is quite good despite being over-the-top at times, and does suit the film well, which is a real shame. The effects are good as well; another sympathy point. Production and direction are very good; yet another sympathy point. Yep, you've guessed what I'm saying: this could've way so much better.<br/><br/>For those who like the game, you might just like this. Otherwise, this isn't worth your precious time or money."

","This movie was by far the worst movie I've seen recently. The ""monsters"" weren't really scary, they were either gross or comical. The acting was certainly nothing to write home about. A cameo or a scene that was actually believable and/or scary might have been nice, but I doubt they could have really saved the movie.<br/><br/>The fact that it was based on a video game, which I did not know going into the movie, explains a lot. While I can see it being a decent video game, it was not a good movie. I think the only people who can delude themselves into thinking that this was a good movie are those who were already fans of the game.

","My friend and I decided to see Silent Hill mostly because the imagery contained in the trailers intrigued us. In this the movie didn't disappoint. From the odd ashen ""snowfall"" to the claustrophobic interiors, the movie does far better on the big screen than it will on the small.<br/><br/>It was also nice to see Alice Krige again. Some actors get stereotyped, and this seems to have happened to Ms. Krige, who has played some very odd characters in her career. From the Ghost in ""Ghost Story"" (her best role, in the movies I've seen her in) to a scientist become eco-druid-temptress in ""Habitat"" to the Borg Queen in ""Star Trek: First Contact,"" her roles put her in the company of great character actors such as John Caradine.<br/><br/>As far as Silent Hill's plot, well...<br/><br/>My friend and I laughed all the way through this movie. To the point where we were sore from laughing.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot was clichÃ©. Toss a bit of ""6th Sense, Just a dash of X-men (for the mutant-revenge angle), a fair dose of ""Hellraiser"" (for the overall imagery, gore and omnipresent, oppressive entity or force)and any movie about the Salem Witch Trials, and you'll end up with something very like Silent Hill.<br/><br/>There were may unintentionally funny moments. In one scene the main character memorizes the interior map of a hospital; right, left, right, right... she mutters this to herself for some time while you remind yourself that the movie was based on a video game. Your thumbs start to ache as the dialog continues.<br/><br/>In another scene,a gaggle of demonic-ally-possessed undead nurses (!) lurch down a dark hallway towards the camera. I've no doubt that the extras were dancers... who knew the undead could be so buxom and toned? As they continued to lurch, I found myself humming a pop beat from the 80's, expecting both a voice-over from Vincent Price and an appearance from the gloved one. No such luck.<br/><br/>There was much much more. In one shot a police officer fires a few shots at some baddies then, after keeping them at bay by keeping her gun trained, grins and explains (to those that will later kill her) that she was out of bullets. In another horror movie, this person might have been the one who went into the barn alone, to see what was there.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is an impressive looking movie at most times, but that's about it."

It is never ever really explained what the hell Silent Hill is, only brief mentions of some underground coal fire in the town, but what, how with all the supernatural stuff? I'd love it if it was much more abstract, this movie wasn't trying to do that, and did an awful job communicating anything. And Its still confusing as hell what how the little girl is really connected to anything - becuz she looked like the daughter of one of the women that wouldn't join the silent hill cult whose own mother was in the weird supernatural stuff going on in the town.<br/><br/>There is just too much going on that is not communicated and its supposed to skit that by being so visually appealing, but it just ends up being a little boring.

","Firstly, i'd just like to say that this film, for me was something which was quite highly anticipated.. and i thought it would be worth the wait. When i first came to watch the film, i thought it looked quite promising, and the filming of it looked quite grim. And then.. the boredom kicked in.<br/><br/>The film simply took TOO LONG to make ANY POINT WHATSOEVER. It seemed to focus on the idea that ""ooh.. it finds YOU"" and spent simply too much time trying to establish the fact that Silent Hill is a grim, scary place. When you see some films, you notice that there's a device used to build up the tension - a ""set up"" shot .. i.e ""a stir"" or ""something going on"".. That was what the film was like about 60% of the way through.<br/><br/>Now, i have to admit that nowadays, filming something in good quality shots can be done so easily it's unreal - digital cameras and tripods as well as all the software that's out there.. But anyway, it was undoubtedly well filmed.<br/><br/>The point is, the film takes way too long to get to any point, and when it does make it.. you find it somewhat diluted and not putting across any real problem or reason. All of it seemed to pivot on the idea of the evil-ness of the town and it's residents, and, despite a few things here and there, nothing was really elaborated upon.<br/><br/>The weird thing also was, that the storyline seemed to waver a lot -- lots of info which was basically padded out at one time.. other times with nothing but useless banter about this and that.<br/><br/>If you're interested in something leaving you wanting more, this will deliver. If by wanting more, you mean either money back, sense or time."

","""Silent hill"" What else can I say? It is one of the most fantastic horror movies of all times. The music and sound effect, the horrifying and breathtaking scenes, and lastly the entire plot and storyline are all terrific and well arranged. The ending was especially astonishing and really caught my eyes, I finally realized that Christopher s wife and his daughter had already died once they arrived silent hill, and as well as the female cop. So, after death, they were trapped in a different dimension from us, and now the world that they perceive is gray. The ending had explained it all. Well, i would highly recommend you to watch this movie, if you haven't already done so."
"DJAkin","8","2","5","26 April 2006"," Classic horror with a death by barbwire touch
","If you want to see tons of blood and barbwire, see SILENT HILL. This movie delivered the goods though. I loved it. I have never seen this video game but I might go see it now. Sean Bean did a good job for as little time as he spent in this movie. I loved that cop who wore the leather. She looked like the legend of Billy Jean girl. The monsters with no faces were amazing looking. There is a lot to this movie and I can't piece it together. There were two dimensions going on and I am not sure hot to feel about that. However, the amazing BORG from Star Trek was in this as the female witch hunter. She was good. All the aspects of this movie hit the mark."
"wolfs_baine","9","2","5","26 April 2006"," Near perfect copy of the first game
","This movie, by itself, would be enough for an intelligent person to understand and enjoy. But this is no ordinary movie, this is a movie based on one of the greatest horror games made today. I found this movie very enjoyable because I have played all the Silent Hill games (including the gameboy advanced version only released in Japan) and I found that the story is a near perfect copy of the first game. Yes, there are creatures from the 2nd and 3rd games as well and they mixed a bit of the 2nd games story into the inner workings of Silent Hill, but the main story follows Rose (in place of Harry) who lost her daughter after getting into a wreck on their way to Silent Hill. There are scenes in the movie that were in the game, the same exact scenes! So, as far a video game movies go, this is the best one made to date. As far as Horror movies go, it is better than the regular ""slash and kill for no reason"" movies that are out today. I give it a 9 out of 10 only because the ending is very different than any of the 4 endings from the original Silent Hill for the PS1. Still, it was a nice surprise but it just wasn't in Silent Hill style."
"jonathan45","9","2","5","26 April 2006"," nerve shredding movie with astounding visuals.
","The film starts out with the family DaSilva, they are a young attractive couple living the American dream with an adopted child, a young ethereal looking girl named Sharon(played with ghostlike otherworldliness by newcomer Jodelle Ferland). The mother and daughter share a strong bond.But all is not well in their seemingly enviable life, Rose DaSilva ( the always good Rhada Mitchell) and Christopher DaSilva ( played by the talented British actor Sean Bean) are on red alert every night because their daughter has a dangerous habit of sleepwalking. She also scribbles violent imagery of people being tortured by demons and being burned alive, the motife running through these macabre drawings is the town of Silent Hill. The daughter is being treated with medication for her behaviour but it seems to have little effect. In a fast paced scene we see every parents worst nightmare as young Sharon dream walks to the edge of a cliff saved at the last second by her mother, desperation and panic aiding her speed. After this terrifying night Christopher (understandbly perhaps) is at his wits end and wants his daughter to receive hospital treatment but Rose cannot bear to be parted from the daughter she loves so dearly. She takes Sharon to Silent Hill without telling her husband ,hoping that by going there she can understand why this town casts such a shadow over their lives.When Christopher finds they have gone to Silent Hill he makes a few panic stricken phonecalls and cancels her credit cards to get her to talk to him. She refuses to come home until she has some answers, in a key scene as they are talking on the phone we see he loves her and their daughter, and is not trying to get rid of her.. after all in the sleepwalking scene at the start of the movie he risks his neck dodging cars in his panic fuelled desire to find his daughter- he is no villain. Whilst they are arguing a butch female bike riding cop ( played with depth by the beautiful Laurie Holden) talks to the daughter, she compliments the reticent Sharon on not talking to strangers. Back in the car the DaSilvas are stopped by the same cop, fearing her husband has called the police to bring her back Rose speeds off on the road to Silent Hill with the cop in hot pursuit. Something or someone leaps out in to the road and the car spins and slides in to the town . Rose is knocked out temporarily by the crash and is terrified to find her daughter missing from the seat beside her, she sets off in to Silent Hill to find her.. . The town is disturbing, old buildings look abandoned and black ash floats through the air, the light in this town has a ghostly quality to it and dust covers everything. A chilling siren sounds warning that a darkness is about to descend ,seemingly pulling the town and its people in to Hell. Rose encounters the female cop again and they battle through hordes of demons to find her daughter. They are almost sliced in two by the truly terrifying Pyramid head- a giant with a thirty foot long sword, disfigured nurses wield knives and baby golems burn up in to embers, the visuals in this film are astonishing, reminiscent of Hyronemous Bosch paintings. They encounter the townsfolk, huddling in nooks and corners ,and discover the terrible punishment the have brought upon themselves. Rhada Mitchell is very good in this, Sean Bean gets little to do other than chase his wife ( and delve in to the history of the town), but he adds depth to his,limited, role. The direction by Christopher Gans is nerve shredding in places, particularly the demon sequences and the siren screaming. Alice Krige is as usual brilliant in a role tailor made for her cold beauty. The film is scary and gives a little food for thought for the viewer about hypocrisy and moral corruption."
"philosophous2k","10","2","5","26 April 2006"," The product of my childhood dreams, the perfect horror.
","My childhood search is now over: I've found the perfect horror movie for me. Before I get into why I thought this was the best horror movie I had ever seen, I'd like to make some things clear.<br/><br/>1) I played several Silent Hill games, but just couldn't get into them. The style of action/adventure gameplay found in those games (along with Resident Evil) just don't appeal to me, even though the twisted imagery was really cool.<br/><br/>2) I was not expecting much from this movie as a big Hollywood horror film. I've been very disappointed by the likes of Saw and Hostel, and thought this would fit alongside of those as something not particularly exciting for me (okay, but not great).<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely wonderful. It was like the movie I had been been waiting for my entire life after being disappointed by horror movie after horror movie from more mainstream hits like Hellraiser to Fangoria classics to Lucio Fulci's cult hits to Bunman: The Untold Story to Ichi the Killer (though I really did like Ichi the Killer, but not to the extent of this movie) to Hostel and more. I've watched many horror movies, and this one was the one for me.<br/><br/>While I am a big fan of horror, I'm ultimately more of a fan of fantasy, and I mean fantasy in a very broad sense of taking the audience to a world very different from our own, whether it's a violent, futuristic metropolis, outer space, a town full of zombies, a land of sorcery, etc. I like horror movies primarily for the otherworldly aspect, and as such, I don't care remotely for the likes of Scream.<br/><br/>As a fantasy film, I thought this film was fantastic. My favorites in that category would include Robocop, Excalibur, Neverending Story (nostalgia), Willow (nostalgia), Alien, Bladerunner, Sin City, Ichi the Killer, Ravenous, Lone Wolf and Cub, Story of Ricky, Equilibrium, and now probably Silent Hill. The movie really succeeded in taking me to another world: a hellish world filled with some of the coolest and nastiest creatures I've seen of the likes that would make Clive Barker envious. And, unlike Clive Barker's movies, the novelty and excitement from these creatures never ceased to wear off for me. If you aren't impressed after the first siren rings in the air, then you probably won't like this movie. I, for one, was completely mesmerized after that point.<br/><br/>The movie is not for everyone. It's obvious there are a large number of people who absolutely hate the movie, to the extent that they have to post on the message boards during regular discussions about the movie about how much they despise it. Still, I can say that if you're like me, you're going to be in for the time of your life.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fantastic. The music was a perfect way to accompany it for me: I'm always paying close attention to movie soundtracks, and there are some movies that I probably wouldn't consider nearly as good had it not been for their soundtracks. Among these would be The Fugitive (perfect soundtrack even though I didn't like the movie so much), Ravenous, Neverending Story, Sin City, Kill Bill, Rain Man, and now Silent Hill."
"redblood_666","Null","2","5","25 April 2006"," My new favorite movie
","Watching movies of all kinds my whole life, I've learned to never set high expectations for an movie, as most of the time I'm left disappointed in one way or another. But because I'm such an huge die-hard SH fan, I set my expectations more then just high for the movie, and I wasn't disappointed. Silent Hil delivers everything an fan of the games good of hoped for in the movie...well almost everything. The only thing I wished that they would of done differently, was to give Pyramid Head some more screen time, but seeing as the screens with him were just so damn awesome, I don't really mind all that much. :) Everything else, perfect. <br/><br/>The atmosphere was amazing. The town has the same look, and feel to that in the games. <br/><br/>The creatures looked just as they do in the games. <br/><br/>All of the characters and acting were excellent. Radha Mitchell, Laurie Holden, Deborah Kara Unger, Alice Krige, Jodelle Ferland, and everyone else were excellent!<br/><br/>The story was excellent. Very silent hillish. <br/><br/>Special effects were great. Hardly any CGI used in the film? Beyond amazing.<br/><br/>The gore, oh how I loved the gore!<br/><br/>And the sound and music were beautiful. An lot of it was taken from the games, and if your an fan, then I'm sure you already know how truly beautiful all of it is.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is by far the best film this year so far, and I don't see anything else topping it anytime soon. Perfectly identical to the games if your an fan then see this as soon as possible, you will love it.<br/><br/>And thank you Christophe Gans, and Roger Avary for creating not only one of the best horror movies ever, but the best movie/video game adaptation ever."
"The_StickMen","8","2","5","25 April 2006"," For better or worse, the first literal video game to film adaption thats out there...
","Like I said, this film, with all its faults, is the first literal film adaption of a video game. Let me explain. The movie has been accused of many things; being overly-long, having bad acting, having abysmal dialog, being too confusing. That's just to name a few. Fans of the games will certainly recognize certain parts of these qualities in the film. Being a strong fan and supporter of the franchise (even the bastard child that is Silent Hill 4), I didn't realize at first what the filmmakers had done with this film. They have essentially created a Silent Hill video game thats plays out on the screen. All the great things about the games are there; the interesting if not somewhat inexplicable story line, the depth and history and metaphor to the design of nearly every element to the story and characters and creatures, the creepy and original atmosphere of all the different dimensions that embody the town, and etc.<br/><br/>Something that fans of the series, but naysayers of the movie, have failed to point out is that all the faults of the film are elements of the game. Some point out that the characters don't seem to react realistically to the goings-on that occur in the film. This is true of the games as well (ex. Silent Hill 3's Heather and her encounter with the terrifying boss monster Leonard, she seems completely unphased by the sheer horrific scene that she's in), while sometimes the people in the games do react with strong emotions to certain things, a lot of the time they fail to find the horror in their situations. Some say they don't get the story. Again, most people have to jump on to gamefaqs.net to read the countless plot analysis that exist for the series of games to fully grasp what's happening in the undercurrent of the story. That is part of the Silent Hill charm; it provides something that fans can analyze and dissect and try to explain, even when the game may be designed to be unexplainable in some instances.<br/><br/>I assure you, those familiar with the games, watch the film again keeping all the elements (both good and bad) of the games in mind and you will find that for better or worse, it is a true adaption. For the rest of you, I think you're probably $hit out of luck. Overall, I give it an 8/10."
"patrickharboun","10","2","5","25 April 2006"," a brand new kind of cinema
","I've just come back from the cinema and I would really like to thank Christopher Gans for succeeding this tour de force. As a former film student now working in the game industry, I'd like to say that Silent Hill is like no other movie, simply because it's the first time that a real movie is made from the medium of video game. It makes us forget all the other game-to-movie ""inspirations"" that we have unfortunately seen over the years hoping that they would respect our art form and us. This is also why film critics from the old generation probably won't understand Silent Hill. They have only been used to movies resulting from book adaptations with their rather linear and passive feeling. This is a brand new kind of cinema."
"The-Hater","9","2","5","25 April 2006"," Major Fan Really Impressed
","I really loved this film for it truly stuck with the game in the important parts. I knew that the plot would be changed and that never bothered me cause the plot did not matter. All that really mattered was the atmosphere and terror around the tiny little town.<br/><br/>The acting was over the top enough to be a fun horror film but also reserved enough not to fall into lame.<br/><br/>The directing was the strongest point since everything I could have asked for was implemented well into the movie. Everything. The monsters were scary and the Hell world was scary. P-Head was so perfect and to do what he did really scared the head out of me. <br/><br/>The writing was what a movie like this needed since if it tried to be Oscar worthy than everything would have broken down with the confusion that was supposed to be set.<br/><br/>Overall a great horror film that will become a part of my video library.<br/><br/>Now my only complaint ONLY<br/><br/>Was that the main character should have been male Like the first two games it should have been a male All horror films nowadays have females and I am tired of it.<br/><br/>And to cast Sean Bean who would have been perfect as the lead just made me realize how much i did not like the decision to change it to a female lead.<br/><br/>9 out of 10<br/><br/>Great.....Almost Amazing"

"qatgrl","2","2","5","24 April 2006"," Two Hours of My Life That I'll Never Have Back
","Some movies must be seen on the big screen (Star Wars). Some movies are still meant to be seen in the theatre, but not paid full price for. Silent Hill doesn't even qualify for Nothing Else on TV Pay-Per-View Movie Night. This movie was appalling.<br/><br/>The Creepy Little Girl in this movie is Sharon, a dark-eyed, white-faced, waif who is haunted by nightmares of a place called Silent Hill. She also sleepwalks and the movie opens with her mother Rose and father Chris screaming after her into the night because Sharon has wandered out of the house and they find her ready to plunge off a cliff.<br/><br/>Chris Da Silva, played in this movie by Sean Bean, Hollywood's token evil Brit, who in the past several movies he's been in has played a character who is emphatically Not a Bad Guy, has lent and wasted his talent on Silent Hill as the ethnically nebulous husband and father who thinks Sharon might be better off receiving supervised psychiatric care instead of being driven over the state line into West Virginia--and he just might be right, as we shall soon see.<br/><br/>Rose gets the idea in her head that she can solve Sharon's nightmares and sleepwalking issues if she sneaks off and drives Sharon to Silent Hill, WV in spite of her husband's protests, because of course this is the new millennium where men are no longer Ward Cleaver and they all have the intuition of a cinder block. Mommy knows best and Daddy may have good intentions, but he's an ignorant oaf. Sharon is Rose and Chris' adopted daughter, born in Silent Hill, WV, parked at the doorstep of the local nun-run orphanage.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a town on fire. An underground fire has been burning for 30 years and now the town is deserted. While we learn how the fire started, the movie never really tells what keeps it going. We can only deduce that the fire hit a coal seam, since this a mining town after all. The inspiration for this appears to be Centralia, PA. Centralia is also a real-life town on fire after a trash fire hit an exposed coal vein in 1962. However, a fire started by burning trash is unexciting and Centralia isn't haunted by burning, shrieking spirits.<br/><br/>Rose first runs into trouble before she even leaves the state of Ohio. A sexy, tough-as-nails, lady cop named Cybil takes a bizarre and unwarranted interest in Rose and Sharon outside a gas station. It's left up to the viewer to try and figure out why Cybil even gives two craps about them, but she obviously does. She follows Rose out to the fork in the road at Silent Hill and the ensuing chase leads Rose crashing through the fence shutting Silent Hill off from the rest of the world and thus the nightmare begins. Maybe Cybil was having a slow night. By the end of the picture, she was likely wishing she had stuck around her own jurisdiction, in her own state, chasing speeders.<br/><br/>Rose's car crashes, she gets knocked out and when she comes to, Sharon has disappeared and Cybil is standing outside the car. When Rose gets out, Cybil slaps the cuffs on her and the women snipe at each other like two scorpions in a jar. Rose manages to escape from Cybil (still cuffed) and sets out to look for Sharon until Cybil finds here again and frees her from the handcuffs. Naturally, they're bosom buddies by the end of the show. The rest of the movie is spent with Rose and Cybil looking for Sharon and encountering qrotesque and terrifying demons along the way.<br/><br/>The town isn't completely deserted though. There are a few hangers-on. They are followers of a bizarre and unholy cult leader named Christabella. Her disciples are all pasty-faced, stupid, brutal sheep. Christabella is the only one of them who looks like she's seen the sun, although it's unclear how since the town lives in a perpetual fog. Turns out Silent Hill is a witch-huntin' n burnin' town and we get to the bottom of how the whole fire got started in the first place--namely a witch burnin' gone awry.<br/><br/>Without going into the rest of the details (I don't want to spoil it), suffice to say Rose finds out the whole dirty truth, she finds Sharon, Rose, Cybil, and Sharon are accused of being witches (surprise!) and Cybil gets burned at the stake (somebody has to--the female cop of questionable sexuality is the perfect fall gal for this).<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely atrocious. I've heard some people complain that Silent Hill didn'tdifferentiate between Christabella's apocalyptic brand of medieval Christianity and mainstream Christianity. If there are people who think the two have any relation to each other, they would think that without any help from this movie. The movie is fraught with religious imagery--weird crosses, churches and the like. Heck, even people's names--Rose, Sharon, Christabella. Is it coincidence or intentional? Hmmm. Who knows--and more importantly, who cares? This movie is awful on so many levels, it's portrayal of organized religion is the least of its problems. However, its gory and graphic nightmare sequences and scenes of blonde, busty babes slapping handcuffs on and fighting with each other will serve as an inspiration to disturbed teenage boys everywhere."
"sweetiepie2487","2","2","5","24 April 2006"," Absolutely Horrible
","This movie, although hyped up by the video game, was completely horrible. Within the first 20 minutes of the film, I wanted to fall asleep. The only thing that would wake me up occasionally was the laughter of the audience on how bad the acting was. The whole time the actresses were stating the obvious over and over again and just plain being stupid throughout. The only good parts were that of when the small ash babies appear and chase the mother and then at the end when Alysa Gillepie's decrepit body kills everyone with barbed wire. Overall the movie was extremely horrible and I would not recommend it to anyone. The only people I know who saw it, was out of pure curiosity because they had played the game. I think that is the only way this movie is going to make any money in the theaters. As soon as it hits DVD, nothing."

","What does every scary movie fan want? I scary movie. This film isn't a horror film despite some horrific scenes. It's a very fine thriller based on an awesomely dark video game. Negatives first: I didn't care for some of the acting, particularly Rose and her husband. Also, it does get a little confusing. You can never tell who the bad guy is or who prevails in the end. Positives: When the first monsters came about, I was genuinely frightened by their screams and their bodies. And Pyramid Head's first attack is pure terror. The movie climaxes in true form during a final blood bath in a sanctuary. Visually it's pretty magnificent. Silent Hill is an intelligent, complex movie that succeeds in being a good scary movie."

","I cannot believe what my eyes just saw. I am so shocked with this movie. Being a fan from the game since the first one was released for the PS1 i have to say this became instantly my favorite movie right after Pyramid Head made his first appearance, and believe me, it was a huge appearance.<br/><br/>You may have noticed i am a big fan of the character, though he didn't appear a lot in the movie, he was awesome.<br/><br/>Well, about the movie now, as i said i am still shaking and i still have the chills when thinking about the movie, my mouth is opened and my face probably has a ""shocked"" expression, has that is the feeling i sense right now, i'm shocked.<br/><br/>This is definitely the best movie i've ever seen from beginning to the end. The monsters were really well chosen (and the new ones, they're just totally CREEPY, the Gray Child totally freaked me out, i was shaking from hair to toes, and believe me i'm not frightened so easily; i must have been the only person on the theater watching ""The Exorcist"" who did not feel scared almost at all, well, some suspense maybe).<br/><br/>I'm taking ages to write this comment, and why? Because i can't see no proper words to describe this, i'm trembling all over and all i can think is about the scene where Alessa finally has her revenge. That was the freakiest thing i've ever seen.<br/><br/>About the ending of the movie, since this has become quite the talks here on the forums: i think we WILL have a sequel, i mean, did you notice the way Sharon looked at Dahlia, and the way she looked when they arrived... ""home""? I too think the ending gives us a lot to think about, i have quite a weird theory: what if Rose and Sharon, and Cybil died in the car crash? Yes, in the beginning. And I say this, because of the ending, or that happened or they were still trapped in the other dimension, and if it's the ""dark one who opens and closes the door to Silent Hill"" why didn't ""the dark one"" (a.k.a. Alessa) let Rose and Sharon go back? These doubts are killing me, i want more, i want MUCH MORE! <br/><br/>I have to congratulate Christophe Gans, he's made my favorite game become also my favorite movie, i freaking love you (not in the way many of you are thinking lol) and we want more!

"Lupin003","8","2","5","23 April 2006"," Blew away my (admittedly low) expectations. Best game to movie ever?
","As stated above, my expectations for this film were very very low, based not only on the EXTREMELY low quality of game-to-movie adaptations, but my ignorance to the team involved with making this movie.<br/><br/>I should have done a bit of research before writing this one off as a guaranteed stinker...as Roger Avary has always provided his viewers with entertaining screen writing, and Christophe Gans' Brotherhood of the Wolves was one of the best films I saw the year it was released.<br/><br/>I've also played the first three Silent Hill games to completion, and enjoyed them (as strange and hard to follow as the stories were) so that added to my trepidation...were the filmmakers going to monkey with things like the Resident Evil movies? Were they going to make things easier for the audience to ""understand""? Were they going to leave out characters or change the location / origin / story of the entire film to retro-fit it for a movie-going crowd like DOOM or Tomb Raider or just about any game-to-movie in the past 10 years...<br/><br/>...The short short is that my low expectations were blown away. The characters, locations, visual design, cinematography, and even the acting were all VERY respectful of the source material.<br/><br/>I ESPECIALLY enjoyed the sound design...which contained (as many other reviewers have cited) a LOT of the music from the 1st few games.<br/><br/>The movie was every bit as creepy, off-putting, tense, strange and violent as the game series, and it retained the feel of the game throughout....I commend the filmmakers for producing what very well may be the most faithful adaptation of a game to the big screen to date.<br/><br/>The only thing keeping me from scoring the film higher is the potential for viewers of the film who are not familiar with the game series to get lost in the material....there may be SO much visual and story reference to the game series that it becomes obvious...like listening to an ""inside joke"" that appears that it should be funny, but you don't know the source material that it's making fun of.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Silent Hill, and have played the first few games...this is quite a ride through world of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Avary penned a VERY smart screenplay (based on Boukhrief's story) and Gans did an AMAZING job of staying true to the feel of the game both visually and atmospherically.<br/><br/>I'll be looking forward to a deluxe edition DVD for re-watchings trying to pick up on more of the game references.<br/><br/>Loved the ending too...it could very well be the pre-cursor to the opening of the 2nd game!!! -Frankie"

","OK, I have to say this was a really good movie, you really have to think back for a bit, without the acting, a more or less think about the background and the cinematic stuff. The acting was meh, at times really really cheesy, then again, for a horror movie it was pretty good, acting wise. The music was pretty good too, and was almost taken completely out of the game, but it was a bit over-done at times.<br/><br/>At certain moments when...<br/><br/>::Spoiler:: Rose, Cybil, Anna walk into a room that has obviously been burned to kingdom come, Rose says something along the lines of: ""It looks like a fire was here."" :End of Spoiler: Does make the movie's script a bit cheesy and kind of lame.

"questclub","10","2","5","23 April 2006"," It can't be better
","There are quite long and detailed comment posts on IMDb so I'll make it short. One word - Masterpiece!<br/><br/>Yes! There are some story laps, stupid filler phrases, awkward acting of some characters but that's just minor details. From start to finish a one big crazy visual roller-coaster with game's authentic chilling soundtrack this movie draws you deeper into its eerie rusted world of hatred and fire.<br/><br/>It's not just the best game adaptation and not just the most precise on-screen adaptation - Silent Hill adds that extra chilling effect that the game itself misses quite a lot. I played three episodes of the game and saw them as a boring, tedious location scouting with monster shooting and stupid endings. The movie takes the same scouting approach but mixes the best parts of the game with an excellent story. The story flows on two levels - Silent Hill (Rose) and Real World (Christopher) - an important division which helps a viewer to understand what exactly is Silent Hill. The second storyline looks kinda goofy since it is not originally supported by the game but gives many answers to what is actually happening inside Silent Hill. It is well-done but not as strong and convincing as Rose's part.<br/><br/>But even if one is critical towards the story one can't deny Silent Hill's visual and audio superiority. Visuals are a bit dark at times but that's a concept of the game to which the movie sticks obediently. What I loved and the reason I played Silent Hill was the musical score - its strong presence keeps the movie together and serves as a massive foundation to an entire concept.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Silent Hill is a sharp twisted barbed wire which slowly embraces your mind paralyzing it with shock and confusion and like some exotic drug leaves you with an ultimate satisfaction."
"kanman","9","2","5","23 April 2006"," En enjoyable experience, although not for everyone.
","I must say that I've waited nearly 4 years for a Silent Hill film to come out. Once I sat and witnessed the work of everybody involved in this film's production, I was more than satisfied.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the production design, cinematography and photography are just amazing. Truly, there is a masterful design that stays true to the spirit in some SH titles. The majority of the tracks heard throughout the film are excerpts from the games. I tried to figure out which part was composed by Yamaoka-san and which by Jeff Dana.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of this film, rather than scary, is tense and suspenseful, obscure and grim at times. The plot is good, but it could have used some elements that would not make it complicated and hard to digest at times. By that I'm not saying that the film is flat and lineal; the story sometimes puts the neurones to work for a bit.<br/><br/>The acting is impressive, considering the fact that we're not talking Award Winning performances, but most of the characters are truly believable. Sometimes I thought I was immersed in the game, through some exquisite camera movements and takes that are require a few seconds to find certain details.<br/><br/>The secondary approach on the story, focused on the character Chris, needed to be taken a bit further, although it's not the core of the movie, but one of its branches.<br/><br/>As a fan of the game, I give it a 9 because there are some elements that slow the pace and may drive the viewers to fast-forward one or two scenes. Also, the lack of emphasis on some crucial points in the original story make it confusing for a few minutes.<br/><br/>The presentation is superb, the score is amazing and the whole design is just a masterpiece. I dare to say that this film is not scary, but very graphic and tense. It follows some perspectives that Mr. Gans has taken on some of his films. In addition, it is a promising addition to the horror genre that will become an instant classic and a landmark in video game film-making.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film, whether you are a fan of the game or not, but dare to look for some answers for yourself, rather than judging 'a la' Ebert & Roeper."
"jamegurl","10","2","5","23 April 2006"," Best Rated R film by far
","I saw this movie opening night and I thought it was absolutely fantastic. It wasn't like most movies where it drags into it, it gets right into it, which I love! I think Jodelle was the perfect child actress for the part of Sharon. She is very believable and adorable as well. Some of the parts in this movie were quite disturbing while others were kind of funny, when I don't believe they were supposed to be. I haven't seen a Rated R film in a long time in which it leaves me practically ""jaw-dropped"" by the time the credits start rolling. However, the ending is a little tricky to figure out. I was completely mystified on what had happened in the end, until somebody explained it to me. Otherwise it was a fantastic film, and I have already been recommending it to other people to go and see. If you haven't, you should too!"
"bretxheart","9","2","5","23 April 2006"," Silent Hill...My personal opinion!
","As a hard-core SH game fan, I must start off by saying this movie does an amazing job re-creating the element and atmosphere of the game. Gans truly had a vision and I understand exactly where he was coming from. I am going to try my hardest to make a decent review so that both, SH gamers and the common movie-goer will get some type of idea.<br/><br/>PROS: The element and atmosphere came out really good on the screen. The fog and environment was nothing short of amazing, in my opinion. I got that same ol' unsettled feeling watching the movie, as I did when I first played the games.<br/><br/>Original Plot. I've seen others ranting and raving about how the plot is weak and flawed. I just don't see it. I have never seen a movie like this, nor a plot that would even come close. Even if you don't like the plot, everything else in the Silent Hill movie is sure to make up for it. I've also heard that Sean Bean's character in the movie serves no purpose, but I think it does. It breaks the movie up right when you're ready for a change. It also explains a lot about the town and shows that Rose and Cybil are in a completely different realm than Christopher or everybody else for that matter. Sean Bean's parts kept me guessing and helped me understand everything a little more.<br/><br/>The acting was very credible. Rahda Mitchell did an excellent job and I would also say that the other actors did a fine job themselves, although there were a few (very few) scenes where it was a little weak. It's really hard to find a good horror/suspense flick with acting that isn't dreadful.<br/><br/>The creatures were also done extremely well. They looked great and definitely freaked me out. Honestly, I've been hesitant to walk in a dark room ever since I watched it.<br/><br/>Forget scary...this movie is down right disturbing and unsettling. The climax was, by far, the most horrific think I think I've ever seen in a movie, and I've seen a lot of horror/suspense movies. The feeling you get is unexplainable.<br/><br/>The music was well done. Arranged by the same composer that did the games. It helped create the feel, without a doubt. It changes in each room and keeps you guessing. I've read other reviews with people saying that the music got monotonous and didn't fit some of the scenes, but judging by the interviews I've read with Gans (and having seen it twice already), I think those things were intentional. The fact that the music didn't fit in on certain scenes only helped build things up and get the audience excited. As far as it getting monotonous...I love music, and I personally think it helped make the movie what it was.<br/><br/>The ending gave me a satisfying feeling of dissatisfaction. Doesn't really make sense but it leaves a few unanswered questions, and I'm a firm believer that it isn't always a bad thing. Its an uneasy, weird ending that either leaves you coming to your own conclusion, or waiting for a sequel.<br/><br/>CONS: Like I said earlier, the acting (mostly the little girl) comes off a bit weak in a scene or two. I've read reviews saying that the actress that played Anna (dont know her real name) did an awful job and everybody in the audience was laughing. I think a big deal of this would be that the majority of that audience were ignorant and not willing to think things through. Sure, she was corny and goofy...but you have to think about what living in a place like that for so long would do to your mind.<br/><br/>I think it should have been darker. When Rose is walking around Silent Hill during the day, its not all that scary...its eerie, but not really horrifying. I think there should have been at least one scene where she was walking around the streets during the night.<br/><br/>It seems just a tad bit uneven. The first half (and maybe a fourth of the second half) has that ol' fashion Silent Hill-ish feeling to it...the town, the surroundings, the school...somewhere after an hour or so the movie started to lose that and started focusing more on the cult.<br/><br/>I heard a rumor that there was very little CGI used in this movie, but that is definitely only a rumor. I was looking forward to seeing a flick that isn't pack loaded with crappy cgi. Fortunately there was a happy medium...I saw a movie that had a lot of very decent cgi. It was weak in one or two scenes but again, I think that was intentional. I believe it was there to give the audience a sense of false reality...maybe not, but I do know that Silent Hill is known for messing with your head big time and it wouldn't surprise me if the couple of weak cgi scenes were done on purpose.<br/><br/>Over all...the best game-based movie so far and one of my personal favorites. I'm a huge Silent Hill fan and always will be. I had HUGE expectations for this film and it met 95% of them. Was it perfect? no, but I have never seen a movie that was..but it came damn close, in my opinion. However, if you don't know a lot about the Silent Hill world, I would definitely either read up on it quite a bit or play the 1st or 2nd game extensively before watching this movie, because it does tend to be targeted for the game fans and will leave you with a lot of unanswered questions. Hopefully this helped you out some, guys.<br/><br/>9/10"
"d0x","10","2","5","23 April 2006"," Better then expected
","This movie is exactly like the game series its based on. It makes no literal sense, its gory and strange and the music is spot on. Some of the dialog sucked but overall this is a perfect example of a well done video game movie. If your not a fan of the game series you might not get it but if you enjoy the Silent Hill games your in for a treat.<br/><br/>To retouch on my comment about dialog in the movie...I don't think its so much bad dialog but more bad delivery. The little girl is new to acting and it shows in some of her lines, they are bad and there are only a couple of them but it kinda breaks the overall tension of the movie when she delivers a line and has almost no feeling behind it. Otherwise everything works well."
"PlayerSS","7","2","5","23 April 2006"," Very respectful of the series
","I've never been a huge fan of the Silent Hill series. I've played and beaten the first three games in the last four months. They are all good, but not my favorite game series. Initially it was seeing some of the stuff from the movie that got me into the games.<br/><br/>Going into the movie I had an open mind. While The film is loosely based on the first game. I pretty much knew it wasn't going to be a ""direct port"" of the first game. It was an adaptation of the games. There were elements taken from the first three games.<br/><br/>Usually when adapting something There is usually always going to be something changed. It just has to be done is a respectful way. There is usually always something changed in the Stephen King movies that have been adapted from books. This movie lived up the Silent Hill series in my opinion.<br/><br/>It had the look, feel, and authentic monsters of Silent Hill. There's even a new monster in the movie that looks like it would fit perfectly in the Silent Hill series. As an individual movie. This is one of the more ""brutal"" movies I've seen in quite some time. It doesn't let up with the violence. It's a breath of fresh air this day in age amongst all of the PG-13 horrors with all the off screen kills.<br/><br/>Yeah it didn't live up the first game completely, but it was respectful of the Silent Hill series. I feel that Gans and Avary respected the source material. That being the games. Hopefully they'll come back if there is another one."
"time_travel","9","2","5","23 April 2006"," Silent Hill
","Being a fan of the Silent Hill games (although they are usually too scary to finish!), I decided to go and see the Silent Hill movie ready to be scared out of my skin. This didn't happen so much. The film started off very slowly, setting the groundwork for some (expectedly) scary moments later on, much like the game; this was to be expected. As the film continued, I found that the plot lines deepened more, and instead of being the typical ""blood and gore, all action"" horror movie, it turned out to be more of a psychological thriller. The special effects were top notch, making the sense of realism much more intense, and the monsters matched the game perfectly. The ending provided the coming together of the whole storyline, making everything make perfect sense; and the effects of the final scenes were amazing. In conclusion, I thought this film is a must see for fans of psychological thrillers with all the blood and gore of a horror film."
"comewithussir","8","2","5","23 April 2006"," Gamers Should Be Pleased..
","I saw the film last at night after months of waiting. I'd started playing the games at SH2, then played 3 and then 1 to get the whole storyline and although I felt a bit let down by the film in a way, I was very impressed otherwise.<br/><br/>First of all, the main problem for ANY game-to-screen adaptation is the time; a game has eight plus hours to tell you a story in many different forms. In the Silent Hill games, the story is told to you through newspaper clippings, puzzles and character speeches over your playing. Now Christophe Gans had four stories to tell in this film and only two hours to do so.<br/><br/>Thing is, you can't condense four games into two hours, you just can't.<br/><br/>So the film became a little 'drawn out' and characters - especially the religious cult - seemed to explain too much too quickly. In the games, we don't see any of this cult and their actions. In fact, it's very rare that you, as the central character, meet more than one person at a time, which all adds to the fear factor in the games.<br/><br/>A lot of disappointment is in that people are trying to read 'game' and 'film' together. They're two entirely different mediums with entirely different rules. I did feel the film captured brilliantly the sounds (mostly direct from the game) and atmosphere of the games, especially when environments turned 'evil', accompanied by the eerie siren and the darkness closing in. As 'reality' literally stripped away the blood-soaked metallic floors and crawling walls were practically an inch perfect replica of the game whilst the soundtrack and sound effects will strike fear once again into gamers with all the extra-diagetic music coming from all four games.<br/><br/>Gamers will also recognise certain parts lifted straight from games, especially the toilet scene where it turns dark in front of her (there is a room in Silent Hill 3 which turns evil the longer you look at yourself in a mirror) and the apartment building on Silent Hill 2 where you can jump across to an adjacent building. Even the monsters were adapted well with the impressive 'Pyramid Head' from SH2 stealing the show. It's a pity we didn't see more of him/it or indeed a few of the other monsters that litter the games. However, Gans doesn't need to show us a monster every scene to remind us that they're there..<br/><br/>So the usual pitfalls for a game adaptation apply here, but this isn't a Resident Evil. Silent Hill as a film has re-created the games visually in a near-perfect style. The cults history is visually explained rather than a background (which it is in the games) but thats cinema for you - audiences need everything told (which is evident from the questioning on this board!) and Gans has tried to do that in the two hours he has.<br/><br/>I liked it. I liked the games and I've seen a film that is another story about Silent Hill. Yeah, it goes on a bit and could have had this or that added, but every Silent Hill game tells another story about the town. You could call this film the fifth story.."
"wil327","10","2","5","23 April 2006"," Silent Hill is a major step for video game to movie adaptations
","As a long-time gamer, and fan of the Silent Hill video games. I have to say that this movie represents, in my opinion, a giant leap forward for video game to movie adaptations.<br/><br/>I say this for the following reasons. The plot line managed to be the same as the games, even though there were some minor changes made. The soundtracks from the games were used as the soundtrack for the movie. The creature designs were spot on from the games, with a few minor tweaks. Most importantly, the town itself and the fog were taken directly from the game as well.<br/><br/>I've always held out hope that they would finally get the formula for video game movies right. Silent Hill represents that formula, and serves as an example of just how good that adaptation can be.<br/><br/>A word to all the nay sayers of this film. Consider that in the game, the goal of finding your daughter is the same, but in order to do so, you have to explore the town, and deal with it's denizens. Part of the game was finding out what happened in this town. The movie does this perfectly.<br/><br/>I realize that many people expected a Saw, Hostel, or a Land of the Dead, and that's why they left disappointed. I would too if I was expecting that, but honestly, I feel that those movies represent the lower quality spectrum of horror movies.<br/><br/>It's great to expect quick scares, if that's what you are in the mood for. However, there is a market for cerebral horror films (i.e.: The Ring (1 not 2), The Grudge, Jacob's Ladder, etc.) as well, and Silent Hill is just such a movie. The key is that you have to think and ask questions as you watch the movie, in order to understand what you are watching.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this movie a 10 because of the milestone in video game adaptations for the big screen. Also, I feel that the use of the soundtrack, characters, and imagery from the game is almost exact. Finally, the plot, while admittedly not Oscar worthy, is still understandable, and the effects and atmosphere serve it well. Do yourself a favor and see this movie and keep these things in mind when you do."
"imajestr","8","2","5","23 April 2006"," An ode to the games, in every way.
","First off, let me say that I've played Silent Hill 2 and Silent Hill 4: The Room and absolutely loved every minute of them. Could this influence my enjoyment of the movie? Absolutely, and guess what, that's why I like it so much.<br/><br/>This movie is almost an ode to gamers that have played the Silent Hill games, and that really makes me want to thank the makers of this movie. I don't believe game to movie translations should be for everybody, if they're done correctly. Real fans of this movie can walk away relieved, this truly is something of a translation from one screen to another.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie had me floored. Why? Because it's seriously like you're watching one of the games in movie form. People who haven't played the games may not like this so much, because it throws them off a little. The monsters are incredibly well done and very unnerving. I would say that most of the horror tension is gone in the second half of the movie, though, which actually isn't so bad, it's the same way with the games, you just get used to the ""horror"" and get more caught up in the story.<br/><br/>The only real problems in the movie involve dialogue. Specifically in a major scene before the end, the dialogue seems very forced and somewhat superficial. I don't know if it's because of poor acting or if the writing was just slightly off in this spot, but for some reason it doesn't work as it could have.<br/><br/>As for the ending, don't expect every loose end to be tied up. If you've played the games, you wouldn't be expecting such an ending anyway. Yet, I don't understand why so many people have trouble understanding the movie. Pretty much everything involving the world is explained in one way or another. If anything, I think there may have been a little too much explanation, but not overly so.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie does exactly what it should. It follows the formula for the videogames almost perfectly. Any real fan of the games will probably enjoy the movie, though it's not perfect. Personally, I want to watch it again, and again after that. This movie is not for everybody, and that's what I love about it. You can't argue with people who didn't like it because, they just don't GET it. I know every time I saw one of the monsters from the games I wanted to jump up and cheer. However, I'm sure there will be fans of the games that don't quite love this movie. As I've said, it has it's problems, but in it's entirety I think it's a great translation from game to movie, the best I've ever seen in fact. It manages to keep the atmosphere, the style, the creepiness, and the very formula that creates the games, something that no other video game movie has been able to pull off in the least bit (Resident Evil and Doom failed at this MISERABLY).<br/><br/>Don't go to see this expecting a perfect movie, but expect something like an ode to the videogames, heck, it may even add to your enjoyment of the series.<br/><br/>I'm giving this an 8 out of ten only because of the problems with dialogue, and some of the game formula didn't work as well as it possibly could have when translated to the screen."
"dpac500","3","2","5","23 April 2006"," Different
","As a fanatical horror fan, I was disappointed by this film. I would like to take the opportunity to say I haven't played the computer game and as such my comments are solely about the film and not how it was adapted to the big screen.<br/><br/>I found this film slightly disturbing in that it has attempted to be as shocking and gory as possible while leaving the actual plot to be left to the viewers imagination until we receive a lengthy explanation near the films climax. Also I felt that the trailer managed to conceal the true nature of the film, disguising what appeared to be a suspense building thriller in to this gorefest which followed.<br/><br/>My apologies to those fanatical fans out there but I felt that the film alone came up wanting."

","Wow is the first word out of my mouth, the movie is amazing. Now true I can nit pick at some things because its based of Silent hill for PSX. The opening was amazing true seeing the downtown of my city featured as silent hill was amusing, but the ash fall, the strange camera angles, the trapped in the end of the ally and pretty much dieing (like harry did in SH 1) then waking in the ""real"" world was awesome. I almost crapped my self with glee as the air raid siren sounded as she descends into the alley. If you played Silent Hill 1 you see the similarity's and differences of the start of the movie. Well yes there was some discrepancies like how Silent hill was made and the Cybil well was just plain wrong. The ending was perfect for all you people who don't get it sorry play the first game. In my opinion she got the bad ending, and need to play the movie again ;) Over all I was great they played there characters like they should, the effects were awesome frell massive CGI use people in suits like Silent Hill did (true environmental effects are CGI but that cant be helped). I want another movie I want more! (and the SH2 rip with triangle head was great) Do your self a favor and see it, but warning if you have a weak stomach or don't like rather gruesome scenes do not watch this movie, other wise SE IT NOW!"

","As a hardcore Silent Hill game series fan, I did not expect much from the theatrical adaptation. But surprisingly, it's probably one of the best video-game to movie adaptations ever engineered.<br/><br/>This movie blew my mind. The graphics, the music (which of course comes from the game ost's) the actors, everything fell perfectly. Every minute was full of suspense. As with any horror movie, there are the obligatory gore scenes. However, the directors found ways to psychologically strike fear in the hearts of its viewers, just like the game accomplishes. The most important character development is seen through the actions of our genuine heroine, Rose DeSilva. Despite corny lines here or there, the characters complete the Silent Hill environment in their determination to find themselves amidst the murky, transient, thickle, and dangerous state of mind Silent Hill produces.<br/><br/>This movie will indeed send shivers up your spine, but all in good timing...it is indeed the psychological thriller (and or good commentary on the validity of religious power within modern society). Just as the game reveals these themes in the delicate placement of symbols and signs, and the actions/roles of certain characters, you will see the same in the movie.<br/><br/>Definitely watch it, it'll blow you away."

","This movie is awesome. I've never seen a video game based movie that looked and felt so much like the original game. It transmits all the goosebumps the game did every time the noise effect comes on, like a dreadful warning that evil approaches. It felt like being on another Silent Hill Game, the monsters, the clues, and creepy occultism, is all there. The storyline is a little different form the original, but you'll find that it all fits together nicely. And yes it seems a little bit slow, but at the end of it, you'll end up wanting to know more, to see more. You will never find a better movie, either if your are a fan of the game or just of horror,this movie will take your breath away."
"theredraylives","6","2","5","22 April 2006"," Tampering with Silent Hill
","Silent Hill (Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Jodelle Ferland) Six out of ten stars ****** ""Only the Dark one opens and closes the door to Silent Hill."" Silent Hill is an absolutely frightening video game. I still won't play the game alone at night, that's how much it STILL freaks me out. The game plays on your isolation and fear, especially thanks to the environment (going from foggy, to dark, to hell and back again). It is a creepy, psychological horror game, and it is still among my favorites. When I found there was a movie coming out, I was thrilled; could they capture the same psychological terror that the game gave us so well? The trailers all looked so very promising. Unfortunately, the movie just failed to live up to expectations.<br/><br/>Once Rose (Mitchell) reaches Silent Hill, the movie takes basically the exact same path as the first game for around ten minutes or so. We get crazy camera shots (a nice nod to the awkward camera of the games) following Rose as she chases someone that she thinks is her daughter down a dark alley. All of a sudden the film shifts into ""hell"" world, which was a nice effect, but suddenly hundreds of monsters show up. This was one of those things that has changed from the games... in the game there were monsters, but only ever a few at a time. Anyway, Rose wakes up with the monsters suddenly gone (again, nod to the game) and heads back to her vehicle. She even finds a drawing from Sharon (Alessa?) directing her to go to the school! I LOVE THIS MOVIE! So many great tie-ins with the game. Then, officer Bennett shows up.<br/><br/>In what was the first of many deviations from the game that I did not like, Cybil shows up and treats Rose like complete crap, even ARRESTING her and trying to take her out of Silent Hill. What? Then again I don't know why they had Rose speed away after being pulled over by Cybil anyway... they should have left the opening more like the opening of the game. They changed Cybil's character for some reason, that's OKAY, I guess. Why does she follow Sharon around? One of the KEY components of the game, one of the most fun elements of the game was the fact that you were always isolated and alone in this freaky place. Why is it that Rose isn't alone for most of this film? It's like the filmmakers knew what made Silent Hill freaky and terrifying, and they added characters to it, which totally destroyed the whole thing. When Rose is alone in the film, pretty much at any time, those are the film's best scenes.<br/><br/>But the film never quite seems to grasp onto the terror that the game had pumping through it. The story was pretty good, but I have to draw attention to the fact that, about 3/4 of the way through the film, they stopped everything to tell us the entire plot since they didn't do much in the way of plot development throughout the rest of the movie. This smacked of laziness and I found myself rolling my eyes when this happened. We see who appears to be Lisa with Alessa, but she doesn't have red hair and isn't explained at all, a rip-off since Lisa was one of the game's best characters because of her connection to Alessa. Where was Kaufmann? Why was Dahlia just some sympathetic old lady? Dahlia in the game was a terrific villain, why remove her from the picture completely but still keep her in the film? Why were there (at least) 40 or 50 people in Silent Hill? Crowd scenes?! Where in any of the games do you ever see a crowd?! It started out promising, had its better parts, but it just didn't capture the essence of the games. The worst part of this, however, was probably the fact that they didn't stay in Silent Hill. At any number of times through the film, they cut out of Silent Hill to the B story going on with Chris (Sean Bean), Rose's husband, who is not in the world of Silent Hill and is trying to find his wife and daughter. This story wasn't even that interesting, quite frankly, and every time they cut away to it, you lost a little bit of what made the games so great. The fact that Harry was trapped in Silent Hill the whole time made it that much creepier; that environment started to wear on you after awhile. Cutting away to the real world of which Silent Hill is not a part completely destroys the effect.<br/><br/>It had its good parts, but it never captured the terror and all-out creepy feeling that the game(s) give you. They changed some aspects of the story, which I wouldn't have had a problem with if they hadn't tampered with the exact formula that makes each game what it is: that being the isolation and trapped feeling of the characters. It did so many things right and tied into the games so well at times, but it just deviated far too much at other times. Unfortunately those deviations managed to steer the film too far off course and removed the audience from it. I did rather enjoy the ending, however, which I am understanding many people did not understand; I won't ruin that for any potential moviegoers. Six out of ten stars."
"skyb788","10","2","5","22 April 2006"," Awesome Movie (contains spoilers!)
","Last night was the opening night of the Silent Hill movie. I have to admit, I've been waiting as patiently as possible to see this! Which of course isn't saying much at all! For those of you who are Silent Hill fans, you got to see this movie! The movie started off with little Sharon (changed from Cheryl from SH1), having nightmares (dreams?) about her mother and Silent Hill. Her adopted parents, Rose and Chris DaSilva, go after her through a tunnel and past a highway to this awesome waterfall area where Sharon is just standing and calling out for her mother. Rose immediately goes to the rescue just before Sharon falls forward off the cliff, and holds the squirming child who is screaming at this point for her mother and Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The movie then picks up with Rose taking Sharon to Silent Hill without consulting her husband first. On the way, Rose is pulled over by a bad ass bitch cop (Cybil SH1), and speeds on to Silent Hill. Speeding along the way Rose almost runs into this ghost-like figure of a girl crossing the road and everything goes white.<br/><br/>Rose wakes up a bit later to discover that Sharon is missing and she runs ahead to Silent Hill when her car doesn't start. There she sees the girl figure thinking that its Sharon. She follows her into this alleyway where there is a loud alarm and she first finds herself in a hellish alleyway where blood is no stranger. The worlds have shifted, and we find ourself witnessing the first view of the demon Silent Hill. (This is a great scene here) Rose continues to search for the girl and run behind her tracks, but stops when a human-like figure on a fence stands right before her. The eyes are moving and it's breathing, then out of nowhere come these gray figures that chase her while she runs. Then she makes it into a building with them right at her feet. As they are clawing away at her, she curls up and they disappear. The world seems to have turned back to normal.<br/><br/>She looks around the town coming to a street that has been taken away by something, and gets her first encounter with Dahlia Gillespie. Dahlia sees the picture of Rose's Sharon and tries to take away her locket saying that that is HER daughter! Rose freaks and throws the woman off her.<br/><br/>After a bit more searching she meets up again with the cop, Cybil, who handcuffs her and they walk away from Silent Hill only to discover that they cannot leave the way they came. Then they meet more of the gray figures who spray acid on Cybil and Rose runs away, handcuffs and all.<br/><br/>Rose then proceeds down the streets of Silent Hill, only stopping for a few moments to check each bus route map to get to Midwich Elementary School. At the school, she goes inside to the main office area. Obviously at this point, you know that there is some weird thing going on and it mainly has to do with religion, cause there are a LOT of pictures in the school (and the rest of the movie) dealing with cult religion and God.<br/><br/>Now, I won't go spoiling the rest of the movie, I'm just gonna say that there are a Lot of things having to do with Silent Hill 1 on the regular Playstation. If you have played the game, then at this point you are probably wondering why they used the mother (who is supposed to be dead), instead of Harry Mason. I honestly don't understand it, but there was one quote used in the movie that made me feel a little better about it.....<br/><br/>Cybil: ""A mother is God in the eyes of a child."" OK, on to my great commentary part. The movie was Great and I played all four games before I actually saw the movie. There are some great enemies like Claudia, Pyramid-head, the nurses (which made everyone jump), etc... Also, while I was watching the movie, I had to bite the urge to jump up and scream ""quick, use the first-aid kit!"" or ""You have to get the memo."" I only have a few questions that still bother me. One thing that bothered me was the fact that she was in handcuffs during almost the whole school scene. I don't know why, it just bothered me. Then, my biggest question (for those who've seen the movie) is why was Rose and Sharon still in limbo at the end of the movie?

","Silent Hill was very much THE WORST movie I have EVER seen. <br/><br/>I felt that the special effects were some of the best I ever seen, but all the money was spent on that, and not on quality acting lessons.<br/><br/>In the movie, roughly every 20 seconds the main character played by Rhada Mitchell screams out for her lost daughter, Sharon. After hearing this for the first 30 minutes, I was not willing to hear it for the next 90. However, I did sit through the movie, in complete agony, waiting for some scare, thrill, or some REAL drama to happen.<br/><br/>Instead what I got was some sad half way attempt to describe that the fate of Silent Hill is coming to a head, and the whole town is religious and loves to ""burn at the stake"" anyone who is not like them, and holds their faith high.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I was thoroughly unimpressed with anything outside the special effects. The changing of the darkness coming and the demons coming out was a little confusing as to why it was happening, but still was neat visually. I still don't understand the ending of the movie as it seems to me, there is an alternate dimension in which everyone, except the character Chris lives in.<br/><br/>Save yourself the $10 and wait for video."

","Literally one of the worst films(if you can call it that)I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Script was...well what was that?. Editing was not unlike that of which a lobotomized 3 year old with a blindfold and ear plugs could do.I don't think anybody new what to do with this one. Everyone involved dropped the ball. There was one point in there that I could have sworn I was watching Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" video. WOW how unforgivably unabashedly awful. It's hard to believe this is the work of the same person who was responsible for Brotherhood Of The Wolf. I guess it just goes to show that we all make mistakes ,or something rather clichéd like that. Not unlike Silent Hill."
"Joshaw","4","4","14","21 April 2006"," Terrible, terrible movie.
","I'm not one to think that a video game movie will be very great, but the advertisements for the Silent Hill movie made it look like it could be halfway cool. Plus, it's got Sean Bean, so it can't be all bad, right? Alas, not only is it not very good, but it's downright awful. The music was pretty good and I thought they did a good job of setting mood with it. Also, the cinematography was pretty sweet for the first half to two-thirds of the movie. I really like a lot of the angles used. It's a great LOOKING movie. Other than those two things the movie was complete and utter garbage. About halfway through I decided the movie wasn't particularly good, but it wasn't awful. It was just an average movie. The final act of the movie was absolutely retarded. Plot threads were left hanging, characters and devices left unexplained, and it was just gratuitous and stupid gore. To top it all off, it wasn't even remotely scary. When it comes to horror movies I am probably the biggest wimp there is. I would go into more detail about some of the stuff that has kept me up at night, but I am actually ashamed. This movie didn't scare me in the least. Anytime something that I assume was supposed to be frighting happened, I found myself bored.<br/><br/>Don't make the mistake that I made. Avoid this movie at all cost."
"Screamfan3","2","4","14","21 April 2006"," Why must we be tortured with bad movies...
","As the movie opened, I found myself looking forward to a pleasantly bad and quite jokingly funny horror movie. I, however, in the end found myself confused and relieved. The movie boasts its abnormality, and yet begins with a near cliché plot, ghost towns. However, as the journey throughout a barely visible and overdramatised set continues, we find ourselves consumed in questions such as, ""Why is the cop wearing a tight leather outfit?"" or ""Why is her phone on a necklace?"" or ""Why has she stopped looking for her daughter?"", or many other distracting thoughts about minuscule points within the film. Surprisingly, such experienced actors fail to represent their horror genre with unbelievable reactions to unbelievable events. However, I am willing to forgive and instead blame the script. A script that contains such odd lines as ""Look, I'm burning!!"" as the little girl then burst into flames, or as the mother says to the cop, ""Its all going to be okay, were going to be fine,"" before the drama even happens. The movie also brags at its minor use of computer generated action and scenes. I found myself doubting that throughout. Also unbelievable, was the music, and not in a good way. The oddly placed and strangely non-thematic sounds did not accompany the action well at all. Besides the aforementioned ""problems"" with the incredibly confusing, cliff-hanging, and ridiculous film, it was quite amusing and moderately entertaining, allowing for numerous chuckles and outbursts due to character stupidity and some awkward and misplaced dialog."

","Won tickets to a sneak peek last night in Toronto. <br/><br/>Before I went, I checked the user comments here on IMDb and found a lot of glowing / positive reviews so was actually getting pretty excited about seeing the movie (I have played and finished Silent Hil 1, 2 & 3 and am well versed on the mythos).<br/><br/>+ The visuals and the music (a lot from the SH3 soundtrack) were excellent. - The acting was absolutely DREADFUL.. - Some of the serious lines had the audience laughing very hard (""I think there was a fire here"" was the classic 'bad line') - Story was simply dreadful - the ending scene with our heroine in the church giving her 'speech' was eye rollingly awful. - movie was way too long (2 hours..s/b 1.5 hours)<br/><br/>OK, I think you get the picture. <br/><br/>I honestly question the authenticity of the earlier glowing reviews. Seriously...the acting was bad, bad, bad...not like good bad or bad you can overlook however BAD.

In a word: crappy.<br/><br/>The dialog is full of unnecessary hyperbole. The acting itself is too heavy-handed. The monsters are not all that frightening. The music sounds like somebody playing a Casio keyboard with their feet. The best part was the entire theater laughing, no, guffawing at the climax.

Alice Krieg was much scarier as the Borg Queen than as the personification of evil in Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The pop-video end title sequence felt like it had been tacked on to the end of the film. One thing that really annoyed me was an almost inaudible high frequency whine through large portions of the film.

","...because you aren't disappointed when the movie blows.<br/><br/>Being a big horror movie buff, I had been waiting for Silent Hill for awhile. It was an unfortunate wait.<br/><br/>The movie dragged on a could have been made 20 minutes shorter. It employed - as too many horror movies do these days - the ""creepy child"" scenario. Enough, children aren't scary anymore! The dialogue was awful. The main character played her role well, but her sidekick, a cop, only brought unintentional laughs to the crowd.<br/><br/>On top of that, most of the movie made little sense (until of course the end where it was all explained for us). At which point, the movie still did not make any sense. It left way to many open endings and you never really know what happened (unless, God forbid, it was intentional to bring on a sequel).<br/><br/>In all, I gave the movie a four, because it was somewhat interesting despite its many, many flaws. I thought the town in the movie was pretty cool, and it is obvious that they spent a lot of money on the movie. I'd have to guess that a lot of the script was being tossed out and re-written as they went along. Not as bad as, say, House of the Dead. But if you want a good horror movie go see The Hills Have Eyes if it is still playing in your theatre. This one is a DVD rental (if someone else rents it)."

"woody-126","3","3","11","22 April 2006"," Pretty ridiculous.
","Let's start with the good: this is a pretty good video game adaptation. The film captures the look and feel of Silent Hill the game better than can be imagined. It sounds great, the colors are right and the desolation and decay of Silent Hill the town are all perfect. The film's stars all look great and fit in really well.<br/><br/>But that's really all I can think of for the good.<br/><br/>Now for the bad... Let's see, the script, the dialog, the misogyny, the insulting exposition, just everything. Let's admit it here, fan or not: this movie was pretty much awful. At no point in this movie was I genuinely creeped out. I expected the motion picture adaptation of the scariest game I've ever played to make my skin crawl. All I got was bored and just a little perturbed.<br/><br/>The movie is too long. Really, I never say this, but there could have been a good 20 to 30 minutes shaved off, and it would have been just about right. There are some recreations of shots from the game that just go on a little too long. Or a lot too long. The entire second half of the movie just felt like it was being dragged out for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Silent Hill the game is slow in parts, but it builds tension and keeps it up for the entirety of the game. Silent Hill the movie builds tension slowly in the first quarter, and then... just loses it. I was hooked in the beginning, and then I wasn't. When the movie should get exciting, it doesn't. No follow-through.<br/><br/>And for all the length of the film, it doesn't seem like they accomplished anything. I don't feel any closer or more understanding of the world of Silent Hill. I walked away from this movie with a bad taste in my mouth. It was my fault, though. I had expectations, and I set myself up for disappointment. Should have known...<br/><br/>The dialog was horrid, and not in a cheesy-horror-like way. It was just bad in a bad way. Most of the exchanges consisted of action movie clichés and emotive ""It'll be okay"" tripe. NONE of the dialog seemed to flow out of the actor's mouths naturally. It was like they were spitting out words without context. Not that it was any of their faults; they're all good actors. But the writing was so poor that it just didn't work. It was simple, terse writing in the worst way.<br/><br/>The misogyny in the movie was just out of control. Avary's original script, featuring a cast entirely composed of women, might not have had this problem. But as it was, it was just a little too obvious. I know the S&M/fetish/sexual undertones of the world of Silent Hill, but there's nothing really like the barbed-wire in the crotch scene. That's pretty blatant. Or consider the miners beating Cybil. Or Rose getting beaten as she enters the church. It's all just a little too much for me.<br/><br/>Alessa's complete explanation near the end of the film was absolutely insulting. It went on forever and covered flashbacks in the worst possible way. The syndicated Tales from the Darkside series had better voice-over work. The movie itself didn't need that explanation. The flashbacks could have been worked in without that god-awful description of everything that had happened up to that point. Great, we didn't really need that. The move spoke for itself pretty well up to that point and just absolutely fell apart after that.<br/><br/>And again, for all that extra film and stupid explanation, Pyramid Head didn't get any fair treatment, Cybil was never ""converted,"" etc. There was an apparent cliffhanger, setting the stage for a sequel.<br/><br/>There are TONS of problems with this movie, and I really wanted to like it. I was excited, just like most Silent Hill fans. But I am now a little sadder for having seen this movie. It could have been incredibly creepy, and a good movie on its own. Instead, we get a ""good"" video game movie (which isn't saying much) that's just a little jumpy.<br/><br/>I thought Gans could have made something worthwhile with a good script, a good cast and a large budget. He made something pretty but terrible, with a good cast, a large budget and a silly script that could have used some heavy editing. I'd like to hear what he has to say about any studio limitations or script problems, but what I'd really like is an explanation.<br/><br/>What a disappointment."
"skewperman2056","3","3","11","21 April 2006"," Silent Hill
","Being the avid gamer that I am, but also a movie buff, seeing this movie made me terribly upset with the movie making industry.<br/><br/>This is not a good movie. Not even remotely.<br/><br/>The game, is fantastic, superb even. I own and have beaten all 4 silent hills, and was extremely ecstatic about this release.<br/><br/>The fact they changed the main character to a woman, not because shes a woman, but the fact that, it was just done terribly wrong, makes me sad. HUGH events that were the entire reason why the game was happening, why harry ended up in Silent Hill, were all lost to the script of this mediocre movie. The characters are stupid, they don't look anything like they did from the game, and just don't act the exact same way. Example, Cybil Bennet being extremely rude and aggressive to Rose. Wheres the Cybil you could choose to fight or save, because she helped you out SO much during the course of the original Silent Hill? Gone, thats what. Stripped down to a (of course) big breasted bimbo, with a large gun and a sharp tongue. So, to say that only the hardcore gamers will enjoy this, is to say, you will enjoy the characters having the name, not the personality or the flavor of the games characters. And as for the monsters, NONE of those monsters came from the original Silent Hill. Pyramid Head Man, and the spewing numb bodies cam from Silent Hill 3, not Silent Hill 1. They even changed the name of Cherryl, to Sharon, for absolutely no reason or significance to anything the story has to offer. Nothing about witch craft was present in game, yet in the movie. Just extremely cheesy, like every other video game movie. The fans get screwed because it has nothing to do with the game. Non-fans get screwed because they don't know any of the significance of anything going on, the places, the characters, or events. Everything is sloppy, wrong, and just plain dumb. I laughed more then I was was scared. Stupid actors, stupid story, stupid ""reason why the towns ""huanted"""", STUPID MOVIE.<br/><br/>The movie sound like it was made form taking hearsay from a dyslexic 12 year old who played the original for an hour.<br/><br/>And thats a crying shame."
"KineticSeoul","6","2","6","29 November 2012"," Decent video games to movie adaptation but just not a good movie
","This is a video game to movie adaptation from the video game franchise called ""Silent Hill"". And this is a mix of ""Silent Hill 1"" and ""Silent Hill 2"" when it comes to the video games that is integrated into this movie. The story sorta follows the plot of ""Silent Hill 1"" but the premise and atmosphere is more similar to ""Silent Hill 2"". Anyways both games is about trying to find someone and that is basically the plot to this movie as well. A girl constantly calls out Silent Hill sleep walks a lot so instead of psychiatric the mother Rose(Radha Mitchell) decides to take her to Silent Hill although the husband played by Sean Bean is against it. And as farther it she goes into the town of Silent Hill things start to become nightmarish as more secrets unravel. Especially when the siren starts to ring. Unlike the ""Resident Evil"" movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson that has nothing to do with the video games. This one at least tries to be faithful to the video games this is based off of. Christophe Gans probably did his research and tried to please the fans of this video game franchise or something. Because the atmosphere and direction is similar to the game, even how items are found and etc. But the thing is some actions and scenarios that might work for a video game doesn't always come off as something positive when put into a movie. Rose just seemed to be off her rockers most of the time and her actions sometimes doesn't make much sense. Especially in the beginning where she tries to outrun the cop. Who is actually a character from the first Silent Hill video game play by Laurie Holden. That actually pulls of the character Cybil pretty well. The thing is watching characters go in the direction like video game character doesn't make it a good movie, especially since sometimes it feels like your watching someone play a video game but without the emotional tug and engaging story. And it isn't all that scary like the video games this is based off of especially since your not the one controlling the characters. I give it props for trying to follow the direction of the video games this is based off of but there is little to not tension in this. They got the atmosphere right but it just didn't have the psychedelic and ominous and yet dreamlike feel from the Silent Hill video games that it is known for. And those are the main elements that makes the games stand out. And some parts in this movie just seemed irrelevant and out of nowhere but that works in the context of the video games but not really as a movie. For a video game adaptation this movie is decent but it's not a good movie either.<br/><br/>6.3/10"

"demoriorxois","4","2","6","25 April 2006"," Pseudo Silent Hill
","*SPOILERS* What words might I add to fully reveal my utter disappointment with this film? I patiently awaited the release of Silent Hill, in hopes that this would be the best video game to turn movie thus far. My hopes were shattered. I must speak figuratively when I say I want Roger Avary and Christophe Gans to die a miserable death for believing they actually wrote and directed a great Silent Hill representation.<br/><br/>Firstly, inserting the word ""F**k"", was the wrong thing to do; for not once in any Silent Hill game of the series does that word appear.<br/><br/>In addition, inserting Pyramid Head and a demon patient does not make any film ""Silent Hill"". Pyramid Head is a representation of James Sunderland, and the ""throwing up"" demon patient is a representation of the late Mary S. Sunderland. This is quickly proved by the scene where Pyramid Head is strangling a demon patient in the Apartment Buildings in Silent Hill 2 (Consider how James killed Mary). That said, what the hell did they both make an appearance for? This has now ruined the chance of creating a Silent Hill 2 game-to-movie and having it make any sense.<br/><br/>The cult in the game did not exist, the whole point of the town was that is was to be DESERTED! Yes, that means no cultists who have been living in a town with hardly any food for over thirty years. I distinctly remember differently in the game Dahlia was in search of her daughter, and was trying to aid her in bringing forth the god Samael. In the movie, they just believed her to be a witch. They do not explain why she was a witch, or what she did to signify her herself as a witch, she just was.<br/><br/>The characters do seem agitated during the film, but the characters in all the SH games have a much calmer demeanor; which ruined it for me. I despise screaming, frightened women. Albeit being calm the characters fail to seem realistic, consider the fact that this movie is entirely unbelievable in itself.<br/><br/>I will admit Pyramid Head is the best part of the entire movie; He looked authentic. The removal of flesh from Anna was entirely great, so thumbs up on that motion.<br/><br/>In closing I just think a few things could have been altered with the script to make it less talk and more action. Also, I would have enjoyed more fog, more dark hallways with gruesome cries and frightening echoes, and most decidedly, more blood...Everywhere. Just like the games."
"arc81","3","2","6","25 April 2006"," Don't waste your time. It's all hype.
","I don't write reviews too often, but I wanted to voice my opinion on this one, because the ratings on IMDb were truly deceiving this time.<br/><br/>Let me first start out by saying that I did not play the games much before seeing this. I spent maybe 10 minutes walking around in Silent Hill 2. Enough to see the overall atmosphere and beat up some zombies, and that's it. I didn't know anything about the storyline.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie, from what I saw in the game, was dead on. They did an excellent job matching that for the most part, and it had a great feel to it. However, this is the only thing I really enjoyed about it -- the creepy atmosphere. Then comes the actors. A few of them did what they needed to do, but they just didn't come through for us. Nothing felt genuine, to be perfectly honest, it didn't seem like they knew what their roles really were. On the flip side, a few of them (particularly Laura Holden, the police officer) were downright awful. For me, she completely ruined the first half of the movie, simply because she didn't fit her role. Another thing that added to the cheesiness of this was the makeup. The special effects in the movie were excellent, kudos to them for that. But the make up was terrible. When someone's supposed to look dead, or sickly and pale.. I don't want to see pink flesh on their eyelids where they didn't put white makeup. When someone's supposed to look like a mutilated burn victim, I don't want the skin to be shiny and look like plastic, and I surely don't want to clearly see where the makeup stops and their real skin begins. These were all things I immediately noticed when I watched Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Now comes the story. Again, I do not know how the story went in the game. In the movie, the story was a total mess. It seemed EXTREMELY rushed, and nothing fit together right. I honestly don't know how to explain it, so here's an example. Let's say you're watching a comedy, laughing until your sides hurt, and out of nowhere, Robo Cop comes in and starts terrorizing the city for no reason. Then Robo Cop leaves, and the comedy continues. This is how I felt with Silent Hill. Something would happen, and then it was over. Then something completely different would happen, then that was over too. No focus was placed on a single event for more than a couple minutes. Multiply that over 120 minutes, and throw in some time fillers, and you have the story of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The IMDb rating on this movie (6.9) was the reason I went to go see it in theaters tonight. Judging by the comments I've read about the movie and by the movie itself, it seems you HAVE to have played the games to really enjoy this.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.. I wasn't bored while I was watching it, I wasn't mad when I left the theater, and I didn't feel like I completely wasted my money. It kept me entertained, I was just very disappointed, because I was expecting a fresh new horror. It had some nerve-racking moments, but no good scares. I had a wimp of a girl next to me who didn't flinch once. We both walked out ready to just go home.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the story had potential, but they screwed it up. If nothing else, I suggest waiting until it comes to video and rent it. If you're a fan of the game, and have thoroughly followed the story, you might really enjoy it. If not, I can almost guarantee you're going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>3/10"
"musicveins","4","2","6","24 April 2006"," a sophisticated idea turned generic and cheesy
","Now let me first give you my review as a person who might have never experienced the video game:<br/><br/>The story begins with an enthralling and unique turn of events unlike any movie. As the movie progresses, the visual effects are stimulating and different, but the story becomes generic and cheesy. What began as a smart thriller has turned into a lame witch hunt. All of the sophisticated ideas are simplified into boring concepts that are only laughable. The entire story begins to crumble at the foundation, and near the end, most of the audience has given up any emotional connection to the events. The very end, however, brings back the sophistication only seen in the beginning of the film and rarely seen in the middle. All in all, it had a very unique concept that was lost in the effort of trying to make a story EVERYONE could connect to because in the end, it was only VERY cheesy.<br/><br/>Now as a longtime fan of the game my review is almost the same, but the movie is even worse for fans of the Silent Hill game. Gamers enter the theatre already understanding the complexity of the Silent Hill stories and although many will be GREATLY satisfied visually (and the music was also fantastic because it held true to the music of the game and also added very beautiful melodies to the score) the story is changed in a way that only a fan of the Salem witch trials would be satisfied. The plot becomes VERY basic and by the end of the movie, most fans will just pretend that the movie never happened. The story and dialogue are way too cheesy to be taken seriously which is very different from any of the Silent Hill games. MY OVERALL REVIEW (OUT OF 10 STARS): -PERSON WHO HAS NEVER PLAYED THE GAME: 5 STARS -FAN OF THE GAME: 3 STARS"

","OK, I went and saw it today. When it started, I was amazed. Some of the camera angles reminded me of video game camera angles, and at different times it looked like rose ran like a game character. Halfway through the movie, it started to get a bit boring. It felt like the movie was 5 hours long. Even my friend's dad fall asleep. When it was all said and done, I was left feeling confused about certain things. I have never played the game, so if it's a thing were I need to play the game to understand things better, then I feel the movie should have explained itself and the makers should not have expected the audience to have played the game.<br/><br/>All in all, to me it felt like one long car trip that I wanted end."

","the actors - excellent the artwork and sets - excellent<br/><br/>The mood of the game was captured stylistically, and yet emotionally i did not feel immersed in the dark world, as one can experience in the game.<br/><br/>isolation, paranoia, claustrophobia, anxiety -all very difficult emotions to convey through visual story telling. I think of Kubrick's 'The Shining' of an example of how to create mood through a powerful musical score, cinematography, and very little dialog, mundane conversation, facial expression and the tension of suspense.<br/><br/>I wish the film was more dream like, with much less literal verbal explanation. Narrower story focus, staying in the dark world. I wish the actress was just left alone to mutter to herself. More internal personal conflict rather than being surrounded with a cast of townspeople.<br/><br/>I think this movie was killed in committee, way too many characters and competing story lines forced together. I can only assume the studio had too much control over production and sabotaged the concentration of the director. Perhaps the multiple 'Executive Producers' got scared the production would fail and withdrew their financing. Because you can tell this thing was thrown together in a bizarre illogical manner. Entire scenes needed to be scrapped, rewritten and re-shot.<br/><br/>It seems that Silent Hill's considerable existing base of artwork was expropriated to tell a fast paced sweeping epic of a film, a Hollywood action type of story rather than what this subject matter required- a thought provoking, very personal experience of hell on earth. I would like to change the pacing and focus of the film to a grim determined Karasawa style.<br/><br/>i have to say the entire cast and crew is so talented, it really hurt to see such a horrible failure. 30 seconds of the silent hill game would be scarier than this movie.<br/><br/>the editing of this movie was Horrific.<br/><br/>I am seriously hoping that a directors cut DVD is released which is radically different than this studio version.<br/><br/>#1- erase the husband from the script.<br/><br/>Sean Bean is one of the great actors working today. He was used in this movie like a card board cut out.<br/><br/>The cast and crew are some of the most talented people in the business of film making. I loved 'brotherhood of the wolf.' I had a 10 year old little girl next to me laughing at how bad and unscary this movie was. And I quote ""That was retarded.""<br/><br/>Sometimes good intentioned people are warped be circumstances they do not understand to do horrible things, they look back and say how did it get so bad, how did I allow myself to fall so far into hell. This movie is an example of the same message it was trying to convey.<br/><br/>I wish only the best for the individuals who worked on this movie in their future endeavors, and I look forward to Silent Hill 2."

","I came into this film expecting nothing, and that is what I left the theater with... well, that and a bunch of jokes about what I just saw.<br/><br/>The movie was a classic video game adaptation: Plot holes everywhere (I don't care if a movie makes much sense though) Poor acting, Zombie shooting, Poorly created characters, and scenes that seemed to come from nowhere and that never explained themselves...<br/><br/>Nothing was scary. It seemed to me that the movie was created of scenes that were scary inside the directors/game developers head, but on film just looked stupid. I can imagine the director saying to his friends ""Hey, wouldn't it be scary to see a nurse bleed from her eyes?"" or ""A man dead and tied up in a bathroom stall seems scary huh?"" Nothing was scary. Nothing at all.<br/><br/>As a whole the movie was horrible, but it was kinda fun to watch.

Here's a quick rundown: Acting: Horrible. Possibly even worse than the video game series.<br/><br/>Story: Not much mystery, everything happens very quickly and it was so good of a game-to-movie adaptation that you may as well hold a playstation controller and follow the simple, quick clues that lead Rose to her daughter. Watching the movie was like playing an altered version of SH1 mixed with a tiny bit of SH2 in fast forward with the puzzle level set on 'too easy'.<br/><br/>Gore: Very well done in my opinion. There were a few really great gore scenes.<br/><br/>Monsters: I didn't care for the monsters much...you'll see what I mean. Pyramid Head was pretty cool, and performs the greatest scene in the entire movie. He was introduced way too soon.<br/><br/>Screenplay: Maybe if the script called for more panic in the actors, then the acting would've been better. The script was probably taken from a children's book; however, some lines were tolerable.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: The original music for the movie were awesome, but the tracks they took from the videogames were a little redundant. Oh well, may as well half-a** the music if you're going to make a shi*** movie.<br/><br/>I just have an overall bad opinion of this movie, but I almost expected that when I knew they were taking the SH1 storyline and regurgitating it.<br/><br/>jrkgaergreigreg GRRR!

I still purchased a copy of Silent Hill on DVD due to the brilliance of the fist half, but I really believe the overall result to be one of the biggest disappointments in horror movie history - due mostly to the horrific ending.

"peeedeee-94281","1","1","2","15 December 2019"," Inconsistent Mess, Very Disappointing After Brotherhood Of The Wolf!
","You would think that the director of the marvelous, well-crafted Brotherhood of The Wolf would have come up with a great follow-up film. Apparently not! And even more disappointing considering it was a passion project for the director, who sought after the rights.
Where do I start? The movie is bad from the terrible acting, poor development of characters, inconsistency in tone and even the way the horror plays out. It's almost like watching two different movies stitched together.
The two main characters, the mother and daughter, are quite dull. I don't get any sense of family between them, or even the father (played by Sean Bean). Not sure if the later reveal that she was adopted has anything to do with that distance. Sean Bean seems redundant here. Whatever evidence he uncovers in his quest for the truth is rendered redundant when the mother goes through that whole 'reveal sequence'. It seems like the only reason he was there was to have someone hear the garbled phone calls.
The presence of the motorcycle cop is also redundant, only serves for a shocking death towards the end of the film.
The movie starts off with the mother and daughter driving off to Silent Hill because of the daughter's nightmares. Not sure why she needs to take the daughter with her, without the father. At some point, she interacts with the motorcycle cop, who then chases her all the way up to the Silent Hill area, where they both crash.
They wake up in a hazy setting, where as the movie goes on, you see is a parallel universe version of the town. And we also see the occasional monster. But then the siren goes off, darkness falls, and some even creepier crawlies come alive. All the time, the mother is looking for her daughter. But there doesn't seem to be any consistency as to when the monsters show up, because there's a scene when they are on the road and some armless/faceless monsters show up, and there wasn't any siren.
Eventually after all the yelling an screaming they were doing, they meet up with the town folk who are still alive in this purgatory place. And that's when the movie switches from monster movie to witches/cult/sacrificial burnings.
All the while, Sean Bean's father character attempts to find answers, but what's the point of his character? He can't do anything to help the wife and daughter. The mother is constantly looking for her daughter, but it gets tiresome. Eventually you find out some confusing plot twist about the daughter really being the alter ego of a girl burned in sacrifice years earlier in Silent Hill. Go figure.
No explanation about these apparently coal fires that have made the town abandoned, and what relation that has to the sacrificial cult that died in the church.
By the end of the film, you don't care anymore. And you realize you wasted time watching it because there's no real end. The mother and daughter didn't die in the town, but they're still dead? Confusing, muddled mess. And a waste of time. Not worth sitting through."
"bowmanblue","5","1","2","19 November 2019"," A film that's TOO based on a video game
","Ever since 'Super Mario Bros,' films that have been adapted from video games have faced harsh criticism from cinema goers (and even more scorn from the critics!). 'Silent Hill' was a game with more 'plot' than Mario, so at least there's more to work with when it comes to trying to create a coherent story for the big screen. Unfortunately, whereas Mario was critisied for straying away from the source material, 'Silent Hill' sticks to it a little too much (for my liking at least).<br/><br/>The game features a town that's filled with monsters and a hero that has to navigate their way through it. And, without wishing to indulge in 'spoilers,' that's basically the first hour of the movie. A couple (Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean) have adopted a young girl (Jodelle Ferland), only for her to go missing in - you guessed it - the cut-off town of Silent Hill. Mitchell visits the location first and spends basically an hour moving from one spooky location to the next, crying her daughter's name and then getting chased on to the next set-piece by some slavering computer-generated beast or other. Later, when Bean arrives there, he repeatedly shouts his wife's name over and over again.<br/><br/>You may be able to tell from my tone that I wasn't that taken with the film. I found it very long (nearly two hours), a bit predictable in terms of plot and very repetitive. However, there are definitely some plus points, too. The casting is good. I've already mentioned Mitchell and Bean, but there's also Laurie Holden in a pre 'Walking Dead' role and Alice Krige. Plus the special effects are quite gruesome. Yes, the film doesn't have a perfect budget when it comes to CGI monsters and a lot of the time you can tell they've been added on in post production, but it does do a good job of creating a bleak and fearful atmosphere.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film overall, just one that you seriously have to be ready to invest two hours of your life in (or be a mega fan of the game, I guess). Fair play to the film-makers for trying to stick ardently to the source material, but whereas with many films a 'director's cut' may add more scenes and give a better idea of the original vision, this is one film that would benefit from having a few scenes taken out of it to move the pace along, as (certainly the first half) feels a little like they're retreading the same old ground again and again. I wanted to press the 'START' button and skip these 'cut-scenes.'"

It's a movie - end of. Or it should be. As such, it's one of the most eerie, atmospheric horror films I've seen for a long time. The special effects are stunnng. And that's what my five stars are for. I was completely captivated from the beginning. However, the convolutions of the story are a bit involved - dark Alessa, super-dark Alessa, innocent Alessa.....it's all a bit difficult to follow. I lost interest about half an hour before the end, which was a shame because it started so well. Maybe it's really aimed at the gamers who know what to expect and who recognise the characters. However technically it's a tour de force and I can see why it has a cult following. According to some reviewers who are clearly totally captivated by the whole concept, there are a whole host of underlying themes here which were obviously lost on me. But the special effects are great!"

If you want a pure jump fest go watch something stupid like Texas Chainsaw.<br/><br/>This movie is scary on a whole other level, and obviously all those low reviews were written by morons who can't comprehend anything and have to have the movie dumbed down for them.<br/><br/>This movie is a mental game, not a gory show. If you can't comprehend a well written, ethereal mind trip, then please go elsewhere.<br/><br/>This movie is about how faith and fear corrupt the innocent on a spiritual and mental level, that creates it's own psychic world to live in; outside of ours. That's why the characters never meet up even though they are in the same place. They are spiritually out of time and sync with each other.

","Director Christophe Gans has produced a horror film of such imagination and overwhelmingly shocking imagery that it breaks new cinematic ground. With stylistic vision and nightmarish atmospherics, this is a chilling gaze across the desolate landscape of hell itself. It seems the gates of hell have indeed swung open and the damned have occupied this unholy town. The visuals are nothing less than breathtaking, unique in every possible way and beautifully realized technically. As previously noted, the creatures given life in this movie seem to have escaped from Hades and run rampant in this small forsaken town. Their movements are amazing and repellent concurrently, their tormented visages unlike anything ever before captured on film. A film of such innovative artistic choices is a welcome but disturbing cinematic accomplishment. There is no doubt that it will mark a turning point in horror cinema if for no other reason that the trend toward torture porn is defeated by such a motion picture. Without abundant gore or excessive violence, a terror filled mystery can unfold with incredibly frightening ways if imagination is invested in the project. No one who sees this film will ever forget the haunting imagery, dark landscape, and unrelenting horror that is Silent Hill."

","Silent Hill is one of those series that I could never get into. Silent Hill 2 was good, but the only other Silent Hill game I have played is Downpour and that one was abysmal. I know a lot of people are going to say that I should play the games first, but I'm going to dismiss that because it really shouldn't matter. A mother and daughter flee to a strange abandoned town to seek out answers to the daughter's nightly psychological turmoil in Brotherhood of the Wolf director Christophe Gans' adaptation of the popular survival horror video game. Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) is a very sick child, yet rather than seeing her child suffer the cruel indignities of the medical profession, Rose (Radha Mitchell) ignores her husband's (Sean Bean) pleas and absconds with her ailing daughter to the fog-enshrouded town of Silent Hill. A town drenched in darkness and inhabited by a strange collection of menacing specters, Silent Hill seemingly swallows young Sharon whole upon arrival. Determined to get her daughter back at any cost, Rose sets out to explore the mysterious Silent Hill, only to discover an evil so powerful that it possesses the ability to transform anything it wishes. With the deeply disturbing history of the town slowly coming into focus through the dense fog, Rose soon realizes that both she and her daughter may be little more than simple pawns in a much larger, and seemingly supernatural, game. (Jason Buchanan, Rovi) Let us talk about the things the movie gets right: The music. They got the composer from the games, Akira Yamaoka, back to do the music. It is a great, creepy soundtrack, as expected. And they nailed the LOOK and FEEL of Silent Hill, it is a gorgeous looking film. The monsters look really good and the best monster of all makes an appearance: Pyramid Head. However, everything else about the film falls apart. The script is a cobbled mess, with no clear idea of where it is going and why. They leave things under-explained, or explained to the point where it doesn't make any sense. (For example: What was up with that ending). Also, there aren't really any scares, which is irritating to me. Also, the acting is pretty mediocre. The little girl does good, but everyone else it feels like is just phoning it in. And the film's pacing is all over the place: at times it goes too fast and you are like ""Wait what? Why did that happen?"" and other times it is so slow you're like ""Can we please move along?"". I know some fans are going to tear me apart for this, but I'm sorry: Both this and Silent Hill Revelation are terrible movies, video game adaptations or not. But on the other hand: This is a masterpiece when compared to the piece of crap sequel that came out just last year, IN 3D!!!!"

The atmosphere in the games is amazing. Maybe even the best part of the franchise. Which they converted into the movie pretty well. The acting isn't bad at all either. Jodelle Ferland who seems really talented to me (based on her roles in Kingdom Hospital & Tideland) again is pretty steady in this movie although her role is quite small this time. Same as Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean act pretty decent. You can easily imagine the fear Mitchell (Playing the main person) is experiencing during her forced visit to lovely Silent Hill.

The only movie out of that department which wasn't THAT disappointing was DOOM (Although it was still bad), but other movies like Alone in the Dark, Far Cry, Dead or Alive or the legendary Super Mario Bros. just left me close to tears because of how awful they were in terms of game adaption and movie quality in general. So my expectations towards Silent Hill weren't high. I actually didn't know this movie existed, until I stumbled upon it during a late night TV session. And fell in love with it instantly. First of all, I never was really into the Silent Hill franchise (I played the second part casually at a friend's house, but that's it) but still liked the way the game always retained a high level of tension and horror. And the same feeling came back to me during the movie. Although I have seen tons of horror movies, this was the first one since a while during which I was genuinely AFRAID. The atmosphere was great, the visuals stunning (I especially liked the 1:1 transition of the creature design), the gore well-dosed and placed (favourite scene: The Razorwire-Tendril execution of Christabella at the end) and, probably most surprising for a video game adoption, the acting was generally good. Some people complain about the replacement of the male lead from the game with a female, but it worked. This is definitely a movie worth seeing, for Silent Hill and simply horror fans alike."

","Was this supposed to be a horror story? Yes, I was sat there squirming on my seat, but through embarrassment. My impression of the production is that there's 2 directors in charge. One who's pretty capable and another overseeing the monster/crowd scenes. The second one is a very camp choreographer attempting to create his own Michael Jackson's Thriller video without the music. The crowd/group scenes looked pure theatre rather than cinema, and sooo many goth actors minus the makeup but with hair and emo faces. There's even one or two post-apocalyptic punks in there. And the group acting... ""come on dahhhlings, lets try to be a tree"" The scene I really choked with laughter over was where Rose was heading for room 111 and had to traverse a group of faceless, gray, uniformed nurses. They'd been instructed to twitch convulsively, which was certainly excellent amateur dramatics stuff, and they all advertised a possibility that the production company had received a free job lot from Wonderbra. If the overall style had been camp, then I'd have classed this as a ""cult movie"", but with the mixture as it is I'll class it as awful and not bother watching it again."

'Silent Hill', that is. and silent it is. at least during the day. at night zombies (or another type of deformed humanoid, which is basically the same in this case) roam the place. before the female protagonist finds that out, she will crash the car in an effort to not crash into a little girl, who walks the streets at night (bare feet, in a night gown, as them little rascals do). when Rose wakes up, she finds Sharon is gone missing, and, dismissing the comfort and practicality of her car, starts walking through the inevitable fog to the abandoned town of Silent Hill. there Rose and the viewer will discover the truth behind Sharon's nightmares, which is unnecessarily complicated and involves witches, 'the demon', 'the sign', evil in general, lots of gore, less suspension, and above all a lot of stupidity. i wonder how many mothers out there would keep searching for their daughter after they travelled to an abandoned town where ash rain clouds their vision and where the first signs of life, apart from their daughter running away from them, are a bunch of burned children trying to grab their limbs while crying like very small pigs and an extremely disfigured body on a fence looking right at them. at a certain point, you just know something is wrong. right?<br/><br/>i believe plausibility is the first thing to achieve in order to make good horror. the uncanny, empathy with at least some of the characters, &c. few film makers in this genre seem to realize this (or maybe i tend to watch the wrong horror films).<br/><br/>of course, all cannot be bad. the ash rain (thank God Rose is such a good observer and mutters about what she sees and does the audience a service in the process) and was quite nice (though i don't know if this is an original addition or not), as were the burned children because they had (the potency to have) something very sad about them. also, the way the skin of the environment peeled off to form Kafkaesque cockroaches was pretty neat. another detail that caught my attention was the interesting design of the demon's helmet, reminding me of the design of the video game MDK's protagonist Kurt. in this film, however, it felt out of place. over all, the color correction and post-production were clean and effective. at times the sound effects were really adding suspension, though the music was too dramatic and cliché to my taste. the ending was intriguing. not very original, but subtle enough and well-executed. <br/><br/>on a side note: the biggest thrill i got from the entire film was when i mistook Rose's leg for a weird creature lurking behind her. i think this might illustrate the ineffectiveness of cinematic logic in and a trite basis of this film: somehow the viewer might know what's coming at any time. food for thought."

","I haven't written a review in a long time. But I feel I have some semi-insightful ideas to contribute to the reviewing of Silent Hill. So.....<br/><br/>I originally bought this film as soon as it came out on DVD. I watched it right away, put it on the shelf, and pretty much forgot about it. Today, something drew my girlfriend and I to Silent Hill, and we decided we would watch it again.<br/><br/>I had a decent recollection of the film, but decided I would open IMDb and read a little bit to refresh my memory some more. Upon logging on, I noticed I originally gave it a score of 6/10. I also noticed that it's overall rating was 6.5. That intrigued me a bit as I assumed it was much lower. Plus, my favorite horror film of all time happens to have that same rating. So, I had semi-high hopes as my opinion of many films has changed over the years.<br/><br/>Right from the start, it is very appealing. They waste no time whatsoever getting to the relevant stuff. The film has literally no empty, needless minutes, like many 100+ minute films have (The best example of this would be many of Stephen King movie adaptations). And I must say, 45 minutes to an hour in, I was beginning to wonder why I rated it as low as I did. Everything was moving along quite nicely. Very creepy, very interesting.<br/><br/>Then, the second half of the film started to take it's course, and everything started going downhill. The eerie atmosphere and suspense created by the creatures themselves started to dissipate as we begin to see less and less of that aspect of the film. The focus began to shift completely to the actual history and story itself, which is not necessarily a bad thing, by any means. But, I feel they did a poor job of incorporating the terror and fear of the present situation, and the urgency of the task at hand. And as a result, the whole second half of the film became quite dull.<br/><br/>Then you have the crazy religious freak, which gradually goes from a significant but simple part of the story, to a shameless attempt to portray religious people in as negative a light as possible. We've seen enough of that in films these days. If the opportunity presents itself, even in the slightest fashion, it is capitalized on nearly every time. But that, in itself, does not ruin a film for me.<br/><br/>The real problem comes as we get closer and closer to the conclusion of the film. And it's a problem I see repeatedly, mainly in the horror genre. The relentless desire and attempt to create dramatic effect and shock value ends up creating aspects of the film that are just completely over the top. It's as if the director reaches a plateau of fright and apprehension, and then just cannot resist trying to take it one level higher. Typically, this ends up taking away from the film, overall. This is a real problem with MANY films. In fact, I watched another horror film last night that had me thinking the exact same thing.<br/><br/>There are also some confusing elements and loose ends that are ultimately not tied up. I wont get into detail on those. I suppose there is something to be said for leaving certain things to the imagination. But everything has to be just right for that to work. That really didn't appear to be the case with this film. Still, it is NOT BY ANY MEANS, Mulholland Dr.-type confusion and uncertainty. But then again, no film has confusion and uncertainty to rival that mess.<br/><br/>Overall, it's decent. It's user rating is fairly close to accurate. Definitely not a waste of time, but certainly nothing that will rock your world in any way."

","Silent hill has been giving gaming fans sleepless nights since its 90's debut on playstation. The film adaptation however induced sleep as its steep crawl into some form of horror simply took a golden age. By the time anyone in the cinema knew what was going on, a man with a piece of toblerone attached to his cranium was pursuing the under developed characters of this dingy motel of horror film around a rust infested CGI set. This film can only be described as a very bad roller-coaster. It hurtles viewers from one enigma to another without explaining any key events whatsoever. As I have played the games, I had some answers to the questions my bewildered friends were asking, such as ""who the hell is he?"", ""Why are they even here?"" and the classic ""why has everything turned rusty?"". Unfortunately for anyone still in the dark as to the storyline of the games franchise, this rubik's cube of a film will cause you to develop narcolepsy for its entire running time, as trying to keep up with the endless hail of plot twists is overly tiring. Even the legendary Sherlock Holmes would be scratching his cap wearing head as to the whereabouts of the runaway plot line.<br/><br/>Some of the finer features of the film include, rape with barbed wire, The fiery torture of a female police officer and of course a deformed and very undead paedophile janitor named Colin. Sounds interesting I know, but trust me. It isn't.<br/><br/>The ending of this film should have been a masterpiece, a true Da Vinci of the horror genre. Instead, it is a cheap caricature of what could of been a amazing and truly frightening game to film adaptation. The storyline was already prepared like a fine cuisine. Instead the directors chose a cheap half baked finger buffet and destroyed any hope of dignity this film had left.<br/><br/>The events that took place were summed up perfectly by one utterly baffled viewer in my screen, who at a blank and silent transition between scenes, expressed his outrage at the mystery narrative with a quite accurate ""What the F***!?"". This outburst however voiced what everyone was thinking and marked the steep decline of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>An utterly disgusting display of film making that should not be viewed without some aspirin and an ice pack for the headache that will develop from trying to find some clue as to the storyline. Not recommended to anyone, ESPECIALLY fans of the game."

","When i heard that there was a movie of my favourite game coming out, i was dubious. Fans of the game are very precious about the imagery and feel of the game, the tension this creates, the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Thats what this movie is about, its unnerving, its not an all out horror hack and slash movie, its about creating a feeling that your skin is crawling, that you don't feel comfortable with what you are seeing. This movie captures that feel almost perfectly. This is a good departure from the spate of 'Saw' style movies that are coming out at a rate of knots.<br/><br/>This film however is let down by a few things i felt. The acting in places isn't great, its just not convincing, other than that, its a decent horror movie even if you are not a fan of the game, because it is an uncomfortable experience. Excellent movie, not 10 just because there are small niggles, one of the actresses is just awful and the movie seems to flag a little towards the end."
"GreyChild","9","1","2","12 February 2008"," Truly the best adaption of a computer game !
","To be honest, when I saw the ""Silent Hill"" - DVD in the store, I thought: ""Well... can this really be any good? Those adaptations always are cheap and in most cases a torture to look at..."" - But I was wrong. ""Silent Hill"" has convinced me. I loved to play the games and so I really wanted to buy this DVD. What Christophe Gans did with the Silent Hill - Theme is just brilliant! The atmosphere is scary and almost just like playing the game (although, playing the game always gives you a deeper feeling to be in Silent Hill). The horror that takes its strength from the psychological aspects you experience - plus it's got a LOT of blood... wow, the blood! I don't think that the movie is too long (you can read this in some critical articles all over the web). Who loved the games will also love the action-parts that ""alternate"" with the parts where the story goes on and many important things get explained. To truly understand what the movie is entirely about, you will have to watch it twice. I watched it ten times by now - but not because I don't understand the story (it helps when you know, what the first three Silent Hill Games are about), but 'cause I really like this movie and I'm really looking forward to the next ones. But to be honest, I don't think kids (young people under the age of 18) should watch this movie (just read the ""Violence and Gore""-article - which gives you just an impression what's ahead of you). I now own the regular DVD and the 2 DVD - Steelbook-Edition. Both in English and German. I am really surprised that a game adaptation could be so nicely done!"
"theaxekeeper","3","1","2","6 October 2007"," Why do they keep doing this?
","Why do filmmakers keep thinking that horror video games would make good movies? They have failed in almost every attempt, for instance here are a few titles that are based off of horror games: House of the Dead, House of the Dead 2(DVD), Alone in the Dark, and Silent Hill. Now they did make Resident Evil movies, but from what I have heard, they are not that bad, but I haven't gotten a chance to see them. Anyway, these are some of the worst film adaptations ever made, I think that when you adapt a good video game to the big screen, you need to be extremely careful. This movie was not scary in anyway, it had no evil, it was cheesy in some parts, and the ending was lame. But, someone decided to make a movie out of a pretty good game, believe me play the game, especially Silent Hill 2, it is scarier than the movie will ever be."
"Ronald_James_Corbin","10","1","2","24 June 2007"," Alright but could have been the better
","This movie was OK. It was not that scary though. I liked how it changed from fog to evil darkness. there were great special effects and great visuals.<br/><br/>I am a Huge fan of the Silent Hill games (except silent hill 4). They didn't add as many horror elements from the Games as they should have. (1) The was only one scene where the main character was going down a complete dark hallway with a flashlight (there should have been more of that)cause it was a great scene. (2) They should have added that the town was completely obsessed with a dark religion. It created a creepy mood in the game and kinda explained why the town was so messed up.(there were symbols for a religion but it didn't explain the religion. Also Alessa was burned because they thought she was a witch and not because they were trying to create a hellish god). (3)This movie had only one ending.The DVD should've had more. the ending was very unclear. Each silent hill game had at least 4 endings.LOL (4) one thing that made the games so scary was that the main character was alone a lot and only meeting crazy characters. (5) They should have added the radio better. The loud scary sound when a monster was near definitely should have been added more. Cybil had a radio but it was not loud or creepy enough and the main character should have found the radio. (6) They needed more creatures. (7) The movie showed the real world with the father searching. The ruined it a lot. the games would just through horror at you the whole time. This took away a big horror aspect.<br/><br/>I admit if that it shouldn't be too much like the games they just should have used more horror techniques from the game :)<br/><br/>IT WAS OK BUT COULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST XD The creatures looked very creepy and i liked that they used the pyramid head creature. The fog made it creepy. Amazing special effects. A lot of good things about this movie too.<br/><br/>Great Movie . But if you are a fan of the games it not as good as it should have been. (although best game-to-film crossover yet) Everyone should see this movie :)"

","I normally do not post reviews (this is the first I've posted on IMDb, in fact), but being someone who has followed the series for eight years and has read a good portion of everything people have had to say about it, I feel I should say something.<br/><br/>The ratings that people have given this film are only slightly above average, but--statistically speaking--the major outliers are the large number of people giving it one star and the large number of people giving it eight stars, each assuming the other does or doesn't know anything about the game series (which should be irrelevant) and does or doesn't know anything about good film-making (which should also be irrelevant).<br/><br/>A sizable portion of the reviewers who liked the movie never played the games. A sizable portion of reviewers who didn't like the movie are devoted fans.<br/><br/>I, being a fan of the series, had mixed feelings going into the film. I was not sure whether I liked it or not after the first time I saw it. Upon subsequent viewings I enjoyed it more. My experience was very similar, actually, when I played the first game in the series. I wasn't looking for a precise adaptation, because precision--regarding plot--does not always make a good adaptation. I just wanted a good, disturbing movie, and I felt the film delivered that.<br/><br/>The visual presentation was not only accurate, but wonderful. The people bashing it on the basis of overusing CGI should note that, for the most part, they were not seeing CGI, but real costumes and make-up effects. I am led to believe that CGI has become a scapegoat for whatever a person finds visually unpleasant about a movie.<br/><br/>The script was not as good as I was expecting. I can suspend disbelief by telling myself that, being part of a living nightmare, the characters were prone to dream-like nonsense talk, but it still should have been better. The actors were competent in delivering the lines, but the set production and art direction were the star of the show, so it did not matter so much. This is true in the case of most watchable horror films.<br/><br/>That being said, I would have given my review an additional star if they had just cut out the narration of the flashback explanation sequence; it was very nice-looking and would have explained enough on its own, much like Blade Runner was a far better film without its original narrative track.<br/><br/>To those who did not understand this film: No one should force you to watch a movie you don't like, but if you didn't understand this film, you weren't trying very hard. It's no fault of yours if you were not engaged enough in it; I was, and so were many others.<br/><br/>This is a good horror film; I have been trying to find good, classic horror films recently, and this one ranks with Jacob's Ladder, Session 9, and The Omen as one of my favourites. As a video game adaptation it is fantastic.<br/><br/>As a film with many contradictory reviews, it deserves a try from any moviegoer; it's a film that you cannot really judge from a review whether it is worth seeing. When everyone tells you something different, all you can do is find out for yourself."

","I thought it was so much better than any other video game adaptation i have ever seen. Haven't played the games but now i want to. It wasn't so much scary as horrific. Very cool movie and i hope that other video games have plots that are this involved and thrilling. I have always wondered who writes videogames. Is it the creator or perhaps some screenwriters should start getting involved in the industry. Definitely the best Game adaptation i have seen yet and this serves as example for all other writers to put some effort in and try to produce something that actually works. That barbwire stuff was a killer man. I did wonder how much of whats in the film is in the games."

","Routed from sleepwalking problems, Rose Da Silva decides to take her daughter Sharon to the town she talks about in her sleep, Silent Hill, to face her nightmares, where Sharon goes missing and Rose must fight the power of the town to get her back.<br/><br/>No, I'm not a fan of the game. No, I haven't played the game before. May I assume that you have to play the video game to like or even understand this confusing film? Doom seemed completely understandable to me but this film is very confusing and is very bad, indeed.<br/><br/>I have to point out the lighting in this film is very bad because many scenes are completely dark that you can't see anything which doesn't make you feel scared of the violent moments. Does darkness make anything scary?<br/><br/>And one last bad thing I have to point out in this film is the score. It's a variety of rock and classical? I couldn't tell but it sure didn't ante up the suspense. One very good thing this film has is the visual effects with the cinematography. Those are very above average, still, it done't make up from the film's cons.<br/><br/>The acting by Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, and Laurie Holden were decent. Aside from the cinematography and visual effects, this film is very bad. If you're a fan of the game, you'll probably like it. If not, you'll be very confused with the movie."

","I'm not one for playing video games so cannot comment on the adaptation.<br/><br/>It's probably one of the most boring films I've had the misfortune to watch. Any marks I give for the production are for the set, not the script nor the acting.<br/><br/>To maintain interest the storyline needs more than a couple of scared women wandering about a deserted and shadowy premises pointing a torchlight on anything that moves or is likely to move.<br/><br/>The husband seems superfluous but is introduced to provide relief from the two women who continue to wander aimlessly on. Now we have two parties and still little is happening.<br/><br/>The only scary bit for me was when the floor fell away and i thought the good lady was done for. But no! She was very athletic and managed to balance on a protruding floorboard and then jump to safety.<br/><br/>There was no real tension as there should have been. May be the actors did the best they could with a bad script. Perhaps the director should have tightened up the proceedings. If you're going for a dreamlike atmosphere, care must be taken that it does not drag out the action.<br/><br/>The idea of a building being built around a fire shooting up from the bowels of the earth did heat up the action for a while, but it seemed too much for the lady who started to spew up an enormous quantity of writhing worms or slugs.<br/><br/>It's the only DVD I've activated the fast forward button to see if the ending was more exciting. I need not have bothered."
"cherold","7","1","2","4 April 2007"," thoroughly entertaining, but doesn't quite feel like the games
","This is an interesting movie, because the games have a very Japanese quality to them, full of creeping dread and weirdness, but the movie has more of an American feel, with straightforward action and scares. I think it probably would have been a more interesting film if it were done more along the line of The Ring, but taken on its own terms it's quite entertaining.<br/><br/>I've played all the Silent Hill games except the first one, which is probably what this was based on, so it makes it difficult to know how closely the story was followed. I did read a synopsis of the first game and I think it was something like what was here. I suspect, based on the other games, that the movie took more pains to explain what was going on, although it apparently didn't help since I see a lot of complaints about not understanding the story. I followed it pretty well myself though, and was surprised people were having so much difficulty with it.<br/><br/>All in all I liked this movie. While it doesn't quite have the tone of the games, it does have a lot of the look, keeps things moving and has a few nifty scares in it. I'd say it ties with Resident Evil for best game-based movie."

","...not MY time & money, because I had seen Brotherhood of the Wolves and already knew I didn't like the director's work-- but the time & money of everyone working on the film except for the director, who made it into what it is. Initially, I was tempted to give this movie at least 5-out-of-10, since Christopher Gans is just one of many new generation MTV-style directors who can direct action but not acting, and script plots but not people. But then it dawned on me that, instead of trying to be a scary and fun mystery/horror/action/thriller/etc. like Resident Evil, the director held back the pace and toned down the dialogue/music/sounds/etc. because he wanted Silent Hill to be scary and SERIOUS. So I must ""fail"" Silent Hill for trying too hard and in the wrong ways: 3-out-of-10 for creating lots of interesting visuals on the big screen, but putting them together in an uninteresting way.... the stylish B&W photography of the end credits was the best part of the movie for me."

Whether inspired by comic books, video games, whatever...doesn't matter to me. I judge movies on their own merit.<br/><br/>That said, this movie is an adequately acted, poorly directed, pointless, lumbering, FX-driven brainfart. The entire story was sophomoric hack work with no surprises...and major plot holes. Perhaps it makes more sense to those who played the game. I didn't.<br/><br/>From the trailers I expected to at least be treated to a few scares and maybe a gross out or two. No luck... The ""scary"" scenes were too predictable. I was sitting there thinking ""I'm supposed to be scared now"" instead of actually BEING scared. As for the gore, I give it a puke-factor of 5 (being generous) - this was no Hellraiser.<br/><br/>The creature designs were pretty creepy, albeit generic...and the FX were pretty awesome in appearance.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I want my 2hrs back."

That's irrelevant. A movie should stand alone. This one was  well  silly, and illogicalalthough I suppose logic isn't really all that important in a horror movie. <br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography at the start was really quite beautiful, and the transition into Silent Hill was excellent. There was a certain degree of suspense in the beginning (in spite of the lack of logic), and the concept of a relatively modern-day Ghost Town had me intrigued. Unfortunately, it turned into a horror-melodrama of the over-acted variety. By the time it reached the aforementioned ""silly bit,"" I was rolling my eyes and doing work on my laptop. <br/><br/>Strangely enough, I found the ending relatively satisfying (and I don't just mean because the movie was over).

"pyramidhead84","7","1","2","26 February 2007"," Beautiful
","First off, this is not a game clone. If you have played the original Silent Hill video game, you'll have a fresh outlook on the story to look forward to. While the changes disturbed me a bit at first, I feel they were necessary to the overall success of Silent Hill the movie. Alice Krige does a beautiful job of making sure her character, the religious zealot, Christabella, does not sound contrived in her dialog, which would have been an easy mistake. The game version of the character Dahlia Gillespie is shallow and unchallenging, but Gans has reworked her into a believable person with real emotions, and Deborah Kara Unger really brings her to life for the first time! The visuals are grotesquely beautiful. Each creature has it's own feel, it's own texture, and it's own personality. They are ripped straight from the tortured mind of an emotionally and physically abused little girl, and they have a way of reminding you what it was like to be so young; everything distorted and frightening in your nightmares. They look as though made of plastic, yet they have flesh and bone and blood...symbolic of the toys of a small child, yet they are tainted with the horrible reality of the frailty of living things.<br/><br/>The music is taken straight from the games, with minor 'facelifts' so to speak. Added instruments only make Akira Yamaoka's haunting melodies all the more addictive and frightening. This movie is a video game adaptation, yet has few of the pitfalls typical of the game movies before it. Do not be mistaken; Silent Hill is not a horror movie. It is at it's roots a drama...the story of a child forced down the path of evil to take revenge upon those who caused her such agony."

And, I have to say; there wasn't enough of Pyramid Head. Hands down, PH is without question to most evil, cruel, and sick character in the history of cinema. He makes Freddy Kruger look like a choirboy. When Rose (R. Mitchell) first gets to Silent Hill the sequence of her walking through the alley in the dark is an excellent portrayal of the opening sequence in the first Silent Hill game. It is eerie beyond words. Other scenes looked remarkably like the games. My main complaint is the lack of direct confrontations between Rose and the monsters. A bit more exploring would have made it better as well. But, that said, there are many elements that gamers would like to see and there's no way to satisfy them all. Without question, when the town changes forms and seems to shed its ""skin"" it is a remarkable cinematic experience. I can't think of another film in which that occurs. Nor can I think of a more painful-looking treatment than having razor-edged barbed wire rammed through a person's body from the rectum to their head (which I could have lived without) as a punishment for heresy by the local garden-variety religious nut cases. I fast forward through that part. I really like is the way the move remains true to the feel of the games by using much of the same music, sound effects, and monsters. The air raid sirens still send a chill down my spine. In all I highly recommend this movie but not for children under 16."
"rixrex","Null","1","2","11 December 2006"," Another violent vid game movie with Lovecraftian imagery that ends up crap.
","Not having seen the VG, I was completely ignorant of the story or plot of this horror entry. Now that I have seen it, I am no longer ignorant of the plot, and I realize that the plot is what is ignorant, what little there is of it. This starts out promising enough, very similar to a 1970s European horror film, with a somewhat haunted little child. Not an unusual theme for that earlier time. It's far-fetched that the mother would get the bug to visit Silent Hill on what's pretty much a whim, but the film must progress, and that's not unheard of in horror films. The imagery we see once we get fully engulfed in the town's depths is quite startling and nightmarish. But then the whole story of the good people who are really bad because they are intolerant religious fanatics, and the bad ""demon"" who is really good because she was wronged by these fanatics is really the turning point, turning what could have been something quite eerie into yet another unsubtle revenge melodrama with violent imagery. This then becomes yet another one in the long, long list of VG based horror films, and really most modern horror films, that are long on style and very, very short on having an engaging story. It's getting tiring to see the constant juxtaposition of religious fanatics as the really bad people, do any of these filmmakers really think nobody gets their less than subtle commentary for what it really is, a slander on religion and the faithful in general? With people getting thrills out of violent tripe like this (and rating it a 10 no less), there is no wonder that many think of this society as decedent and immoral."

Harry was still there walking around. He was still in Silent Hill. Can anyone tell me the ending of the game? What was I supposed to do? I htink the movie was good. but the only thing that bothered me was the fact that they put Rose instead of Harry. I had to watch the movie 3 times to understand it better.

Ultimately, his character is completely pointless to the movie. I mean really, there is no point to his character. The town's secret could have been found out easily without him, or that pointless detective. There were far too many points where nothing happens, rather than a steady flow of frightening scenes and plot. Our heroine's plight through the basement was far too short as well.

This formula of conceptual delivery is mixed in with ambiance, surrealism, and monsters that derive from the characters own minds. It's not just random happenings of gore, at least in the game(s).<br/><br/>This film fails because of its overblown plot, inherently poor melodramatic acting, and dialog that seemed unintentionally comical. Some of the people sitting next to me in the theater giggled at a few of the lines. And those who seem to be bored with everything, were either confused or not interested in thinking at all.<br/><br/>Most people just want mindless action derived from nothing, while they choke on popcorn and suck down sugar water.

I was saddened for not getting to the box office for a showing of Silent Hill. That all changed when it was finally was released onto DVD last month and I purchased it and watched the movie yesterday. What a waste of $ 24.00 and even more so...a waste of my time. It reminded me of a recent Stephen King movie that goes into every direction possible depending on the writers particular mood on any particular day. The movie started off with the daughter sleepwalking to the edge of a huge cliff. Somehow in total darkness the parents find her and save her. Then the next scene is the mother taking-off with the little girl against her husbands wishes and they end-up in this ash-covered town called Silent Hill. It reminded me of dark stormy afternoon in northern Ontario in mid January....DEPRESSING...then you see all sorts of weird people running around trying to harm the mother and it just seems to drift into un-imaginable belief ! In my opinion it could have been done a lot better so the average person could enjoy it.

Instead Rose brings her daughter back to the place, where she's originally from.

This film is perfect on its strong visual style by the director, arresting production design work by Carol Spier (Who worked on memorable David Cronenberg's movies like The Fly, eXistenZ, Videodrome), terrific atmospheric Widescreen camera work by Dan Laustsen (Darkness Falls, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Nightwatch) and especially good performances from the cast including:Deborah Kara Unger, Kim Coates, Tanya Allen and Alice Krige. But the picture isn't as eerie or scary as it should have been. The premise of this movie never loses it's intriguing premise, which keeps the audience interested and even those are not familiar with the video game (like me).<br/><br/>DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The DVD's extras are on six part entertaining featurettes with plenty of interviews with the cast and crew. Although the DVD could have used a filmmaker, crew or cast commentary. Also Deleted Scenes and the terrific theatrical trailer is missed in this DVD edition. It's a rumor that Gans is working on a possible Director's Cut of this film in the near future. Gans' first assembly cut was over 3 and a half hours. Some of the behind the scenes footage from the DVD are not seen in the final cut. One of the highlights of this picture are the amazing visual effects that truly served the story well from this flawed but certainly unique movie. Some will be disappointed or confused by this film (especially towards the conclusion). Attention must be made by watching this picture. I find this movie more enjoyable by seeing the second time, once it did came out on DVD. This is worth seeing.

"tpd79","6","1","2","10 September 2006"," Very average horror movie
","While not reaching the horrible depths of the house of the dead adaptation, this movie was not as good as the game upon which it was based. While the game was incredibly spooky with a feeling of complete isolation the movie had a few too many extended interactions with other characters which interrupted the suspense and there was the pointless inclusion of the husband figure who provided no information whatsoever, which would seem to be the only reason for including him. It would have been nice to have seen him alone in the town more and crossing over with the characters in 'spooky' or 'evil' Silent Hill. I liked the explanation of the cult's actions and Alessa's condition although again this differed from the game somewhat, something die-hard game fans will no doubt disapprove of and I found the ending to be formulaic and disappointing. That said the movie was fairly interesting and it certainly looked good with some nice effects particularly during the changes to 'evil' Silent Hill."

"semi_cool18","6","1","2","27 April 2006"," Good movie, despite being unfaithful to the games
","From the average movie-going standpoint, I liked Silent Hill. Its acting was good (except perhaps for a couple scenes of Rose, who was otherwise decent), its monsters were demented and scary, and the way it switched between normal and horror world was cool. The storyline was weird, but good, and LOOSELY based off Silent Hill, the original game for Playstation.<br/><br/>From the videogamer standpoint, however, its ties with the Silent Hill games was disappointing. There is nothing in common with the movie and game other than the fogginess of the town and the characters' names. Going into detail about the discrepancies would be unnecessary, since almost everything is different. Here's a hint: in the original Playstation game, there was no big emphasis on some fire in the city's history, and there was no church full of religious zealots. And since that is the basis of the movie's plot, that goes to show how little the two titles have in common.<br/><br/>Another thing about the video game: I think Silent Hill will never be faithfully made into a movie, because the medium is incompatible (mostly). What makes the Silent Hill games scary are their slow, creeping sense of dread and horror. A game can take you about 15 hours to beat, unlike a movie which is over in 2. Movies just don't have enough time to create the horror that the games do, and because of this, Silent Hill will always be at its best in the video game medium.<br/><br/>That said, it was an entertaining horror movie, and managed to stand out from the many in its genre."
"general009","7","1","2","26 April 2006"," Entertaining, but...
","Let me first say that I extremely enjoyed this movie. I really liked the atmosphere that was created, the CGI was very good, and the monsters were really awesome and frightening. I've played video games but never the Silent Hill series, and I was extremely impressed by how the producers managed to capture much of the spirit of the game in this movie. Silent Hill definitely ranks as one of the best video game movies yet made. That being said the ending left me really confused, and some of the acting was drab. Overall, Silent Hill was a great Friday night movie, especially if you want to be held on the edge of your seat for the entire ride."
"saturnalia33","7","1","2","26 April 2006"," fantastic dark visual sequences
","In the past, Hollywood has thrown some pretty poor video game based films at their audience such as Doom, Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider, so it was with trepidation that I went to see the adaptation of the successful computer game series Silent Hill.<br/><br/>I had never played the game and had it pinned as a family member of Resident Evil and expected a movie based on a town over-run with zombies and lots of shot-gun action. Instead I was pleasantly surprised with uber-nightmarish visuals and no cheap shock-tactic camera tricks. The demons are most certainly real in the town of Silent Hill and creepy as hell to boot.<br/><br/>It all begins when a little girl, Sharon, goes sleep walking in the middle of the night and her parents find her on a precipice near the family house looking into a firey cataclysm. that only she can see. It turns out that this is not uncommon and she often goes off in the middle of the night in search of a place called Silent Hill. Rose, her mother, disagrees with her husband, played by Sean Bean, that the daughter needs psychological help and decides to take her to the deserted town of Silent Hill to find some answers.<br/><br/>However, a lone cop spots Rose and Sharon asking for directions to Silent Hill at a petrol station and follows them towards the deserted town. After pulling them over and with Rose hitting the gas to escape to her destination, a pursuit ends in disaster with an awakening on the edge of the dreamlike ash-raining town. Worse still, Sharon is missing and Rose enters Silent Hill to find her.<br/><br/>Things quickly descend into a living darkness and after failing to find her daughter in a plot sequence familiar to Don't Look Now, Rose hooks up with the cop, Cybil, to find her daughter. If they can get out alive and find out just what is going on.<br/><br/>Silent Hill's first half fires along at a great pace, with monsters, demons and fantastic dark visual sequences which are among the best I have seen in any horror film. However, what lets the movie down is when it tries to explain itself and the last half an hour, although still pretty cool, implodes on itself with mediocre dialogue and a flimsy plot structure in an attempt to tie up loose ends and explain to the audience just what the hell is going on when I feel viewers should be left in the dark just like the characters were for most of the film. Nevertheless, it is the best video game cum movie I have seen so far and would make a good DVD to add to any burgeoning horror collection."

"kirkwatts","7","1","2","22 April 2006"," Even after all the bad points, I still think it's a film you absolutely must see
","As a huge fan of the series, here's a little bit about what I thought.<br/><br/>The environment was done perfectly, a fantastic portrayal of the world in Silent Hill. The transition from the light to dark worlds was really cool and I don't think it could have been done much better. I think the cinematography when she was wondering around in buildings, fighting monsters and running around streets was brilliant.<br/><br/>All but one of the monsters were out of the game. Aside from that one monster, I think they were all done perfectly  from their looks down to how they moved their toes and fingers. Not scary to me (but then again no film has ever been scary, it can only make me jump - which isn't scary, it's just going BOO), but they were grotesque and disturbing certainly  which is what I want in a monster.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty poor and I wish Radha Mitchell would stop screaming 'Shannon!' all the time, she made my ear drums bleed and although she was searching for a child it wasn't necessary to kill my hearing over it.<br/><br/>You don't really find out about the plot until about half way through the film, and it's really pretty weak  I won't spoil it for you, because there's really nothing to spoil. I mean, there is a plot, and it is quite hard to get your head around, and you'll probably walk out not totally understanding it - I just don't think it was really very good. The way it was explained could have been a heck of a lot better too.<br/><br/>I think what this film did right, was represent a world of nightmare. From falling down and blacking out right at a pinnacle of your nightmare, then being in place of another nightmare, the environment, the monsters, the transition of worlds, the vagueness at points, the feeling that you're running as hard as you can but you can't run fast enough  the cinematography construed this perfectly. I really don't think a world of nightmare could have been more accurately depicted. A world of nightmare knows no bounds and generally doesn't make any sense - but that is what makes nightmares even more horrifying. You won't possibly understand how well this film does this until you see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when watching this film, and having played the game, I really think they didn't do this film right. It's too much like a game. It's almost as if they sat down and watched somebody play silent hill, wrote down everything that happened, and then acted it out  that just doesn't work in a film. I think the environment was right, the monsters were right, and I don't think there was anything wrong about the characters (I think the real Alessa character was great  I also think the actor for the girl was a good choice  just because she was really weird), I just think everything else in this film was wrong. It could have been so much better.<br/><br/>I think the soundtrack from the game is amazing, and I love that they used it in this film - and I really think that it suited it on so many levels, but sometimes it seemed out of place. Maybe only because I knew it was from the game and the scenes it was used with then.<br/><br/>I really think this film had the potential to be fantastic. The stage & characters were there for the best horror film of all time in my opinion - but it just wasn't used right. As this film was now, it was just entertaining, grotesque and disgusting (good). I do admire all the great elements that were in the film, but I hate it for how those elements were used so poorly sometimes.<br/><br/>One thing I can say, is that the way this film does horror is like having King Kong charge you and smack his balls in your face whilst echoing off a huge roar. There were many times when I sat back in this film with my eyes wide and thought ""...holy s##t........."".<br/><br/>Something that shocked me most about this film was that it was a certificate 15 in the UK. I think this should have certainly been an 18. The ending alone warranted that.<br/><br/>As much as I have slagged off this film, and even after all the bad points, I still think it's a film you absolutely must see & I really did love it. At IMDb most people are loving this film so don't let my negative feedback put you off - as this is currently my favourite horror film in a long time.<br/><br/>I'm too tired to right anymore now, I'll edit this post another time.<br/><br/>PS> I think we need a justice system similar to the end of this film."

","Let me start by saying that this movie wasn't 100% horrible. In fact, if you have played the games or watch them be played by someone else, you will most probably be extremely excited by the first 15 minutes of this movie. <br/><br/>""Oh!"" you'll say, ""I know this!"" you'll realize. Each minute passes and you find yourself tingling in anticipation of the next scene. She finds an alley, the siren sounds and-- ""Movie,"" you breath excitedly ""keep going!

It's subtle at first, but then this uneasy feeling grows. <br/><br/>It starts with one scene that doesn't quite happen in the first game. Still, that's not a big deal right? Creative license, you say to yourself. The movie can't be exactly like the game. And you'd be right. No one should expect it to be perfectly in sync with those incredibly creepy playstation hits. However, when you delve deeper into this movie you'll find yourself traveling through a ridiculously thick, stinky, sloppy plot that's being unsuccessfully masked over with lemony fresh visuals.<br/><br/>*SLIGHT game spoilers*<br/><br/>If you've played the games, you'll know that each one was connected in some way or another. However, this didn't ruin playing the games out of order. Sure, you'll miss a few references, but basically the stories are different with just one thing in common: Silent Hill. That's what could have made this movie a very good idea. They could have chosen to stick with the idea that someone who is tortured in the mind or someone who is affiliated with someone who is tortured in the mind, traveled to Silent Hill in order to deal with their 'demons'. If you haven't played the games, then you just read, technically, the plot to each game. Anyway, as I was saying; they could have chosen to stick to this plot and make the characters interesting, but instead they decide to throw in a woman screaming after her daughter the whole movie long, a bunch of recognizable monsters, a few religious fanatics, a disgusting and completely unnecessary barbed wire scene, useless 'humor' and even lines that probably weren't supposed to be humorous(but made the audience laugh anyway), and a weird/confusing ending that really gives you next to nothing on closure.<br/><br/>In short, this movie was not at all a good tribute to the games that they were inspired by. The games might not make sense to you at first, even after you play the endings, but usually they'll begin to after you think on them awhile. Unfortunately, the movie makes less and less sense as you think on it awhile."
"m4nea","2","3","12","22 April 2006"," The film is a mess.
","This isn't a movie. It is a mess under the guise of one of the most successful horror video game franchises in existence. I haven't played the games personally, but I went tonight with someone who was an avid fan, and they didn't even understand what was going on.<br/><br/>To be fair, it had a strong first half hour, and some pretty interesting and gory deaths...Yes, that's about as fair as I can be, as it all goes downhill after those first thirty minutes.<br/><br/>Now, the premise of this film is that the town of Silent Hill was destroyed by fire some years ago. This is a fact well known by every police officer in the area. However, upon entering a building not long after that thirtieth minute, the escorting cop says (I kid you not): ""Looks like there was a fire here..."" This is when people really started to laugh and leave the theatre.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, the movie takes a turn from TRYING to be terrifying, to cheesy, one-line-and-effects-laden, mindless, repetitive garbage. Also, according to my friend, the main villain which SHOULD be the ""main boss"" is not actually really a villain at all, but more of a minion to the ""master mass of living razor wire"".<br/><br/>Probably a good way to conclude is with that of the film. One of the foremost reasons not to see this movie is that it has the single worst ending I have EVER SEEN. Nothing is resolved; however, this is due in part to the fact that the whole reason the second act starts is because the mother gets her daughter lost in the whole mess.<br/><br/>Mess...what an appropriate word to end on. This film deserves no more or less title."
"EVOL666","3","2","7","1 September 2006"," I Hate Everyone Who Recommended This Film To Me...
","I didn't have very much interest in this film to begin with - until several of my friends saw it in the theater and said how good it was. Well - they were all wrong. Other than a few well-executed scenes - SILENT HILL was boring, hard to follow, laden with ineffective CGI and horrible performances by the actors involved. I typically don't watch a lot of U.S. theatrically-released horror films, preferring more ""underground"" material and older exploitation type films - but every once in a while I'm impressed with something that hits the ""mainstream""...this is not one of those cases...<br/><br/>A little girl has strange dreams about a place called SILENT HILL, and when her mother notices strange behavior, including sleepwalking and drawing ""creepy"" pictures, she decides to take her daughter to the supposedly haunted town in search for answers. When she gets there, the town is deserted (or so it seems...) and her daughter disappears after they run off the road. The remainder of the film is about the mother's search for her daughter and the truth behind her daughter's dreams, and the town in general...<br/><br/>Honestly - the above synopsis is about all I could make of the film. The story is convoluted and confusing and ultimately centers around witch-hunting and other played-out themes. I remember playing the video-game several years ago and liking it quite a bit - but 95% of the events that took place in the film, I have no recollection of from the game. The acting is some of the worst I've seen from a big-budget film - almost EVERY line coming out of EVERY actor's mouth seeming so wooden and cliché as to be actually infuriating. The CGI is FAR over-done and many scenes would have been more effective had they been a bit more understated. The good points - a few decent scenes and set-pieces that were suitably ""creepy"" and kept true to the atmosphere of the game, but seriously - that's it - and unfortunately, that doesn't carry a film for me. I've definitely seen FAR worse films, but I really enjoyed pretty much nothing about SILENT HILL. I understand that it has a lot of supporters, though I can't possibly understand why - personally, I'd say to skip it unless pretty much everything else is out at the video store or play the game instead...3/10"

","Silent Hill was by far the worst movie I have seen in my life. It lacked any kind of credible storyline, continuity, or thrilling content!! From the opening cheesy scene to the final ""what the hell just happened"" closer....all I could do was laugh. The acting was brutal...at one point I thought I was watching the beginning of a show case porno! I understand it was based on a video game but I felt as though I was watching someone go through, level by level, with no character building, and no clear direction. I burst out laughing time after time at the weak attempts to scare....not the heart racer I was hoping for. I can't say enough terrible things about this movie!! My favorite part however was the choreographed, huge boobed, nurse level where the mom had to get to ""the demon"" by ducking under their legs! Oh my!

It has been 24 hours since I went to see it and I still can't think of another movie that was worse. Is it because I never played the game ? The acting was excruciating, the story was very poorly explained, and when it was over people in the theater were actually laughing at how bad it was. I was SHOCKED when I saw that it scored a 6.7. You people are stoned ! Here are some questions I would like answered: Were the people all dead? If so, how can you kill a dead person again ? How did they know to sound the siren signaling that the darkness was coming ? Why did it seem to randomly leave and reverse any effects to the actors' surroundings ? Were the Mom, Daughter, and cop all three killed in their initial crashes ? Wow. I was completely confused by this movie. Anyone planning on seeing it should consider getting a root canal instead."

SHARON!, the high pitch voice of the child, the nosy young Sharon stone look alike cop, the outcast mother would looked like the crazy garbage lady for the movie labyrinth.

","So disappointed. Had high hopes. Great production design, great creature effects, shoddy CG and a story that manages to be both flimsy and bloated with exposition at the same time. Rhada runs around looking concerned and makes some truly bad decisions regarding her ""daughter"" whom she apparently ""cares"" about (yeah, I'm gonna to tell my kid to make sure her seatbelt's fastened while I floor it to escape a cop who pulled me over -- then I'm going to crash the car and look shocked at the fact that my kid ran off without me). But whatever, it's a horror movie and I'd be willing to accept a few gaps in logic if it was in the service of an exhilarating experience. The issue here is that there's no tension. The movie's like walking through a nicely decorated haunted house while knowing with absolute certainty that nothing bad will happen. It's infuriating because there's some great creature work here and Gans films it really well -- but then he cuts away to Sean Bean trying to grapple with an American accent. And as far as being faithful to the game...whatever...the game relies on player interaction as much as it does atmosphere. The movie ONLY relies on atmosphere and it's just not enough to carry an audience for two hours.<br/><br/>Oh and try counting how many times the line ""It's going to be okay, baby"" is spoken throughout the film -- even when the kid's tied to a ladder over a freakin' bonfire by a cult of Addam's Family throwbacks! Somebody please get Ridley Scott back in the genre game."

","I went to see this with a group of friends, and I think everyone in the packed theater left feeling pretty similar to us. For about thirty minutes, I actually thought that this movie might manage to be frightening , thinking that the previews would prove to be an accurate portrayal of the movie. From then on, the movie dragged to a halt until the big ending, complete with genital-shredding barbed wire, which got a good chuckle out of the audience. <br/><br/>Things that were just terrible about this movie:<br/><br/>The dialogue/screenplay, which sounded as though they had lifted the dialogue straight from the video game. Oh my god, it was so bad. ""It's gonna be okay honey!"" and also, ""I think there was a fire here""<br/><br/>Also, the storyline, which managed to show no creativity and followed a incredibly formulaic video game plot. The characters go from scene to scene following clues to new places where they have to, ""battle"" and escape demons. Why even make this movie if it's just going to come off as one long video game interlude storyboard scene?<br/><br/>Another thing, the music was TERRIBLE. I am told that some of it was the music to the game, which perhaps would work in that context, but it gave this a cheap B-movie feel with shitty programmed drums and bad synths that seemed very out of place throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The visual aspect of the movie was pretty cool, but I think that is to be expected from a movie based on a video game. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a great video game, as well as terrifying and engrossing, but it isn't pulled off on the big screen. <br/><br/>Please don't waste your money; I spent seventeen dollars for myself and someone else to see this, and I feel like it is my duty to at least try to warn people."

Inane scripts and a drawn-out, lengthy plot with no notion of going anywhere accompany this movie to bringing boredom to the audience. But just when you thought the movie was getting back on track with its at-par special effects, a corny line by one of the numerous sub-par actors or the out of place hip-hop background music makes you thing again. The special effects are the only aspect not far below average in this movie, yet have an unnecessary gory side to them that may make you squirm in your seat.

The cool parts were, admittedly, cool, but the rest of the movie seemed so slapped together and directionless that everything else lost any power to entertain. The computer effects were atrocious and laughable. The writing was so bad that the audience did not laugh at the jokes, and they laughed at parts in the movie that were not meant to be funny.

I don't know where other reviewers have seen this film that produced ""gasps by the audience"" or ""people grabbing onto friends"". How many screenings to five year olds could there be?

Characters are either extremely flat or develop in awkward burst shown through terrible dialogue.<br/><br/>The games had a much more Japanese horror feeling to it - using what wasn't there as a device to create suspense and horror. The movie threw monsters at you when most expected and in large amounts.<br/><br/>There is an extreme amount of focus on cleavage, which becomes more pronounced as the movie comes to an end.

","I've been a loyal S.H. player since the 1st game on PS1, so naturally I was stoked to hear that they had made a film version of one of the most amazing horror/action games ever made. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to the video game. The plot was weak at best, and the characters were intensely unbelievable. The plot seemed to drag on for days, and did not reward the patient audience with a satisfying resolution. The filmmakers seemed to have it in mind to stick as close to the video game as possible. This, however, may have been one of their downfalls. The film contained so much running around and item grabbing, that the plot was left to trail behind the meaningless action. The redeeming quality, however, is that it is interesting to see a director's take on a truly amazing video game. The makeup/special effects were pretty stunning at times as well.

I saw it last night and the beginning was creepy. For those familiar with the game it stays pretty true, and keeps with it, giving away faint hints at what was happening. It's a horror and has the dialog to go with it, obvious and off timed. The Horror has a Hollywood feel in the set design and general flow, but the monsters are more of an eastern feel reminding me of the ring and the grudge.<br/><br/>They switch things up with a side story line, which from what I gather wasn't in the game. Now an adaptation has changes, which is normal, but these changes didn't do anything for the movie. The worse part is that they chose to build up a set of characters that just vanish during the climax of the film. It's half an hour of film that served no purpose but to let me watch boromir look scarred.<br/><br/>Back to the main story arc, and it's odd religious twist, which made next to no sense, and required the equivalent of a video game ""cut scene"" for it to attempt to have a plot.

Once there, she loses her tracks and has to experience that this town keeps some secrets that had better be kept buried.<br/><br/>First of all, I haven't played the game, so I really can't tell if the film suits them. However, I like the general topic very much, where the girl keeps screaming the name of the town and the two of them experience horror once they arrive there. What I didn't like so much were all the creatures. For me, a more subtle kind of horror that focuses more on the humans and the girl would have created an even scarier atmosphere, than some fantasy demons arising from nowhere. That's why, in my opinion, the second part of the movie with the church kind of saved the film from becoming just another monster splatter. In some of the situations it is easier to adopt than in others, which makes it hard to give a homogeneous overall experience.<br/><br/>All in all this isn't a bad movie but it could have been way better if some of the monster action would have been transformed into something more subtle. I see potential, though."

","From the opening sequence to the arrival at Silent Hill, there seems to be a problem with the script, since the actors don't really know how to make the viewers care for the character before they split their ways. When we get to the confrontation of the film, there's no holding back from the screen-writers when it comes to the use of poor CGI. After the second plot point it seems to reveal a third act with some resolution, but that's stretched way too far into what can barely be called a climax. The basic problem with this movie is that it doesn't know when to stop."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","1","3","7 October 2015"," Absolute gem of a horror film
","-31 Days of Horror Day 1-<br/><br/>Few video game adaptations work as movies, about as few as I can count on one hand. But Christophe Gan's Silent Hill is a rarity in the group, a fright flick that captures the melodic ambiance and off kilter spookiness that made the games so terrifying. It doesn't one hundred percent capture the entire vibe of what made the games so special, but it comes oh so damn close, and when compared to other attempts at bringing games to life, it's a valiant effort, and a frightening addition to the horror genre. It also uses authentic music from the games compositions, by Akira Yamaoka, which gives it another leg up in the atmosphere department. Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (Sean Bean) have an adopted daughter named Sharon who suffers from sleepwalking night terrors, and cries out the name of a town in her dreams. When Rose questionably decides to bring her there and decipher her cryptic past, strange occurrences befall them. Her minivan becomes mired on a misty stretch of highway after an accident, and Sharon disappears, as she begins her search through the eerie abandoned mining town of Silent Hill. Aided by a tough chick motorbike cop (Laurie Holden) she faces unspeakable horrors and ghostly apparitions to find her daughter, and the truth. Jodelle Ferland expertly plays Sharon, and the darker version of her, Alessa, with more than a few spine shivering moments to her work. Deborah Kara Unger is excellent as the distraught wanderer Dahlia, with strange, poetic dementia and ominous ties to the central mystery. Alice Krige takes antagonist duties as the scary Christabella, a maniacal fanatic to rival Marcia Gay Harden in The Mist. Christopher follows her to the region and is aided by a local police captain (Kim Coates, stealing all his scenes like he always does), but is always one step behind. Bean, playing against his usual roughneck type is wonderful to watch as the caring father and husband, wracked with desperation and longing. The Silent Hill mythos in general has always had an unconventional, disturbingly surreal aspect to its visual and auditory palette, and the filmmakers don't let that slide in their translation from the game. The monsters, including the infamous pyramid head, are unlike anything seen before, always with an abstract biology, the music is an ethereal quilt of lilting melodies and grinding, industrial groans that blankets the film in an unshakable, beautiful sense of dread and buried tragedy, like the town itself, shrouded in an unending curtain of falling ash and fog laden gloom. The director wisely casts mostly obscure actors from indie and cult fare (my favourite kind), which give the proceedings a feeling of detachment from straightforward Hollywood horror, and a more free flowing, atmospheric tone that works its way into your head and tags along into your dreams."

","Wow. That's all I can say. First time I saw this I was mesmerized only because of the flawless performance of Laurie Holden, but the second time I realized that the whole movie was packed with very talented actors including Radha Mitchell and especially Sean Bean (who seems to die in every movie he stars in). The movie was packed with tension and the work involving the monsters was exquisite! Nothing looked too much like a game. First time I didn't watch till the end because I didn't want to (SPOILER!!!) watch Laurie Holden a.k.a. the policewoman to die (because she was so sexy), but it is an essential part that you need to watch in case you want to understand the entire plot of the movie. I also believed that the ending wasn't an easy one to figure out and i proved it right and am glad that it takes a lot of mind to get what's going on. Anyway, I rated this movie keeping in mind that this was a horror movie, and your rating scale must be a little lower for horror movies. So this is a 10/10 movie and I believe that says something..."

It's a confusing mess that makes very little sense, not a story.<br/><br/>And that whole cult business is so totally ridiculous and unrealistic, I can't even find the right word to describe how stupid it was.

That constant fog/rain or whatever. Trying too hard. I was not convinced. It's just cheesy and unrealistic. It had a feel of a studio filled with man-generated special effect, not a remote/abandoned location.<br/><br/>And why did the dead girl wait for the protagonist to get to the city, and only then she killed off its inhabitants (who, allegedly, tortured her to death)? She had nothing at all to do with this woman, except that her daughter (Sharon) was a look-alike of the dead girl. Maybe it's just me, but nothing in this whole movie makes any sense.<br/><br/>Well, the pyramid-head monster looked kind of cool, I'll give them that.<br/><br/>Anyway... I don't know what to say about this film, except that it's really not very good (to put it VERY mildly).<br/><br/>Like I said, I did kind of like the monsters, but the rest was an utter failure, including the acting.

"Meven_Stoffat","5","1","3","6 November 2011"," A 2 hour movie about nothing
","Sometimes, when I thumb through reviews of movies on Amazon and IMDb, particularly those I don't like- actually being even more specific, those being made out to be absolutely amazing due to the general hype and histrionics- I notice the terms ""intelligent"" and ""dripping with atmosphere"". More often than not, I can't help feel they're essentially using those terms, because they need SOMETHING to substitute ""full of plot holes/pretentious"" and ""very beautifully shot but lacking in anything else substantial"". Sadly, Silent Hill is one of those films.<br/><br/>I bring this up because last night, Silent Hill showed on TV last night. It showed on a Yankee TV station, and I still had time before I hit the bed, so I figured I would watch it. I remember seeing it at the cinema back in 2006, and generally not liking it at all. But who knows, what have I got to lose but time? It couldn't be as bad as it was back in 2006, could it?<br/><br/>Wow, actually, it was much worse than I expected. And back in 2006.<br/><br/>If anything, this film could be summed up like this: it's awesome visually. It looks like the inside of a criminally insane man-child's mind, with the glowing embers, the desaturated colours and the depressing atmosphere. However, plot wise, it's like you're watching a dress rehearsal they're throwing in story elements as they go along. <br/><br/>I haven't played the game, so I can't comment on the overall faithfulness to the source material. But what I can say is that I've read reviews that say this is exactly like the game. So I should give it that, right? No, actually. I want something more than being faithful to a video game of all things. I can't sum up the plot at all, because essentially there's no plot... hell, something tells me this film has no SCRIPT even!!!! Its like they just came up with everything on the spot.<br/><br/>In other words, this is a 2 hour movie about nothing. NOTHING. Had a hard time trying to stay awake during this movie, couldn't wait for it to be over. I would complain about the glaring plot holes in the film, plot canyons, even, but  there's really nothing to complain about in this film in terms of plot since there's really NO CONTENT in terms of a script.<br/><br/>The acting, in addition, is extremely awful. The cop is boring and says all her lines as if shes in a hypnotic trance of some sort. Radha Mitchell is just as boring and watching her is like watching an acting robot. Needless to say I'm sure the films script, or lack of, didn't excite them to the point where they cared about their characters.<br/><br/>Boring, far too long, missing any plot of any sort and a script to speak of, this is a very thankless, self indulgent and pretentious bore of a film to be avoided at all cost."
"Catharina_Sweden","2","1","3","29 December 2010"," Far-fetched, muddled, stupid and meaningless
","This movie was pure crap. It started out alright, as long as one believed that it would be an ordinary ghost story. That is: Sharon (the little girl) would have been receiving messages in her dreams from someone who died in the fire in the ghost town - her mother, maybe, or twin sister. Because the ghost wanted some unfinished business put right. That plot could have made an adequate horror movie! But instead, when the mother (Rose) and daughter arrived at the ghost town - the plot quickly turned out completely weird. It simply was too unrealistic, that a sect like that could have existed, without anyone knowing about it, in a modern town (I mean - even before it became a ghost town.) Neither is it explained, how all these people had found enough edible food to last for 21 years, or how they had survived the poisonous fumes...<br/><br/>The monsters are also very odd, and one does not receive any explanation as to what they are, or - if they are humans from the beginning - how they have turned into what they now are. 21 years is much too short a time, for them to be a new mutated species.<br/><br/>There was no explanation of the strange ending either - when the mother and daughter got home, but their husband/father could not see them. Had they died after all, so that they were really ghosts returning home..? Or did they immediately leave home again before the husband woke up - in that case: why? It is not explained! Overall, everything is too muddled, unrealistic and stupid, for one to start feeling for the characters, or even being curious about the end. The special effects and the main actors are good, though, so because of those/them I give the movie two stars instead of just one."

"renickmarsh","4","1","3","26 May 2009"," Should've Stayed a Video Game
","Just another example of the ""A.D.D. Ones"" not organizing and editing their thoughts or even focusing their ideas. This movie could've been very good, but the whole thing was just way out in left field with parts spilling out into the parking lot. I found myself suspending disbelief way to often and this is coming from someone who loves Science Fiction and Horror stories.<br/><br/>After reading some background info on the movie, I found myself even more confused. You shouldn't have to be familiar with a video game/back story or be required to do research in order to follow a movie, and if the Director is going to use visual clues, better make them obvious. In a world of excessive graphics and attention deficit disorder, people without A.D.D. are learning to ""tune out"" certain visuals. I also found myself wanting to see more of the creatures, and as usual with todays modern cinema; the dialog was somewhat slurred and mumbled. I don't want to ""figure out"" a movie. I do enough ""figuring out"" in the real world.<br/><br/>Maybe the movie should've been split up into a trilogy. With the first movie mainly being about Alessa's past and the town of Silent Hill. The second, about Sharon, her upbringing and her relationship to Silent Hill. Then the third, about the alternate realities of Silent Hill. Maybe the movie would've been better if someone who wasn't familiar with the games took on the project. If you're someone who likes clear and consistent rules in a story, and doesn't like to make a lot of assumptions; you probably will not like this movie. Overall, I would say the movie is worth watching for the Cinematography and Creature Designs alone, but be prepared to be disappointed in the Plot and Direction."
"thewordwasaphex","5","1","3","13 November 2008"," Underwhelmingly plotted, visually good
","I have to say, I was reluctant to watch this, being a massive fan of the games. A friend convinced me, and I must say that visually the film is excellent. However, there is a sense that the visuals are the 'meat' of the film - something I despise.<br/><br/>Plotwise, the film apes the first game - with the difference that the principal character has been gender-switched (something I found almost entirely unnecessary and actually somewhat counter-productive).<br/><br/>Sybil the motorbike cop is made less ambiguous than she was in the first game, and gone are all references to Metatron as some form of celestial being pulling the strings.<br/><br/>Alessa wasn't used or exposed on enough. Her tale is a tragic one; and in the first game you really grow to feel genuine sympathy for her. In the film, she's depth-less. The whole witchcraft thing is appallingly boneheaded, and totally out of keeping with the 'spirit' of the games.<br/><br/>My biggest bone, in fact, is that Christophe Gans chose to play with the mythos of Silent Hill - whilst an 'official' explanation has never been given, it is the consensus that Silent Hill exists differently depending on the person experiencing it, and that the creatures and so forth (whilst sticking to some repeating motifs) are personal anxieties and fears given form. Which leads me to both a big problem I had with Silent Hill; Pyramid Head.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Pyramid Head - whilst gorgeously and provocatively rendered - is a stinking abortion in this film. Pyramid Head in Silent Hill 2 (indeed, he has zero connection with Alessa in 'true' Silent Hill mythology) was James Sullivan's sense of guilt and self-persecution at his euthanasia murder of his wife Mary, and the subsequent creation of Maria, a sexier and more idealised version of her (who becomes 'real' in the dark town). In Silent Hill the movie, he's Jason Voorhes - a one-dimensional killer with no substance beyond 'walk towards screaming woman with big knife and kill her'. That Pyramid Head subsequently disappears without explanation is bemusing also. Gans has really fired a blank here; Pyramid Head is potentially a mountainous horror icon that could be the first to break the 'based-on-the-computer-game' barrier. Here, he's flat and - dare I say it - dull. For that, I can't forgive him. Even more perplexingly, the final raft of Alessa-based killing is done gratuitously with barbed wire in a way very reminiscent to the WWI horror 'Deathwatch'. That Alessa was burned to death, tied to a ladder seems to have no relation to her supernatural abilities. Which, frankly, irritated me too.<br/><br/>Plot - 2/10 (I enjoyed Sean Bean's character, looking for his wife, and never finding her even when they were in the same room. That's the only bit of the plot I liked.) Visuals - 7/10 (very good, if more fan-service than anything else. And the barbed wire, as mentioned, was a ripoff)<br/><br/>P.S: What they should've done was made Silent Hill 2's plot into the basis for the films plot. It would've been creepier, more unsettling and more human than this hackneyed pseudo-nonsense about 'witches' and 'faith'."

","Let's just say for a moment that the Silent Hill series in completely bankrupt, over. It's done. Now, they are trying to sweat out money from any pore that they can. Now lets snap back to reality. Silent Hill is still a major franchise with over a thousand fans and it's still going strong. Yet the director of the Brotherhood of the Wolf, an award winning film, has produced this razzie-worthy video game adaptation film. Now, don't get me wrong. While the movie deserves it's fair share of point-outs such as it's accurate usage of the characters and environments, the film still derives from the game and lacks the strength and ability to move the audience that was seen in the game.<br/><br/>In the film, Rose Dasilva(Replacing Harry Mason from SH1) and her daughter, Sharon(Replacing Cheryl Mason from SH1) make their way to Silent Hill, a small resort town in Toluca County, West Virginia to see if they can solve the mystery behind Sharon's sleepwalking issue. While stopped at a gas station, Sharon is approached by an motorbike officer, Cybil Bennett(Same Character in SH1), who believes that Sharon is a missing person and Rose is her captor. A few minutes pass before Sharon and Rose continue their journey to Silent Hill. While driving down the road towards Silent Hill, Rose realizes she is being followed by the motorbike cop. She sees a sign pointing to Silent Hill and speeds up. A chase ensues followed by Rose breaking through a roadblock into Silent Hill territory. The officer is lost in a fog. Rose is relieved to have lost the officer, but suddenly, relief is broken by loud white noise coming through the car stereo. Rose attempts to shut off the radio, taking her eyes off the road. Before she knows it, she is swerving to avoid a young girl traversing the desolate road. She crashes her jeep and is knocked out. She awakes in a fog, Sharon is gone, and her only chance of finding Sharon is to go into town. She wades through the blinding fog, soft petals of ash fall onto her face like snow. As she enters town, a old scraggily woman named Dahlia(Same Character from SH1) welcomes her in an odd way. After showing her a picture of Sharon, Rose is attacked by the woman, who seems to think Sharon is her own. Rose manages to escape the madwoman and continue her search. Coming upon a small shopping street, she notices the image of a young girl. thinking it's Sharon, she quickly pursues. She comes across an entrance to an alleyway and descends down a dark stairwell that she saw the young girl enter. While descending, a siren sounds, and she is dropped into the nether-realm of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>ACTING - 1/10 - Surprisingly poor acting really marred the beauty of this film. Had the acting and script been a little less wrought with emotion and bad lines, I might've been able to watch this the full way through without cringing.<br/><br/>MUSIC - 8/10 - Using Akira Yamaoka's music in this film was a very good choice. I'm glad to see that they didn't use their own brand of music because Akira's is Silent Hill exclusive. You can't duplicate it. The only major problem I had with it was that some of the music was used at awkward moments.<br/><br/>DESIGN - 6/10 - I like how the design was close to Silent Hill's in appearance, but too many of the characters seemed to be made up. Cybil and Alessa are really the only accurate people in the story, but Dahlia was way too overdone. Set design was fairly well done and the monsters were freakish in well played Silent Hill fashion.<br/><br/>OVERALL - 5/10 - I gave it a 5/10 because while the sets and characters were almost very well played, the acting was excruciatingly bad. It was like watching a High School play almost. The actors seemed too cued and organized like they were forcing their lines. It's definitely a well played horror film, but if you're a die hard Silent Hill fan, look away."

Good, because you will be when you watch this film. That's because the film does not make any sense at all. <br/><br/>I was intrigued by the visuals for the first half hour of the film.

","I have little experience with the game, on account of the fact that I couldn't sit through even an hour of the damn thing, it was so disturbing, and this was the original on the primitive Playsation One. So I was obviously hesitant to waste my time on another offering from that most pitiful and forlorn of genres: the video game adaptation *shudder*. But based on my experience with that darned video game, I was actually terribly curious to see if a film could could somehow evoke even slightly the same sense of eerie ambiance, unease, and dread that stem from the otherworldly and hideously unnatural landscapes and creatures that characterize the games. Well it did, and beautifully so.<br/><br/>I will admit, the plot is borderline nonsensical and silly... almost. And this the ONLY TIME that I haver felt that the art direction, design, and effects actually outweighed the need for a traditionally cohesive screenplay in a film. I still don't quite understand the vagaries of Silent Hill's dense and loopy 'story', and for the first time also, I didn't really care either. I just got lost in the flow and feel of it. And it is to dark and odd places that these feelings will take you if you're anything like me. At best, I guess I could describe this mesmerizing film's story and imagery as some unholy mix of Lewis Carrol, H.P. lovecraft, and an aesthetic sense that could only be dreamed up in an insane asylum or Hell, or both.<br/><br/>From the foggy neither world of Silent hill to its even weirder 'dark side', you will never lose the sense that you have wondered down some god-forsaken rabbit hole when you watch this movie. It's all just so unique and odd and random, as though you were roaming the subconscious fantasies of a demon. It's hideous and horrible, but there is a splendor and beauty that lurks in the decrepitude at the same time. Like the games, the ambient lighting, colours, and especially the sounds will draw you deeper and deeper into it's bizarre world. It's overwhelming at times if you watch it alone in the dark. The wailing claxons that usher in the inky darkness is one example. Utterly chilling. Cuddos to the producers for choosing an oddball directer like Christopher Gans to bring this concept to screen with grand guignol art house like sensibilities, the only way this project could work.<br/><br/>So yes, I found the movie mesmerizing and unforgettable, but if you appreciate it like I did, I recommend going into this movie as an artistic and sensory experience, rather then get caught up the technicalities of traditional film narrative, because I think its real beauty lies outside of those parameters.<br/><br/>Like I said, just roll with it like you're a clueless child about to be whipped away into a bizarre fairytale that is clearly only for adults with a strong stomach and a limitless imagination for the dark and sublime.<br/><br/>A+"
"katynko","4","1","3","7 March 2007"," Rather boring and not extremely intelligent. Typical Quest movie.
","Some people here claim that it is ""intelligent"" and interesting movie. But in my opinion it is intelligent only at a level of a quest-game. I liked those as a kid and when you are into the game, you can follow the movie and tell ahead what will happen. Typical quest - but intelligent?!!! My definition of ""intelligent"" is ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Memento"", ""The sixth sense"" and ""Fight club"". This movie, ""Silent Hill"", has a waaaaay to go before it will become any ""intelligent"".<br/><br/>Some people here claimed it is not a horror-movie, but I would say it is. For people with weak nerves may be it is not such a good idea to watch it.<br/><br/>And most disappointing is the end. I expected that may be the end would be ""intelligent"" but it was just as boring as the whole movie."
"elfinium","5","1","3","4 March 2007"," Overall disappointing
","Maybe I just wasn't in the right mood, or maybe you need to have played the game to enjoy this film, but I found it a huge letdown. It has so many promising elements to it, but the sense of anticipation built up in the viewer only lead to disappointment in my case.<br/><br/>Silent Hill manages to carry an incredibly creepy and disturbing tone throughout, with good acting and amazing visual effects, but it just drags on and on for so long... only to reach a totally ambiguous ending, which left me feeling completely frustrated that I'd wasted hours watching a depressing story, which petered out to nowhere.<br/><br/>I also had problems with the storyline, which whilst keeping in mind it was a fantasy movie, at times pushed the limits. Many of Radha Mitchell's actions seemed totally illogical. As well, the opening scenes of the film are weak in that they don't establish enough of an interest or care for the characters to sustain the viewers throughout."

","Silent Hill... OK, I thought. It can't be that bad! The game was alright. When I pushed it into the DVD player and sat down with my brother to watch it, I thought it started out fine. Great, creepy opening, weird burning cross. The works! But, as the story progressed, I became further disappointed in the adaption. The 3D graphics were TERRIBLE (am I the only one who thought the scene with the alter-ego child was some of the worst graphics conceivable?), the acting got worse and worse (yeah, OK, I get it! You're a crazy church freak. Tell me something I don't know...), and, all in all, the director could have done a better job (just... just wow.). The movie started with a great idea coming from an alright game but the end results were less than mediocre... besides, the ending wasn't even a real ending. Sure, there's more than one Silent Hill game but that doesn't mean that you should make me endure another MOVIE to see where the story is going. In all seriousness, don't watch it. EVER."

","I watched this movie first time with a faint fear in my heart, having played the original game many times on Playstation. I only knew that main protagonist had been changed from man to woman. What else did they change? Well, a lot of things, but that was certainly a good thing. I understood, that direct translation from game with multiple endings wouldn't have been possible. <br/><br/>Aside details, this game is most faithful to the game in surprising area: camera angles! There are a lot of scenes, where the view of the scene is taken 100% from the original game. Music is another. You have the same haunting music as in the game with few exceptions, and it's orchestrated this time.<br/><br/>Movie is scary, sad and extremely anxious. It doesn't have sudden scares. There is nothing that suddenly jumps or could jump on your face from darkness. It's scary, because the world in itself is a scary & weird place and there is no way out. Feeling of anxiety in the movie is phenomenal. You see the monsters from the distance but there is no way to keep running away from them forever. Behind everything that, there is just a sad story about a fate of a small girl.<br/><br/>Actors on this movie are good. Not great, but good. They are in a good balance, so that most of the main characters and in this case quite a few supporting characters too are very memorable. Expression on the face of the Kim Coates when he rescues Alessa from burning is terrific. No character is too generalized archetype either. <br/><br/>The only thing in this movie that monsters are way too visibly computer animated. I forgive that partially because, well, this is based on a video game."

","I came to this film without knowing the history behind its making: I am very glad this was the case. Had I known it is based on a game, I may not have even looked for Silent Hill at all. After all, most adaptations from games to screen are dodgy to say the least. I don't know what the game is like, but the film is sensational! Silent Hill has pretty-much anything one could wish for in a horror flick: great direction; excellent editing; and a wonderful cast. Alice Krieg plays Christabella to the hilt, and references to her ""Borg Queen"", especially toward the denouement, abound. Jodelle Ferland as Sharon/Alessa proves she is an adaptable actor who should get better by the role/year! And the list goes on...<br/><br/>Everywhere, there are allusions and references for the fans among us: ""Midwich"" makes an appearance and there is more than a touch of the original ""Kingdom"" (rather than King's adaptation) floating about. We have: the isolated community; the government (in this case local) conspiracy; the hypocrisy of sectarian religion/cults; the strong bond between mother and child; and the father-figure out of his depth.<br/><br/>I'm avoiding ANY hints re the story/action because it is so good that it must be experienced first-hand. Rent the DVD or buy it. I'm certainly going to watch it a few more times, and I bet you will too. Yes, it's THAT good! Now, I suppose, I'd better go find someone who's played the game..."

","I have played the game, and the flaws of the game are ipsis literis in the movie. Perhaps that makes for a good game-movie translation, but i agree with the posts that say it is poor. One comment said, either it is crap or i don't understand it. I would like to assuage that particular person. There is nothing to understand, and it is crap. The dialogs are the cream (i should say crap) of the cliché, and there is no turn over that isn't expected or completely out of the blue. It saddens me, that this is the trend horror movies are probably going to be taking, as so many blunts are saying it is actually worth to seeing. Again, it makes me aware of the despicable stance of the current movie watchers, those that unfortunately do rule what the producers are going to be making. More and more crap."
"Nevadapilot","Null","1","3","29 October 2006"," The Ending
","We've read the other comments on the movie, and think in the end they are actually dead. And that they died in the car accident when they first arrived to Silent Hill, which is why they thought they couldn't leave when they found the road gone and a huge abyss in its place. We also think the cop was dead, since she was in a motorcycle accident (The bike on the ground and the blood on her head). When Rose tried to call her husband and say she was coming home, all he heard was static. When Rose and Sharon drove past the gas station they stopped at before coming to Silent it was full of people, and later on it was empty, and the house was empty, and gloomy. The Husband saw the door open, but no one was there and the car was gone. Just kind of like at the schoolhouse, they were in the hallway and courtyard together, but could not see or hear each other, he just felt her presence. We understand that some of you may disagree with our theory, but that is all it is, just our theory."

","First, I should point out that I can't really identify myself with the group of people that adore the Silent Hill video games. I've just tried out one of them and I was quite impressed, but I'm not really much of a gamer these days. So I thought I was in a quite good mood for a movie like Silent Hill tonight, and I can't say I got too spellbound by judging the plot... Although I think the scenery was amazing! I'm a bit interested in art and this flick just had what I'm into, that sort of morbid and doomsday kind of feeling to it. For the action and the acting, I didn't get too involved... I mean, it was just another American flick, considering the acting and the Hollywood style. But hey, it was two hours of good effects, so the time watching it wasn't completely wasted. I give this 6/10, where at least 4 points are earned just by the scenery."
"sir-montag","6","1","3","17 October 2006"," Looks very cool, makes little sense (in a bad way)
","I play a fair amount of video games, but never played Silent Hill, so I really had no idea what to expect going into the movie.<br/><br/>It's creepy, it's incredibly gory and incredibly violent, and it looks very good the whole time.<br/><br/>After that, however, there isn't much. It is like a video game was directly adapted to the screen. In this case though, that's a bad thing. Faithful adaption of the video game it may be, but good film it's not. 90% of the time, I got the feeling that this would make a *lot* more sense had I played the game.<br/><br/>In many cases, things happened for no obvious reason (falling somewhere, ending up somewhere) that didn't do well for it as a film. It wasn't the good kind of 'that made no sense' but rather the bad kind - just a character falling from one situation into the next, very much akin to going through different levels in a video game.<br/><br/>That doesn't make a good movie though. Characters run around doing things you would do in a video game that don't come across as believable on screen - 'run around the town gathering clues' - 'solve this brain teaser' - fine for someone *playing* a *game* but for *viewing* a *movie*, it just wastes time and you're like ""Ah. That's nice. Plot please?"" <br/><br/>We don't expect Joe Dirt to be Shakespeare, so we don't hold it to those standards. Silent Hill, on the other hand, set the bar high in many ways, only to fail miserably in others. Joe Dirt can never be Shakespeare material. Silent Hill could have.<br/><br/>More or less, you get a very creepy and gory video game translated directly to the screen. As a video game translation, it seems to succeed extremely well.

","In comparison to ""Mortal Kombat"", ""Street Fighter"", ""Dead or Alive"" (In cinemas recently) or the horrible ""out-of-the-games-by-atmosphere"" Movies ""Resident Evil"" (I LOVE the Games, heavily addicted)and many others, ""Silent Hill"" managed to stay close to the game.<br/><br/>The Element of using the Music from Games 1-4 was congenius. Therefore fans of the games had Elements to get stuck to.<br/><br/>The plot ranged between Silent Hill 1 and 3, the creatures were all taken out from Part 2 (except the ""Crawling Creature in the toilet from the school) Since 1 and 3 were connected together in storyline, and had the sickest atmosphere, it is very good they stayed so close to this plot.<br/><br/>Atmosphere, lights, camera angles and the costumes of all the creatures were amazing, VERY Close to the games design and atmosphere. You felt like playing it again without controller and therefore an even more helpless feeling, witnessing what would happen next.<br/><br/>Even Locations of the games were taken or slightly ""passed"", like ""Annie's Bar"" which the main character passed running through deserted Silent Hill. The School, the ever-present Hospital... everything was there, sadly not the ""Lakeside Amusement Park"" ^_0 Would have been stranger....<br/><br/>The only three ""downs"" of this movie were... 1) Too less ""creatures""... Since fighting is one of the recognizable Elements of the Games, the movie offered a lot of Creatures like the Cockroaches, the psychological Enemy ""Pyramid Head"" from James Sunderland's mind (Silent Hill 2) and the great Nurses (in Game 2 the best look) but in the movie they all show up for a short time, nonetheless in overwhelming amounts. 2) The long ""Monologue"" from Alessa/Cheryl/Sharon explaining everything, it gives the movie some ""length"" for those who played the games, for others, it's vital for understanding. 3) The ending. It is great, but from the movies point of view not understandable, without having played the games, where a character was NEVER Able to escape the ""fangs"" of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>To me, it fits perfect in the line of Horror-Classics like ""Thing"", ""The Fog"", ""House of a 1000 corpses"", ""Tesis"", ""Nightwatch"", ""Near Dark"" ans so on....

","OK, probably nearly everyone who chose to watch this film expected a half arsed, fan-pleasing, game to film adaptation with less than average visual effects, and acting that a woodpecker would break it's beak on.<br/><br/>However! I found this film to be a refreshingly disturbing and brilliant work that left me grabbing for handfuls of pop-corn to fill my gaping jaw as I sat through some of the most eye catching and brilliant ""monsters"" I have yet to see in film.<br/><br/>Having only glanced upon the game several times I haven't much input on the game to film adaptation stuff. But, I've been told it's all great. So that's that.<br/><br/>I usually can't stand horror films, or anything ""scary"" in film. I've often found them either too disturbing, laughable, or just out there to give the audience a cheap shock. But I've got to stress this is simply not what happens here, the acting of the leading woman/girl/mother (I'm just no good with terms. Actually, I'm not good with names either.) was great, and not the corny scream and run idea I was expecting. Her reactions to the ""monsters"" are completely believable and no heroics are shown at places where you wouldn't expect.<br/><br/>Mr Sean Bean however... was just not on. A crappy attempt at an American accent was just laughable, however his scenes were necessary to those not familiar with the game.<br/><br/>Not many points have been covered in this, I believe to be the first review I've ever written, so I'll summarise in some nice numbers:<br/><br/>Scaaaariness: 10/10 Acting/Believability: 8/10 (Due to The Bean.)

"dolph50","1","1","3","17 September 2006"," Silent (but nonetheless stinky) Sh*t
","I have seen a lot of people impressed by this film. Oh, they say, it's carbon copy to the video game. Well if that's something to be credited for then kudos to the filmmakers. Other than that I see nothing else but another senseless movie. Of course I wish I had seen comments from someone older than 12 here, but looks like there is none. For the other hand I have read some comments (of some frustrated people) saying is's the worse movie ever made. I don't think so, but I should admit the filmmakers tried hard to accomplish. Last time I checked a movie should have something else than computer-made characters. They don't even wanted to spend money doing appropriate casting. If it had been a matter of low budget I would understand the 90% of any ""living"" thing on this movie were computer-generated. Wake up people, there were movies (and certainly good ones) even before computers hit the market. So there is no need of computer CGI to make a good film like some reviewers here seem to believe. One last thing. There was a moment (when all these nurses gathered) I thought I was watching ""Thriller"", that clip featuring Michael Jackson, or at least something very close to it. Was it me? For one split second I thought they would start dancing around. Unfortunately I wasn't that lucky. Maybe, have they turned it into a musical movie, it would have saved the whole project. As people is settling for less and less the filmmakers think there is no reason to go that extra mile for quality anymore and they just feed us with some CGI and the rest is up to us to figure it out. No plot, no acting not even wardrobe. You only have to throw in some visuals and voilà, you are in the business. Enjoy, people."
"jaredmobarak","9","1","3","6 September 2006"," Sinners deserve to lose their spawnSilent Hill
","Silent Hill is a study in atmosphere and mood. While some may say it is style over substance, I'd have to agree a bit, but correct the statement to style with substance. Christophe Gans, the visionary director behind a great foreign film Brotherhood of the Wolf, has crafted a film that is visually astonishing while mind-bendingly layered. Credit writer Roger Avary, whom I have yet to be disappointed with anything I've seen containing his involvement, for adapting, not the story exactly, but the emotion and structure which has made the eponymous video game as successful as it has been. While one can look at numerous message boards yelling that this movie is trash compared to the game, the main character's sex has changed, monsters are in that shouldn't be, etc., as a film fan (who has never played nor seen the game played) I need to tell these people that film is a new medium. The transition, in my opinion has gone over practically without a hitch.<br/><br/>The acting is superb throughout, a tough sell for a movie of this ilk. Amazingly, Gans was able to compile an on-the-cusp of A-list cast to do the material justice. This is not a hack- em up slasher flick, nor is it a horror of the kind churned out each week to make money. Silent Hill is a stylish art film whose atmosphere haunts. The multi-plane dimensions are reminiscent of the classic Hellraiser movies, along with the creatures that have been manifested from the minds of those being pursued. Each monster here has been created for a reason and does its' job. This is not the real world, but a nightmare come true. Radha Mitchell plays the desperate mother to perfection, showing fear for outside forces and fear for the wellbeing of her child. While under-used, Sean Bean also shows a subdued emotional palette as he searches for his wife and daughter. The always effective Deborah Kara Unger plays the outcast nicely. A mother herself, she must live with the mistake she has made; the devil reaping revenge won't allow her to die, maybe due to the love her daughter still holds, but more realistically because she must live with her sin for eternity. As far as the creepiness scale goes, praise should be awarded to Alice Krige as an overzealous cultist and to young Jodelle Ferland who plays some very disturbing scenes like a pro. Ferland is a credit to some liberal parenting I'm sure, as she is cast as some emotionally wrought children with many skeletons in her subconscious. She plays the layers great and I just can't wait any longer for the much overdue Tideland, directed by auteur Terry Gilliam and starring Jodelle.<br/><br/>While the acting surpasses the genre that Hollywood has tried to pigeonhole the movie into, it is the visual style that really impresses. From the first moment in the town of Silent Hill, when the snow falls through the fog, a flake is caught by Radha Mitchell and turns black, the viewer gets an idea of the attention to detail. Each conversion between reality, Silent Hill grey, and menacing darkness is seamlessly orchestrated. Watching the structures of the grey burn to ash, in turn becoming creatures of the darkness after the air-raid siren ceases, is magical. It's even more so when the darkness has come to an end and the creatures turn back to ash and slowly materialize together into walls and doors. The cgi work is top-notch as well as the sound effects. Every industrial sound is placed with care and the use of a score does more for mood than any heavy-metal soundtrack couldwhat seems to be the horror choice of the past decade.<br/><br/>Gans had a vision and he filmed it. The cinematography and visuals are a sight to behold and unfortunately for a horror film, not to be appreciated by the audience the studio has targeted. This is not a horror film more than a dark insight into the psychological mind of a scorned child; a child who hadn't developed her mind enough to go past atrocities she has seen and experienced. Because of this, her openness to a deal with the devil can have drastic results. Silent Hill is an intelligent thriller that calls for attention and thought. It is a shame that the filmmakers knew this wouldn't go over with the general audience and had to explain every detail during an extended flashback sequence towards the end of the film. If only Gans had been really creating an independent vision and was allowed to leave surrealism to itself a la David Lynch, I probably would have given this film a perfect score. Instead, money really does talk and when Hollywood wants accessibility, every action must be taken to make the backers happy."
"WolfGifford","9","1","3","6 September 2006"," Chilling, surreal and horrifying.
","I know nothing about the game - and it was with no knowledge (other than that this was a horror film) that I went into the cinema. I then sat through the best 2 hours of pure horror I have seen in a long, long time...<br/><br/>The tension kicks in at the off and gradually climbs in little notches until the audience in on the edge of their seats - not only wondering about the fate of the principal characters, but about the back story that will explain what is going on. And after 90mins of tightening the screws the final 30mins is a tour-de-force of revelation, revulsion, revenge and retribution.<br/><br/>The eerie and very effective use of sound, coupled with the surreal imagery is very disquieting and left me feeling quite uneasy through the whole movie. You know a film has hit it's mark when the gang of kids who laughed and chatted and made phone calls through the trailers shut up and go quiet very early on.<br/><br/>The explanation for the movies premise is one of the most horrifying I have come across and is brilliantly handled (i.e, without excessive gore)by the director. This also one of the few horror movies of recent years that remains grim throughout and never seeks to lighten the mood with ill-placed humor or a a ridiculous 'macho' ending. The action is driven by the love of a mother searching for her daughter - and for that is very believable.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, 'Silent Hill' is something special. A real horror film in every sense of the word. It doesn't rely on on just one element (gore, violence, horrific story etc) for it's success, but manages to use just the right amount of each to create a spell binding and knuckle whitening whole. See it now!!"
"shattenjager777","2","1","3","2 September 2006"," Pathetic in nearly every way and so poorly directed it will give you nightmares . . . and not in the intended way.
","To begin, I am not a fan of the game; in fact I have never played it. So the game fans who are only concerned with its ""accuracy"" to the game (which is, by definition, uninteresting film making) will get absolutely nothing from this review.<br/><br/>Beginning with the screenplay, ""Silent Hill"" is an ugly smattering of unconnected scenes with hardly any discernible plot or characterization. Despite attempts near the end to bring together the preceding into a coherent whole, the film really is a series of slightly varying sorts of chase scenes so much so that the entire film could be reduced to only 20 minutes in length. Those scenes aren't even original or interesting; in fact they are simply one cliché after another until it almost makes one sick. The characters follow much the same pattern--they are one-dimensional, weak clichés of the standard horror movie ""mother with missing child,"" ""husband with missing wife,"" and ""troubled child."" Overall, the script and story can only be described as pathetic.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the acting, while not particularly impressive and quite hampered by the lack of characterization, is probably the best point of the film. The only actors who have even a slight (and they only have that) possibility for performance are Sean Bean and Radha Mitchell, who are adequate performers and do what they can, adding a bit to an otherwise truly pathetic film and saving it from deserving a 1 rating.<br/><br/>However, the aspect of the film that truly destroys it is the direction. Christophe Gans obviously did not fully think through the film before making his decisions, as evidenced by his opening, which immediately and heavy-handedly set up a world of diametric opposites and obvious morality. The film opens with (what Gans was intending to be) a frightening scene to set up the fear, and it is appropriately dark and menacing; however, what follows is a shockingly brightly colored scene (seemingly even without a normal ""56"" filter) showing the loving bond between a mother and child before the true horror suddenly begins. Then, the film does not really follow through with this obvious black and white sort of universe, instead attempting to subvert its own moral compass time and again and yet never adjusting its lighting scheme accordingly. Furthermore, the overly-quick, MTV-style editing and bouncing among useless extra camera angles is also nothing short of disgustingly annoying and serves to reduce the tension in the film's few attempts at said tension. Finally, Jeff Dana and Akira Yamaoka's score does not do the film any favors, switching back and forth between being wildly clichéd and wildly inappropriate.<br/><br/>Finally, no review of a film filled with this many special effects would be complete without a word on them: awful. First, the sheer amount of effects shots is way, way too high, to the point that the film is more like a cartoon than film. Second, the animation is often truly pathetic, as in the shot of the skyline of Silent Hill that resembles a bad matte painting and the awful field of plants around the mother and child in the beginning. No one should watch a film for special effects, but even for those of you who do, this film needs to be avoided.<br/><br/>All told, ""Silent Hill"" is not one of the worst films ever made, but it's close. The screenplay, direction, and score are all extraordinarily bad and the latter two are often inappropriate for the moods intended by the former. And as if those weren't enough, the pathetic characterization precludes any good acting and the CGI is unbelievably bad and so overdone that the film watches more like a badly drawn cartoon than a true film. Perhaps there are interesting tie-ins to the game that would make a fan of the game enjoy the film, but watching it as simply a film, it is truly pathetic and should be avoided by all, even those who enjoy bad horror films."

","OK, first things first. I don't understand how nearly everyone is actually praising this crap. It should be said that i am a big fan of the first game, but not of this movie. <br/><br/>The good: The camera angles are spot on, and the look and atmosphere is great, so i will give the movie that much. It's impressive in that aspect. Very well done. But that's where Silent Hill ends as a good movie and goes down the hill and becomes Silent Queef Hill.<br/><br/>The bad: Everything else about this movie is horrible. I actually excited to see it. Then when i watched it, it was so boring that it was like a vampire stealing my vitality. This movie only got more boring as it went along. Most of the special effects are horrible, especially the creatures. The CGI effects of the paint chipping of the walls etc. are laughable, as are the CGI bugs. Way too cartoony. I would not have been surprised at all if Sponge Bob Squarepants himself made a cameo in the movie. I had to fight my hand from grabbing the DVD player remote and clicking this movie off several times. I always give a movie a fair chance and watch it through. But sometimes, like this movie's case, it can be very, very tempting to shut it off.<br/><br/>(Spoilers) <br/><br/>At one point, a monster picks a girl up buy her throat and then tears her clothes off. What's so cheesy about it is that the girl is very obviously CGI when she's supposed to be real. That's really overdoing it. This movie is a CGI crap-fest, but that's not where it ends. It has characters i never once cared about, and they could have all died for all i care. The movie has no pacing, making it very boring. The story is a mess, and the ending is slapped on and ""explained"" in the last 20 minutes or so. And the fact that the annoying little girl is narrating it makes it all the worse. Nearly all the acting is horrible and laughable.<br/><br/>(End of spoilers) <br/><br/>There's too many things going on in the movie, and they are never really resolved. There's also several scenes that are unimportant, making the movie feel under-edited. But even cutting wouldn't help. This movie is simply a mess all around. I refuse to watch this movie ever again. And if anyone ever tries to make me watch it again, i would politely say ""no."" However if they persisted, a fist-fight could probably ensue, i'm serious. The movie is that bad. It simply stinks, well, like a queer..right from the backsides of all the females that are in the movie, all mixed into one gaseous, green, stinky cloud. This is the worst movie to come out since 'The Hulk'. <br/><br/>2 out of 10 stars for Silent Queef Hill. And that's being generous."

"yakmanyhad","5","1","3","26 August 2006"," As a movie, or as a VG movie?
","I have never played the game, Silent Hill, therefore I am judging the value of this flick as a horror movie, not as a horror movie based on a video game. The visual effects were absolute madness. The concept of the ghost town is realized with a dreamlike hellishness that is often missing in most contemporary horror flicks. The characters and settings seamlessly blend with the overall ethos of the story to create a mood that is heavy and palpable, jolting the viewer with paranoid urgency and a claustrophobic, no-way-out mentality. The imagery is poignant, the camera work exploiting each scene gracefully.<br/><br/>Silent Hill has a few glaring issues. While most people who see this movie will know that it is based on a video game, hardly any audience member wants to be reminded of it. I recall the battle scene with the super-zombie at the end of Resident Evil 2 (one could almost imagine life-measurement bars next to Milla Jovovich's character). Silent Hill contains one of these scenes, a scene that takes you right out of the movie to remind you that it is all based on a video game. For VG fans, that is probably OK, but for horror movie fans that is a big ""no no."" The acting and plot are very instable, as well. The speaking characters are simply vehicles for the plot, pushing it along to it's eventual conclusion, rather than shaping the course of the story. Granted, a whole lot happens between A and B, and to squeeze in development would derail the whole film, but S.H. relies too heavily on it's flawed plot structure to make up for it's lack of character development. Does anyone truly know what the outcome of the movie is, gamers and movie buffs alike?<br/><br/>Overall, Silent Hill is a nice, gory, entertaining nightmare, stylish in it's use of effects but staggering under the weight of a busy plot and it's obligation to viewers who played the game first."
"bones_havoc","3","1","3","24 August 2006"," A visually interesting film, with horrendous narratives
","Silent Hill is an interesting concept and with good reasons. It looks amazing, it feels eerie and it definitely gets the discussion going. I was quite pleased to hear they were making a movie based on the video game, and especially pleased to hear that the director behind ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" was attached. After looking up the writer, and seeing that he had dipped a bit of his talents into writing ""Pulp Fiction"", I was in heaven.<br/><br/>The final results though aren't as pleasing. The film turns out to be visually impressive and stunning, all the while being irritating to listen to. My eyes were happy, not my ears. The main problem is the narrative, how the story flows and how the events unfold. Rose simply runs around for half of the movie making some very odd decisions. First blindly following her daughter around, then stupidly following bus routes while handcuffed, to somehow believing that in the mouth of a corpse might lie a clue to her daughter's whereabouts (the logic in this puzzles me), ending in a church. The scariest part of Silent Hill is the fact that the whole movie is explained within a 4-5 minute stock-looking film which is played...in the mind of Rose?...In the air?...somewhere? I'm not sure, but it's played and it explains a few things.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is worth checking out, no doubt about it, but it isn't a great addition to the video-game adaptation resume. If critics feel that the main issue with vg adaptations are the lack of story and character, this just might be a huge caliber in their guns for the future. Albeit the narratives, this movie looks amazing!"

","I'm honestly in a rush right now, but i see it as my patriotic duty to warn you all innocent tax paying citizens about this movie. Firstly, it's based off a video game, which means that from inception it was going to be difficult unless there was some genius behind the plot ( we're still awaiting the arrival of the genius). The eerie silent hill atmosphere surrounding the actual game was excellent as it really depicted that element from the game, however everything else was in pure shambles. The acting sucked to an extreme I never expected...how in God's earth can a woman who lost a child in a ghost town act so calmly when arrested after being chased by seemingly alien life forms??? A woman that calm wouldn't have wanted to go to Silent Hill in the first place. The cgi was ""ok"" i guess, although it can't be compared to great works such as The Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and Lord of the Rings.The ending also leaves only the perception of the imagination, as there's really nothing in the movie that explains what actually happened in the end. Overall i think i lost a few IQ points from this movie, and I would suggest for you to rent it on tape, borrow the DVD or just don't watch it at all.<br/><br/>Overall rating 4/10"

To sum it up this movie is plain bad. It's not scary which is its main downfall, but besides that the story is told dully, the characters' motives seem vague at most times and the movie is just too long. Now, I wouldn't mind the 127 min of the movie if it had something to tell. But it doesn't! A lot of scenes are useless, and seem to be there because someone just couldn't hold himself and had to put those in. Bottom line save your time.

Although it is rooted in the 'wronged-spirit-gets-revenge' category, there is a definite twist in who turns out to be the entity that did the wrong. I Highly recommend this movie to people who like their horror without having to switch off their brains. Visually, this was a treat. Some of the direction reminded me of Kubrick... very atmospheric. I guess that's why some people complain about the pacing of the movie (as they do with some kubrick). The effects were top notch and quite disturbing (I coulda done without seeing a human being burned alive in such great detail, I prefer my horror to be more rooted in fantasy).

","I've never played the Silent Hill games so I'm not a fanboy like most of the reviewers here seem to be. What maybe worked in a game certainly does not work in a movie. The so called plot of this movie makes no sense and it's also very boring. Why do little girls always represent evil in Japanese horror? This film isn't actually frightening at all, although it's supposed to be a horror movie.<br/><br/>Video games in general have very poor story lines, they're just there as an excuse for the action. It's pretty clear with this film, when they try to convert a video game straight into a movie, it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Anyway a complete waste of time, avoid at all costs unless you're a fanboy of the games.

"qball_82","6","1","3","13 August 2006"," Almost had it....!
","Video game to movie adaptation. Are those alarm bells I hear?<br/><br/>Silent Hill introduces us to a rather disturbed little girl, Sharon, and her protective parents. Sharon has been sleepwalking and the final straw for her mother, Rose, comes after an encounter with a very high cliff top. So Rose does what any sensible, intelligent mother does and takes Sharon off to the town of Silent Hill - the name Sharon has been muttering in her nocturnal adventures. Being a horror movie, and with a name as creepy as Silent Hill, we're about to find out this is the place of nightmares.<br/><br/>To get it over with, as a video game adaptation, Silent Hill somewhat bucks the trend and provides us with an entertaining couple of hours. Stunning visuals and production values make it very easy to watch and coupled with the score, it is easy to get lost in Silent Hill. But like a lot of video games (and lets face it, movies too), the storyline has enough holes to rival a sieve. Rose makes countless, illogical decisions and not enough is revealed to the audience as the film dawdles along. Finally about two thirds of the way in and approaching the climax, the film kicks into overdrive and a barrage of revelations are made - which is all well and good but with so much information to take in it all gets rather convoluted and confusing...<br/><br/>I liked the film a lot but it's really a classic case of style over substance. If only they had paid half as much attention to fine tuning the story as they had with the imagery and attention to detail, Silent Hill would really be cream of the video game-to-movie crop."

","Having read a couple of the previous comments and being a long time PC gamer I approached this film with fairly high expectations. On the plus side, the scenario's, camera work and characterisations were pretty reminiscent of two of the three PC versions of the Silent Hill games I have played. The film does conjure up a palpable atmosphere and the special effects are well done. On the minus side, the acting and script is pretty poor, almost cringe-worthy in places. I would give a score of 7/8 for effects, atmosphere and deja vu factor for gamers, but a score of 3 for acting and plot. Slightly disappointing. Some previous commenter's stated this was the best film adaptation of a game so far, I disagree and think that accolade goes to Resident Evil 1 and 2, which although perhaps not as atmospheric, offer solid action and better acting than is on offer here."

I say all of this as a big fan of the Silent Hill game series. This wouldn't even be a Silent Hill 5, the story is way lame for that. I remember playing the first game and thinking ""wow, this would be a great movie"" but everything needs to be the same, same story, characters(mother is dead), Cyril turns into a demon later...

","Sleepwalking daughter (Jodelle Ferland) wanders off from her mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) in an abandoned ghost town known as Silent Hill. While Rose's husband (Sean Bean) searches fruitlessly for her, she must put up with a police officer (Laurie Holden), who suspects her of kidnapping, the crazed mother (Deborah Kara Unger) of a ""witch"", and the variety of repugnant mutants that inhabit the town.<br/><br/>I had absolutely now idea what to expect when I went in to this movie. I didn't know what the video game was about and I didn't know the plot of the movie. All I wanted was two hours of shocks and scares. To my disappointment, Silent Hill is one of the forgettable films of 2006, and definitely not scary to anyone over 13. Director Christophe Gans tries his best to create a sense of foreboding and to some extent, the atmosphere he builds up works - but the payoff just isn't there. While some scenes in ""Hill"" are truly disgusting and gruesome, the film is far from scary. <br/><br/>The good points of the film are the sweet score, some smooth, stylized camera-work, absolutely brilliant settings and an unpredictable and very confusing plot. The bad points include the pretty weak acting overall, a brutally corny script, and the lack of any really frightening scenes. The CGI mutants are hideous enough to look at, but too cartoonish in their digital appearance to feel like they're really there. They look like just that: CGI mutants, straight out of a video game.<br/><br/>Sean Bean, by far the best actor out of the cast, has nothing to do, and he wanders around as aimlessly as his character in the film. The rest of the cast is just passable although their dialogue sometimes becomes eye-rollingly cheesy.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just too jaded. I bet there are many 13-15-year olds who will sneak into the theatre and have a scary good time, but any true horror fan will most likely leave unaffected by Hill's violent CGI mayhem. I can only recommend this movie to people around 12-14. That's not to say Silent Hill is a waste of time. It's just a huge disappointment.(r#47)"
"twitch_19c","9","1","3","26 July 2006"," best video game to film adaption...EVER
","European movie based on a Japanese survival horror video game filmed in Canada with little Americans involved...the main reason it DOESN'T suck. I'm sorry, but America just tends to waste movies. Especially remakes/adaptations.<br/><br/>First of all, this is by far THE best video game to movie adaptation to date.<br/><br/>Not everyone will be too pleased with it, mostly those that have never played the Silent Hill video games. But as as huge fan of the video games, I really enjoyed this movie, beginning to end.<br/><br/>For those who haven't played the games, the only thing to do is to get lost in the story and be taken aback by the amazing visual effects. The story can be confusing, but once it's explained, the movie will make some more sense, and therefore you'd like it more :D Then again, being bombarded with confusion and such just makes the Silent Hill experience that much better since that's one of the elements of Silent Hill! The movie altogether is just amazing - it's pure Silent Hill...basically eye candy for the vg fans n__n It's creepy, it's dark, the visual effects are amazingly breathtaking, the eerie music & sounds taken directly from the game work amazingly well, and so on. Like I said before, the story can be pretty confusing, but putting that aside it's just a feast of visual...awesomeness. The characters are kinda flat, but that's really no big deal...average acting, really.<br/><br/>The story stays pretty true to the original game, obviously some changes since it would be kinda boring watching an exact remake of the game. But it still works well.<br/><br/>Overall, if you're a horror movie/SH fan, watch it. It's creepy, it's dark, it's gory (this possibly has the most gruesome slaughter scene I have ever seen in a movie), it's beautifully done. If you're neither, then just watch it for the ride. It's a good one."

","What a disappointment. Or not. What the hell is Silent Hill, anyway?<br/><br/>Silent Hill is the best video game adaptation made so far. If anyone makes a list of the ten greatest images in the history of horror films, if this doesn't have at least one spot on there, then there is no such thing as justice. This movie looks fantastic. The set design by Cronenberg Woman is astounding and evocative, the cinematography is pretty much perfect, the creature effects are magnificent, the direction is amazingly confident.<br/><br/>Having said that, it just doesn't connect. <br/><br/>The script, by Roger Avary, seems to be attempting to sound like a video game. In other words, the dialogue is mostly not so good at all. Almost all of the dialogue feels off, both in delivery and in the actual writing. While the movie is going for a surreal, dream-like feeling, the middle section has a few major groaners, once it turns into downright flat exposition it gets next to impossible to stay in the movie. Of course Christophe Gans, a fellow whose visual skill is impeccable in my opinion, thought the script was great, but that's because he speaks English as a second, or maybe even third language.<br/><br/>Anyway, the exposition part is done in this cool-looking flashback, but it's totally unnecessary. As is Boromir of Gondor even being in the movie. The movie's central problem is that its story, while initially intriguing (that's because there really isn't much of any for the first hour, just wandering), just doesn't work. It doesn't work because it doesn't connect emotionally with the audience. Even when it has the potential to, it segues into its middle hour, which is by far the worst part of the movie.<br/><br/>But the problem with calling the movie bad is that it's way too damn cool. I think someone else said that it's good in all the right places and bad in all the wrong ones. It's the very definition of an uneven movie. There is so much right in this movie. The soundtrack, from the games, is brilliant. And as I said, the way everything is visualized is fantastic, although the parts where the monsters melt into ash is a bit excessive and unnecessary.<br/><br/>A lot of people, mainly the ones who haven't played the games, will have no idea what is going on. This is only partially the fault of the filmmakers, because the studio's handling of the movie attracted the wrong crowd. It got teenage guys taking their girlfriends to a scary movie on Friday nights, and by not screening it for critics in the US it got the grouchy, fairly unintellectual Saturday critics, who totally missed the point, or at least the good parts.<br/><br/>The studio's handling of it is worse than any element of the movie, except maybe the part where Radha Mitchell (who is pretty terrific, if slightly awkward due to accent change) and Laurie Holden (who plays the cop who wears sunglasses 24 hours a day and who every critic thinks is a lesbian because she wears tight pants and has short hair) are walking down the street: Laurie Holden:They used to say this town was haunted. Radha Mitchell:It looks like they were right.<br/><br/>Except for that part, the studio's handling of it is much, much worse than the worst parts of this movie.<br/><br/>I dearly hope that Silent Hill is successful enough for a sequel to be produced, because although it's definitely a love-it-or-hate-it affair (sometimes both at the same time), if Gans and company realized the mistakes they made the first time, the Silent Hill universe still holds bountiful possibilities."

","In the Silent Hill video games, Pyarmid Head was placed in SH2, and for good reason! He was meant to represent an executioner, punishing the lead character for his sins. Placing him in this movie added to the horror, but his significance was lost. SH is video gaming as art, this movie made it cheap. However, main reason for bad reviews was probably the attempt to squeeze storyline into 2.5 hours. Long plot worked as a video game, because one plays at leisure. Made movie frustrating to non fans of the series, and did not attract any new ones. Sinful! The characters of Dahlia and Cybil to cop were made cheesy because of terrible acting. Yet, one thing they managed to do half-right were the visuals. Monsters are genuinely scary sights to behold. Overall though, the transition from game to movie was bad.

I thought the trailer looked cheap and cheesy, but a lot of them do these days, even for great movies, so I didn't pay any heed. I should have, the movie was just like the trailer, cept for a few cool parts. The biggest problems for me were: Awful dialog, badly acted by annoying, shallow cardboard characters that I knew nothing about, and therefore cared nothing about. I can't believe Roger Avary wrote this.... And the plot, or at least the resolution of it, was just stupid and convoluted. It seemed like they needed an excuse for all the weirdness that had gone on, so they threw something really ridiculous together in the last 20 minutes. It didn't unfold naturally or believably (at least, as believable as a situation like this can). I know, they got some of this stuff from the games, but I haven't played the games, and I shouldn't have to to enjoy this. If anything, this seemed too much like one of these types of games; aimless wandering from scene to scene, finding clues, unrealistic ""conversations"" with random characters intended to advance you throughout the game.<br/><br/>I thought this was going to be creepy and gory, but there was about 20 total minutes out of 2 hours that I'd call that. Maybe if all the backgrounds and gore hadn't been badly computer animated, and if there hadn't been 2 minutes of cool and creepy then 20 minutes of walking around, i would have liked it more. I'm really getting tired of the cgi gore in horror films, it's not necessary, and not once has it made a movie better for me, usually the opposite. Doesn't seem to cost less either..... bring back the latex and corn syrup with red#40..... this movie was just more lame, fake, shiny Hollywood crap.....

The worst offender is the long scene where the heroine - and the audience - literally have the entire backstory explained to them in voice-over, and it *still* doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the three 'worlds' of Silent Hill - the damp, sunlit abandoned real town, the fog and ash-shrouded ghost town and the rotting, industrial 'dark' nightmare version - are all superbly shot, and the film's use of sound effects to establish a sense of dread is exceptional. Each time the siren sounds it gets more chilling (even if some of the CGI monsters it heralds are a bit fake-looking).<br/><br/>The problem is, none of the good points outweigh the fact that the story is completely incomprehensible.

It is very difficult to get it right when it comes to Game Movies, simply because most of us spend days or weeks on these games, desperately trying to figure out the next step and probably being petrified in the process, whilst a movie is only a couple of hours long which significantly reduces its chances of trapping us on a personal level. But you know what.. this film achieved what I suspected was unachievable! It uses an amazing amount of the original aspects of the game which got our hearts pumping in the first place, and actually manages to mimic the journey almost step by step.

The ending is surprising and the characters are well plotted out (except for the husband, but thats IMO). <br/><br/>If you're looking for a pulse raising horror film where random objects, from rats to humans jump out at you in dramatic musical climaxes, this is not the film for you.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action and mystery to go around, and later a feeling of compliance. The cinematography definitely stood out as unique as well, it is noticeable that the effect was not intended for gut-wrenching terror but for thoughtful contemplation in many scenes where you would expect otherwise.<br/><br/>My only complaint is the child actress, her lines were too ham-fisted if you will and the audio editing seemed absent from her dialog, as if they added it raw in post-production, so it took me out of the context of the film and placed me right in a studio standing next to her, listening to what appeared to be a raw sample. <br/><br/>Overall though, that didn't weight down the enjoyment I got from this viewing, I came away not in awe but in pleasant surprise and for that I give this film at 10."
"Mountagon","9","1","3","12 May 2006"," Very great Movie in the end... but not for everyone.
","I've just seen Silent Hill in Germany yesterday and i have to admit that it's one great Movie. As a lot of people said before me it's the best Game Adaption up to now.<br/><br/>However the Film is not for everyone and i can understand why the opinions here are so much splitted about this Film. If u are not familiar with silent hill and u don't know the essence of the Games there are just 2 ways for you. <br/><br/>1: You'll just enjoy the Movie as much as i did and a lot of others. 2: You'll just think that movie is a bunch of crap.<br/><br/>That is because it is just so close at the game and if u don't know anything about it this movie just wont make any sense to you. Thats the reason why a lot of people are thinking its so bad. As i said you may enjoy it even in that case. But the Movie is made for the gamers and not for a major audience and that is what it makes so great. This movie shows you a very good idea of Hell. And that is the what it should. Some things are just unanswered. for example why all these things suddenly happen but in the Game u don't get an explanation for it either. It just is how it is. and when u can accept that u'll enjoy it i guess.<br/><br/>Just one more thing. this movie is partly very brutal in a sick way. So u have to be able to deal with violence in a very creative way ;) However that is how it should be. You have to think about the idea of hell. It's not a place where u can choose your torments. It's a place where u get that what is the most horrible thing for u personally and that is what's partly shown there. Another Reason why a lot of people think this movie is crap but at the end Silent Hill should be exactly like that... that is why i enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>Why i didn't gave this movie ten points what it actually deserves is... it is not very creepy. the game works with fear and is scaring u like hell. The Movie doesn't at least not very much. nevertheless it is great.<br/><br/>Finishing words are. Very great movie for the people who like that.<br/><br/>So if u are a die hard fan of the game and the idea of Silent hill like i am. Go see it. You'll love it like i did.<br/><br/>If u don't know the game at all... Think about it. You may love it as well if u like twisted pictures and a very sick idea of a world between reality and the depths of hell. If u don't i recommend u seeing another movie. maybe it's more worth of ur money.<br/><br/>A Film For Gamers! I've been waiting so long for something like that and i'm not disappointed at all."

","Save yourself the $ and wait out the DVD. It's right around the corner of time. This movie had it's moments and I won't rip it to pieces. Apparently there is a pretty large following, mainly video game folks. The movie is just too damn long in parts and boring, not to mention some really dull acting. However, some of the visuals are very cool!!! The sound effects as well which is the only reason I would recommend this at the movies. The sound of the siren on the church was very eerie to me, I loved it!!!! There are some creepy parts. I'm glad for those of u who found it to be enjoyable also found it to stick close to it's premise. I just could not stay interested. In fact, I caught myself dosing off towards the end until the final conclusion. This movie was kind of like HELLRAISER meets a TOOL video/concert.<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS; WARNING; SPOILERS One part I did not understand, when officer Bennett finally caught up with the hero and cuffed her a very creepy mutant came out of the junk yard. The officer shot it. I think it was the only mutant seen in the daylight before the darkness fell, besides some others of his kind on the nearby hillside. Why? I mean why were they day walkers. It was the one thing in the movie that has followed in the footsteps of the who dun it murder mystery spiritual guess the surprise ending genre that's been going on since the Sixth Sense that confused me. WTF!?!?!? I'm sick of of it, gimme Kane and an ax slinging maniac and See no Evil!!!!!!!!! Want an original keep ya guessing horror/thriller/suspense?

"pmNiko","10","1","3","10 May 2006"," What I heard and What I know
","I heard many comments about the movie and to be honest, people simply are very close-minded these days. Lets begin from the most important part: The story... The movie is based on a game and the SH Movie Team did not want to make something completely irrelevant to the game, quote: ""We were not aiming to create a Resident Evil about women who act like men, thats action"" (not really a quote i just took the words but they are moved around, the quote is in flash so can't copy-paste). Instead they made a movie based on the stories in the game. Many fans were outraged that Harry was replaces by Rose, a girl, well film makers commented he acted like a woman, in the game it's nice to see an emotional character, but in movies it doesn't work that way... The story was though to be Confusing to many... let's say the SH series are LONG games... a lot of background info there... get use to complicated movies, Holiwood movies with barely 1 idea aren't the only ones there.<br/><br/>2nd thing: Acting... Yes there was 1 bad thing about the whole acting... the Cop's (Cybil's) dialog was an attempt to make the movie with a catchy semi-funny line... lets say game style... And that was in 1 place... this caused a LOT of criticism, as critics started basically leeching of 1 phrase, making the whole movie bad. I don't think many noticed Jodelle Ferland in there with her monologue, that kid does not have a choreographer or actor guide/adviser... ALl the movements came from her head, the director was amazed at this, so I wouldn't think it's something normal at age 11... She played 3 different characters, if you don't like it I personally BAH you, and call you a toaster face.<br/><br/>Religions critics: now here I googled the topic and sat there laughing at how amazingly ignorant people can me, best example being something like this: ""I showed this movie to my daughter's because I saw a little girl in the trailer... The hardest part was explaining that Christabella character was a fake Christian, because no Christian would EVER do SUCH bad things..."" For this I advise the person who wrote this, to google: Witch Hunters, Pope authorizations to burn people, crusades, or simply: inquisition... Or in Silent Hill case: Cult... (not only Arabs burn and torture people you know...)<br/><br/>Special effects: People didn't like the Fog/Rust world effect, too easy for Holiwood? The game was made like that, the movie (once again) is based on the game... But I agree on 1 thing here, it's suppose to ""snowing"" ash if you want to make it perfect to be honest... Monsters were actually real people in costumes, all of them dancers, so they can ""twist"" quite a bit, no computer graphics is considered bad now? My reply: The monsters are suppose to be some kind of people, deformed most of them... not doom like aliens.<br/><br/>Gamer's response: Being a gamer for a long time, I will tell my opinion first here: The monsters are all imaginary Silent Hill generated personal demons from the second game, putting Pyramid Head there has confused some, but remember, the story was a little changed... He can be representing something else here... Over all people were happy with it as far as loyalty counts (from what I heard best game adoption EVER)...<br/><br/>I give it a maximum grade (never gave this before), because this is my perfect movie. I think even if there was a sequel and the movie was just as good, the actors would have to be changed... and there ain't nothing like Jodelle Ferland as far as angel/demon roles count..."
"charlotterandle7","9","1","3","10 May 2006"," possibly the best horror movie I've ever seen...
","having never played any of the Silent Hill games i went into the theatre completely unaware of any kind of background story unlike all my male friends who had kind of pre-warned me that it might be a bit gross. so on my first night in new york city i thought it would be a great idea to go scare the living daylights out of myself. it was great! OK i thought, I'm a big girl i can take blood and guts. but i was amazed at just how much is used, especially in the ending scene where the policewoman is burnt alive and the young girl, i forget her name, rises in the church to kill the residents etc... anyhow i loved this film so much i couldn't stop talking about it to my friends who hadn't seen it. the camera work is so edgy and eerie and the grain in the visuals make it just as disturbing as the creatures in it. the acting, apart from a few, is on top form and i loved the set, make-up and visuals. The background story is also very interesting, could kind of see a lot of it coming but nevertheless i loved every second of it. This was actually the first film, i can honestly say, that has seriously scared me unlike the slasher flicks being churned out at such a quick pace you hardly get time to go home from the cinema for watching them. so please please please go see this film. even if you haven't seen played the games or even know anything about the background of it, then I'm sure you will love it like i did. cant wait to get it on DVD. this film has set a very high standard for horrors movies that will follow. only thing I'm not looking forward to is a poor imitation of it next year when some lame director decides to copy the style and gore....."
"boisemagic","2","1","3","10 May 2006"," A Letdown - And somewhat disgusting
","Let me preface this by saying I was unaware until the day I saw the movie that it was based on a VG, so, of course, I've never played any of the games. I was expecting, based on what little I saw of previews, to see a psychological horror movie, so my expectations were way different than those who are fans of the game.<br/><br/>Honestly, I thought the back story was somewhat interesting (and wrong on so many levels), but the violence too gratuitous. I am a big fan of horror movies, but was somewhat disgusted by this one. Some of the scenery shots were amazing and parts were definitely chilling, but, in my opinion, a fair majority of the movie was just sick. I alternated between having chills (with the air raid siren), to utter confusion, to just being grossed out. I'm actually glad I saw it in the theater because this way the movie won't ever enter my home."
"klklein","5","1","3","9 May 2006"," Don't Waste Your Time
","This movie tried to pretend it had an interesting plot, but really was just an excuse for gory scenes and shock factor. The plot was lame, the acting was okay, and the effects were mediocre. Some of the scenes walking through Silent Hill look ridiculously fake. The plot was so thin that it has been only 3 days since I saw this in the theatre, and I am already forgetting most of what happened during the course of this movie. I have played through all 4 Silent Hill video games, and got spooked at least a time or two. There isn't a hint of scare in this movie, which when combined with a weak plot makes this movie rather boring. I literally found myself checking my watch numerous times - this movie seemed to never end. I didn't hate this movie, but it wasn't good either. Save your money and rent this when it hits the shelves!"
"JKristine35","10","1","3","8 May 2006"," Psychologically disturbing, but that's what the film was aiming for
","After seeing Silent Hill for the second time now, I am still surprised that some people don't get the plot. Ummm, did you go to the theatre with your ears plugged and your eyes closed? Seriously, it's not that hard to get. And the people that call the plot 'silly' because that would NEVER happen seriously need to take History 101. Ever heard of the Salem Witch Trials? That alone just being the biggest example of witch trials, there are PLENTY more where that came from. I think the director is trying to prove a point that religious fanaticism can cause more harm than good, as we have seen before. The film is a horror lover's dream up until we start learning about the plot, in which case, it becomes the most disturbing film I have EVER seen. I really don't understand how people can not be drawn in by a little girl getting burned alive, or the plight of her mother who made the worst decision ever. The visual effects throughout the film are creepy and the town and the monsters have the perfect look to them. Silent Hill is a dark place that reeks of evil, and Gans shows that very well. The end of the movie turned my stomach. It was almost like they wanted to make up for the lack of blood throughout the rest of the film. If there is one scene that I can call the most disgusting scene I have ever seen in a film, it's the church scene. Talk about gross. When you walk out of the theatre, you will feel the need to run home and bathe, then go to church and pray fervently. Honestly. This movie is that disturbing. It's sad that our society is so desensitized to stuff like this that they're able to laugh through the darkest parts of this film. Truly a great movie. It aims to mess you up, and it does that... very well."
"AndyVanScoyoc","2","1","3","8 May 2006"," A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY ***Contains Spoilers***
","I saw this movie a few weeks ago and just now have been able to sit down and write a review that sounds intelligent, instead of writing from my gut. As it is, this review is still totally out of my league as I have to keep fighting the urge to say ""This movie sucked!"" But being as I don't write reviews like that, I will do the best I can to be objective and give the facts as they appear to me.<br/><br/>The story starts out with Rose Da Silva (Radha Mitchell) taking her daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the abandoned town of Silent Hill after the little girl continuously has nightmares and tries to ""go home"" which would amount to her killing herself if she were able to make it ""home"" in her dreams.<br/><br/>On the way to the town a little girl runs into the path of the Da Silva's car resulting in an accident. Of course when Rose wakes up, Sharon is gone. She goes to the town of Silent Hill where everything is an eerie gray.<br/><br/>She begins looking for her daughter only to find the locals (if you can call screaming children burned to a crisp) ""locals,"" inhospitable.<br/><br/>On the way out of town Rose finds a strange woman Dahlia Gillespie (played with tragic realism by Deborah Kara Unger, the only good performance in the entire movie) whom she tries to talk to, but the woman's ramblings are not only macabre, but frightening. Rose tries to leave town only to find that she is trapped.<br/><br/>It is when she goes back to her car that she finds officer Bennett, none too happy to see her (after chasing her over the bridge and wrecking her motorcycle) and Rose is arrested. However, upon trying to leave the town, both women find they are trapped and more of the locals show upthis time in the form of creepy mannequins with no arms, which spew molten ash, disintegrating anything it touches.<br/><br/>From this point on out I was totally lost.<br/><br/>I have been told that like the game, the movie isn't supposed to make much sense. I don't play video games and had no idea of this. Wish I had known before I wasted my money. When I left the theatre I had just as many questions as when I went inand that is never a good thing. The haphazard way they attempted to tie everything together did nothing to help the plot or in any way add to the story line. It simply made it more confusing and difficult to follow.<br/><br/>There is great debate as to whether or not Rose and Cybil die or if they are in a parallel universe/Silent Hill. Go to any movie message board and see so called experts claiming they have the correct answer and everyone else is wrong.<br/><br/>Does this add to the confusion? Yes. What a waste of money. If a movie is not going to make total sense by the time I am done watching it, I wish they'd let me know so I could avoid wasting my money on it.<br/><br/>This movie is one better left alone until it gets to your local dollar theatreif you have one, because I would not even spend the price of a rental on it."

","That's not to say that I didn't think that this was an incredible movie. I have not been so terrified in years. I was literally watching with my fingers over my eyes! I'm a 29 year old dude that usually laughs at most of these types of movies. I had no idea that Silent Hill was a video game until after the movie. It didn't matter. The special effects were gnarly and the sound was right on.<br/><br/>In fact the only reason i'm on this site is because I was searching for answers to the movie. I never do that.

"zomboscloset","5","1","3","8 May 2006"," Zombos Closet Review: Great Visuals, poor acting, lame dialog
","To begin with, I must give kudos to the art direction for this film. It is a wonderful creaturefest of make-up, CGI and costuming that is quite a treat indeed. The creatures are nightmarish and the coloration of the film, when the mom goes deeper into the cursed town--especially when the siren blares as a warning that the town is going 'into the darkness'--is superb, and evokes a truly horrific mood; those embers that glow on the damned creatures' bodies, and the falling ash and pall over the town--again, quite well done.<br/><br/>The dialog needed much more work, however, as most of the lines were poorly written. The acting also needed more verve, especially the climactic Barker-esquire Hellraiser- styled confrontation in the church between the mom and the evil religious cult. She manages to easily walk through a congregation of crazed, girl-roasting individuals with amazing ease. And the black leather uniform on the female motorcycle police officer. Really! You couldn't get it much tighter. How DOES she get on the motorcycle dressed in those tight pants? Weak acting here, too.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, the plot.<br/><br/>Alessa, the poor girl born out of wed-lock that is roasted like a turkey by the evil religious cult, while her mom stands by helplessly, takes revenge on the titular town of Silent Hill. ThoughI am not sure if this occurred before the fires broke out in the mines, or afterwards. I am also not sure how the witch burning thirty years beforehand fits into the events with Alessa.<br/><br/>Anyway, from her hospital bed, the badly scarred and immobile Alessa, either through sheer malevolent will power, or by the assistance of a hellish demon (hey, maybe it's the witches familiar?) destroys the town and it's citizens, forcing their dead spirits to 'live' in a nightmare world that puts Dante's Inferno to shame. The undead citizens of the town must endure not only the hellish Limbo they have been caught in, but also must avoid the Darkness that brings Pyramid Head (see the game) and his agonies (give or take a few) to torture them.<br/><br/>Alessa, for some reason sends off a good version of herself as a baby, now known as Sharon, then summons it back to the town after nine years. Sharon sleep walks and blurts out Silent Hill in her sleep, so her mom, casting prudence to the wind, takes her to Silent Hill. Yes, that Silent Hill, the one with all the well-known evil cursed stuff attached to it. A place so bad, Sharon's father reads about it on the web at a famous ghosttowns.com site. This is the ABANDONED place that has had toxic fires burning beneath it for years, so much so that ash continually falls from the sky. So her mom takes her there at NIGHT, hoping to find out why her daughter keeps sleep walking and saying ""Silent Hill."" Along the way, they are almost stopped by a female motorcycle police officer who dresses in impossibly tight leather motorcycle garb, but her mom makes a frantic attempt to head straight into the unknown at the last minute.<br/><br/>Reaching Silent Hill, her mom also promptly manages to crash the car in a convenient plot-ism to keep the story rolling. She wakes up, sees that her daughter Sharon is missing, and heads into the town. The police officer eventually makes her way to the town, too, even after crashing her motorcycle on the roadway (probably couldn't reach the brake because of those tight pants).<br/><br/>As far as I can gather, Sharon, her mom and the police officer are actually dead, but they do not realize it. They died in their respective vehicular crashes. This is the only way I can explain why they can be affected by the creatures and hellish darkness of Silent Hill, while her husband and the others searching for them walk through the town unaffected and unaware.<br/><br/>Alessa has Sharon's mom go through quite a few trials and tribulations to find her (Alessa, that is), and uses her to bring the darkness into the church, where the dead cult members retreated, when the siren blared, to escape it. Much gore ensues as the evil Alessa gloats over her prey and tears them apart in a scene of CGI butchery that Pinhead would be proud of. Sharon and mom survive all this, thoughwink, winkthe evil Alessa (or demon) now lives inside Sharon. Mom and daughter walk back to the car, buckle themselves in for safety, and head home.<br/><br/>Of course, there is the confusing sequelization-antic, where the husband is home while mom and daughter return home, and the scene shifts between the husband in the nice sun-lit home, and the mom in the dark ominous- looking home, with Alessa/Sharon/Demon looking ominously in the background. With mom and daughter being dead and all that, how exactly does Alessa benefit from taking over Sharon's dead body? And I still do not know why the witch was burned or why the fires started in the mines."
"Cuttothechase_75","Null","1","3","7 May 2006"," Silent Turd-spoilers
","*Spoilers*<br/><br/>The only reason I give this film one star is for production value, and for the good acting efforts from everyone who played the Silent Hill religious fanatics. All the other actors were abysmal. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this-- I was a bit wary because it was based on a video game, but hey, I'm an eternal optimist. Sadly, it was a total piece of garbage and can best be summed up by the following equation:<br/><br/>Bad Writing + Bad Directing + Bad Acting = Two hours of Silent Crap. <br/><br/>The acting was literally painful to watch, the story made zero sense until about halfway through the film, and the subplot of the father was just boring and unnecessary. How did a wonderful actor like Sean Bean end up in this stinker? Did he need the money that badly?<br/><br/>I know I keep banging on about the acting, and normally I'm pretty forgiving of actors. But it's like the casting director had his eyes shut or something during auditions-- the mother is AWFUL, the kid stinks except for that one excerpt they showed on Conan, when she plays evil Alyssa, and the cop's performance is just goofy. I think Laurie Holden, the actress playing the cop, tried her best, but she couldn't do much with such shite dialogue-- seriously, it's really that bad. <br/><br/>It's not like the actors ever have a chance though-- the writing and directing fails them completely. The script is so out-of-touch that it lost both me and my friend in the first five minutes, and we have completely different taste in films. But you just don't care about the characters, or the choices they make. As mom and kid are speeding along to Silent Hill in only the first five minutes, you're like, BFD-- who cares? <br/><br/>The film is also full of could-be-cool-but-just-aren't moments, which build you up with hope then fall completely flat, for example, the mutated humanoid figures gimping around all over the place-- okay, fine, after the fourth time, you've seen it, it doesn't make any sense, and you just don't care. When that silly thing came out of the bathroom stall, I was already yawning coz 1) I didn't care if the mom bought the farm and 2) it was predictable and hackneyed. Notice the trend with not caring? And trust me, I tried. <br/><br/>That whole scene with the scarabs is lifted right out of the mummy-- and the scene with the zombie demon nurses wants to be cool, but you just keep expecting them to break out into a Janet Jackson-style Rhythm Nation dance. See it and you'll see what I mean-- their body language makes them look like refugees from a bad but slick-looking remake of Thriller. <br/><br/>So there's really not much to redeem this crummy film. I went to see it coz the previews made it look interesting-- but it's just another case of the marketing dept. being the most talented, them and the VFX and title sequence guys. Even post-production magic can't polish this turd-- the movie is laughable, logic-free, and not even remotely good enough to enjoy status as a guilty pleasure."

","All right gamers out there. Before you start attacking me en masse like the obvious cgi bugs in the movie, let me say that I come at this as both a gamer and a critic.<br/><br/>It's not that the writing was bad. It was, in some parts. (I mean please, check this little delight of an exchange: ""They used to say this place was haunted"" ""I think they were right"". Please. That is no good. No good at all). And it's not that the acting was bad (though, yet again, it was a little laughable in some parts). I didn't even mind that most of the cgi was more video game and less motion picture (except the creatures (but the bugs were bad)). I know exactly what this movie lacked. Tension. Many of the things that should have been scary were just interesting instead because of the lack of tension in most all the scenes. The nurse crying blood, the weird nurses, the two blade guy, the barb wire guy, these things should have been scary. But I brushed them off and waited for the next thing. All the darkness scenes should have been scary, but instead they were just fun to look at. A bad directorial and editing mistake. Otherwise...rent it."

Go and see this film, and prepare to be amazed!!"
"Denden667","7","1","3","7 May 2006"," Everything a fan or horror fanatic could wish for!
","The guy who directed it, hasn't lied about his devotion to the games. Everything he put in the movie, will be recognisable for silent Hill-fans in one way or another. Of course changes have been made, of course it still shows its video game roots now and then, in the negative sense of the word. But when it all comes down to it, this movie will be at the very least enjoyable for Silent Hill-fans and horror fans who are unfamiliar with the source material.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Silent Hill is the very first game-movie done right. There have been quite a few game-movies over the years, but they never ascended beyond the level of ""fairly amusing"", and I think that none of them stayed to true enough to the source material, while they should have. Christophe Gans, the director of this movie, stayed true to the source material in almost every way, and yet he also knew how to alter it just enough to make it interesting for a good horror movie.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the Silnet Hill-games has always been the most important thing to me, you really felt alone most of the time and creeped out by what this ghost town had to offer. The movie provides the same experience, because the town has been recreated for the movie, based on the looks of the games. That's marvelous. The same fog is there, the darkness, the nightmare world. It's all there, even the sirens. I loved it.<br/><br/>And then there are the monsters. thankfully, it wasn't all CGI, puppetry was also used and humans in suits. It worked incredibly well, but the CGI too looks amazing. I didn't know whether I should cheer or scream when a familiar Silent Hill-creature showed up. It was great to see them without having to worry about them coming after me, but on the other hand they were every bit as scary as they were in the game. Except Pyramid Head, he was every bit as AWESOME as he was in Silent Hill 2. You see? You CAN have an iconic game villain in a movie without having him looks stupid(looks at Nemesis in RE: Apocalypse). I was very satisfied with the appearance of the SH-creatures in this film. They didn't always act like they were ""supposed"" to act, but it was all for the good of the movie.<br/><br/>I read a lot of criticism about the acting in this movie. Well, I've seen much worse in other horror movies, I can tell you that. the main character was good in her desperate search for her daughter, she really reminded me of poor Harry Mason in the original SH-game. And then there was Cybil, also from the original game. The woman who played her was pretty good, she was as tough as I had expected Sybil to be. the girl who played a demon and the daughter of the main character, wasn't too bad at all. She received the most criticism, but I think she's quite good. There was one line that made me cringe at the beginning, but that was it. Especially as a demon kid I liked her acting. Sean Bean was a pretty worthless addition to the story, but at the very end of the movie, you'll see why he had to be in the movie. I won't spoil the ending. You may like it or you may hate it, but I loved it as heck. It was a perfect Silent Hill-ending.<br/><br/>Now for the worst part of the movie, and that is sadly the story and the dialogue. I have to agree with others I've seen making comments on this movie, that the movie clearly shows its gaming roots. Sometimes a character would say something so damn obvious, that it felt like some B-movie. As a whole, this movie is definitely no B-movie. Also the times that characters seemed to know exactly where they had to look for clues, was very much like the game. Coincidences happen more than once in this movie, it all look very linear like the games. The character are 'driven' by an unknown force towards the ending, that is very clear. Gans did exaggerate the coincidental nature of the games in this movie. Changing the purpose the mysterious clan from the original Silent Hill-game wasn't really a good change for me. Until the finale came up, and I realized it was perfect after all.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to make comments on the sounds and the music. From the very beginning I was creeped out by the terrible sounds that the monsters make, and the terrible sounds of the nightmare world. There is a good use of the source material's music in this movie, not ever out of place like so many people say. I didn't think that Gans went too far in this case. Sure, the games were silent a lot of times, but that's no reason to make it like that in the movie. Gans put a lot of music from the games in the movie, and it doesn't feel like fan-service only. the music fits, and it's awesome music at that.<br/><br/>Final Judgement: Gans did a wonderful job on creating the typical Silent Hill atmosphere in a two-hour movie. The images, the creatures, the sounds and the town in both of its versions are in there, and they couldn't have been better. the acting is very decent, unlike what some would want you to believe. The dialogue isn't too good, but the same goes for the games very often. That's no excuse for the movie of course. The story and its changes to the original game's story bothered me at first, but it all fit in at the end. This movie is the perfect fan service, a wonderful movie for the true horror fan and the best game-movie ever."
"daneb234","4","1","3","6 May 2006"," Very Boring
","The only way I could actually see anyone going to see this movie is if they actually enjoyed playing the video games...and even then they will be severely disappointed with the outcome. <br/><br/>Silent Hill is a dull, and very vague, attempt at a sci-fi movie...there are no mind blowing special effects nor are there any truly ""bone chilling"" moments. Upon seeing the trailer, I thought that maybe, just maybe, Silent Hill may have a chance to eclipse the quality of the video games and even perhaps be among the top sci-fi movies to date...boy was i wrong...<br/><br/>The movie is soooooo slooooow...nothing scary or thrilling happens for the first 25-35 min...and even then...i was like ""wtf"". The acting is basically the only major upside to this dull film...the setting of the movie seems to be way too vast and vague to even be considered scary....again there are some cool parts in the movie, but I believe that this movie is severely disappointing for all those die hard silent hill fans. <br/><br/>Positives: good acting, some cool special effects, nice boss (huge guy with sword)<br/><br/>Negatives: no action within the first 25-35 min, special effects are not as ""special"" or ""mind blowing"" as they could have or should have been, and the ending of the movie was really retarded"
"lynnclare5","9","1","3","6 May 2006"," Silent Hill review
","This is an epic of a film. its beats any other game/film movies and any Recent normal horror movies by miles. What makes this so special is the fact they keep an eerie mood to the whole show. I would say you don't need to have played the games to enjoy the movie but it will definitely make you enjoy it more if you have. Monster and music have been taken from the game and of course the town itself. Everything about this film mirrors the game perfectly from the main actress running through the town, the mist, the torch light, the sounds, the movement of monsters even the walls. The ending leaves a lot to the imagination which is like the games, but if you look at the clues throughout the movie then you may understand the ending. Now if you are players of the game then you will notice one problem with the police woman (cybil) i wont type it here because it will be a spoiler. so in total, i extremely! recommend watching this movie. I've seen some ""proffesional"" critics oppions and they totally have no idea what there on about, i mean they give the most terrible movies the best reviews. so if your into horror movies / extreme gore / imaginative story line and of course silent hills totally originality then this is the movie for you."

","As the film opens, young Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland) is in the grip of a bad dream that has taken her out of her house and to the edge of a cliff. Nightmares and sleepwalking have become a regular part of her nightly regimen, and her parents differ about what should be done. Christopher (Sean Bean), the practical one, believes that medicine and time in a hospital will cure Sharon. His wife, Rose (Radha Mitchell), disagrees. She decides to take Sharon to visit the mysterious locale in which her nightmares take place - the abandoned town of Silent Hill, which sits atop a mine that has been on fire for three decades.<br/><br/>Rose and Sharon's arrival in Silent Hill is brutal. They are involved in an automobile accident when Rose swerves to avoid a girl who dashes into the road. When Rose recovers consciousness, her daughter is gone. Rose tries to phone Christopher, but her cell phone won't function properly. Accompanied by Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden), a police officer who pursued her into Silent Hill, Rose sets off in search of Sharon. At its best, the town is an eerie place - a crumbling relic with the sun hidden by a fog created by falling ash. At its worst, during periods of inexplicable blackness, it becomes hell on earth, with demonic beings and zombies rising up from the ground.<br/><br/>I have never played the game Silent Hill, but that didn't stop me from appreciating some of what director Christophe Gans (who displayed a similar visual flair in Brotherhood of the Wolf) puts on the screen - although I suspect aficionados will have a better grasp of what is transpiring. Silent Hill looks great. The town is suitably eerie and the periods of darkness are ominous. The movie is all about visual appeal, feel, and tone, because the story underwhelms. The plot concerns Rose tracking down Sharon, going from place to place and following clues until she discovers the truth about her daughter and Silent Hill's dark past. Meanwhile, Sean Bean is wasted as Christopher. His subplot could have been excised. All he does is wander around, mostly in the rain, learning the town's history and trying to find out the fate of his wife and daughter. One expects a payoff from his activities, but there isn't one."

","When I went to see this movie I was expecting a lot and turned out I was completely wrong. Before I say why this movie is so bad, yes I've played the video game and also I'm one of those people that get scared very easily by movies and I sat there the whole movie without being the tiniest bit scared.<br/><br/>Like one person said they did do some changes but they weren't huge ones which is what makes the video game remakes terrible. Who would rather sit and watch a movie or go play the exact same thing as a video game, or for the people who play video games a lot who wants to see what the exact same thing they've been playing for the last week or so. All the video game remakes need to try and change the movie so you aren't seeing what you've been playing because that's just plain boring. One movie that tried to change it from the game(but failed miserably) was Doom. Anyone who's played those games would agree the movie is a lot different then the game but most likely would've been worse if they just copied exactly from the game.<br/><br/>Now going back to Silent Hill, it was just terrible. It could've been semi scary if they didn't show the only things that could've possibly been scary in the trailer. Also the acting wasn't that great. The only one who does good acting is Radha Mitchell. I would avoid this movie if you can especially if you haven't played the game and expect this to be a non stop action horror movie(like some of the people I went with)."

","I hate games to movies crossovers. They are rubbish. Really really bad...... with very very few exceptions.<br/><br/>This is one of the exceptions. It scared the pants off of me just like the game did. In fact the reason I liked this so much is that it is a natural progression from the film. It took the best bits from the game and brought them to life. In such a CGI laden film the actors did a great job and the pace was magnificent. Not too much back story in one go...a nice toeing and froing of exposition and action at just the right times.<br/><br/>As for the supposed ""weak"" ending...it isn't. It leaves everything open very nicely for a sequel. Can't wait for Sean's trip into the hell of Silent Hill."
"daztuk","8","1","3","5 May 2006"," Silent Hill ... What A Great Movie!
","Being a loyal fan of the Computer Games I found this Film very close on storyline and atmosphere to them all with elements of each of them in it. I wouldn't say this way the scariest film around but as with the games there are some really Freaky and very Disturbing things going on around the characters that makes you say 'What the Hell!' on a regular basis. Another good point on the film is the duration of it. Its lasts a fair while but it's only really the beginning where it becomes tedious. Throughout most of the Movie it really keeps you interested and guessing about whats coming next! Overall, Great Horror Movie to watch and there's extra satisfaction for its Computer Game following."
"Mee_Malfoy","10","1","3","4 May 2006"," So true to its roots
","Resident Evil 1 completely disappointed. It was so bad I think the dead really did rise from the dead, and Bloodrayne almost actually made blood rain. By now I was expecting for SH to be a big screw up no matter how cool the trailers looked. But when the movie started and that familiar song came to my ears, it was the music of angels. I have never seen a game adaptation so true to its roots. The music is taken from the games, monsters, characters, and most of the story! Even the ending was something to be expected from the world of Silent Hill! Anyone who is a fan of SH won't be disappointed with this one. It brings back the pleasant, or should I say, disturbing memories that makes us stay in Silent Hill forever."
"sneb84","3","1","3","3 May 2006"," Looks good, tastes like crap.
","I went to see Silent Hill because a few of my friends from work were going and asked me to come. I had seen the trailer and some of the scenes looked pretty interesting. I should have just watched the trailer.<br/><br/>The movie starts off decently with a young girl sleepwalking and murmuring something about silent hill. This is a plausible start to any good horror movie. However from then on it takes a most implausible turn. The mother of this child (Sharon) decided that taking this kid to the town may be a good idea. Once she gets to the town she gets confronted by a police officer and for some reason unbeknownst to the viewer she decided to outrun the cop on an abandoned road into a ghost town. Now it may be just me but that seems like the most impractical thing anyone could ever do! And that's just the beginning of the movie! The rest of the movie is just as stupid and confusing. A lot of unanswered questions are uncovered and a lot of the scenes seem tacked on so that the plot, which is way to confusing, will make scene. Also a lot of the movie just feels kind of hokey. A lot of stereotypical horror movie stuff happens that could have maybe been mixed up a bit.<br/><br/>Lastly is the actual good in the movie. The one thing I found that made it worth watching was some of the visuals. The scenes when rose is in the darkness and the town takes on a creepy underworld like feel are interesting to watch and look really slick. Also the whole concept of the darkness falling ever hour or so preceded by the air-raid siren was an interesting plot device, but that is pretty much all there was. The only other good thing I can say about it is some of the music was very fitting for the movie."
"jancel_85","10","1","3","3 May 2006"," A movie like no other.
","I've never seen a thriller movie such as this. I just saw it yesterday. Well I was not afraid with all the scary creatures appearing there because I'm used to it. The cubicle scene scared me though so is the scary nurses blocking the way. This movie is The Grudge, The Village, The Ring all rolled into one. Well if you can see it that way. What I can't understand though is that the burning happened 30 years ago and then Sharon is like what 13 or 12 years old? Well all I can say is that the special effects are fantastic. Radha Mitchell is such a good actress.<br/><br/>You really have to see this movie if you want to see something different. Unlike other triller Silent Hill will make you jump from your seats from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>SOMETIMES YOU COULD BE WRONG WITH YOUR FAITH."
"mark-2584","7","1","3","3 May 2006"," Finally a conversion to talk about!
","I haven't read many of the other comments for this film so it's quite possible I am repeating others.<br/><br/>I cannot express how impressed I was with this film. After the Tomb Raider and Residnet Evil films I was quite fearful about even the thought of making this film. Hollywoods insistence in making films that will be a commercial success and not necessarily a good film is a real grind but gladly this did not happen here.<br/><br/>I will concede that playing and enjoying the games will help with the enjoyment and maybe understanding of this film but not essential. I took my girlfriend who had barely heard of a play station let alone the game Silent Hill and she got along with the film fine. The end needed a little explanation but that was all.<br/><br/>There are only two small complaints I have about this film.<br/><br/>First, a little on the long side. I am a firm believer that horror films should be short and blunt, the classic 90 minutes of fear.<br/><br/>Second, Sean Bean's accent really made me cringe. Granted I was never a fan of his back when he was working on British TV, but his forced Americanisms just made me want to put my boot in his mouth every time he opened it."
"sarahbailey21","3","1","3","3 May 2006"," Disappointing Overall
","OK as a fan of the computer game I was really looking forward to seeing this film and also slightly afraid of seeing it without having a pillow within easy reach to hide behind during any tense scary moments expected! <br/><br/>I was completely disappointed though. Main reasons:- the acting was bad, the monsters were not nearly as frightening as the game version, the sound affects were not used as effectively throughout, it was soooo long and drawn out! <br/><br/>OK so the acting... lets start with Sean Beans bad American accent who thought that it was a good idea to have him do this? <br/><br/>Radha Mitchell surprisingly bad (really loved her when she was in neighbours and Pitch Black) and if I had to hear her scream Sharon or Honey one more time my head would explode, this film would be great for drinking game although you would probably be unconscious with alcohol poisoning after the first 15 minutes. The character was mind numbingly stupid running backward and forwards throughout the town, screaming, dodging monsters, running away from the only person with a gun who is shooting the monsters, standing still when she should be running, Screaming Sharon and honey at every opportunity!!! <br/><br/>Jodelle Ferland was a bit sketchy at first but then I think she got much better the further into the film you got she really got into the whole I am evil part.<br/><br/>Laurie Holden I quite liked throughout the film but if I'd have been her I would have saved Radha Mitchells butt less and found me some way out without her! <br/><br/>Alice Krige, she does a good evil lady! I enjoyed her screaming, ""Burn the witch!"" at every given moment this was not annoying like ""Sharon, Sharon, Honey!"" but very amusing. I found myself using this phrase throughout the weekend! <br/><br/>OK now the Monsters... Not as scary as expected and I think I may have laughed out loud when the gyrating kinky nurses came on the scene, seriously they should have given them poles to dance around! And the characters seemed to do far too much running and not enough kicking ass! <br/><br/>Sound effects... The main scare factor in the game comes from the sound effects, this was not used to maximum effect. The whole static noises when the monsters are in close proximity but you don't know where, was actually made a point of but then completely abandoned...<br/><br/>Length of drawn out movie... I think I may have given birth two my first two children whilst waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>OK so there must be some good points... It does keep you quite tense through most of the film, Laurie Holden is enjoyable to look at, the kinky nurse monsters are hilarious with their disco beat moves, and it has some excellent sets.<br/><br/>I would not watch this film again but it's not as bad as date movie, why oh why would Alyson Hannigan do that to me it was like mental torture! <br/><br/>Perhaps would recommend viewing just to see the kinky nurse monsters..."
"amb102","4","1","3","2 May 2006"," I was disappointed
","I knew when we saw the preview for this film that it was going to leave a sour taste in my mouth, and the fact that my mouth was indeed sour afterward was the only thing that brought me satisfaction at the end of this film.<br/><br/>You know you have bad cast chemistry when the best played character is brought to you by a virtuously nameless child actor, and when pseudo-famous leading ladies cannot seem to deliver anything at all worth watching.<br/><br/>The (not so) special effects were ridiculous. I am not hard to scare and there was not one point in the movie that made me come even close to squirming in my seat. You know it's bad when the score is good and still cant make you hold your breath and clinch your seat.<br/><br/>There was one scene that was shot well, and it was only ten minutes out of two hours so it did not even remotely make up for the fact that the rest of the movie was a boring, contrived, drawn out disaster."
"jbel14","7","1","3","2 May 2006"," One of the most impressive and original horror productions in years
","While based on the video game (which I have played) this movie does enough to stand on its own in terms of presentation alone. There are some holes in the plot, but to be fair the game didn't make a lot of sense either. Players had to wait for Silent Hill 2 to have them answered. That's not to say that it leaves the viewer stranded. It gives more than enough information for the audience to draw their own conclusions, as is sometimes the case with supernatural-type movies. <br/><br/>The acting was done well; actually better than I expected, with only a couple of lines made cheesy with a tongue in cheek attempt at humor. I actually remember only one line that was delivered fairly badly (and many would probably know it when they hear it) but considering the character it's pretty trivial. Some may say it was too speech-y towards the end but considering the content, most of it was necessary and done so in a way that it merely gives you a little breather before the ""final confrontation"", so to speak. Radha Mitchell (Rose) delivers one of the most blood curdling screams I've ever heard in a movie. You'll know it when you hear it; it's that effective. <br/><br/>The impressive use of filming and sound to set the scenes are what really immerse you in the disturbing and unsettling world of Silent Hill. There is one shot in particular, in which an ambient but subtle use of bass as the camera slowly does an overhead pan of a drugstore sign, that makes you feel as though something could seriously be wrong with this town. This is definitely a movie to see on a big screen with Dobly 5.1 sound, as it pleases (and often disturbs) the senses, which both directly and indirectly adds to the suspense. The limited use of CGI blends well with real on-screen action and all the characters look incredible. <br/><br/>All in all the movie definitely succeeds in delivering a unique horror experience, which gives the audience enough closure to the main story while leaving room for a little imagination. I actually understood the video game better after watching the movie, so in that case alone, no you do not need to know about the game to understand the movie, as some critics might have falsely led you to believe. <br/><br/>One more thing, it's pretty violent in some parts, featuring some of the most innovative and detailed death scenes on film. However, it's done in such a way that it seems more stylish than grotesque (although there's bits of that too!). A truly beautiful albeit disturbing movie. <br/><br/>Individual ratings (10 pt scale):<br/><br/>Plot: 7 Acting: 7 Visuals: 10 Sound/music: 10 Entertainment factor: 10"

Also the actual ending was annoying and predictable.<br/><br/>However, the film was the best game to movie adaptation I have ever seen. I know that's not saying much, but trust me, it's worth seeing. What I like about Silent Hill is how f***ed up it is, and this film did it proud. It was really dark, and twisted and vile. All this worked in the film's favour.

The stakes are pretty high and I believe if Rose would have been terrified at what she saw I would have too. You know the eyes are the windows in which we get to see what she's seeing and experiencing , otherwise we see two different Films.

","My husband chose this movie as part of our ""date night"". It ended up working out well for him because I spent half the movie in his lap with my eyes closed. e-gad. Usually horror movies don't bother me. It's not the blood (heck, I'm in nursing school, I love to pick out the anatomical inaccuracies). What bothers me are the monsters that are grossly deformed and that lurch through dark hallways with eerie moaning. The monsters in this movie are highly disturbing--especially when a body who was previously tied up with barbed wired gets up, inverts his body and starts crawling around in unnatural positions. The visual effects are quite stunning. The scene where Rose is in the bathroom and everything starts ""peeling upwards"" is really cool.<br/><br/>What I can't figure out is the ending, which leads me to ask--and here is the spoiler-- was Rose dead the whole time? In the scene where she crashed her jeep we think she just hurt her head. She ends up running in a town where ash falls like snow and the original road that lead her in is broken off. When her husband arrives to look for her, the road is fine, sun is out and there's no ash. Then when she runs through the school hall, everything is blackened and dark, but her husband run through the same hallway that just looks old and deserted--then he ""senses"" her. I didn't think much of it at the time. Yet in the end when she goes home, everything is grayish. Then we see the husband in the house, and everything is a normal color. hhhmmmmm, did she die when she hit her head? It makes sense because the cop could also be dead--remember she crashed her bike. Part of the girl's revenge was ""killing"" those that burned her way back when, but because most everyone died in the city fire, those people were dead too. Part of ""killing"" them was destroying their ghost or soul, or whatever you want to call it. Hhhhmmmmm, what do you think?"
"Rendell","5","1","3","2 May 2006"," Good scare ruined by a laughable story.
","I went into this movie really wanting to like it, but was very disappointed. Granted there seems to be an inverse relationship between age and liking horror movies (notice the ratings vs. age) and 25 years ago I probably would have been on the edge of my seat and slept with the lights on, but I found ""Silent Hill"" far from creepy and more amusing than a horror movie.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem is that I was expecting something which while unbelievable could at least leave you feeling there was some base on reality, such as ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Ringu"", (the 1998 Japanese version of ""The Ring."" Instead it was like they were trying to explain the strange happenings in ""Silent Hill"" to make it believable but failed so badly that it just made it amusing. If they had left out the background and scenes in the real world and set the movie entirely in an alternate sort of fantasy world such as ""Resident Evil"" or ""Underworld"" I think it would have played out a lot better. With those movies they weren't supposed to be based in our world so you started the movies from scene one in a fantasy world and I found that much better than ""Silent Hill"" that wants to try and explain why all these creatures are out to kill our heroine, but instead just makes you laugh. Oh and speaking of our ""heroine"" if my daughter was having nightmares and my wife decided to drive off in the middle of the night to a ghost town with toxic ash falling I would sue for divorce and custody of my child once I found her."

","I walked into this movie expecting next to nothing- and I wasn't disappointed. It started out well, with lots of suspense, horror and emotion, but just didn't end the way it should have. The movie was too long and could easily have been cut down to a shorter time if a handful of unnecessary scenes had been deleted. The action was great and I loved all of the special effects, along with the plot. Radha Mitchell is wonderful, as always, and even though Sean Bean didn't quite pull off the American accent he played his part well. The ending ruined the entire movie for me. I hate artistic endings almost as much as I hate unclear endings, and this was both. If this movie had maintained the same slick pace it started off with, been about twenty minutes shorter, and had a more solid ending, I would have loved it. As it is I don't care to see it again, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for maybe as a rental later in the year."
"aharmas","8","1","3","1 May 2006"," Ambiguous and a Visual Treat
","Beware!!! Here is another film where we never know exactly what is going, and yet that is part of the fun here. The film's story might not be its strongest point because there is not a lot of originality here, but there are new approaches to the old theme of good vs evil, or is it stupidity vs. evil, or might it be just ""I don't know what I'm doing here vs. You have no idea of what's is going to happen to you here""... Whatever the case might be, the atmosphere, and yes, surprisingly the acting are very good, making sure you get your money's worth, pretty much the way, a roller-coaster ride gives you some thrills; you don't have to worry about anything deep or lasting.<br/><br/>First of all, I am amazed at how much computers can do. The design of the town and its inhabitants should be acknowledged as some of the best of the year. It's unconceivable that work of this quality never makes the list in those top 5 or top 3 awards shows. The idea is to recognize the best of the best in each category, and there are some amazing creations in here. We have seen spooky interiors and netherworld before, but the scope of this universe is something to admire. There are times when you literally feel that Dante's Inferno could have used some of these looks for inspiration, or maybe you wonder whether this director and his production theme should go ahead and tackle that type of material. The haunting quality feels like much more than just a set. It consistent and strong. It compensates for the gaps in the narrative's logic.<br/><br/>There are some powerful ideas here, and I like the concept of God/Mother as a symbol. I don't recall having seen it before, and its works very well here. As previously mentioned, the principals in the film are quite effective, especially the fanatic priestess who has a key role in the last half of the film.<br/><br/>The story of a child in distress has been done before, yet it is the ride that is much more fun this time. Starting with the typical beginning that takes the mother in search of what can save her child. It is not the most practical move, but we have to get to the that haunted town somehow, don't we? The ending is much more successful since we know that things might not be what they seem after all. What in the world is happening with that little girl? What about that other girl? What is her role here? Don't worry about it. Just have some fun and pretend like you really don't care. This is light entertainment (well it's a bit dark, too), and it's to be enjoyed!"

The rating given on this site is also deceiving until you realize most of the people who enjoy the movie are also ones who were into the game. As a person who hasn't played the game I can't really relate but as far as judging it on as a movie it impress me all that much.<br/><br/>I will start off saying something nice about the movie. Visually this movie is pretty good they did a good job for the most part with the look of the film. The monsters or whatever they were looked like something from a generic video game but that was the only thing that I can complain about visually. That is pretty much the best thing I can say about the movie other than if done right this might have actually been a really great movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie failed horribly. For a horror movie that's dealing with demons there are really no scary moments in fact most scenes are laughable. The actors and the dialog left much to be desired. For someone who isn't familiar with the game the explanations given to what is going on isn't exactly clear or really all that exciting. With good movies you're often left wanting more but with this one I felt myself looking at my watching just waiting for the boredom to end."

","I usually do not post my thoughts on a movie, I usually allow people to see for themselves. Yet this movie was so horrible I must display my opinion.<br/><br/>First off I have never played the games so I had no previous knowledge of any storyline. I saw the previews and I was under the impression this was going to be a horror flick. Boy was I was. Not once throughout the whole movie did I feel my heart leap from my chest. My ribs were hurting. I was laughing so hard I almost thought I was watching Carlos Mencia. (or however you spell his name).I almost walked out but I was pretty comfy in the open theater. Something you don't see in a town with 25,000 people and one theater.<br/><br/>The only reason I did not rate this movie a ""1"" is that the main character and the chick cop are kinda hot, little bonus. All in all the acting was sub-par, the horror non-existent, and storyline kinda thin. Its early in the year but I would vote this WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR. Waste of time and money."
"hijeff1","2","1","3","1 May 2006"," This movie is HORRIBLE!!!
","I just watched Silent Hill at the theatre and I wanted to see what other people thought of the film. For those of you who liked it, why? I've never played the video game, so I can only judge the movie for what it is... A MOVIE!!!!! not a movie based on a video game.<br/><br/>The movie trailer made this movie look like it was going to be a great scary movie, instead you get a film with good special effects, but the story is horrible. Here are some small problems I have with the film:<br/><br/>1st one.. The mom is looking for her daughter, got that, but why in the end does she allow the ""reaper"" to enter her body? 2.. The scene where the cop is beaten to death... looks like it right, nope shes still alive just to be killed later. Umm yea, good story, I think not!! 3.. The story was very dry. The plot of the film is revealed at the very end of the film. If I had rented this film I would have never made it to the end. The movie is that bad. 4. The creatures that are killing everyone are never explained. What are they? and do they have a mind of their own or are they just following orders. 5. The very VERY end.. Are they dead now? I thought they were going to be saved. 6. When the mom floors it and goes through the fence... um yea... not a scratch on the car, no dents... and we are supposed to believe that a Jeep Liberty could actually break open a fence like that? Comeon Now!!!<br/><br/>I know some of you will know the answers to these questions because you have played the video game, but remember this is a MOVIE and for it to be good it has to explain everything to people who are unfamiliar with the story line. Look at comic book films... ex: spider-man, or X-Men. Everything is explained so even the non-comic book fan knows who every character is and the story is very clear.<br/><br/>This film will probably only be considered good by the video game fans, but that means it is not a good film."
"squeezebox","8","1","3","1 May 2006"," Finally, a real horror movie!
","SILENT HILL is one of the best horror movies of the past twenty years. Unlike many other recent ""horror"" movies, which are more fantasy, action or thrillers with some blood and guts, SILENT HILL is a full-blooded exercise in nightmarish and surrealistic horror. It is the movie that HELLRAISER was trying to be.<br/><br/>A mother and father are trying to deal with their adopted daughters dangerous sleepwalking affliction. The girl repeatedly shouts the name of the town from which she came (""Silent Hill""), and the mother believes that taking her to Silent Hill may be the catharsis she needs to snap out of her dementia.<br/><br/>The two of them drive to Silent Hill, against the father's wishes, and crash the car when they try and avoid a mysterious figure crossing the road. The mother wakes up hours later and sees that her daughter is missing... and Silent Hill has become some sort of nightmare alternate dimension plagued by monsters, mutants and creepy street people.<br/><br/>The movie captures the look and atmosphere of the video game without ever coming off like a filmed session of game play. Other game adaptations have fallen into the trap of seeming like little more than watching someone else play the game, which is not particularly interesting or entertaining. SILENT HILL has intelligent dialog, intriguing characters and a fully developed plot to add muscle to its astonishing visuals. It's not just one gory, bizarre set-piece after another; it's a surreal visual feast held together by a compelling story and strong performances. <br/><br/>The screenplay is the movie's only real liability, as screenwriter Roger Avery tries to incorporate the video game's stilted, melodramatic dialog into the action. It works in short spurts in the game, but simply doesn't translate to the cinema.<br/><br/>SILENT HILL ignores both the unfortunate move toward ""extreme"" horror and the tendency of horror movies to pull punches for fear of offending the audience. Political correctness and a need to repulse the audience with gruesome but pointless imagery isn't to be found in SILENT HILL. This is true horror, pure and uncompromising. Horror is like rock & roll: it's about breaking boundaries and not worrying what's going to sell in middle America. If they had given Lucio Fulci $50 Million, he might have made a movie like this. I highly recommend this movie for hard-core horror fans.<br/><br/>More casual audiences and younger kids may not be ready for it."
"jazni","2","1","3","30 April 2006"," What a waste...
","Silent Hill may only be for audiences who have played and loved the video game. For all else, it makes no sense.<br/><br/>I tried to give the film the benefit of the doubt when Rose decides to take her young daughter--alone--to a known Ghost Town, without assistance from her concerned husband. Silent Hill continues to defy logic from there. <br/><br/>The film does not explain the presence of the monsters that Rose continues to run away from. Half the time, you get the sense that she's in no real danger at all and these never-ending chase scenes become boring and redundant. At one point, I was hoping one of these creatures would rip her to shreds, just to give us something interesting to watch.<br/><br/>I was expecting Silent Hill to be a clever, horror flick that would make me jump at all the right times--but it never happened . The only truly terrifying thing about Silent Hill is that you have to sit through this snoozer for over 2 hours."
"suspiria10","8","1","3","30 April 2006"," S10 Reviews: Silent Hill (2006)
","Rose is worried about the strange behavior that her adopted daughter has. Strange drawings and waking nightmares are clues to the girl history and a strange little West Virginia ghost town. The town of Silent Hill may hold the answers but they won't come easy because the abandoned town of Silent Hill still has inhabitants lurking in the darkness and it all makes the Twilight Zone seem like a pleasant dream.<br/><br/>Director Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf) brings the Konami video game series to the silver screen with much success. Wonderfully atmospheric, the gorgeously photographed film is a lot of twisted fun. An unusually decent group of actor's (Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Kim Coates and Alice Krige) for a film like this add dramatic punch to the extremely bizarre monster design. The overall look and design is absolutely nightmarishly brilliant. It unwinds at it's own pace and captures the feel and many aspects of the story from the game well. I did wish there were more scares because I thought the original game was of the best scary games ever but it's a minor quibble at best. Some reviewers have found the film to be perplexing but I didn't have that problem. That might be due to me having played the games though."

","The film was awful. i gave it three stars because some of the scenes were so bad it was funny. The idea behind the film, and the game were good. But something let it down, well many things let it down. The acting was awful ,total crap. The only good actor in the entire film was Sean Bean. The film wasn't even scary. If your looking for a movie thats really gory then Silent Hill may be for you. But if your looking for a good film, this isn't a film you should see. My girlfriend, 3 of my friends and myself all wanted our money back. people actually clapped in the cinema when it finished and there were shouts of ""oh thank god its over"" Some of the scenes were quite disturbing specifically the 'witch-hunter"" type scenes. The dialogue was cheesy and some of it looked like it had been taken straight from the game. A few of the scenes looked as if they had too. it was just rubbish."
"Edward_Forty_Hands","7","1","3","30 April 2006"," Great movie for those who like horror movies
","Before Silent Hill, I can't remember seeing a horror movie in theaters and walking away satisfied. I love a good horror film, and this was just that. The atmosphere, characters, acting, and storyline make for a very creepy and entertaining experience. I have never played the video game, so I am certain that this movie has potential to be enjoyed by gamers and movie-watchers alike.<br/><br/>The story was not predictable at all. As soon as I started formulating the possible outcome of the movie in my mind and thinking about how bored I was going to be (like watching most horror flicks) the story took a turn and the movie had my full attention again. Surprisingly, the film did not use cheap scare tactics. It wasn't a chaser film, or a roam through a scary mansion film either. The horror never got too cheesy either.<br/><br/>If you like movies that creep you out and depict dark, Gothic, horrid surrealism, then I highly recommend Silent Hill. I give it 7/10, because many people will not like this film if they do not respect fantasy/horror films. It is definitely above average and highly enjoyable, but it will not be a great among the majority of movie-goers. More people will see it as another entertaining movie than a memorable horror film. Personally, I am already excited and awaiting the DVD release."
"CraneWife00","3","1","3","30 April 2006"," why the sub plot?
","Okay, to be fair let me first say that Silent Hill 2 is my favorite video game of all time. I went into the movie expecting a totally mysterious and creepy showcasing of all of the scary characters from the game. Instead, I got two scary scenes (the two times Pyramid Head showed up) and another hour and a half of some crazy, random, and completely WEAK subplot involving witches and burnings and conspiracies. Where did that come from? Also, I know that the first game had a police officer in it, but wouldn't it have been much creepier if Rose had been alone the entire time? She didn't even fight anything....I'm pretty sure that is completely opposite from the game. A better idea for the film would have had Rose, totally alone and scared, wandering around kicking creature ass. She would have had to find different weapons to use (as in the game), and eventually would have had to fight Pyramid Head in the end to get her daughter back. I had been looking forward to this movie for a year, and was so disappointed that I wanted to cry....does anyone agree with me? Woudln't my version have been better?"
"dodgeball1987","10","1","3","29 April 2006"," Awesome.
","A lot of people for some reason didn't care for this movie too much. Thats because they have been spoiled with garbage horror movies like the Darkness and boogeyman for too long. Silent Hill on the other hand opened the long since closed door of what horror movies are supposed to be. It was very creepy and could very well give some nightmares. The story was far better than I expected. And if you can last through the first thirty minutes and bear with the storyline you will be well rewarded in the end. The gore in this movie is off the charts and reminded me of Saw. It also had the spiritual horror that has been missing in movies since the Exorcist.If you really want to see a good horror/gore/mystery movie than this is a movie you cant neglect.10 stars and two thumbs up."
"orokausagi","9","1","3","29 April 2006"," Ever hear the phrase ""don't choke on the pig's tail""...?
","As a major fan of both horror movies and games, this movie was a stunning experience for me. They really kept true to the feel of the game on so many levels; those crazy camera angles (how many times did I die because I couldn't see what I was shooting...?), the apparent links between monsters and events that had transpired to create them, and they even had a few puzzles, albeit fairly simple ones. And the sets! Good lord, it's like SH became a real place! I couldn't stop giggling with glee every time I saw a location I had played at. The graphics were just beautiful (the world rusting and peeling away, floating up like ash- I got chills!), and the music, naturally, was perfect (love you, Yamaoka!). I even enjoyed the ""memory"" bit, with the blinding white screen and the scratchy film quality (it felt a little like SH1). So much just went so right with this movie, I was ecstatic.<br/><br/>...And then, about a third of the way through, it's like they ran out of steam. Admittedly, there's not much that could have been done with the endings from the games in terms of a transfer to film. But going on what felt like a never-ending gore-fest like that... I dunno. It just felt like a cop-out to me. I just kept wondering ""Sooooo, she's raping Christabella... why?"". And the dancing in the blood thing... maybe a touch over the top. It just came across as silly to me. Also, as many people pointed out, Bean's character felt like a last minute addition, mostly because it was, but it had it's uses (digging up background info on SH, showing that Rose is permanently trapped within Sharon/Alessa/the demon's dreams in the end...).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I highly recommend this movie to fans of the game- all your favorite locations and landmarks, all your favorite monsters, all those feelings of anxiety and terror in the Otherworld, it's all there. I, for one, plan on buying the DVD so I can get some subtitles on this thing, and to catch some of the writings on the walls. I just hope they'll have some good extras on it to make up for that ending..."

","Unbelievably intense and so much like the game!! Several scenes are directly taken from the game and flawlessly adapted in the movie. There is also several pieces of music taken from the game too and this is a perfect move for my taste.<br/><br/>I cannot be grateful enough that Uwe Broll didn't make this one, and i pray that when he see Silent Hill he will just stop making anything else he is actually working on and understand the mess he is doing with every game title he touch.<br/><br/>When Christophe Gans told us not to worry because he was also a fan of the series i just sat back and wait. Now i realize how lucky we are that he was the one in charge and how much the team creating this movie did a mighty good job! 10/10"
"toomuchcoffeeboy-1","7","1","3","29 April 2006"," Meant for fans of SH and horror films
","I would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of Silent Hill or horror films. The visuals are outstanding, the acting was good, but allot of things could have been better. My main complaint about the movie is that as cool and original as all the different creatures are, they hardly ever explain anything about them. They just pop up, look scary, and then disappear so the next monster can do the same thing. Who are they? What are they? What do they want? Why are they there? Things like that never get answered...with one exception. Other then that and the movie being a little drawn out at times, I would recommend watching it. Even with its flaws, it is still better then most horror films and far better then any movie based on a video game. But like I said I would only recommend this movie if you are a fan of Silent Hill or horror films. There are some very graphic images in this movie so if you have a weak tolerance for gore steer the other way."
"Quentintarantado","7","1","3","29 April 2006"," Not perfect, but the images are wonderful and it is thick with atmosphere.
","I have a hard time watching horror films. I'm a pushover. I was scared in ""Gremlins"". I did want to watch this because I enjoyed Christophe Gans's and Roger Avary's previous work.<br/><br/>There are some clunky parts. Reassuring each other it's going to be all right seems like denial in the face of reality, though I could also interpret it as an agnostic's replacement for prayer during desperate times. The exposition before the final finish seems like it was dropped like a lead weight on that part of the plot because Avary couldn't find anywhere else to put it.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the husband doesn't seem out of place for me. It's a tease to me, when he could feel her in that other dimension, like a red herring that there could be some hope. Plus the ending wouldn't mean the same way, both of them at the same place but vaguely aware that they are finally together.<br/><br/>I like the leads, Mitchell, Bean and Krige, who has to go through pages of lines as the fanatic head of the cult. My fave is Holden, the cop, because she clearly sees she's in over her head and she doesn't have a daughter at stake. I would have left that crazy mother on her own (that would leave me with...living with that cult the rest of my life, or burning at the stake anyway.) What I do like about the movie is the atmosphere. Especially in the first half, when we understood nothing yet, the buildup was excruciating. It reminds me of Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"", especially the beginning when a girl goes from the airport to her dorm, NOTHING happened but the buildup was incredible.<br/><br/>The nice thing about the second half is there are little plot points which pay off, though not everything is explained and the ending is suitably Japanese (they don't believe in unambivalent endings). Sometimes I don't like things wrapped up in neat packages.<br/><br/>Horror these past twelve months have been people being tortured (Hostel, Hills Have Eyes remake, Wolf Creek), so this multidimensional/scifi/supernatural shtick is a welcome change. I'll let it steep and maybe I'll raise the rating at a later date."
"chriscollier_2008","7","1","3","29 April 2006"," Well worth a watch!!
","Really wasn't expecting too much from this film based on previous video game to movie crossovers that I've seen in the past. Despite not being a massive fan of horror films in general, Silent Hill was a film that I really enjoyed. Although I have never played the video game I had the basics of the game explained to me before seeing the film and this did clear some things up eg) parallel universe etc. The element of poor visibility in silent hill added to the tension and the pursuit throughout of the little girl kept the film moving at a steady pace. When special effects were used, particularly during the 'dark' periods they were generally excellent and the introduction of pyramid head to the proceedings intensified the horror aspect of the film. After watching the fairly decent Resident Evil and its appalling sequel, Silent Hill will hopefully convince studios to keep faith in producing more movies based on video games... so long as we don't have more movies of the quality of Super Mario Bros from the 90's!!"
"johnshinobi","6","1","3","29 April 2006"," Better than average but not scary
","I went to see Silent hill in Switzerland a couple of days after it was released. I have to say that from the trailer footage i saw that the atmosphere had been respected quite well but i had no indication of plot. I must say that the monsters were creepier than expected but some minor details ruined their presence- For example, when Cybil takes down a straightjacket monster and sees 7 or so more coming down a hill. This, in a way, kind of kills the ambiance. Another very important point is the types of monsters used. Although monsters are not the number 1 plot point, it would have been nice to see more monsters reflected from Alessa s mind and hate rather than some fan favourites thrown in for fan service(pyramid head, straightjacket). As a matter of fact, i found the original monster (janitor) to be the best because his significance is very well pointed out in the flashback sequence. Apart from this minor complaint, i found the music, coming mostly from episode 3 of the video game to be very enjoyable.I was not convinced by the portrayal of the cult who were more into burning witches than ""birthing a god""- which i found a shame. The ending of the film was quite interesting and was left open for interpretation- unlike the rest of the film, which sort of loses its symbolism compared to the vg (most notably with the monsters and ""puzzle solving""). In conclusion i thought it was a pleasant trip but it might have been better to develop Alessas character more through the use of significant elements in Roses exploration. My last point is about the acting. Radha Mitchell manages well despite a cheesy script and Jodelle Ferland is very convincing. MAJOR problem with Tanya Allen- i don't think i have ever seen worse acting from a single actor/actress in any movie where the rest was acceptable. <br/><br/>good film overall. Well directed and NICE credits<br/><br/>P.S. I hope a DVD release with a Directors cut will help the plot situation."

I loved the movie because the story line was really creative and the visuals and imagination of this silent hill was outstanding. The scary things in the movie felt like I was actually seeing hell, it was almost as if I went on some tour of what's to come if i don't start going to church more often. On the other end, I didn't like the film because the end was not quite satisfying to me and there were some really graphic parts that I could have done without.

"Matt_Layden","8","1","3","28 April 2006"," ""I Had A Skin Ripping, Blood Dripping, Body Tearing Good Time""
","Rose takes her daughter to Silent Hill in hopes of finding an answer to her sleep walking nightmares. After a car accident just outside the town, Rose wakes up to see her daughter missing. Now she must roam through the ash dreaded streets of Silent Hill....<br/><br/>Silent Hill is based on a video game, one of which I've played, briefly. So I know what I'm in store for, but still didn't expect it. Silent Hill is one of the better horror films of the decade and without a doubt one of the better, if not the best video game adaptation...ever. That's not saying this movie is perfect, it does have it's faults, but the bottom line is that I had a skin ripping, blood dripping, body tearing good time.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is beautiful to look at. The cinematography is wonderful, ranging from gray ash ridden streets and buildings, to blood dripping red terrifying nightmares. The film jumps back and fourth between the two eerie scenery and manages to make you feel the eerie weirdness and confusion that our main character, Rose goes through. Rose's husband, Sean Bean, goes through the same town, but in a different state...he's world is grounded and realistic.<br/><br/>Is Silent Hill terrifying? Yes and no. It depends on what you've been exposed to in previous films. For me, I love the horror genre, so I've seen it all. Silent Hill wasn't anything to shake me to my bones, but it does a very good job and being creepy. One of the best parts of the movie is the siren. It blares a warning sound when the town turns into the nightmare. You hear it for the first time and you know that nothing good can come of it. You hear it a second time and you are terrified, knowing what will come, but not knowing what to really expect. The third time, you just say to yourself that the characters better get the hell out of there. There are three worlds in Silent Hill. The ""real"" world, in which Sean Bean is looking for his wife and daughter. The ""Limbo"" world, which is when the town is covered is ashes creating the foggy creepy feeling, then finally, with the siren alarm comes the nightmare world, where we meet all the insane, brutal, pyramid head nightmares. <br/><br/>The Pyramid Head guy, if you've played the games you know who I'm talking about, if not...he a guy with a giant pyramid on his head...you think it's funny? Wait till you meet the guy, you might sh*t your pants. He carries a big sword, and can rip the skin of a human in one second flat. The little time he is on the screen, you hide behind those fingers of yours, peeking every once in a while to see if the nightmare is over.<br/><br/>There is one scene that is a pure ""Evil Dead"" moment. In the original ""Evil Dead"" one of the characters gets raped by a tree, here it does that same scene, only upping the terror and cringe worthiness. Think...barbwire. Is there gore? Well, let see, there is the one scene that I just described, in which the body is then ripped in half. Pyramid Head...you remember him, well he rips the skin off a human body. A woman is beaten to near death with blunt instruments, then burned alive. The burning of the woman is kind of pointless. She is repeatedly beaten, to the point where we think she is dead. But, oh no, she is still alive. Can she be saved in time? We think so, otherwise why is she still alive, but then she is burned alive. Reason, for shock value. Pointless.<br/><br/>What hurts this film is the useless character of the father, it's need to explain everything and the corny dialogue. While we're in Silent Hill, we should always be in Silent Hill. You take away from the suspense when we have to follow the father and his searching for the two. It takes away from the mystery of what's going on. The audience should be lost with it's main character, there should be no connection to the outside world when you're in Silent Hill. That would ultimately make it more terrifying. Which leads me into it's second fault, which seems to be a trend in many movies. The need to explain why. Why do we always have to have an explanation of why bad things have happened. Why can't it all be a mystery, they're there for our imagination to come up with a reason, not because of what you're telling us. Granted the way they told us was different and nice to see, it's still hurting the film in the end. <br/><br/>The dialogue is laughable, is it because it's based on a video game? No, video games can have good dialogue, this film has teen slasher dialogue written all over it. Scream names here in hope to find an individual. Lines like, ""Hey, look at this"" or ""No, you're the sinner"". Stuff that should be in a cheesy B-horror movie film that came from the 80's. In this movie it is just out of place. Everything is great in the film, except for the dialogue.<br/><br/>The ending does many things, leave you to come up with an explanation and lean into a possible sequel. What I took from the ending? Rose is still in the ""Limbo"" world. Her daughter has been for a lack of a better word, possessed by the demon. Which is why she has a different look at the end, the look that a kid such a Damien would give us. The way it's presented to us can confuse the audience, but I liked it. Silent Hill, for the hardcore fans, I think will please. For horror fans, will please. Silent Hill is a genuine terrifying experience."

This one beats them all and high praise to Roger Avery on the script by keeping the exposition simple in most places as the film moved forward to the climatic ending. And wow the sets also with the harsh metal structures and the blood and body parts all around leaving the best parts of the game intact. Kudos also to the choice of keeping the music and songs(Silent Hill 3)from the games.

"myrothe","8","1","3","27 April 2006"," VERY pleasantly surprised. An Excellent movie that stands on its own
","I just finished watching Silent Hill and was VERY impressed. I cant see how anyone would think it ""sucked"". They captured the dark essence of the games perfectly. What I was most impressed by was the fact that they didn't take the sellout route that pretty much every video game movie does. They didn't simply sell out and make a shallow loosely tied game with cheap scares. In fact there were several moments where I was sure they were going to do the cheap ""monster jumping out of the darkness"" or ""body suddenly leaping up"" (like when she was digging in the corpses mouth) scare but they didn't. <br/><br/>This movie actually had some essence and a gripping plot. Insane visuals, believable acting, intriguing plot, appropriate gore (rather than just for random shock value). I think it was very well done. this isn't simply the best ""video game movie"" I've seen, this is an excellent horror movie in its own right and stands on its own with or without the Silent Hill name. I was NOT disappointed in any way. I had low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised. It stays very close to the source material as well. <br/><br/>Frankly I don't see how any fans of the series are disappointed. Maybe they got something different from the games. I myself was more drawn to the story (I actually enjoyed the cut-scenes far more than the game-play) and for me this totally captured what I loved about the games.No offense to some of the others ""reviewers"" but I hope this review was a little more informative than ""it uh, like kinda sucked but was like, kinda cool too"" Reviews like that (pro or con) just kind of make my skin crawl."
"madmax_thegamer","8","1","3","27 April 2006"," Wonderful if you have played the games, if not it may confuse.
","First off let me make one thing clear, this is in no way a direct port of any of the popular games. It is rather a combination of factors of the four. There was no way they could take four games that run 8 hours or more in play time and condense them into a 2 hour movie no matter how hard they tried. Since different aspects of the mysterious towns background are explained in each of the games, the film makers chose to use characters and make references to the different titles to come up with a somewhat original story. Now i have played all the way through the first 3 games and am currently working on number 4 and i enjoyed this film quite a bit. But then I had some idea behind what is showed in the film, like what some of the monsters represent and why things are happening to the town. There are three versions of Silent Hill, normal silent hill, what you might see if passing by, alternate silent hill which is shrouded in fog and mystery, and dark silent hill, not a place the tourists would like to visit. During the movie all three are explored as the story unfolds and the main character tries to find her daughter. If you have not played the games the movie might confuse and even disturb you, as I said, I have played them and some parts bothered me. All that said though, this is by far the best game to movie released thus far. Gamers should not be to disappointed, and non gamers, well you might not quite enjoy it as much."

"jmfadeley","8","1","3","27 April 2006"," Best movie based on a video game.
","I'm a long time fan of Silent Hill. I can say with confidence that this is one of the most faithful conversions of a video game onto the big screen in existence. Though not Oscar winning, there is much to enjoy from this movie.<br/><br/>With the exception of Sean Bean, every actor in the movie has at least one moment where their lines are not as convincing as could be. However, these parts are never where it is most intense, so you never feel downright cheated. The story is fantastic, a combination of mystery, drama and horror that is difficult to forget. Fans will be happy to know that though it draws itself heavily on the first game, elements of the second and third are involved as well.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing as each monster was incredibly recreated. The film successfully combines all elements of a fantastic horror film, from the creepy atmosphere, the dread, gore, violence. The music is taken directly from the game and fits the movie as perfectly as the game itself. Even the length of the movie makes it feel like there was more effort put into it than normal. <br/><br/>It was not perfect however. As stated, some of the acting and character choices lost a step, but caught up soon after. Also, some of the special effects went a little overboard towards the end. The movie is far from completely ruined by these facts however.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is no cheesy, sad attempt to cash in on the franchise. This is a genuine, fantastic attempt to recreate the story, characters and feeling from Silent Hill. And it succeeds. I doubt there will be any awards, but fans of the game and horror fans alike will not be disappointed. Well done."
"bobtheduck2003","8","1","3","27 April 2006"," The best standalone video game adaptation to date
","This was a good movie. After reading reviews talking about how confusing the plot was, I am beginning to wonder about the intelligence of those viewers. Really, I don't think it boiled down to intelligence as it did willingness to pay attention. If a person of average intelligence were to pay attention to the whole movie, they would have understood the core narrative, with the exception of the last 10 minutes of the film (but horror movies are supposed to end enigmatically, aren't they?) The Sets and costumes (yes, they were costumes...) were incredible, the acting of Rose and Christopher was great, and Sharon / Alessa was mostly good (except for that ""Silent Hiiiiiill!"" part at the beginning) and the monsters were incredible. I especially loved the Grey Children. That introduction to the town was bliss.<br/><br/>Now, what people may have trouble understanding is the logic to the dark world. That's just it. There is none. It's a nightmare. If you recall, Alessa said she would put everyone into her nightmare, so it has dream logic because she pulled them into her dream. Plain and simple. The logic to the events? While Alessa's power is never completely explained, she basically split into 3 parts (her real self in the bed, the ""demon"", and Sharon, which was her good half) She wanted to preserve herself, so she let the part of her that wasn't filled with hate become a child again. Of course, this is all SAID in the film, but people tend to ignore it.<br/><br/>One big complaint is that, unlike the games, they explain pretty much everything. This is not nearly as enigmatic as the games, and yet people were still confused. That boggles my mind.<br/><br/>Now, this wasn't scary. A lot of horror fans went into this wanting to be scared. Don't think of this as a horror movie. Think of it as a supernatural fantasy adventure movie with a Horror motif. If your only desire is to be scared, you'll be disappointed. If you want to experience a great movie with incredible scenery, a good simple fantasy plot (if you actually pay attention, and the best imagery of a nightmare (since when are those abstract nightmares scary in the retelling? Almost never) you'll find in any movie, watch Silent Hill."
"Moonlit_Sorcery","8","1","3","26 April 2006"," Very disturbing
","I'll assume you're already familiar with the plot, and if you aren't there are plenty of other places to find it. I just wanted to say that while I'm a huge fan of the games (espescially the first, which the movie is loosely based on), I found one scene in the film to be the most disturbing thing I've seen on the big screen, ever. Basically, we see a flashback in which a little girl is tormented by her peers, then we hear her screaming as she molested in a bathroom stall. But then we see her being dragged away SCREAMING from her horrified mother by some cult members, shackled, and we hear her scream and sob as she's burns to a crisp. Then we see her mother screaming at the sight of her mutilated body, and we see the fried girl wheeled away on a stretcher. Not only that, but we learn that she spends 30 years lieing in an oxygen tent in agony. For me, this scene ruined the movie for me. Unfortunately, you can't just skip this scene, because it explains almost the ENTIRE PLOT.<br/><br/>Also, while the first half is creepy and atmospheric, they really over do the blood and guts at the end.<br/><br/>And it's a shame, because there is some very cool stuff to be seen here. If you're very sensitive like me, and haven't seen very many disturbing movies, then you should AVOID. If, however, you're a fan and the idea of a screaming little girl being fried alive doesn't phase you, then enjoy. For me, it was just too much."
"middielaxqb8","6","1","3","26 April 2006"," I don't know what movie all the other comments are for...
","These other people might have went into the wrong theater. I went in there ready to scream and jump and yell... I laughed. The only things Silent Hill used to make me jump were a desk and a garbage can. NOT A GOOD THRILLER AT ALL. The story line was OK. I just really didn't think there was any urge in the movie. The girl passed out every 5 minutes and nothing ever really happened. A lot of the lines were random and completely pointless and things happened at random for know reason. I left the movie theater disappointed and confused. Nothing explains itself in the end and all of a sudden, the movie is over. I recommend doing a lot of searching on the computer like my friends and I did after we got home from this movie JUST to figure out why we wasted two and a half hours on a Saturday."
"anajberg","8","1","3","26 April 2006"," Teaches the viewer how to watch the film then turns into another film.
","No real spoilers but I clicked the button just to be on the safe side.<br/><br/>Silent Hill starts as an outstanding experiment and atmosphere, psychological horror, and surreality. Visually stunning throughout, the first half of the film creates the promise of a horror experience as strong atmospherically strong and engaging as such classics as Alien, Jaws, and the Exorcist. Furthermore, the first half delivers on that promise. Silent Hill stands out as one of creepiest films of the last decade without doubt both with its craft and its ambition.<br/><br/>For the first half.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The second half is entertaining, well crafted (especially visually) and ultimately satisfying from the standpoint of a standard horror experience, but it does fail to live up to what started off as one of the best horror films of all time. The story primarily tracks three central characters and does its best when it provides a plot that promises their eventual intertwining. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the school sequence, these plots rapidly diverge and the promise of a contained and driven narrative fall away in favor of clichéd arcane dialog and a loss of the emotional core of the filming.<br/><br/>Secondly, the first half of the film, despite complaints by many reviews of the difficulty of following, does a solid job teaching the viewer how to watch the film by providing distinctive and repeated audio and visual cues that establish the rules the filmmaker is following.<br/><br/>Again, however, following the school sequence, these rules largely vanish from the narrative. Gans teaches us how to know what to expect and then he abandons the sense of a living and breathing world that operates in a logical (if surreal) fashion in an attempt to ""open up"" the story and artificially insert background information that the audience does not need to understand the plot.<br/><br/>However, Gans mistake is small compared to Roger Avery. The minimalistic dialog, while slightly stilted (which is to be expected because of the unfortunately expository nature demanded out of a supernatural or horror thriller), functions perfectly for the first half of the film, telling the audience the necessary information to explain the audio and visual cues the film uses to teach the reader how to understand the film. The surreal is supplanted by the convoluted.<br/><br/>Lastly, I must address the ending. Without spoilers, I can say the film has two climaxes: one plot based the other emotional. The plot based climax coincides with the second half of the film and therefore leaves the audience feeling disappointed and emotionally disengaged. However, the emotional climax caps off the first half of the film quite beautifully, focusing on the psychological complexity of the world Gans and Avery created. If the emotional ending of the film were to follow the school sequence with the slightest of transitional additions, this film would be an outstanding (if slightly short) example of the top of the horror genre.<br/><br/>All in all, I must applaud and recommend Silent Hill as a fine example of horror film making and not because it is simply by far the best video game movie, but the visual and audio elements are without doubt at the top of the film-making craft, the first half is engrossing and engaging, and the second half is still a fine example of film entertainment."
"grimrogue","2","1","3","26 April 2006"," Very disappointing.
","My memories of playing Silent Hill for the Playstation are fond ones indeed. It was the first video game to actually scare me, and I can remember thinking as I cautiously wandered around the sinister, fog-drenched town, ""This would be a cool movie."" It's really too bad that after all these years, the flick finally gets made, and it's nowhere near the same level of brilliance and creativity that the game possessed. The movie is bad. It takes the video game's classic setting and combines it with ideas and themes stolen from The Ring. It's an unfortunate mix.<br/><br/>After reading all of the positive reviews on here for this movie before I saw it, I can now only wonder what the average age group most of these fans fall into. It's an 'R' rated movie, but really, it plays out no differently than most of the generic 'PG' rated horror flicks that have hit theaters in the last couple of years, except this contains more senseless violence. I'm all for seeing disturbing images on screen if it propels the story, but in Silent Hill, these scenes come off as being pointless and meant for shock value only. Most mature horror movie fans will find this boring, not ""cool"".<br/><br/>The story is really what sinks this movie. I don't exactly remember the entire plot from the original video game, and I could have honestly cared less if the movie completely re-wrote it for the screen. All I was really hoping for was a decent script, and this movie does not deliver in any way. In fact, there are moments that just don't make any sense, and fans will argue the point that ""it's meant to leave you with questions for a sequel"" or ""it's supposed to make you think."" Whatever.<br/><br/>There are moments in the movie that are unintentionally silly, which really hurt the viewing experience since the audience was supposed to be feeling a sense of fear and dread. These parts are subtle, but at least the majority of the people in my theater were older and understood how ridiculous it was, as there was a few instances of shared laughter at the foolishness of it all. A perfect example is early in the movie when the lead actress holds out her hand to catch what could be a snowflake falling from the sky, but when she rubs it between her fingers, it leaves a black residue. What would any half-intelligent horror movie fan think at that moment? It's not snowing; it's raining ashes, right? Well she has to literally say out loud to herself, ""It's ash"", so that we, the simple minded audience that could never possibly grasp this visual for ourselves, can understand what's happening and keep up with this ""intelligent shocker"". Bah.<br/><br/>It also needs to be said that creepy little kids in movies who are scripted to speak like creepy adults just isn't scary anymore. It fact it is downright irritating. Please screenwriters, let this crossover fad from Japanese horror movies die once and for all. Another problem with the script was the addition of Sean Bean as the frantic father searching for his wife and daughter, alongside a cop who seemed to know more about the town of Silent Hill than he wanted to admit to. Both of these characters were pointless to the story and added nothing to the movie. I don't think I've ever seen two characters in a flick interacting with this much screen time that had absolutely nothing to offer. What a waste of Sean Bean, who is normally interesting to watch and adds some kind of needed element to a story.<br/><br/>For fans of the original video game, there are a few good parts to the film. The music is pretty cool, and at times it flashed me back to scenes from the game that made my skin crawl. And there is no doubting the brief sense of fear that strikes you when the town siren first goes off in the movie, as anyone who played the game can remember, it was always a chilling moment when you knew that bad things were coming fast. Unfortunately, things like the radio static, which was also very creepy in the game (as well as being extremely useful), was poorly underused in the movie, as was any form of ""puzzle solving"". I know, watching an actress on screen trying to decipher a brainteaser isn't exactly horror, but it was a huge part of the game, and I'm sure it could have been done somehow in the movie to make it more interesting.<br/><br/>Rent this only if you were a fan of the video game. Don't expect to like it though."
"hemotoggy","10","1","3","26 April 2006"," Great Movie!
","Finally, a movie that was worth watching. I had a hard time getting excited about this movie because I was sure it would go down like all the other video game movies as not even close to the game. I was surprised to see that I almost felt as if I was playing the game in the theater! They did a wonderful job capturing the feel of the game and making a pretty great film as well. The monsters are great and straight out of Silent Hill 1&2. I recommend this to all that have played the game and enjoyed it, but if you don't like those type of games, chances are you won't like this movie. This movie actually plays more like a mystery drama more than a horror flick, of course this would be the first mystery drams I've seen with this level of gore."

I loved all the bad guys that they managed to squeeze in.Pyramid Head in particular made me cheer! The fact that they didn't try to overexplain everything was close to the game. My only negative would be the Husband's part of the story.He was used to fill in some of the blanks but i felt this was not necessary in some parts and overlooked in others.This didn't take away from how much i enjoyed this Film though. As the ending was left open I'll be hoping for a sequel."
"gaterichard","9","1","3","26 April 2006"," Silent Hill - Finally a good video game movie
","This film is very good! As a big fan of the video games I felt they did a decent job of portraying the Silent Hill world and story that the fans of the series love. The film's story and setting is mostly true to the first game, however I feel some key aspects take away from the overall experience. For example the games rely on instilling a feeling of isolation, yet in the film a police cop accompanies the lead character, the town is populated and monsters attack in dozens. This really adds to the action but takes away from the isolation and suspense that is a prominent feature of the video games. The film also has a slightly different - but never the less important - take on the story. To avoid spoilers I won't go into the details here. Let's just say if you really want a close to perfect story match you will be disappointed. The film complete with these changes feels a little - but not too much - commercial, this is particularly apparent towards the end of the film in a scene where the story is simply explained  fortunately not too much as to leave nothing to the imagination. In addition, adding popular characters like Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2 didn't do much for the story and felt more like rush additions to the film rather than well thought out ideas. That said, the story, visual effects and action make for a very engrossing film. As a big fan of the game I was concerned the film would not do the game justice. I was not disappointed. I'm looking forward to a sequel."
"Bathos78","2","1","3","26 April 2006"," A poor script ruins an otherwise good idea
","'She Gods of Shark Reef' had more internal integrity than this well executed piece of dreck. No matter the acting, which was good; nor the cinematography, which was excellent; nor the direction, which seemed to be good; can save a bad script. The dialogue is nearly non-existent--Radha Mitchell spends a lot of time screaming, ""Sharon!!""--and whenever a movie, almost without exception, needs to spend ten minutes (I am estimating, seemed like three days) in exposition to explain itself, there is something seriously lacking. The film should be able to explain itself.<br/><br/>Of course Laurie Holden looked great in her 'Frederick's of Hollywood' cop uniform--not to take from her talent, she did a good job with what she had; I am still looking for a hospital that has nurses that dress such as they did in this movie. Jodelle Ferland's Goth make-up and look is the best since Christina Ricci's some years ago. What was Sean Bean doing here? He had nothing to do. What a waste.<br/><br/>I have a question: When is the 'Other Side' going to improve its communications capabilities? Why is there so much interference with radios, phones, etc.? Perhaps we can start a Capital Campaign to raise money for microwave towers for the 'Other Side'?"
"stevox83","9","1","3","26 April 2006"," A+ for A+mosphere
","As a person who has played the games I can say without a doubt that they nailed the atmosphere in the movie. It trumps Resident Evil and Doom in accurate movie/game adaptation. The monsters, the sets, even the music and sound effects were ripped straight from the first three games. The story, while obscure, always keeps the audience guessing and the intense atmosphere (sights, sounds, and special effects) keep them on the edge of their seats. The down side is that there is too much story at the beginning and not enough closure at the end. It's been hinted that there will be a sequel, but I can't confirm that. Also the gore toward the end was a little much, and wasn't necessary for frightening people. All and all, it's a great movie. However, if you haven't played the games, your going to look at some of the monsters and say ""What the ....?!"". And be warned, the games were demented and the movie is no exception."

","I loved this movie, and I have disliked most every horror movie in the past few years. Hostel was a 7 out of 10. Wolf Creek was 1 or maybe 0 out of 10. Plan accordingly.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if playing the video games changed my outlook, but I have played the last 3 Silent Hill games. I am 31 years old. I am not a youngin, but I did play this game for most of its existence. I never got far enough to get a story this deep. So, I doubt my opinion of the movie weighs against the games.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are just amazing. I doubt there is anyone that can argue against that. They are just amazing. Add to that the actual cinematography. Not sure anyone cares about that...but it is amazing. That is definitely the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>The story is good too, if you either a) know the Silent Hill story or b) accept a movie on its own, without the hype.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why anyone in 2006 complains about gore in a movie. There aren't any movies I've seen lately that compare to the 90's or even 80s movies. This movie definitely had little. Have you seen Hellraiser...Friday the 13th...or Nightmare on Elm Street...they had more gore and violence. I'm not sure why people are complaining these days.<br/><br/>Tanya Allen = Pyramid Head? IMDb is err."
"goddess1445","9","1","3","25 April 2006"," Awesome
","First, I'd like to say that this movie was almost perfect, in my opinion. Second, don't see it if you have no idea about the world of Silent Hill. This is not just your ordinary ""scary movie"" and if you have never played the video games, or you don't know anything about them, please do yourself a favor and don't waste your money, because, unless you've played at least the first three games, you will not understand it. This movie is directed to the fans of Silent Hill, which I'm included. I watched my brother play through the entire first game, and I have played through the last three and I love every single one of them, so I was very pleased with how the movie turned out.<br/><br/>Pros: The movie stuck closely with the first game, with the exception of some name differences and gender reversal for the main character. Pyramid Head was taken directly from Silent Hill 2, and the deeper religious storyline of Silent Hill's history was pulled from 3. They didn't include really anything from Silent Hill 4, at least not as far as I noticed. The end was left open possibly to continue the series, as the games have done. I loved the inclusion of Pyramid Head because he is the mac-daddy of all Silent Hill monsters, which I'm sure most fans of Silent Hill would agree with me. If you've never played the games, you wouldn't understand this, but every single time I encountered him in Silent Hill 2, my heart started pounding... he creeps me out!<br/><br/>Cons: Only one monster gets killed by a human throughout the entire movie, and this bugged me. The best part about the games, besides trying to find out what the heck is going on, is taking out bad guys. Don't get me wrong, this didn't take away from the goriness of the movie, but more monsters could have died. Also, although it was awesome that Pyramid Head was included in the movie, they didn't include him enough! He only had one really awesome part, and after that, you never saw him again. Lastly, the ending sequence with the ""boss,"" if you can even call her that, was very corny and they could have made an ending sequence so much better than that, especially with how well done the rest of the movie was. So, this scene was very disappointing, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The only thing that I'm left confused about is whether or not the storyline of Sharon (Sheryl in the games)/Alessa/Dahlia is accurate. Even though I remember the first game from watching my brother, I didn't actually play it and really take in the plot so I don't remember the entire story behind Sheryl and how she was connected with Alessa. I need to buy the original Silent Hill and actually play it so I can fully understand the games' storyline (well at least as much as possible, I don't think anyone *fully* understands the games ;). I believe this is why I wasn't 100% sure on what was going on in Silent Hill 3, whose main character was deeply connected with happenings and history of the first game.<br/><br/>I wouldn't categorize this movie as ""scary"" just as I wouldn't consider the games in this category, as well. Silent Hill is more of a creepy, dark and disturbing atmosphere, with a few things here and there that startle you, game and movie alike. Take my word for it, and I'm sure others will agree: don't watch this movie thinking ""this doesn't make any sense"" and come to the conclusion that it was made poorly, because the games leave you going ""huh?"" after you beat them, as well. That is Silent Hill, and if you haven't liked that about the games, you won't like the movie, it's that simple. And like I said at the beginning of this, please do not see this movie if you have never played the games or don't know anything about them, I guarantee you will not like this movie unless you are the type of person that just enjoys weird messed up things that make almost no sense."

","This movie is one of the better produced works of entertainment in recent year. It does not revolve around the overused, in my humble opinion, teenager 'coming-of-age' theme. The movie deals with real dilemmas in adult relationships with one another and their offspring. While set in a world similar to that of the console game series, Silent Hill, the movie plot is far less about horrifying the spectator visually with scenes of gore and violence. That being said, I did not find the plot hard to follow or the film overly thought-provoking. I would also like to commend the film-writers on their solid judgement in not including a gratuitous sex scene, as has been the trend of late in Hollywood. While the film was decent I would criticize the length, placement and quantity of scenes which did not support the plot or reduced the build-up of pressure.<br/><br/>This film got 9 out of 10 because it is the only movie since V for Vendetta to get me to spend money at the theatre."

","SH is visually very appealing. The scenery is simply amazing. The plot is also surprisingly good. I found the story quite interesting. However the dialogues sometimes lack substance and the acting is occasionally poor. The relationship between the characters and the characters themselves are arguably quite superficial. The characters sometimes feel awkward like in a video game. So not as much of a psychological thriller as expected. At the end, even though the story is explained some questions remain unanswered (but not as many as say in Donnie Darko). So in conclusion I believe that the strongest point of this movie is by far its visual aesthetics, the decor, the camera work, the monsters etc. I think this movie is definitely worth seeing."

","This was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. After the movie, myself and the three friends I went with all turned to each other and asked why the other hadn't suggested that we leave. The plot was predictable when it wasn't falling apart, volumes could be written about how bad the acting was, and those parts that i guess were supposed to be scary made me actually laugh out loud. If one is hoping for any semblance of quality at the end of the movie the movie will further disappoint. The creators of the movie tried to employ deus ex machine by having a little girl explain the whole plot of this ridiculous movie, a plot that leaves the viewer wishing for anything more substantial or though provoking, Teen People for an example. The moral of the story about people being trapped by their own faith is so preachy and such a poor attempt at social commentary, that I felt sick. Do yourself a favor and don't waste two perfectly good hours on a garbage heap of a movie like this one"
"nived84","6","1","3","24 April 2006"," ""This town is the grain, and I am the reaper.""
","Well it took many tries, and sub sequentially, many failures, but it has finally been done; a good movie-going experience based off of a video game. French filmmaker Christophe Gans and Pulp Fiction screenwriter Roger Avery have brought to the big screen a completely faithful film experience that lives up to the game's bizarre imagery and twisted reality, and surprisingly it doesn't rely heavily on fast editing and loads of CGI effects. The film is an experience; much like the Silent Hill games, you journey into the darkness and spiral down into a hellish nightmare that has you coming face to face with your worst fears, and no one can hear your screams in the town of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect it does have a few issues that have to be overlooked in order to enjoy this movie. One of the problems is the films running time, two hours may not sound like a very long movie, but Silent Hill is a dreary, very slow-moving journey into the unknown, and much like the games, when you're not being chased or attacked by a bunch of creatures the experience is rather dull. Thankfully Gans, working along side creature make-up effects creator Patrick Tatopolos, whose previous films include Independence Day and Underworld, have really created some truly ferocious monsters that inhabit the ghostly town, adding just the right amount of freakishly scary and psychologically ""that's screwed up!"" edginess to the film. Gans' never pulls any of his punches with the blood or gore either, which only made some of the scenes seem to stick in your mind a little longer after having left the theater.<br/><br/>However when these amazing looking creatures aren't on screen is when the film seems to falter. The Silent Hill games were really about getting a spine-tingling delight out of creeping through dark, rotten and rusty corridors in near total darkness, just waiting for something evil to reach out and grab you. The movie does seem to have a problem of moving really, really slowly, but then again this is very similar to the games. Like last year's big screen adaptation of Sin City, Silent Hill also stays very close to the look, feel, style, pace and sound of the games, heck, they even went ahead and decided to use the entire soundtrack from the game throughout the film, which worked wonderfully, and the film also puts Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" to amusing use. Silent Hill isn't another Tomb Raider or Resident Evil clone, it's a monster all its own. What is also strangely unique is that the majority of the cast is female (there's really only two male leads in the entire film), and the main character doesn't run around fully armed to the teeth with semi-automatics blasting away baddies and using stylish kung fu and is heavily experienced and trained in combat; she's just an average mother and for the most of the time is completely defenseless; this is a totally different ballgame all together.<br/><br/>The plot of the film revolves around a sick little girl named Sharon DaSilva, who sleepwalks at night and constantly talks about a place called Silent Hill, which she's never been to before. Her mother, Rose is played by Radha Mitchell (you might remember her from Pitch Black or Man on Fire), and she decides to take Sharon to the town of Silent Hill, hopefully looking for answers for what's wrong with her daughter. As it turns out Silent Hill is a ghost town that has been restricted and locked away from the public, supposedly because the fires which destroyed the town and pretty much everyone in it a long time ago are still a hazard and still burn deep underneath the town. This doesn't stop Rose from trying to get Sharon to Silent Hill, but once they arrive in town strange and unexplainable things start to happen. The town is covered in a constant thick fog that showers down ashes like falling snow. Rose looses her daughter in the mysterious town and sets out on foot to find her, and along the way she meets several strange people and shes constantly attacked by various demonic creatures that are waiting around every corner. What happened to this town? Why does her daughter keep mentioning it? And what evil lurks deep within this Hell-on-Earth?<br/><br/>This is a very different kind of video game movie; it's slow paced, confusing and visually fascinating. This horror-thriller doesn't use fast edits and quick ""jump scares"" to shock audiences, instead it uses brutally dark and haunting imagery and bizarre and insane looking monsters to scary the living hell out of you. The story is just as foggy as the town itself, but much like when I was only ten-years-old and used to watch episodes of ER, even though I didn't fully understand exactly what was going on at any given moment, I did however, get the jest of it, and to one degree or another did understand it, just not completely. The film's ending might leave some people scratching their heads but if you've played the games you'll know that this is really just a set up for a possible sequel. Silent Hill is an interesting, but certainly flawed film, and it's a uniquely disturbing trip into a maddening darkness that I can't quite remember the last time I experienced something quite like it in the theaters, and that's why I'm recommending you check out the film, especially if you're not only a fan of the games, but also a fan of real horror movies that aren't filled with stupid teenagers and slapped with a weak PG-13 rating that seem to be a dime a dozen these days; Silent Hill is a rarity."
"thevgmaster","9","1","3","24 April 2006"," Movies like this go understated
","This movie was an excellent depiction of the video game upon which it was based. In the game, you usually have no idea what the heck is going on until say 75% through the game, and even then some spots are sketchy. This transition to the silver screen went without a hitch. There are frightening monsters, there is screaming and blood, and there is actually a story to behold if you will just engulf yourself in it. So many people went into this movie with the wrong attitude. They were more caught up in themselves trying to decide whether it was good or not to be activity involved in the movie. The effects are awesome, and the story is killer as well. The ending was deceiving for many. In my opinion it leaves you to decide what happens. There are ways of thinking that they died, and ways of you thinking that they're still alive. But in the end it leaves it up to you to believe in yourself what is right. This movie was the best game to movie crossover ever, and it is being missed by so many. If this isn't a good movie crossover, I would love to know what is."
"erectpenis99","8","1","3","24 April 2006"," Never played the games and I still thought the movie was really good. I was pleasantly surprised and have gathered my thoughts for a review.
","I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The main reason I liked it so much was because of the amazing sound quality, the fact that I didn't need to have played the game to understand it, and seeing some of the most gruesome acts known to occur in a movie. When I was watching the movie I could feel the suspense with each passing moment almost to the point where I was going to burst. The sound effects and music created an ambiance that was truly horrific (scary, not bad) and it felt like each moment would exponentially increase the main character's terror factor.<br/><br/>Without going into spoilers, I can give you the plot's breakdown. It goes very deep and just as you believe you understand the main aspect of it, the true situation is revealed to you in a very descriptive manner. It can be a little complicated and you may have to dwell on it to understand it (I had to explain the final pieces to my friends) but you do not need to have played any of the games to understand it. I know this because I never have.<br/><br/>I will say this, if you are not a fan of people getting totally ""owned"" then you may want to shut your eyes for some parts. It has some intense scenes of horrific violence and gore. I loved every second of it (I'm not sadistic either, I just like to see people get what's coming to them) and it reset the bar for ""Things I do not want to happen to me when I die."" I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and have recommended it to many of my other friends. I believe most of the critics have no respect for video games and want to see any movie based from a game tank in the box office. I, for the most part, do not care where the story for a movie comes from as long as I am entertained.<br/><br/>If you're not into horror movies, don't like to see people get ridiculously devastated, or are not a fan of suspense then I do not believe I would recommend this movie to you.<br/><br/>If you do like the opposite of the previous paragraph and can go into the movie with an open mind then I believe you'll get a lot out of this movie. Silent Hill, in my opinion, is the best video game adaptation movie (again, I have no idea how true to the game it is and I do not care, I am merely speaking from a theatrical point of view) that I have ever seen. The fact that people have compared this movie to some of Uwe Boll's theatrical abortions just goes to show that they have no grasp of criticism.<br/><br/>I hope this review is helpful in making your decision as to whether you'd enjoy this movie or not. Some may not like it and that's fine with me. Just remember, you never learn anything from somebody who agrees with you."
"SixDoubleFive_321","10","1","3","24 April 2006"," Good but not perfect!
","This is perhaps the best video game adaptation yet. Of course it is not perfect. Some of the dialog is finicky, certain monster sequences play out a bit awkwardly and the addition of a crazy Cult really takes away from the mythology of the games. But overall the movie captures the essence of the Silent Hill franchise. The opening sequences are almost identical to the games and the transitions between dimensions are wonderful. The movie even has Rose use maps, look through rooms and use clues to get to her next destination. The music seems out of place at times but fans will be pleased to hear familiar music from the games. I was happy with the film but it could have been much better."

","I have got to say that this was the mother of all horror films.I usually. don't like horror films but i saw this one in theaters and it owns all. After we left the theater my mom sister and one of her friends didn't say anything for an hour. lol i warned them to see something else. Over all this movie was scary, exiting, and really dark and demented. It was the best video game to movie crossover yet. Warning do not go to theaters to watch this movie if you have a weak stomach there is some very"" I Repeat"" very disturbing images in this film. I plan to go and watch this film again thats how much i liked it. If you don't like normal horror movies today you will like this one more."
"da_vey","10","1","3","24 April 2006"," One of the best video game movies in a long time....
","What can i say? This film was superb. I admit i wasn't to sure about seeing this at first as I was worried about the whole ""Sharon"" and ""Rose"" business, but truthfully, this film lived up to my expectations and more.<br/><br/>Now I'm sure you've heard people say ""I don't get it"" Or ""It didn't make sense"". This is the type of film I like. Silent Hill is not some cheesy horror film with tacky thrills spilled out here and there, its a true mind thinking story. This plot is more about leaving clues for you too piece together, and is one which you will think about for days, figuring out your own little theories on certain parts. Some people call these ""plot holes"". Wrong. Any fan of the series will know that in the game they purposely don't be to explicit with explaining things, so that its more in your mind, and that you can imagine your own theories on certain parts.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movies itself. The acting was great except for a dodgy one here and there. Radha Mitchell (Rose) really shows here acting talent in this movie, taking centre stage and letting us feel her emotion with her. Her acting was brilliant and I found her performance very believable. Laurie Holden was fantastic, playing ""hard as nails"" cop Cybil Bennett. I really liked her playing this character, and she definitely did adapt well to the game version of Cybil as well. Alice Krige as Cristabella was definitely one of my favourite performances of the movie. This woman is fantastic at acting, and really fitted the part correctly. Like I said before, there was a ""dodgy"" bit of acting from Tanya Allen as Anna. Now I'm not sure if they asked her to act like that, but I found hers, along with Sean Beans attempt as Chris, rather dull, and often felt like they were saying the lines without emotion. But, of course, I have to save the best until last. The real shiner for me in this movie, was Deborah Kara Unger as the haggled old Dahlia Gillespie. Great! She played the role perfectly, often leaving me felling very much emotion for Dahlias character.<br/><br/>The setting, was perfect. The foggy/ ashy world was fantastic, looking almost identical to the game, and having said that, so did the ""Otherworld"". Very creepy indeed.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was fantastic, filled with excellent acting, but only the script letting the film down. A few cameos from familiar faces from the games will also keep the fans happy.<br/><br/>A must see!"
"edwjoolee","7","1","3","24 April 2006"," Creepy...
","I had the sense while viewing Silent Hill that the makers of this film were aiming for box office business that the Ring and the Grudge conjured up.<br/><br/>Silent Hill reminded me a lot of the Ring: both are heavy on psychic elements; contain young, malignant evildoers; and rely heavily on creepy atmosphere, instead of outright gore.<br/><br/>Although Silent Hill is a bit more creepier and intense than the Ring, the storyline is not as immersive: the characters are given short shrift, while the creepy backdrop is given substantial more detail. The film felt more like an interactive video game, like the one which it was based, than a narrative film with solid story construction.<br/><br/>I did like many parts of the film, though. There are imageries in the film that clearly stand out: the creatures are imaginatively rendered and are truly grotesque. Also the mood and the atmosphere of the film were dreadful and gloomy throughout, clearly appropriate for the film of this kind.<br/><br/>I give Silent Hill a solid 7."
"anti_poaching","10","1","3","24 April 2006"," Welcome to Paradise
","Great movie. Ignore the summary the first half is wrong they changed it. The way they went about it was genius. Pyramid head was really cool. Also the plot was cool. The only parts in the trailers that were different were she never went through the ghost girl in her car and the girl said i am the reaper in one type of voice not like three. Also the religious symbol of silent hill was not used. Instead they used a more Christian like symbol. I don't think these are spoilers and I hope not. Its a really good movie with a engaging plot. Just one thing of advice. Play the games or read up on it or you might not fully get the movie. The movie was made for the gamers not for random people."
"makojuice","10","1","3","24 April 2006"," Worth the watch if you're gonna go out
","First off I'm giving it a 10, because the average score is a little too low. This movie should at least be in the passing grade, 70%. <br/><br/>What's great about this movie: 1. No stupid pop around the corner trick. Seriously, it is over-used in too many movies, and doesn't really qualify as scary, since it's just a cheap trick with blasting sound. I know there's morons out there who based the entire review on that part, and they shouldn't be allowed to share their opinions. It's equivalent as to a baboon scratching his ass. 2. The use of camera angles and soundtrack are impressive. The music really sets the mood, and not to mention they are the best scary movie tracks I have ever heard. 3. Interesting plot, i'm sure not many people would figure out that the main characters actually died in the beginning of the movie. The exact point would be crashing the SUV, and as for the cop, crashing the bike into the guard rail. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that makes people think, reason behind that is that most people don't enjoy using their brains anymore. 4. Creativity, every time that siren rings, evil is approaching. The town suddenly rots and becomes darkened. And the only safezone is the church, making it into an interesting game-like situation.<br/><br/>What's bad about this movie: 1. The cop gets beaten to death by crowbars, but didn't die. She should have been dead, but... everyone was dead to begin with already. 2. Endng will leave you mystified, you'll be left wondering what the hell. Doesn't offer any closure. From the looks of it. They are forever stuck in purgatory, and I don't think the main character knows that she died. 3. The script lines near the end of the movie was kind of stupid. The heroine comes barging into the church and makes a pointless argument against the evil cult's faith. Anyone that are familiar with religious people would know why. 4. The main character's motivation to save her daughter is not believable given under the circumstances. She's weak, scared to death, and stupid. I don't see what's moving her forward. The entire town is filled with evil creatures and scary as hell corridors. Makes no sense that she stills continue to search. 5. The main character deserved to die since it was her fault that they ended up in Silent Hill. What kind of moronic person would go to a pyro hazardous town knowing that part. Also, trying to ditch a cop in a race through a dark curvy path with a SUV is completely retarded. Is it really worth the risk just to visit a stupid town? Of course not!<br/><br/>Conclusion: Just watch it if you have the time."
"thornem10","10","1","3","24 April 2006"," Don't miss it.....
","This film has to be the best horror flick i have seen in a long while, especially when it comes down to the adaptation of computer games, but where as all the others fail deliver, Silent Hill goes one step further and offers you a gore fest to tantalise even the most avid horror fanatics.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a fan of the games, should definitely go and watch this film... i found the whole experience disturbing (in a good way). Alright the plot isn't that great, but hey... it's a horror and they have kept true the game, which is a big plus, including the soundtrack! The movies is showing in UK cinemas under a 15 rating... however be warned whilst the whole feel of this film is similar to that of the games.. some of the scenes are quite gruesome and even made me cringe...<br/><br/>On the whole I loved this film and hope Sony will go on and produce more films from the Silent Hill saga... 10/10"
"road_dogg_6969","9","1","3","24 April 2006"," The Best Video Game Adaptation Out There
","First of all, I am an avid video game player, and Konami's Silent Hill franchise has been one of my favorites for years. Which is why I jumped at the chance to see a movie based on the game. I was a little apprehensive, since most video game adaptations aren't worth the film they're printed on. Then again, Uwe Boll had nothing to do with this movie, so there's one point in it's favor.<br/><br/>Unlike many video game adaptations, the creators of the game (Konami) were actually somewhat involved with this one. That allows for a feel and an atmosphere ripped straight out of the masterpiece PlayStation 2/Xbox games.<br/><br/>The feel of the town of Silent Hill is downright creepy. A mining town that burned down 30 years ago, Silent Hill is now covered in thick, dense fog, and ash constantly rains from the ominous skies.<br/><br/>The movie is somewhat confusing, but then again, so is the game it is based on. I actually found myself explaining the entire thing to some of the other audience members, since being a Silent Hill player seems to be a prerequisite for watching the movie (or at least understanding it completely)."
"stephentower","9","1","3","24 April 2006"," An excellent film that stays true to the games
","This is an excellent movie, with some really good set pieces. The makers spent a lot of time researching the games as the film is very true to the games. The acting is not the best I have seen, but it is OK for the film as the main stars of the film are the monsters and set pieces.<br/><br/>Some of the special effects are very very good and really pull you into the strange world of silent hill.

","Saw this last night - my hopes were reasonably moderate given that I'd been looking forward to it since discovering Roger Avary and Christophe Gans were involved, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. That's not to say I thought it was fantastic - there was a fair bit of bad stuff in it, such as Radha Mitchell's unconvincing acting and some of the lines she was given, and the whole Sean Bean part which was tacked on at the studio's ""request"".<br/><br/>That said, it was very enjoyable, freaky and disturbing enough with a cracking climax, although the end was slightly annoying. A lot of people said they were confused - it's not really that confusing as long as you take a moment to think about who's who and whats happening. Just think of parallel dimensions and manifestations of spirits etc. I have to say the climax (as opposed to the end) was definitely memorable. Also, Gans demonstrates his amazing eye for aesthetics, and the sound design is also excellent. I'd give it 6.5 out of 10 (rounded up to 7) - one of the better game adaptations yet."
"BladetheBeast","9","1","3","24 April 2006"," Silent Hill: A Film for All
","Christophe Gans has successfully made the first truly good video game adaptation. and here's how he did so: - i'm going to start this off by saying Roger Ebert shouldn't be a critic: ""video games are not art, they're just a distraction from true art"" nay my friend, some video games can tell some of the most beautiful stories and grip your emotions better than most movies coming out nowadays. just like a movie is adapted from a book, comic book, TV show, play, etc, video game adaptations are telling the story in a different manner. the first good choice they made was picking a good game with a good storyline to adapt. just by doing this, it had already surpassed movies like ""doom,"" ""house of the dead,"" ""alone in the dark"" because they didn't have a true story to begin with.<br/><br/>-the next thing they did right was capture the atmosphere the game created. it didn't use the ""pop up"" tactics of scaring people, but rather putting the audience on edge in a slow, stylistic manner. so just like the game, the audience is on edge for most of the movie, afraid for what was coming next.<br/><br/><ul><li>and probably the most important part of this was they didn't make this movie just for the video game audiences. they didn't use cheap pops and references to draw in the game's fan base, but rather turned it into a movie that everyone can actually enjoy. now i made the mistake of watching this movie as a gamer, rather than a movie goer. as a gamer, i was a bit disappointed due to the lack of cheap pops, and also some things they changed from the game. in the game, u don't see even 7 or 8 people, and when you do, its individually. this creates a huge sense of isolation thus adding to the atmosphere. the movie had a group of people in it and that seemed to bother me a bit.</li></ul><br/><br/>but my main point is that Gans didn't create a cooler version of the game, he created a movie. and it is this aspect in which this movie ascends to the best video game adaptation. as a movie, as i mentioned before, it was able to put you in a state of fear that you couldn't really feel safe. during a typical horror movie, when a monster pops out or what not, your usually not afraid anymore, but some of the monsters seemed fake, but even after they popped out, u were still afraid. performances by Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean were awesome and Christophe Gans did an amazing job in using the atmosphere from the game. the soundtrack was actually derived from the actual video games, except a Johnny Cash tune was added, thus making it spectacular."
"number1stun","10","1","3","24 April 2006"," Overall a good film
","In 1999 when Silent Hill was released on the PS1, I picked it up and my friends and I played and played the game. It was a game that pushed your mind to the edge, it made you think, made you jump and cringe, and it sucked you into its own eerie world. The storyline in the game was one that could amount to a perfect movie plot. Then came Silent Hill 2 which had an even better storyline. <br/><br/>After seeing the film version of the games, I am pretty much pleased. There were a couple of things in the film that I believe hurt it, but overall the film lived up to its expectations. One thing I found wrong was that they could have tried to explain a little better what was going on with the darkness in the town(for the viewers who never played the games). I mean, I pretty much understood because I've played all 4 games, but a lot of people who haven't are asking all kinda of questions that could have been answered and explained a little better and more thorough within the film. The film lasted more than a good 2 hours, which in my mind is perfectly fine. It strayed away from the usual 80-90 minute pop-horror trash that usually is spewed out this time of year. Still a lot of people are complaining about how long the film is, but if they only knew and understood how complex the games are..then they would better understand WHY the movie is so long. The games took a good chunk of time to complete, and they're not games for the average gamer who just wants to sit down and shoot things up. The games are hard to understand and they take sometime to stop and think about what exactly is going on. And I see the movie was trying to give the same feel, which is good because it sticks to the whole feel the world of Silent Hill has to offer. I don't know what people expect from this movie, I mean you cant put the name Silent Hill for the title and then fill it in with say...House of the Dead storyline/action. Overall if your a moviegoer and are looking for something easy to understand and for something to entertain you just for fun, then don't bother seeing this film because in most cases you're going to just put it down after seeing it because you don't understand it and never took the time to do so(how bout you Ebert) The only other things I would have changed were explaining the monsters which Rose encountered. I know they somewhat explained the tortured man in the bathroom stall(he was the school janitor who raped/attacked Alessa) but the others such as the burning gray-children the Rose encounters early on, the walkers that Cybil shot, and Pyramid Head. I know in the game the monsters are supposedly the result of the characters mind, but in the movie they never really show or say what they are and why they are there. It pretty much leaves the viewer to make his/her own decision on what they were and why they're there. Other than that I think the film was great, it brought back so many memories from when I first played the games(esp. the first time the siren rings and the darkness comes). See this movie if you are in the mood for something creepy, and for something that makes you think!"

","I went in anticipating a bad film, even though I loved the games, and was pleasantly surprised that the movie actually had a decent plot and fairly good special effects. It captures the mood of the games well, though it probably makes more sense to people who have played the games than to those who have not. The other thing that impressed me was the level of tension held throughout--I actually frequently felt uncomfortable while watching this film, not because of anything actually on the screen, but because the atmosphere and acting carried well enough to make me nervous. On the video game movie scale, with the highest being Tomb Raider and the lowest House of the Dead, I'd put this more on the Tomb Raider end, though it wasn't quite that good."
"Smylee82","9","1","3","24 April 2006"," True to the atmosphere of Silent Hill
","As an avid gamer, I have been anxiously awaiting a well done game to film adaption. After many let downs over many years, the likes of, Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil, Street Fighter(haha) and many other laughable attempt, I can finally say that a worthy transfer has arrived. Gans delivers in every way I had hoped. Though the story differs in some ways from the game, the atmosphere remains true. From the transition from fog to dark, sounds in the distance, music, creatures, even simple details like camera angles, every one is treated with wondrous attention to detail. While watching this movie I couldn't help but get some feeling of nostalgia to play the games again. While it seems many people didn't understand the plot, I had not a problem. This is because I know it would not be you typical brainless horror movie. Every bit makes sense if you pay attention. This movie doesn't go for cheap jumps and boos, but a true feeling of dread and despair, just like its game counterpart, and it delivers. The ending leaves a bit of confusion because it leaves you to guess what really happened, and thats the fun. People who have played Silent Hill know that every game has many possible endings, and it wouldn't surprise me if the DVD had the same thing. I do hope there will be sequels in the true style of Silent Hill. Meaning a whole other story involving the town and one person's plight. Because as we all know, no 2 Silent Hills are alike, cept the town where Hell lives and breaths."

Now I have never played the game before, mostly because I wasn't the dumb one willing to play it alone, none of my friends are really that into video games... but I digress. The film was awesome! There are too many people going into the film expecting Resident Evil or worse, something profound. This is a movie based off of a really cool, from what I have seen in screenshots and have heard, video game. Of course this movie is not going to be exactly like the games, because then what would be the fun of seeing the movie or getting into the games after having seen or played the other? None, I tell you, none at all.<br/><br/>There were loads of scary moments (well, not too scary to me, but I love this sort of stuff), plenty of times to yell at the screen (like what was she thinking going down in the basement by herself?), and Alice Krieg (who as you may remember from Star Trek First Contact is a very creepy lady). The story line was concrete, and there were many little things you had to pay attention to.<br/><br/>For those of you that didn't ""get"" what was going on... I am going to give you a hint, without giving the entire thing away (hence my spoilers)... The Silent Hill that Rose is in is the same Silent Hill that Chris is in, and they are not in alternate realities. If you need further assistance, let me know...<br/><br/>But... GO SEE THIS MOVIE! and pay attention or you won't get all the clues and little things."

","I walked into this movie about 10 minutes late, missed all the good previews. But when the movie actually started it started with all kinds of insanity. I have played the game and love them but this movie took it to a whole new level. The fear displayed by the characters looks so real, that you get sucked in. The effects of certain things, like the acid eating away Cybill's jacket and helmet, looks insanely realistic. The dangers the character's face, you feel like you are facing with them. I was expecting for the dead janitor stuck in barbed wire to come alive and start gnashing like in true horror movie fashion, but it didn't till the main character tried to leave. The ending was very disturbing, but it was just as insane as the rest of the movie. ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash was a nice addition to the scene of the movie it was in. The only thing I am trying to figure out is how they never left Silent Hill! They were there and they got out, they should have left it behind. All in all, great movie, great acting and the CGI used was very appropriate."
"Kalen","7","1","3","24 April 2006"," Disturbing and disappointing all at once (Contains spoilers)
","I went to see this film with high expectations having seen the trailer. Although I haven't played any of the Silent Hill games I have read up on the background and theories about it and found them fascinating (yes, I probably need a hobby), so I was looking forward to it. After a heavy weekend I'm too tired to get a good ramble on so I'm going to summarise.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS COMMENCE*<br/><br/>The Good.<br/><br/>Monsters: Brilliant. From the first creature who appears to be struggling inside its own skin, spraying acid(burning?) blood everywhere when it gets shot (shades of Aliens there), to Pyramid Head wielding his great knife and flaying someone alive with his bare hands. Horribly terrific. There's a good 60/40 percent mix of CGI and prosthetics here which works to good effect. I'm not a big fan of over the top computer graphics but these seemed to work well in combination with the shadowy setting.<br/><br/>The Town: Silent Hill melts. Its the only way to describe it. It dissolves into a hellish rust and blood spattered environment you'd only find in your worst nightmares. Fans of the game will inevitably get a shiver when they hear the fire/air raid siren wailing before the onset of the dark. Very well done.<br/><br/>The Bad.<br/><br/>The Dialogue: ""SHARON! SHARON!"" *waves flashlight about, wanders around looking dazed, repeat ad nauseum for about 20 minutes or so* Yes in the games you're meant to feel isolated and alone...watching someone in a film wander about yelling is another thing entirely. Made it drag a bit. <br/><br/>""There must have been a fire here."" There's ash falling from the sky. The website told you the underground fires had been burning for 30 years. Or did the large amount of burnt and blackened ruined buildings tip you of there sweetheart? Bless.<br/><br/>The Acting: See The Dialogue. Poor sods didn't really have much to work with in all fairness. And what accent was Sean Bean attempting to convey I have no idea...I just kept getting this image of Sharpe attempting to take the mickey out of an American accent. <br/><br/>The Inadvertently funny.<br/><br/>The Angry Mob: ""Burn the witch! Burn the witch!"" If anyones watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail before seeing this, any drama will be leeched from this scene immediately.<br/><br/>The Story.<br/><br/>Time: It all started 30 Years ago? Some of the characters appear to have difficulty aging. Sharon, for instance. And that detective who burnt his hands. No idea.<br/><br/>After all is said and done...<br/><br/>I'm going to get this on DVD when it comes out. Fantastic setting, grisly monsters but let down by horrible acting and utterly barmy dialogue. 50/50 good/bad split really."

","I was with a degree of trepidation that I approached Silent Hill, as an avid video game fanatic I am always the first to pick up on, follow and see game-to-screen movies. Over the years there have been a few highs (Mortal Kombat 1, Resident Evil 1, Doom, and the animated depictions of Tekken and Street Fighter), there have also been some dire lows (see Uwe Boll and Mortal Kombat Annihilation!). Having seen trailers for Silent Hill some months prior, it seemed as if the jinx was to be broken and at last we were going to be presented with a game adaptation worthy of its' title...<br/><br/>With Christophe Gans at the helm and a wealth of input from the games' creators at Konami, Silent Hill doesn't disappoint! In fact, it excels in what it is and what it tries to do.<br/><br/>While the uninitiated will be perplexed by the winding story and characterisation, this (I believe) is ultimately a film for the fans...I have read many reviews slating the film, noting on it's lack of scares and confusing plot. But these reviewers are admittedly Silent Hill virgins and thus do not understand the premise behind the film or the reasons behind the aforementioned twisting plot and characterisation. It is this decision to make a game for the fans, which has ultimately lead to split reviews.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, game-to-film adaptations, should be made for the fans.<br/><br/>During the film itself we are greeted with a plethora of psychological thrills and truly outstanding art direction! The 'creatures' themselves look stunning (especially the nurses and the oppressive figure of The Pyramid Head), their role in the film is not to scare, but to provide the audience with a great feeling of trepidation. This is achieved to marvellous effect! While the critics have picked up on the lack of traditional 'scares', this is not what Silent Hill is about...the entire idea regarding the 'horror' is to keep the audience/gamer on edge. Through the use of the ever changing environments and set pieces, the film does this superbly and at the moment is without equal. The ever changing world of Silent Hill is accurately and spectacularly recreated and fans of the games will have a deeply nostalgic feeling throughout...many places are brought back to life with devastating effect!<br/><br/>The performances of the actors deserves also deserves a mention, Rahda Mitchell is expertly cast and thoroughly breathes life into the character of Rose. The characters of Shannon, Cybil Bennett and Dahlia are also expertly cast and firmly cement the films' ever impressive presentation. <br/><br/>I won't mention the details of the story or the characters...but suffice to say, Silent Hill is one of a very small handful of successful game adaptations...and while the uninitiated may have difficulty enjoying the film, fans and fanatics alike will revel once again in the dark magic that is Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Sayuri x"
"nsbrwttt","5","1","3","24 April 2006"," Enjoyed it but preferred the game
","Before I start I must say I'm a huge fan of all of the games and have completed them numerous times so I was hoping this movie would be just like the games. I went into the cinema with really high hopes that the film would either be exactly like the game (which was completely strange and doesn't explain much and leaves it up to you to decide what it all means) or a little bit more 'hollywood' and give an explanation to everything. The film was non of the above, it explained parts but then drifted off so I lost interest in the plot and hoped for more scary scenes. I could cope with 'Harry Mason' (who was the the character in the game) not being the main role but I was annoyed that they put parts from Silent Hill 1 and 2 in this film as it makes Pyramid Head have nothing to do with the plot and he just wanders around, but after some thought I suppose its because The sequel to the first Silent Hill is Silent Hill 3 so leaving out Pyramid Head from Silent Hill 2 would be sacrilege. (he is the best character after all).<br/><br/>There were some great parts of the film which i wont spoil and the look and feel was exactly like the game. Especially the first scenes in Silent Hill. I kept on wanting some jump-out and shock scened from the games cut-scenes but was left disappointed. They used the music from the game which i was happy with but it didn't have that 'urgent scare' type music like the game when the monsters appear. I cant say i didn't enjoy it but I was hoping for more. No where near as scary as the game and doesn't have the same scare factor when the monsters appear."

","I saw this movie this afternoon and thoroughly enjoyed it. Granted, I don't play video games (my expertise in that arena ended with original NES), but I enjoy horror flicks, especially psychological thrillers. This fit the bill perfectly. Not once was I completely sure what was going on, and that only added to the appeal. It leaves so much to the imagination, allowing the viewer to make up his or her own mind about each scene and, ultimately, the ending. The film doesn't have many ""jump"" scares, but remains creepy and foreboding throughout. Beginning with the haunting opening scene, I was literally on the edge of my seat, wracking my brain and trying to figure out the twists and turns of it. My husband and I spent at least an hour afterwords discussing our own opinions as to the plot, subject matter and the like. Brilliant. For those gamer fans, perhaps this may be a let down. Even I know this is a popular series and I'm sure players have unusually high expectations about the film in relation to the games. For me, though, this is one rare occasion where I can say I was glad to spend the exorbitant amount required to get the ""theater experience"", and will likely purchase the movie on DVD when it is released. Recommendation: Free your mind of expectations, and go see this movie. If you can do that, it will undoubtedly entertain you for what it is - a first rate thriller - and will definitely provoke some interesting conversation."
"laioren","9","1","3","24 April 2006"," It'll make your soul hurt good!
","If you wanted a reason to make your soul hurt, in a good way, go see Silent Hill. Silent Hill was one of the best films I've seen in the last several years. It was also, by far, the best ""video-game to movie"" film thus far made. Lastly, this is the best ""horror"" film ever made, and the template by which other horror movies should follow. Japanese inspiration plus French direction plus American budget equals sweet, sweet, psychosis. This movie is not for the faint of heart, or the psychologically impaired.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is not a ""horror"" movie. It is not a ""scary movie"" either. Silent Hill has long been my favorite video game (with its sequels ranging from fairly awesome to slightly cool) and both that first game and this movie better fit into a genre name I thought up years ago that I always wished would have a movie made in it. Silent Hill is a terror film. Its objective is not to make you ""jump."" Its aim is to disturb you and make you hurt in all the places that you don't want to hurt. The kinds of places you can't put band-aids on.<br/><br/>The monsters of Silent Hill aren't ""monsters,"" they're all the worst stuff that's ever happened to you. The monsters of Silent Hill are the kids in your school that called you bad names, the surgeons that cut you when you didn't know why, the betrayals of your parents, and, apparently, the janitors that molested you. They're very well constructed psychological archetypes for real world events that deeply scar and shatter human lives.<br/><br/>Now, for the bad parts.<br/><br/>First, for some odd reason, even though the acting was superb and the lines were often really, really good, they were not worked in well.<br/><br/>Second, and this is by FAR the biggest failing in the film. It has a single, major, non-objective correlative that ends up figuring in rather importantly into the end of the film. Since I don't want to give out too many spoilers, I'll leave it at this; at one point, someone that hasn't been built up as the ""surrendering type,"" seems to go out of her way to surrender. This totally seemed out of character.<br/><br/>Third, there is a WHOLE scene that doesn't need to have been in the film. It's a very long scene used to explain the plot of the movie, and it's awkward and doesn't fit. Now, let's talk about what was just simply amazing about this film.<br/><br/>First, this film had a message, a point, AND used metaphors! And this wasn't even and independent film. Wow, that's like getting to have sex with someone you think is hot, AND is a good person that likes you.<br/><br/>Second, the film does a great job of making us sympathize with the ""good guys"" in the movie. We care about Sharon, we care about Rose, and we care about Cybil. And by care, I mean, ""hurt with."" It is positively torturous to endure this film because of how poorly it treats these characters. This, of course, is the deranged beauty of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Third, what it does to that sympathy. All I'm going to say is, by the end of the movie, I had been cinematically raped.<br/><br/>Fourth, the film is explicit, without being gory. It never once uses the viewers' reaction to violence to substitute meaning. It uses violence to punctuate it. And thus, a world is conjured for us where there is meaning, purpose, and most importantly, consequence. Gore has no consequence, thus, this is not gore.<br/><br/>Fifth, all the technical crud. I'll use this to simply say that the acting, music, and sets were amazing.<br/><br/>Sixth, the subtlety of the film (with the exception of the ""explanation scene"") is amazing. Very little outside of the basic plot is ever fully exposed through the direct narrative. Instead, even after hours of thinking about it, I'm still finding metaphors that I didn't first realize were there.<br/><br/>Here comes a bit of a spoiler, so skip this paragraph if you want. The seventh awesome thing is the inclusion of Sean Bean's character, Christopher, because he's the representation of US who played the game!<br/><br/>The important factor involved in whether or not you will like this movie is how much you can sympathize with someone. What would you do if your child was in danger? Are we talking, ""danger from getting hit by a car?"" What if her soul or mind was in danger from horrible trauma, or friggin' demons! Would you go just as far to help? What if she was your adopted daughter? Even if you would go ""all the way"" to help her, are you ready to face the idea that your best efforts might NEVER be able to heal her or save her? Would you still stay as emotionally convicted to that child? Some important questions to ask yourself as you plan your trip to Silent Hill.<br/><br/>This movie was phenomenal. I hope that its brilliance isn't dulled by the opaque fog of the average American movie go-er's mental horizon.<br/><br/>I have not stopped thinking about this movie, even though I saw it three days ago. I am very unhappy about where it left me, and couldn't be happier about that! Go see this film now so you can test the limits of what you'd do for someone you love.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Silent Hill remains the last chance a person has at salvation. If you have to go there, you already know you're on your way to the ""not so happy place."" It is the very last chance given to those whom God cannot save, so he allows them the Devil's opportunity to earn their forgiveness. Either way, it will always make your soul hurt good."
"dostephe9","Null","1","3","23 April 2006"," See this movie
","Silent Hill is an excellent modern horror movie that completely avoids the trappings of its contemporaries by giving tone and character first priority and eschewing the cheap scare tactics and gotcha! surprise jolts that have become so cliché and indicative of a lack of true vision in the genre. I was almost completely unaware of the game before seeing this movie, and I was not affected either way, I think; this film stands solidly as a nightmarish world that completely engulfs the viewer and has its own perfectly realized set of rules and logic. I do not understand Roger Ebert's lack of ""understanding"" of the film - everything that needs to be understood is explained in an artful, seamless manner. The strengths of this film are many, but what stands out (as Ebert did actually mention) is the incredible attention to set detail and the horrific and painterly style in which the denizens of Silent Hill are brought to life. We, as a modern audience, are now so accustomed to seeing CG elements in fantasy films that our brains acknowledge them, but still quickly accept the just barely perceptible non-reality of it all; surprisingly, Silent Hill achieves most of its thrills the old-fashioned way, sans computer, and the effect is breathtaking. You can really FEEL the difference - the buildings, the creatures, the danger is all present on screen, in such a human-scaled way. This movie is one of the most visceral I have ever seen, and is the most engrossing horror film since the first Hellraiser; I would even put it alongside such psychological horror classics as Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. And like The Shining, the location itself is a character, and a hauntingly fascinating one at that. Yes, it is that good. The acting is first-rate, the screenplay by Roger Avary is tight, propulsive, and downright creepy, and the ending is so anti-Hollywood-easy, that by the time you leave the theater, not only will the outlandish visions stay with you, but the more mundane and human concerns of the everyday type characters will haunt you, too. See this movie."

","This movie is by far the best video game to movie yet. I read on here everyones complaints and the good stuff too and wasn't near ready for what I saw. This movie tries hard to stick to the 1st ps1 video game plot and from what I can remember it was very faithful. It was quick, (being they only had 2 hours to do a 10 to 15 hour game) but it was like a good trip down a scary memory lane. If you played silent hill 1 or any silent hill for that mater... see this movie... ignore the complaints... see it for yourselves. I will be taking my wife to see this movie next (I will be buying this movie and maybe silent hill 1 for ps1 again), my best friend (which said it was the best horror movie he's EVER SEEN)and I saw it tonight (he's only played silent hill 2)and He liked it too. Only wish the makers of doom and resident evil could have seen this movie first then maybe they would have made a movie more like its game. But hey one can hope this will be the start of things to come. Tell Uwe (I don't know if that's spelled right) to see this movie before he makes another great game into a bad movie, maybe he can learn how to transfer the script of the game to screen like the guys behind silent hill did."
"ohwail","6","1","3","23 April 2006"," Not bad, could have been better.
","This was not a bad crossover from a video game to a movie in respect to some other movies that were made from similar genre such as Alone in the Dark, which was terrible, and Resident Evil. In addition I played every one of those video games. I understood there was going to be some compromise from fitting in a 9-hour video game story into a 2 hour movie, but for any of you who played the game would realize that the characters a bit different (No Harry Mason) so is the story, which kind of lost me for a bit.<br/><br/>The one thing that kind of stuck out to me was the overwhelming CG through out the movie I heard some villain monsters were actually costume get up, and I think I could tell which those were, but undoubtedly there was a lot of CG here which in some sense didn't make it as realistic enough for me and that where some of my voting points where gone to. The other aspect that lost out some points from me was the Acting, I am no movie critic and I usually don't point out acting, but for this one I have to point it out because it was sticking out like a sore thumb. There were a couple of scenes where the main character plus some others seem like they were acting in a school play.<br/><br/>Overall the creepiness of the movie I think kept the movie interesting, however I think I was more creep-ed out when I played the game. So if there is absolutely no other movie you want to watch and you like the creepy ones this one was not bad, but I would hold out for the DVD."

","First off, i have been a huge fan of the silent hill games and have played all of them. The movie really does a great job conveying the visuals from the game. The fog is awesome, the creatures look perfect, pyramid head is the best looking one in the film. The soundtrack is great too. The music from the game i thought always sound good and gave a real eerie feeling but here is sounds so much better. But all these great visuals cant make up for the rest of the movies pit falls. The first thing i noticed was that the acting was pretty bad. Every ""it's going to be OK"" line made me laugh. The story line didn't make much sense. It didn't seem very thought out. Bottom line: Worth a view just for the visuals and fans of the game should see it."

","By far a movie which could stand on its own. The essence of silent Hill was definitely well captured and it far exceeded my expectations. I felt similar to the way I felt when first playing the Silent Hill games. If you have played the game then you have to go see it and if you haven't than you still have to go see it. Idiot critics like Ebert even admit that they couldn't figure out what was going on. Perhaps this work of art may require more than one viewing for the layman to fully grasp. Silent hill fans will also note the excellent musical score which lends to the creepy atmosphere. Also, I'm sure much has been saved for the sequel which I surely hope will be made. Go see it twice!"

","Wow. Just Wow.<br/><br/>First off, let me say how impressed I was with the cinematography and music behind this flick. I knew from the trailer this was not going to be another video game movie'. The story is simple. The protagonist, Rose takes her daughter to a town in West Virginia that she continues to see her in dreams. A town called Silent Hill. A swift departure from such 'movies' as Stay Alive or even The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Silent Hill takes the viewer to the very heart of Hell.<br/><br/>Surrounded by darkness and beings plucked straight out of nightmares, this film is unlike any other horror flick. It does not rely on ""BOO!"" or gore gags to grab your attention. There is a little gore; however, the few scenes involving such things give you quite the shock and unease. The Acting is not Oscar quality, but still note worthy. Especially Jodelle Ferland's duel role as both victim and tormentor.<br/><br/>I am not going to give any of the plot away, but if you've ever taken a sociology class, you'll notice a lot of other things going on in the back.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>B+<br/><br/>Hey, scared me."

","Hey, my daughter is sleepwalking and saying ""Silent Hill!!"" Tonight I better rush right out to a ghost town I located on Google and see what's up. What a stupid intro to a movie. This movie had great atmosphere and the more frequent use of models instead of computer graphics was great but the story was horribly developed and delivered. People who were satisfied with the story quality probably tape and collect re-runs of ""Full House"" on their spare time. The director obviously knew the story was weak so he crams 20 minute back-story scenes narrated by people who suck at voice work. The movie wasn't scary at all, unless you define scary as being startled by your theater's 10,000 watt surround sound from cheese ball ""Boo!!"" tactics. It's easy to be startled and jump out of your seat when you're half asleep from the stupid story and bad acting from the entire cast. Save your money and download this movie off the internet, or play the game which had ironically much better acting, story lines and kept you from falling asleep."
"TheScottman","3","1","3","23 April 2006"," Johnny Cash?
","I would like to start off saying I have not played the games, so I watch this movie as a ""Movie goer."" I was disappointed, I notice a lot of camera views like I would see in a game and I thought ""That's smart."" Then it's about an hour into it and all the camera angles are still in video game view and I start thinking ""Am I playing a video game?"". I understand that keeping the camera angles were for the ""fans"" of the games, but they did get annoying. And did they have to keep the dialogue from the game? <br/><br/>My friend that played the game turn to me about half way through the movie and said ""A video game trying to be a movie and a movie trying to be a video game, somewhere in the middle there is silent hill."" I laugh this off, but then I realize I wanted this. I always complain when movies mess up video games (Mario brothers, Street fighter, Double Dragon, Resident Evil, etc.) I always said they should make them like the game, but would I really like an hour and a half of mario saving the princess from bowser about 14 times and every time it's a little bit harder? or an hour an a half of non-stop fighting of the street fighter crew?<br/><br/>The answer is no, so I have to change my ideas on video game movies. I think they should hold onto the plot of the game, but make it still enjoyable for movie fans. I still think mortal combat is the best video game movie, not great but had both plot of the game mix with a movie atmosphere. Maybe it'll be just better for Video games to stay as video games, Books to stay as books, and movies to stay not remade. Then again what else would I write this long review for?<br/><br/>P.S. Johnny cash's ""Ring Of Fire"" about twenty minutes into the film was the best part of this movie!"

It was scary, creepy, and gory which is perfect for any horror movie. All the characters were really good and the acting was OK. Plus the demons they created for the film were really scary my favorite who doesn't have a name I call him the Executioner, he is this huge monster surrounded by cockroaches with a sword the size of a street light.

","For sake of not mentioning spoilers I will keep this short-- the storyline is quite different from that of the first game, which has similar but for the main part very different basis. As the summary implies, it was horrible according to Silent Hill plot but as a movie in itself it was excellent. I give it a ten out of ten only to boost its overall score, because it definitely deserves better than a 7.0. Also, I did like how everything was explained, as it was not too dramatic, but it wasn't too dry as you may see in some movies with entire summaries near their end. My suggestion to anyone who has not played the game: go see this movie, if you thought any of these piece of crap horror movies lately were scary, then don't see Silent Hill or you'll freak out in the theater. If you have played the game: go see it anyway, just to see its main differences and similarities, so you can either hate it or love it for both. Overall; I enjoyed this movie, but couldn't help pick out many things that had nothing to do with the game."

While I thought it was very creepy and shot well,I thought it was unevenly paced,some of the dialog was week and the overall plot of the story could have been better. I have not player the game,so I'll assume that it can explain one major question,that for some reason,the filmmakers decided they didn't need to answer. If you have not seen this movie,let's just say you'll be scratching your head at the end. Ultimately, if you are a fanboy,you will probably love this movie. If not, then you should probably wait for it on video. If you absolutely have to see this movie,go in with great reservation and maybe you won't be disappointed.

","Silent Hill is a fantastic movie and is unarguably the best game to movie conversion there is - I can't imagine a single fan of the game being disappointed and more importantly fans of the horror genre can finally see a movie that takes them to a nightmarish world that refuses to hold back. While the story is close to the one in the game, there are substantial differences as well - so with this the game and hopefully subsequent movies all have 'different' adaptations of story lines.<br/><br/>The only fault one could say the movie has is that one 'may' find the plot difficult to understand towards the climax but its important to note that a trademark of Silent Hill was always analysis and openness - nowadays movies are too happy to spell everything out for the audiences while in this series, one can finish seeing the movie and actually have to 'think' to decide what is occurring. However its much more easy to understand that the extremely complex plot of the original game yet still being faithful and so for fans - this is a must, and for non fans hopefully this will being you to a place we have enjoyed for so long and hope you will start enjoying :)"

","As we all well know by now, horror is an all but dead genre. To achieve anything with ""Horror"" being associated hand and hand with your film, you have to be crafty, you have to be original. Understanding that Silent Hill is first a drama, then a thriller/horror, it is a film that pulls of a very successful balance.<br/><br/>Christophe Gan's Silent Hill is the film adaptation of the widely popular four parted video game series of the same name. A young girl, Sharon, has spells of sleepwalking, which always end in cries of a place called Silent Hill. Sharon's mother Rose, played by Radha Mitchell decides that taking Sharon to this place called Silent Hill might make her problems go away. However, what she finds in the cut off ghost town of Silent Hill is a life or death fight to find her daughter who has gone missing in the thick fog of ashes that constantly rain down there. By overcoming her fears, Rose slowly begins to uncover the dark secrets that lay buried deep beneath the city, the secrets that are ultimately linked to her daughter. The plot is straightforward enough, a story of a mother fighting to save her daughter, yet is heightened by many factors.<br/><br/>To start, there are very few films, especially in the horror genre that can match the consistency of the cinematography in Silent Hill. This is where, along with other details that amateur viewers reviews fail to deliver a complete view on Silent Hill. Whether you liked it, hated it, or did not care one way or another for it, it is impossible to ignore what Silent Hill achieves visually and artistically, because it is in fact a visual marvel. As ironic as it may sound, the grotesqueness and Gothic-esquire of the settings illuminate an incredible beauty that is consistent throughout Silent Hill. Gan's did a phenomenal job with the falling ash to create an unsettling and eerie yet captivating aura around Silent Hill With it being known the use of CGI was scarcely used in the film, I am amazed more people are not talking about the seriousness of Silent Hill taking an Oscar for best Costumes/Set Design. The creatures of the film are phenomenal. I can honestly say that in no film have I ever seen such imaginative and horrifying creatures done so convincingly. For fans of this genre, the gore and slayings, oddly as it sounds, are highly rewarding, sophisticated and yes, appalling.<br/><br/>Also on par with the aesthetics of Silent Hill is the expert cinematography and editing of the film. Return Gan's cinematographer Dan Laustsen and editor Sébastien Prangère, whose work can be seen in Brotherhood of the Wolf, display a very disciplined and controlled level of suspense and horror in Silent Hill. A great example of how well these two play of each other is a scene where a crucified corpse, serrated in barbed wire, becomes reanimated, chasing Rose. While Laustsen horrifically catches fragments of the creatures face, lashing tongue and tearing skin, Prangère keeps the horror alive by taking these fragments and throwing them in a frantic order against Rose's desperate escape.<br/><br/>Another aspect of Silent Hill that deserves applause is the sound. The soundtrack and sound editing are both highly attractive and effective in point. On several instances Silent Hill takes the audio and plays on the interaction of characters with the environment; Rose's hearing temporarily distorted with her body slamming to floor. The film's soundtrack by Akira Yamaoka, who did the original soundtracks for the Silent Hill series as well, returns to create the most modernly fitting horror style soundtrack to date; it is a gorgeous arrangement.<br/><br/>While I was impressed with so much in Silent Hill, there were certainly aspects that I found to be less than impressive. The most obvious is what seems to plague all video game based films, and that is the excessive trite dialogue. While it did not prevail so much in Silent Hill, as lets say, Resident Evil, there were still enough lines to make you feel embarrassed. I have noticed that the source of the bad dialogue in this genre of films almost always stems from one source: the overly aggressive female sidekick. And you can bet that Silent Hill has one of those in the form of a pesky butch cop who ends up helping Rose find Sharon.<br/><br/>What I find most people complaining about is that Silent Hill either has no plot or that the plot is too hard to follow, both of which I try to see, but simply cant. The plot is classic and ever present. I saw this film with people who have never played the series before (I have) and none confessed to being lost in the plot or feeling that they were left out by not have played the games, and I would agree. What furthers my confusion on peoples Silent Hill confusion is the films take on the riskiest form of exposition at the films conclusion. It is an absolute form of clarity that if done wrong can completely ruin and discredit a film. However, Silent Hill takes a very unique approach on a technique that few films would touch.<br/><br/>There are also a few occurrences that at first glance you would write off as insignificant to put in the film or just simply unexplained, but Christophe Gan displayed enough control and direction to let those who take a second look know that there is another story here, that these things fell how they fell for a reason, and that reason is no doubt with the success that Silent Hill is receiving, a sequel. With the conclusion that Gan's chose for Silent Hill, it is obvious that everything that has to be said was not said in this installment."
"mrplaid2001","7","1","3","23 April 2006"," The best movie-to-game adaptation ever
","Silent Hill is easily the best video game adaptation ever made. Sadly, that isn't saying too much. Director Christophe Gans absolutely nails all of the cryptic mythology of the video game series, and from the art direction it's obvious that Akira Yamaoka, the creative genius behind the video game series, had a heavy hand in the movie's creation. It also fits nicely into the time line of the game series as a prequel to the first game. The movie irrefutably falters in the one area I had hoped it wouldn't, however. Silent Hill just isn't scary. It seems as though the writers and the director were so preoccupied with getting the twisted, byzantine back story right that no one ever stopped to ask, ""This is a horror film, right? Shouldn't we at least try to make it a little scary?"" It actually reminds me a little of why I disliked the first Silent Hill game so much. There's potential for a good story there, but it gets lost among the copious bizarro, metaphysical, go-nowhere exposition. That's why most fans of the series agree that the second game has the best story. Silent Hill 2 is a much more personal tale as it pays little attention to the series' confusing mythology. Gans actually said in an interview (in EGM, I think) that he thinks the material from the second game would have made for a better movie than the first one. I agree. So here's hoping for a sequel."
"SilverKiento","8","1","3","23 April 2006"," This movie will make your skin crawl...
","This is simply the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. I'm not much for watching disturbing movies because of the imprint they leave, but I just couldn't keep away from this movie. Having played the first game, I had thought the movie would be very similar to it from just the previews. I WAS WRONG. There are a lot of elements and similarities between the first game and the movie, but they're different enough to be fresh and new. People who've played the game know exactly what to expect, and will be on the edge of their seats waiting for it to happen. The movie won't let you down. The first encounter with the creatures alone will make your skin crawl and will exceed your expectations. It's just wonderful and disturbing at the same time.<br/><br/>Music and SFX, a lot of the songs were taken directly from the games. The tracks not in the games work just as well, keeping a creepy atmosphere, even when things calm down. I have no gripes with the music. The sound effects are haunting, especially the ones the creatures make.<br/><br/>Visuals, this movie is very beautiful and well done. The greatest show of visual effects are when the sirens go off and all hell breaks loose, literally. The paint and plastic peels off the walls and falls to the ground like wet paper. It all looks real and somewhat disturbing, seeing an Elementary School turn into a sort of slaughter house. That's why it's so great. The creatures will make your skin crawl as soon as you lay your eyes on them. Most of them are real actors in costumes with some added effects. The way they move is disturbing in its' own. Such things I cannot fully explain. You'll just have to see to know what I mean. Also... a contributing factor to how disturbing this movie is.. the gore. It seems like there was no border, no restrictions on the gore, and it was all well done.<br/><br/>Plot, the plot of this movie is good and well written along with the script. Like I said before, there are some similarities between the games and the movie, but not too many. It usually seems like you think one thing is going to happen, but then something else happens. The story does not disappoint unless the viewer is a person that likes a lot of crazy twists and turns, this movie does not have it, but some movies just don't need it. Mostly you're just guessing who's going to die and who won't die.<br/><br/>Acting, the acting was fantastic, I had no problems with it, even Sharon had a very good actor, her body language was dead on with every line. It's the acting you'd expect for a great movie such as this.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved this movie and I will definitely buy it when it comes out. The only problem I had with this movie was the ending, it just doesn't satisfy, but there's one thing you do know by the end of the movie, a sequel is in the works. However, it still doesn't make up for being unsatisfying. It's the kind of unsatisfying where you watch a movie, get half way through, and then turn it off. It leaves you wanting more. Perhaps this is some kind of marketing ploy, I don't know, but I can tell you this, I can't wait for the sequel."
"PawnShadow","9","1","3","23 April 2006"," It felt like I was playing the game.
","This was a good movie. It was not a great movie.<br/><br/>First, I want to talk about the game aspect. Anyone who has played Silent Hill will like this movie. If you have not played Silent Hill, there might be parts of the movie which you will not understand. The creatures were just like the ones in the game. Even the pyramid head level bosses, and the sexy nurses in the hospital. The music was fantastic and creepy. The theater rumbled in the places where the controller would vibrate. The deviations between the game and the movie were minor, and quite expected and forgivable.<br/><br/>Now for the movie itself. The acting was fair. Some of the dialog which was spoken at a tense moment caused the audience to burst into laughing. The role of the policewoman was really a waste. The role of the husband was interesting. It makes me think...SEQUEL. The computer graphics in the change to the reverse scenes was good. Star Trek fans will recognize Alice Krige (Borg Queen). She plays the bad person again.<br/><br/>In conclusion: Silent Hill fans will like it. If you have not played Silent Hill, watch the movie...the play the game. The game is even creepier than the movie. Especially Silent Hill 2."
"SushiJin","5","1","3","22 April 2006"," Good visuals, but horrible dialog....
","This movie had potential, but a ridiculous script in certain scenes made the audience laugh, when that obviously wasn't the desired affect. The acting was spotty at times, but it was serviceable for the most part. With the dialog they were given, even Deniro couldn't carry off some of the lines. The cinematography was spectacular, and this was most certainly the highlight of the film. The creatures were pretty well crafted, and they did bring some chills along the way. I will agree that this movie is one of the best video game to movie transfers, but really now, is that saying all that much? If you like the game, I'd venture to say you'll like the movie. But the plot is comic book-esquire to say the least, and I found myself looking at my watch throughout the movie. It's not a horrible movie, but it's terribly flawed in some ways, and if I had it to do all over again, I'd save my money and maybe just rent it instead."
"Berryannp","9","1","3","22 April 2006"," One of the best horror movies I ever Seen
","Silent Hill is a not your typical horror movie. Unlike most horror movies it contains a plot one must actually make an effort to follow. But it is like other horror movies in the sense that it is creepy and gory; it just does so to a higher degree with an atmosphere so twisted it as interesting as any of the characters. The characters, by the way, are well acted and fit into the plot seamlessly. The monster characters were sinister and all seemed to have a surreal and unique design to them. If your are a fan of gore like myself you will come to appreciate the detailed death scenes and creativity of the executions. The soundtrack added to the eerie vibe with its ambient tones and slow tempo. The only complaint I have is that I wanted to see more of the dark world portrayed in the movie, because it was so intensely eerie, immersive, and thrilling that when it was gone it left me with an adrenalin rush withdrawal. There were also some spots where they could of used props over computer effects to deliver more realistic effects, but the computer effects were by no means sub-standard. All in all, This movie was deep, evil, surreal, immersive, and had its fair share of action scenes. Its a must see for any horror fan and has set the mark, in my opinion, for all horror movies to follow."
"wild_martian","9","1","3","22 April 2006"," A great depiction of the Konami game 'Silent Hill'
","For starters, the movie is a little over two hours long, but I does a tremendous job at portraying the creepy feel of the video game. It contains many familiar to fans sound effects such as background music, steps, echo and gunshots. Even a non-gamer will realize the quality of the the ambiance and mood attained throughout the two hours.<br/><br/>Crew and cast feel well suited for their respected roles, which allows the movie to grow on the viewer as it is a slow-paced thriller. Sean Bean(""LOTR""-Boromir, ""National Treasure""-Ian Howe) sells a solid performance as the concerned husband(Christopher Da Silva) and contributes nicely with timely placed secondary action and dialog. Rose Da Silva played by Radha Mitchell occupies the screen for the majority of the time and with great reason. Quality acting and action is at stake and Mitchell delivers with a Bang! Her mannerisms, gestures and sheer dedication stands out in a bland sea of game/comic to movie crossovers. Wonderful acting in a thriller is also rare, but not here, its present and it shows.<br/><br/>Visuals are simply amazing and stay true within the game's color palette. Within this scope, the enemies are plentiful and present a constant tension against the heroines quest, which proved solid at keeping action fresh. It featured numerous ghouls, monsters and night-walkers with a variety of gore and freight value. It does so in a just suited way and stays back of overpowering the main story. All in all, the graphic Konami valor shines through and pins 'this' winner on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Altogether, this movie will deliver on it's promise and will not disappoint. A standout amongst crossover failures and a big hitter amongst the current choices. A perfect not-so family film, so be cautious of the visuals as they are bang on for delivering the chills and thrills compliments of Konami."
"Havoc1","9","1","3","22 April 2006"," It has it's weak moments, but by the end you'll leave astounded.
","As a small preface: I am one of the most sarcastic, critical people on the face of this earth. Even when I'm a fan of something, I'll tear it to shreds. This November's RENT comes to mind.<br/><br/>But Silent Hill was definitely an experience. It had its weak points. It did have some bad dialog. And it did have some very blatant plot devices. But good lord, at the end will you ever walk away stunned. And I think that -- more than anything is the point.<br/><br/>The good: The visuals. Good lord, the visuals were absolutely amazing. Every character design, creature manifestation, and set were of the highest caliber. Silent Hill did create Hell. It was Hell. And it was a damn fine looking horror film. Bar none. If you want atmosphere, this film has it in droves. DROVES.<br/><br/>And really, that's it. The visuals make this movie, and they make it in every possible way. But really -- this isn't a drama, or a comedy, or action, or mystery. This is horror. Raw, suspenseful horror. And what more is there to horror than the visuals? Not much. Acting -- great for the genre. Script? Wobbly, but it worked. And that's about it.<br/><br/>There are a few negatives that are ham-fisted and did bug me throughout: <br/><br/>1. The OVERUSE of music! I know Director Gans wanted to use music from the games. And the music from the games is of high quality and very good. But there must have been 30 or so tracks squeezed into this flick -- most of it was ill-placed, and ridiculously short. Shot of Rose running from point A to point B: cue 15 seconds of random Silent Hill music track. It was suffocating and broke the tension of being alone in a ghost town.<br/><br/>2. Speaking of breaking the tension: the inane husband/Christopher subplot. It felt as though a producer said ""We need subplots! And Men!"" and tacked this in. Right as you were getting gripped into the terror of Rose's journey, it would cutaway to her husband searching for her, or looking through archived files. It would have made more sense for Rose herself to find some archive or record. Given that the town is some ethereal ghost-realm, it doesn't seem so out of place for a file to appear for Rose (and the audience) to piece it all together.<br/><br/>One gripping scene in the school was just butchered through the juxtaposition of the husband side-plot. Rose encounters one of the most -- if not the most -- terrifying creature in the film, and the tension is broken by splicing it with Christopher. AND there was ill-fit music for the scene, to boot.<br/><br/>3. Anna, the walking plot device (among others). The time devoted to the husband side-plot could have been better devoted to Rose uncovering the mystery herself. Some cryptic clues in the school transform into grandiose posturing and needless plot exposition. The character of Anna is worthless in this film, and her lines are so forcibly developed to introduce the film's religious base that it destroys much credibility.<br/><br/>Those are the three main gripes with the film -- most of which stem from just the overuse of loud, ill-placed music and the devotion on the side-plot: which seems more a studio decision rather than that of the scripter or director. Though I may be wrong.<br/><br/>The plot is cryptic, but followable. Forced, but man, it comes together in the end. And for the gamers who feel it was ruined: cry me a river. Silent Hill 3 was a tragedy of storytelling, not Silent Hill the film. The film improved upon this by droves: and Deborah Kara Unger's Dahlia was fabulous.<br/><br/>See this film. You will walk away dazed by the visuals. However, if you're going in a critic, there is enough to mock and not enjoy yourself. Do what I did: go alone, delve into the atmosphere, and by the end you will be absolutely stunned.<br/><br/>It earns every bit of its 9/10 for the horror genre."
"generalwoundwart","10","1","3","22 April 2006"," Great Movie for SH enthusiasts
","Possible spoiler Apart from tying up many loose ends in the series of games, this movie can act as the perfect segway between game one and game two. For those who have played SH 2 will find this movie fascinating. Not to mention the cop is hottie hot hot. The movie adheres rather well to the thriller genre of Silent Hill 2 and 3. The downside is that there weren't enough nurses in the hospital nor did they spend enough time in the hospital, however those who are looking forward to the special effects such as the transition between hell and limbo will be delighted by the hellish world created in the movie, Silent Hill."
"vaughneh","10","1","3","22 April 2006"," A good all round game to film conversion
","Silent Hill, a town shrouded in a permanent fog and also a place where nothing is as it seems. This has to be the best game to film conversion to date, the story closely follows the PS1 game 'Silent Hill' plot very closely but along the way there are entrances from ""charachters"" from the other Silent Hill games.<br/><br/>Anyone that goes to see this film expecting a top notch horror film will be disappointed as the scares are there but just not good enough to cut it as one of the best horror films. This film is more of a thriller than a horror (although it does contain many horror elements in it). If you go along to watch this film expecting no more than a game thats been turned into a film you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount of efforts gone into making this film and it shows that this has to be the best game to film conversion of recent years. If you want this film to make you scare your self silly like the games did you will be disappointed as well as nothing can convey the sense of immersion and fear that you get when you play Silent Hill rather than watch it.<br/><br/>All in all i recommend this film to anybody who wants to watch a great thriller film and for anybody thats curious as to why its the best game to film conversion to date."
"TheLimeyBastard","Null","1","3","22 April 2006"," What a Load of Old Toss
","Now don't get me wrong, I love a good horror flick, but for god's sake, why did I waste good money going to see this one. And what were decent actors like Sean Bean and Anne Krige doing here anyway.<br/><br/>I saw the preview, and thought, I seem to recall the name from somewhere, but couldn't place it, and then about 20 minutes in I remembered, this is another bloody computer game film. There has never been a decent film based on a computer game, and this is not the one that will change that opinion. I gave it a chance, but this film was really lacking in the essentials: plot, narrative, structure, scares, shocks. It does have gore, and loads of it, but you just feel like it serves no point whatsoever. And the ending is total garbage and leaves you with the one really scary thought.....They might actually want to make a sequel....be afraid!!! be very afraid!!!!"
"reno_turkff7","8","1","3","22 April 2006"," Silent Hill: The Game: The Movie
","Unlike most other video game movie adaptations in which an obscene amount of ""Artistic reinterpretation"" is taken, this movie sticks amazingly close to it's source material. While not intending to be a prequel or sequel to any of the games, it's plot basically parallels that of the original Silent Hill. There are variations, such as PH's appearance, or the fact that this movie's cult is counter-intuitive to that of the games (an interesting and easy to follow change). However, on the whole, is captures entirely the suspense and disturbing images embodied in the video games of it's namesake. It could be said the ending is quite a bit of a cliffhanger, and good golly, let us hope they make more, this is the start of something with potential."
"The_Fear","7","1","3","22 April 2006"," It's Amazing What Happens When a Director Puts Forth a Little Effort!
","All the reviews of this movie have either been positive or negative. People seem to either love this movie or hate this movie; I for one am in the middle but leaning more (much more) towards like. Of course going into the movie with the information I had on it is also influencing my review.<br/><br/>Rose cannot accept the knowledge that her daughter Sharon is dying of a fatal disease. Over the protests of her husband, she flees with her child, intending to take the girl to a faith healer. On the way, she ends up driving through a portal in reality, which takes her to the eerie and deserted town of Silent Hill. Sharon disappears in Silent Hill, and Rose follows what she thinks is her daughter's silhouette all over town. It's soon clear the town is not like any place she's ever been. It's inhabited by a variety of creatures and a living darkness that descends and literally transforms everything it touches. The human inhabitants - the ones who are left - are trapped and fighting a losing battle against the Darkness. Joined by a cop named Cybil, who has been sent to bring her and Sharon back, Rose searches for her little girl while learning the history of Silent Hill and that Sharon is just a pawn in a larger game That's the premise of Christophe Gans' game to movie adaptation. I went in to this movie knowing the premise. I've never played any of the games in this series but I really want to. Gans' did a terrific directing job. The sets look amazing. Everything is beautifully shot and he uses some camera angles which I am going to assume resemble the games' angles in some parts. All in all, his directing job is very well done; you can tell he loves this series.<br/><br/>The script for this movie has been under a lot of scrutiny. OK, it's not perfect and yes, it does have some corny, cheesy and out of place dialogue but I looked past that. I could have used without Rose yelling ""Sharon!"" over and over and over and over again. I was expecting Ozzy Osbourne to pop up and share in the yelling.<br/><br/>The acting is what you'd expect in this kind of movie. Who's here is solid, not the best but they get the job done. Mitchell does a great job as Rose while Sean Bean is just there. Jodelle Ferland is good as the child as well. The score is just ho-hum. It's not bad but it's nothing memorable. They use the ""Silent Hill Theme"" too much (don't know if that's the games' theme they're using or the movie's theme).<br/><br/>The effects in this are top notch. The monsters are inventive and creepy. They're unlike anything I've seen. It also helps they're not all CGI. They're people underneath there and there's very little CGI used.<br/><br/>OK, now to the information on why I rated this a little higher than I normally would have. This movie's run time is 125 minutes (approx.). Things seem missing at some places and not everything makes sense at the end. That's because the original cut was longer than King Kong, it was 3 and a half hours! So yeah, lots of things were cut, I guess that's why I'm being lenient to it and not bashing it. I went in expecting that and wasn't disappointed. This gets a higher grade because I understood things got cut out. The movie entertained me anyways. So I wasn't fully aware of what was going on in some places but I was so wrapped up in the world I was drawn into that I really didn't care. That's kind of like Doom, it's an empty empty movie but it's fun. Silent Hill is a movie with a simple plot and things were cut out but it was fun. Was Doom a ""good"" movie? No. Was it a ""fun"" movie? Yes and that's all that matters for a flick like this. I didn't go into this movie expecting gold in the first place and I wasn't let down. I guess the biggest thing that irked me was the ending. I heard about this huge amazing ending that left the movie wide open for a sequel. Sorry, it didn't. Sure, the ending was damn cool but wasn't what I was expecting, which is my fault and not the movie's. I enjoyed the very ending cause we don't get full closure. The ending is enigmatic but it doesn't hurt the film. My other large complaint is that the Sean Bean character really serves no purpose. His scenes only detract us from Rose's situation, a world that we've become a part of and entwined in.<br/><br/>So no, this isn't a perfect movie, not many are. And yes, things were cut out and that will cause people to be lost. Is this the definitive video game movie? Far from it. But I went in knowing this wasn't Gans' true vision, just his best effort to put out what he was allowed and for that I congratulate him. He created a pretty alright video game movie. I'm hoping his cut is a great one. The dialogue will make you laugh and the acting isn't the greatest but it's supposed to be a fun ride and I for one am glad I took that ride."

","Silent Hill was one of the best if not the best horror movies I have seen in my life. Done are the days of the psychological horror genre that audiences saw with The Ring and The Grudge. Don't get me wrong those movies were well done and did scare me at times, but Silent Hill did so much more. You see, Silent Hill does not so much scare you as scar you. When you leave the theater the movie stays with you, that is what a good horror movie should do.<br/><br/>This movie creates an atmosphere of a true nightmare, which is what the world of Silent Hill is all about. This movie stays true to what the games are all about, without relying too much on their fan base. The story to Silent Hill is actually (and surprisingly) very good. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but if you did not want to see it because you thought it would have a crap story, think again.<br/><br/>I found myself truly enjoying this sick demented world of Silent Hill and I believe a lot of people will too. It is a must see for any horror film junkie, and a refreshing film to all those ""PG-13"" horror movies that have been coming out lately."
"rinoaheartily","10","1","3","22 April 2006"," Unique & wonderful video game
","As being a huge fan of the series (Playing all 4 games, acquiring all the endings, secret weapons, and the ability to beat all the games in under 3 hours) - I know the entire series like the back of my hand. With that said, I came out of the movie simply saying one thing ""Wow"" First off, the movie had elements that played off real world events that occurred. In 1962 a trash fire accidentally ignited an exposed coal mine in the town of Centralia, Pennsylvania. Four decades later, the mines underneath the town are still on fire, even as we speak. The government has projected that they will continue to be for at least another 100 years or so. Many of the people in the town evacuated, but some stayed behind! Smoke and steam continue to pour out of the ground, which is visible from highway 61 Silent Hill screenwriter Roger Avary was told this story while he was growing up by his father who was a mine engineer! He apparently researched Centralia while writing the screenplay; Silent Hill, in the film adaptation, is a West Virginia coal town with the trademark fog/smoke/and ashes.<br/><br/>That alone, the eeriness, the emptiness...Silent Hill is completely vacant was the set up for the movie likeness.<br/><br/>So going into the theater knowing that, I was highly anticipating the movie, especially knowing what attention to detail the director & producer had put into it.<br/><br/>ACTION! The story opens and we quickly learn of a little girl named Sharron, 9 years old, who is plagued by sleep walking - which has taken a more dangerous toll, when she waders far from home. In desperation Sharron's mother (Rose) takes her daughter to the place Sharron calls out in her dreams to be, Silent Hill, and thats where it all begins.<br/><br/>From the moment they arrive in Silent Hill, I had chills all over. It was snowing, but it wasn't cold. I felt cut off, and submersed into this insanely creepy world. I was always wondering what was around the corner. Scenes seem to be taken almost directly from the video game, and if you know anything about the video game, you definitely know what that means. The director did a good job at that.<br/><br/>The experience is nothing that I have ever encountered while seeing the movie. I was nervous, scared, submersed into a very well written plot and the very vivid town of Silent Hill in Which the director and the producer worked so hard at making.<br/><br/>Knowing what I do know of the game, I was also pleased that there were only a few minor changes to the story, but other than that it followed 1 & 2 (with a little hint of 3) I was also equally surprised that no new songs had been written, but were taken from the original game sound tracks.<br/><br/>I don't think its fair that I, or anyone else, would judge how the movie goers would react to the movie. The theater was PACKED, not a single seat was open when the movie started. And I also was surprised at the end of the movie when everyone clapped and whistled. People who hadn't played the video game came out ranting how much they loved it. That made me happy to see I give this movie a overwhelming 10 out of 10 Any questions please feel free to email me Rinoaheartily@gmail.com"

They seemed to like it, but since this movie ties into Silent Hills 1 and 3, I don't think they enjoyed it (or hated it) as much as I did. And by ""hated"" I mean, I felt similar emotions that I had felt while playing the games. Even the soundtrack was taken directly (or mostly directly) from the games. I still got goosebumps during some parts, even though I'd already heard/seen similar things while playing alone at night...<br/><br/>Somehow the makers did a great job. The monsters were very accurately recreated. Nightmare Mode was truly frightening. The only parts I found that separated from the game were during the Monty Python witch burning scenes... which were still good, and could have possibly fit in the games.<br/><br/>The locations in the movie were so well made, they could have been from the games. In fact, I'm sure some of the stores and street signs were taken from the games. Of course, the Bowling Alley that you go through in SH2 was there, the School was very similar to SH1's school, and the hospital (although not thoroughly explored...) were similar to SH2, SH3.<br/><br/>I think the scene when Rose was wandering through the fence maze when she first experienced ""Nightmare Mode"" was awesome. Especially when you first hear the horrible metal dragging sound, that announces the release of our favorite monster... Pyramid Head.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. I loved this movie, and probably will see it again. But I don't really think that people who haven't played either SH1 or SH3 (or preferably both) would understand it. Fans of the game would know that all the SH games are interconnected, but 1 and 3 go hand in hand, and also tie into the movie in many ways. Any fan of the games will love this movie. I was sad that there was no mention of the Silent Hill Smile Support Society, The Order, or the mysterious Walter Sullivan. But what's to say there won't be any more movies? :) I have a feeling that the general public will not ""get it"" as much as the true Silent Hill junkies. I, for one, know that I will lose sleep at the thought of many of the images and scenes from the movies... especially in the bathroom of the school :'( <br/><br/>For the fans that are reading this and haven't seen it... you better don your flashlight, make sure your radio has batteries, and grab your steel pipe on your way to that special place... Silent Hill."
"HorrorFan112490","6","1","3","22 April 2006"," First time in years has a crossover been good...
","First off, Silent Hill is without a doubt, the best video-game adaptation in history. The others before have shattered what critics think about these type of movies but this time, someone's got it right. The only drawback is the ending, which made no sense. The effects and atmosphere were so amazingly creepy to when the darkness transforms what the town is to a nightmarishly-sadistic world. Creatures are scary enough to make someone lurch (Especially Red Pyramids little stint in front of the church). Acting was decent, Radha is a leading lady. But, if you go in see this, keep up, because you may get lost if you haven't played the games."
"swimmingfiend15","7","1","3","22 April 2006"," Definitely a different horror experience....
","Well, for one thing I work in a movie theatre and some of the other people who work with me got to see a ""preview"" the night before (basically the managers and supervisors) and I had gotten a really good review of the film. I went at the 9:40 showing the night it opened with a couple of my buddies and we had high expectations.<br/><br/>Now, to say that it was a bad horror movie would be bad. Horror-wise this movie was great: scary, suspenseful, gory. The movie's only downfall is that it is hard to understand at its fast pace...we were left with a lot of questions at the end. Other than a non-understanding factor, I really enjoyed the movie. What also helped me, personally, was that I had just recently played Silent Hill 4: The Room, and so I was on the movie's level a little bit better than my friends were.<br/><br/>Overall, good movie: 7/10 (*******)"
"newsfop","8","1","3","22 April 2006"," Perfect rendition, but then some
","A friend of mine got me into the excitement of watching her boyfriend play the Silent Hill games. We can't play them ourselves because we quite frankly are too intimidated and scared to. However we enjoy the sense of being freaked out of our minds by the neurological horror brought forth by them and find the stories in them fresh and innovative.<br/><br/>To be sure, discovering that a movie was being made had us all ecstatic but suspicious. We're not idiots to the notion that video games are hardly ever represented properly on the big screen as stand-alone features. Nevertheless, we counted down the months and days until the opening of this picture.<br/><br/>When we finally got to see it, the time was 20 minutes past midnight, so the children were sure to be at home. We only had a few annoying college doofs that probably passed the joint around before the show.<br/><br/>But thankfully, the show really delivered on everything that made the games so engrossing.<br/><br/>The set and creature design was spot on. I can't begin to explain to you how disturbing it was to see how the famous creatures from games one and two walked. Maps, clues, keys and puzzles were part of the story as she should have been. Generally, the entire first two thirds of the movie were going in a wonderfully dank and depressing direction. My heart sank every time the town siren sounded.<br/><br/>Despite having worries about the Christopher Da Silva scenes as being convoluted and unnecessary, I didn't have issues with them. They showed an interesting contrast between Silent Hill experiences for different people.<br/><br/>For me, what altered the mood to a less engrossing level was upping the level of inhabitants in the town from four to about 40. The pay off in the end was worth it, but seeing the rise of human element seemed to negate most of the terror. Additionally, I felt that the fate of one of the key characters was a trifle unnecessary to show in disgusting detail. The time could have been spent better on more monster confrontations.<br/><br/>At the end of all things, I think that the depiction was horrifically excellent. Aside from masses which are handled in a strangely cathartic manner, I'd say that the movie was finished OK. Though if a director's cut is floating around in the editing room, I'd certainly want to wait up for that one instead. For some, two hours was too long of a movie. I was quite frankly surprised to see it end so quickly.<br/><br/>It's still the best game to film adaptation, but it doesn't work well as a solitary piece. The doors are left wide open for sequels thankfully. Whether the James Sunderland or the Heather Morris story lines are to be explored remain unanswered, but fans in general will really like what they see in this movie.<br/><br/>And as for poor acting, the characters don't act any worse than the voices of the characters in the games."
"Skaiton","10","1","3","21 April 2006"," Excellent Film! Avery and Gans Deserve Oscars
","First off, this is the first true video game-to-movie adaptation that deserves the term 'film'. Christophe Gans and Roger Avery have crafted an articulate piece of art that is at once disarming, intelligent, and frightening. This film demands repeat viewings if only to fully understand the multi-layered narratives at work throughout the dialogue and action. I've seen this movie twice in a day and, to be completely honest, I was unimpressed upon the first viewing. After several hours of thought I saw the film again and it was a totally different experience. From Dahlia's dialogues early in the film to the melancholic ending reminiscent of the Japanese film 'Kairo' and the Toni Morrison novel 'Beloved', Avery and Gans show that they are not afraid of subverting the audiences's expectations and delivering a startlingly original finale. Many nay-sayers will claim that the film does not follow the continuity of the game (Dahlia as blameless bystander, inclusion of Cristabella, changing the doctrine of the cult) but the game's narrative of Samael and the rebirth of 'God' could be read into the underlying subtext of the film. It is quite possible that 'Dark Alessa/The Reaper' is in fact Samael, or the part of Alessa that, like in the game, embraces the feelings of depression, abandonment, and loss. Special attention should be paid to Jodelle Ferland's performance. Although flat and (dare-I-say) stereotypical within the initial fifteen minutes of the film, she shines with radiant malevolence as Dark Alessa. Radha Mitchell and Lurie Holden are also deserving of praise for bringing a sense of reality to a thoroughly alien landscape. In closing, this is a film that demands a certain amount of thought from the audience. This is a film that exists on many metaphysical layers of meaning which is not quite standard fare for the typical moviegoer. Kudos to the cast and crew, hopefully there will be a sequel in the near future (the story of Christopher going to Silent Hill in search of Rose?)."
"harpster_2004","4","1","3","21 April 2006"," If you love movies based off a game - you might like this! Honest!!
","When the news came out that Silent Hill was going to be made has a movie, many of the games devoted fans were skeptical - and they were right. If you have never played the Silent Hill games or you like movies based off games, then this is the choice for you.<br/><br/>From the very start of the film to the very bizarre ending, you cannot help but wonder if you should have brought your control pad. This movie has its nostalgic moments for those who have played the game, but this feeling will quickly fade due to a lack of plot and a script.<br/><br/>Feelings are that they could have at least tried to make something tangible out of this movie. The town of Silent Hill and its residents are very faithful to the game but sadly, all this is lost on a weak plot and script.<br/><br/>4/10"
"Pemjd","3","1","3","21 April 2006"," Silent Hill takes a more literal than adaptive approach to its conversion.
","As a game, Silent Hill draws upon and adapts many aspects of the human psyche through use of a clever and well paced story with the ultimate effect being that the player is left huddled up whimpering in the corner of their room and unable to sleep with the light off for sometimes weeks on end. As a movie, Silent Hill tries to draw upon and adapt the human psyche through use of a clever and, well just a clever story really, with the ultimate effect being that the audience member leaves the theatre after 125 minuets, probably has something to eat and then goes home to bed. All in all, Silent Hill is the most faithful game adaptation ever, however this turns out to be its fatal flaw.<br/><br/>As for acting, musical score, and cinematography, they all receive pass marks, by no means perfect, (Bean generally couldn't give a damn, Jodelle's monologue was a welcome addition for the films blind and under five audience, Jeff Danna has hammered Akira's delicate score into this film with no real care, the list goes on.) they are satisfactory for a horror genre at least. The film it seems failed at square one, Avary's script.<br/><br/>With ludicrous dialogue, hideous plot advancement, 'good cop/bad cop' changes occurring amongst characters so often you would think schizophrenia was the likely cause and careless 'mood ruining' scene changes in general, the films script should have never been approved by Sony, let alone made into this two hour 'horror epic'. It seems 'Silent Hill: The Motion Picture' would have been better suited being the premise to 'Silent Hill 5', however even giving it that honour, it would plod along and makes sense way too much to adapt the mind like the other four games did.<br/><br/>Gans said once in an interview that he didn't like 'jump scares' because they removed the audience from the illusion of the story, well in this film it appears that he has found a whole new way to ruin the films illusion, that is by cutting to Sean Bean (shouting 'Rose, where are you Rose?', assaulting Nuns and generally being the town vandal) whenever the films 'hell' dimension takes a hold of Mitchell, the only time the film shows real understanding of its source material.<br/><br/>The truth of the matter is that I'm harsh on this film because I love the series, I loved finding my daughter, got addicted to trying to find my dead wife, relished in avenging my fathers death and whole heartedly enjoyed trying to get out of my demon inhabited room. The last thing I want is to see is someone defecating over something that I have grown up with. This film was as important to me as it was to the millions who waited for Harry Potter to make his big screen debut. Unfortunately it hasn't lived up to my expectations, being an entirely different film than I imagined - a film where priorities lie on the look of the source material rather than the feel (or perhaps Gans feels that the look of the piece transcends its mood) and as a result neglects the story, instead delivering a mess and passing it off as surrealism."
"plaid_knight","9","1","3","21 April 2006"," My Thoughts
","The film does a decent job of adapting many different elements from the games and creating a work that feels fairly accurate to the source material. Non-fans of the games may feel puzzled as to just what the heck is going on, but I feel that this movie is for us, the fans who have supported and loved Silent Hill for years. The art direction is worth the price of admission alone. Also pleasant are the Yamaoka pieces of music. I do wish they had not changed the roles of Alessa/Cheryl, Dahlia, and the Order, but that's about the only real gripe I have. Very nice work. I'm looking forward to the extras on the DVD when it comes out."
"Enixfer","9","1","3","21 April 2006"," Proof that not all video game movies are doomed
","One could understand why any fan of video games would try to avoid video game movies. After what was done to House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and Bloodrayne. I thought that all of our gore ridden franchises, where in fact doomed to be just as terrible. that is of course until I saw, Silent Hill.<br/><br/>As a fan of the games, and after witnessing previous video game movies, I was not really expecting a storyline anywhere near the games. Save for maybe a few character references and the town itself. but I was wrong, Silent hill uses a storyline very close tot hat f the first game; wherein a parent loses there child in a strange city and a search then takes place where the parent must find clues and such to get tot he next locale.<br/><br/>The movie replicates that feel of the game quite well, though at some points it feels quite forced and rushed.<br/><br/>Monsters... the game had 'em in spades, and they where terrifying and unique; the movie has them and though not in spades, the creatures are still very unique.<br/><br/>The sound is very nice, playing to the atmosphere( which is also very true to the games themselves)and also carries some songs from the games themselves, which is a bit of a first when it comes to video game movies.<br/><br/>The story, though I have already said was close tot he first games, but not following it exactly, I'll not spoil it but leave it to you to discover.<br/><br/>in closing I have this to say... Fear not Gamers, silent hill proves that video game movies are not doomed forever"
"Quakezero","8","1","3","21 April 2006"," Best Video game Adaptation ever!
","Gamers, we've been burn so many times by these half hearted attempts at a Video game movies. Resident evil is one of my favorite games of all time. So course I was stoked for the film. I was even more excited when I heard that George Romero was attached to the movie. This guy invented the Zombie movie genera. How many people besides Bram Stoker have invented a monster that has inured for so many years, and is part of pop culture? Not many. But to my shock Capcom fired Romero and hired Paul Anderson. And I was like OK he made Mortal Kombat which wasn't bad when I was a kid.<br/><br/>But doesn't hold up at all now that I'm 25. I walked in to RE really excited and came out angery. They've taken the slow paced atmospheric video game and turn it in to an action movie. A cliché, poorly acted , poorly directed, and poorly written film. And its sequel was so jaw drop it was so bad. Its barely a movie. Capcom fired Romero because they didn't like the script. Well if they choose this script over his, than his script must have been uncompromisable. He must have written it form the zombies point of view, complete with zombie dialog. The problem with RE and every other video game film is that the makers had no respect for the source material. They feel that gamers don't like story, that all they want is action. Which isn't true for all Video games anymore. In fact now games are being panned for having bad stories. Where as before all you needed in the way of game story was an excuse to save someone or kill stuff.<br/><br/>That beginning said I was so skeletal when they said that they where turning silent hill in to a movie. This game is all about atmosphere, its not action game in the slightest. But Sony started doing things right. First Kanomi the games publisher was involved form the begging. And they got a director and writer who have actually made good films. Although I was not a huge fan of Brother Hood of the wolf, Its ten times better than anything Uwe Boll or Paul Anderson have made. And I've read in several interviews that Both Christophe Gain and Roger Avery both love Silent Hill.<br/><br/>I personally don't believe that either Uwe boll or Paul Anderson have ever picked up a controller in their lives. They even have the guy who did the sound track for the games doing some of the music. Which really got my attention. I love the music in the games, Both SH3 and 4 came with the soundtrack. I listen to both regularly. So it sounds like everything finally going right with one of these movies for once.<br/><br/>So having seen It I can't say with out a doubt this movie Rocks! For its start to its ambiguous ending. It felt like the game, but it also felt like a movie. A balance that must be met. Doom felt like a game with really people. I mean it even had a first person shooter scene. And RE felt like a bad action film form the 80s. It was nothing like the game at all. If they called RE, Mil Jovovich Zombie killer you won't know the difference. This movie however was the whole package. It had the atmosphere of the game pacing and suspense of a good horror film.<br/><br/>The biggest problem faced by any filmmaker adapting a game, is the fact that your adapting something that 70% of it is meant to be interactive. Stories is important in a game but so is game play (unless your MGS but thats another topic). In silent hill you spend a good amount of time finding keys solving puzzles and killing monsters. Cool in a game but not in a film. And even the story of silent hill isn't one that a main stream American audience would go for. Some things would have to be changed to make a good film. Now in previous adaptation the filmmakers have either completely dumb it down (Paul Anderson) or just ignore everything and make up their own ridiculous story (Uwe Boll).<br/><br/>This film fines that balances. It doesn't betray the game, and its not some geeky fan film. One thing that really surprised me what how gory it was. I mean I knew it would be the games can be pretty horrific but good god. Pyramid head kills someone in a way that really made me cringe. I'm going to see this one again definitely. I happy to say that the curse has been lifted."
"Combo632","7","1","3","21 April 2006"," Huh? What was that?
","Having played the Silent Hill video games I figured, ""Hey, why not see the darn movie."" I have got to say the middle of the movie was pretty good, but the downside to this was the weak beginning and end. At the beginning of the movie you see random things happening for no reason, and the director seemed to like fading out scenes to put in something totally different that would have never made sense otherwise. But like any other video game movie, it is always nice to see the things we do in games acted out on the big screen as best as possible. In my opinion the downside to this movie was the random events that sometimes happened. All in all it was a good movie."
"kb9999","8","1","3","21 April 2006"," Fans of the series will like this
","As a horror movie alone, its not really all that great unfortunately. I will give it points for not relying too much on loud, sudden noises to scare the audience though. It seems every other horror movie employs this tactic and frankly, its pretty lame. I don't pay the kid who drops the heavy book in a quiet classroom 6 bucks to scare me :P. The Silent Hill games rely on disturbing, more psychological means of scaring the audience and the movie at least tries to live up to this. The horrible creatures/features aren't afraid to slowly creep up and stare you in the face so to speak. Sometimes its creepy, sometimes its not but few things are going to try to get a cheap scare out of you by jumping out suddenly and going ""boo!"".<br/><br/>Still, without knowing the background of the Silent Hill series you may find yourself a little lost. If you've played through the first Silent Hill you'll likely recognize a lot of the familiar faces, characters, and plot features. Like all other Silent Hills, some things simply won't be spelled out for you and you'll have to think long and hard after you're done with it to figure out just what it meant/what happened. Fans of the series will have something to look forward to since at least a few loose ends of the series are tied during the movie.<br/><br/>Anywho, if you're a big enough fan of the series like myself you may even recognize some of the music scattered throughout the movie. The movie really tries to capture the atmosphere of the game and it does a decent job of doing it. If you like the game, see this movie. If haven't played it, might want to read up on it a little before stepping into the theater :)"
"alexander-berns","7","1","3","21 April 2006"," Very Good, but far from perfect
","Alright, so I haven't played any of these games all the way through, but am familiar with the environment and idea. I must say that the film overall delivered. The environment and camera angles in the first hour and a half were just like the game. They nailed it in this aspect.<br/><br/>HOWEVER...I must agree with some of you that some of the acting was horrendous. There were some lines in this movie where I thought ""did they really just say that?"" (eg ""i think there was a fire here"" as said by another reviewer) But this can't be blamed entirely by the actress/actor (the screenwriter really) The acting by Rhada Mitchell and Laurie Holden wasn't overall bad, it was mostly some of the minor characters.<br/><br/>The monsters rocked my face off. I think that all of you who find this movie to be awful must have missed this. I thought that the visual effects were true to the game and should be appreciated by those even not familiar. The environment as well was for the most part accurate I feel.<br/><br/>For all of you who have played the games and are still disappointed, you will never be happy with the way a video game adaptation will turn out. Its just like reading a book and finding the film inadequate. It is extremely rare to find a film that is superior to its predecessor, regardless of the media (exceptions include The Godfather). I really like what was done to the movie and found it enjoyable. The last half hour, maybe not as much as the first hour 1/2, but still decent. Go see it, especially if a fan. Horror fans should appreciate the Hellraiser-esq type slow suspense gore film as well."
"talon-28","9","1","3","21 April 2006"," Excellent Adaption!
","Omg! This movie is like fantastic! I was smiling from beginning to end. I'm a fan of the Silent Hill series and a fan of the Resident Evil series but the RE Movie was so bad, just thinking about it is making me want to vomit. I missed the first 15 min of the movie which I heard was the most boring bit anyway but when they got to silent hill, it was definitely worth it. I think cooldude was exaggerating a bit about bringing a pillow if you haven't played the game. If you think about it, even if you never played the game, you would still understand it because it's not complicated like the game and the plot does sideline enough away to stand out on it's own. And the effects were good too. I don't know what ""SFX"" was saying when they gave the movie 2/5 and said the sfx was rubbish and all this, but then again, I know the majority of American minds is incapable of enjoying anything that doesn't go ""Boom"", ""Bang"" and ""Kablooey"" etc. I mean throw few fireworks in the movie and the majority of Americans will be shouting for an Oscar for the movie. Anyway, the acting wasn't bad either. Everyone was very good except the actor that played Rose. There were times when the bad acting was so plain, especially near the beginning. It felt she was straining it. Also during the movie, some of her actions were a bit confusing to say the least.<br/><br/>==============SPOILER============== Like the part when she saw that dead guy in the toilet and pulled that thing out of his mouth. Firstly, I didn't even know he had something in his mouth and secondly, any sane person would try to get as far away from that dead guy rather than put his/her hand down it's mouth!! ===========END SPOILER=============<br/><br/>But thats just the script and not her actually acting ability. Still, if you watch it, you'll see her acting is desperate at times. Almost like this is her big chance for proper Hollywood stardom so she's throwing everything she has in the movie and overdoing it. Yeah i agree with cooldude in 2 things. The ending was lame with the cliché child explaining everything but you have to remember that this IS a movie and movies does have a time limit. Thats why I thought if they had made it into a 3 hour movie, it would have potentially better but I'm still surprised it was 2 hours. I think any shorter and the movie would have been bad. I also agree about the monster fighting bit. I think everyone would have been happy to see Rose go nuts and clobber a monster to death with a pipe! That would have been funny and cool. Instead, all we see is her running and running and running some more... I think Mr Akira was trying to sell his soundtrack or something because the first thing I noticed when when the movie was the original game soundtrack being used, like, every min! You hear 5 second clips literally all the way through the movie! Not good, even though I love the music. It doesn't work in a movie and especially when you overdo it like that. At the end it felt like a tour of silent hill, and all the scenes in the movie were cut and paste from the video game, although slightly changed. Still it's definitely a movie you have to go see."
"zosotatt","9","1","3","21 April 2006"," Excellent for fans, possibly confusing for the rest!
","Whats this? A Video game movie that does not suck? Indeed. While others have taken what was great about the games and tried to make it appeal to a larger variety of movie goers (Resident evil and Doom spring to mind). Silent Hill sticks as closely as it can to the VG, while at the same time not being 100% accurate, fans will be pleased as to how faithful it is. It retains most of the important themes and imagery from the game which is great, and compresses it into a neat little package that runs in at just over 2 hours.<br/><br/>The effects range from good (some monster effects) to superb (the scenery and other more impressive monsters)and really please's the eye. The sound effects were always an integral part of the games experience and the films makers have acknowledged this, the sound effects are top notch and true to the game.<br/><br/>The acting on the most part is great especially for all the main characters, and the make up and costume design is also well done.<br/><br/>All in all it makes for a great experience for fans of the series and most will surely not be disappointed, but people who have not played the game might be at a loss with the story and the general feeling in the screen I was in was pretty much 'what is happening!?'.<br/><br/>If you are one of the fans of Konami's masterpieces go now and watch this film, I am sure you will not be disappointed. If on the other hand you have not played the games, while you will be able to enjoy the film as a straight horror movie, don't expect to come out without think 'what just happened?'

"Phil-531","9","1","3","21 April 2006"," Good Direction Leads to Nearly Perfect Adaptation
","Video game to movie adaptations are very rarely as successful as one would hope. For the most part I blame the directors of these movies, especially Uwe Boll, for their lack of adherence to what makes the games so enthralling. Christophe Gans, however, adheres almost perfectly to the roots of the Silent Hill video games. The use of suspense and sound combined with eerily lit surroundings had me on the edge of my seat the entire movie, and his decision to use actors in latex costumes as opposed to Computer Generated Images is something that I applaud him for. There some touch ups done to the creatures with the use of computers, but the effect one can achieve from the use of actual people playing these creatures is phenomenal. The imagination shown in this movie was also a wonder- there were two particular deaths which were so well done that my comrades and I lept from our seats crying out exclamations not suitable for children.<br/><br/>There were a few minor things that were not ""perfect"" in this film. For instance the subplot featuring Sean Bean did not add much to the film, but on the other hand it didn't really take away either. I suppose one can only blame the studio for this- as I understand it they rejected the original script because there were no male leads.<br/><br/>Even the end credits adhered closely to the roots of Silent Hill- there were parts that actually looked just like the video games, and considering how far some of the games have advanced technically this is not a bad thing. What we have here is a wonderfully realized movie, and an absolutely perfect adaptation of one of the most popular survival horror titles of all time. In short, if you want a good horror movie, a perfect video game adaptation, an example of how to make the most effective movie creatures you can or just a pleasant way to kill a few hours, Silent Hill is what you need to see."
"in_between_days","9","1","3","21 April 2006"," Strange and beautiful
","For so long now the world of video game movies has been one of trad opportunist popcorn flicks... mildly entertaining at best but ultimately unmemorable and disappointing. With Christophe Gans - a confirmed Silent Hill obsessive - this adaptation is easily the best to date, though admittedly not without its flaws.<br/><br/>The first half is striking, beautiful and utterly spellbinding. The on-screen representation of the strange town of Silent Hill, it's foggy streets, it's nightmarish Otherworld counterpart and it's terrifying creatures is quite simply... perfect. Everything from the perfect attention to detail in recreating its streets and interiors, to the movement of the creatures is exactly what you saw in the game. Fans will lap it up. The sound is terrific too, everything from the scrape of the monolithic Pyramid Head's sword to the Janitor's unearthly mumbling is spot on.<br/><br/>In fact it's only in the second half when the emphasis moves away from that covered by the first game that things go a tad downhill. Whilst the new plot elements are fascinating, a little too much time is spent in its exposition and the pace of the movie is dampened by this. Perhaps the biggest problem though is that the atmosphere of this section simply doesn't feel like ""Silent Hill"" enough, yet at the same time you'll probably need an intimate knowledge of the games plot to make the most of it. It's a strange halfway house and I'm not sure what non-gamers will make of it - indeed, I can imagine many feeling completely lost by this point.<br/><br/>Similarly I felt that Sean Bean's role as Sharon's adopted father in the real world should have either been fleshed out a little more or got rid off. There's nothing wrong at all with his performance, but you feel that more could have been made of the character.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the acting and dialogue in the film, but I'm pleased to say that it's far better than I could have ever hoped. Laurie Holden's bold police officer is a stand out, but there's no slouches.<br/><br/>Overall I suspect that fans will love the first half but be disappointed by the second and that the reverse will be true of non-gamers seeing this film. It's an uneven ride which may alienate many, but it's a strange and beautiful one which I'm sure will invite huge amounts of discussion for months and months to come."

","It's not perfect, but Silent Hill is without any doubt the very best game-to-movie adaptation ever done. But more importantly than that, it's a damn fine movie on it's own terms, whether it's a ""game movie"" or not.<br/><br/>The film is very faithful to its source material while allowing the changes necessary to make it a successful film. Silent Hill is a very complex game, and the movie definitely gets the mythology and symbolism of Silent Hill just about perfectly. For those who want to take the movie at face value, I can imagine it might be a little confusing, although still satisfying. But this is a movie so full of concepts and symbolism that it demands to be discussed and thought about on a much deeper level. No matter what explanations are given, things are never what they seem in Silent Hill.<br/><br/>It doesn't so much scare as it does disturb. Instead of going for some cheap scares, it gnaws its way into your state of mind and fills you with so much tension that when it does explode, it's that much more devastating. There are some of really brutal parts of the movie, but the real horror is the tension in between, which are done masterfully. It's MUCH more about story and atmosphere than the run of the mill Hollywood splatter-fest that studios churn out these days. And what a story it is! Fans of the games can breathe a sigh of relief, it's an excellent movie. For the unfamiliar, Silent Hill is a grisly but very satisfying experience. Enjoy."

","The horror movie genre has had a resurrection of epic proportions recently. With the brilliant ""28 Days Later"" and Alexandre Aja's first two pics, ""Haute Tension,"" and his remake of Wes Craven's second pic ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" it looks as though Hollywood has finally been able to get over the 90's where horror movies had plots, characters, and kills that were about as original as their official one sheets, peppered with floating heads. So on to the video game genre. There's Uwe Bol, the worst director working today, vomiting out pictures as quickly as he can find funding, (which is still a mystery)and then you've got Christophe Gans new pic penned by ""Rules of Attraction""/""Pulp Fiction"" writer Roger Avery. <br/><br/>Gans' last American release was the fast paced, bone crunching ""Les Pac de Loups,"" which made horror fans scream with glee at the mayhem. Apart, their work is well above average, arguably great. Together they are bad, real bad. I don't know who's fault it is but ""Silent Hill"" is possibly the worst paced film I've seen in a long time. The movie is literally about an hour an a half too long. There's also the problem of suspension of disbelief. The movie is so hard to forgive for not even attempting to make sense of its plot, bringing in and dropping characters without even the weakest explanation. Radha Mitchell is gorgeous in the lead but her actions are so implausible that the movie ends up bringing out more jeers than shrieks. <br/><br/>The thing is, the movie isn't all bad. There are more than one genuinely creepy moments and the gore, makeup, and sets are top-notch. 3 out of 10. For fans of either the game or just fans of horror in general. Be warned, it will bore you, shock you (in a good way), then confuse you."

","As a lover of the horror genre I usually see nearly every horror film that makes it to the big screen, as well as many that don't. I went and saw this today because I loved how desolate the town looked from the previews and it appeared as if there might be some interesting sequences in the film. I was very disappointed to find that the acting was almost identical to that in a video game, a good idea would be to take the over-dramatic acting from the original Resident Evil game and parlay that into a very long film. Don't take me for one of these lame people who complain about any film stretching two hours or more, there are plenty movies to love that are that long but this one was just BORING. the CGI effects are not very effective and the plot is shoddy and really leaves a sense of not wrapping things up very well at the end. I realize sometimes the plot is supposed to leave you hanging and wanting a sequel but this one didn't do that either. For people who appreciate a true horror film and not most of the garbage that has come out the past few years, this one is no different. Go rent JC's ""the thing"" or the original ""dawn of the dead"" for a much more complete film that truly can actually make us tense up and fear for the people on screen."

","And I was so excited for this; from the trailer I thought Silent Hill was going to be fantastic, because it looked to actually follow the game!<br/><br/>Sadly, the film version was fully botched.

Because your daughter sleepwalks at night, nearly off a 200-foot canyon screaming ""Silent Hill"" On your way to Silent Hill, evade the police for no reason and crash your car.<br/><br/>Once in Silent Hill, cut away constantly to your husband who is trying to find out about Silent Hill, but otherwise contributes nothing to our nothing story. In other words a complete waste of out time. <br/><br/>A two-hour running time for this film was a crime.

","Silent Hill (2006): Dir: Christophe Gans / Cast: Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden, Deborah Kara Unger, Jodelle Ferland: About as exciting as a bad bout of diarrhea. Here is yet another mess based on a video game. Some kid sleepwalks and has horrible visions about Silent Hill where something bad happened. Her mother travels there and battles demons, monsters, religious fanatics, and the urge to masturbate. This film is about as groundbreaking as the last dump I took and it makes about as much sense as pissing your pants above an open toilet. Director Christophe Gans fails to make any sense out of it but in his defence he probably thought that he had a winner because it is...BASED ON A VIDEO GAME! Woo-hoo! Radha Mitchell is totally expendable as the mother. With a performance this bad she would be lucky if any demons would even attempt to scare her. Sean Bean plays her husband who's searching for her. This whole conclusion where he and Mitchell cannot see each other while in the same room is about as exciting as your parents arriving at your fraternity party only to announce that you are going home immediately. Laurie Holden has a pointless role of police woman who gets burned to death. Deborah Kara Unger plays some crazy woman. Jodelle Ferland plays the creepy troubled daughter.

"fedor8","Null","1","4","10 December 2014"," Stuck between a hill and a hard place.
","There aren't many horror films I can think of in which the hero or heroine is stuck between two sides battling each other, both of which are equally nasty. Essentially, this is the premise: a fundamentalist Christian sect lead by a deranged woman (suitably cast with Krige) used human sacrifice to fight Satan (or at least a demon), but they played with fire rather clumsily – literally – which lead to a minor incident in which most of the population got destroyed and sent to some sort of a Hell. (It's too depressing-looking and contains far too many ugly bite-happy insects to be Purgatory.) The girl they burned (?) became the demon's BFF, but because there was still a speck of goodness left in her, a child, Sharon, was ""created"" (don't ask me how); that same girl that had been adopted by Sean Bean and that actress who looks exactly like Roman Polansky's wife, the French actress Emmanuelle Seigner. The two look so much alike that for a long time I didn't realize I was watching two different women in movies! Emmanuele played Satan (or a demon?) in ""The Ninth Gate"", and so we come full circle. (Well, it's a sort of circle; perhaps a pentagram.) We come full pentagram. Polansky privately also likes little girls, so we have at least two circles or pentagrams here to come full to.<br/><br/>Anyhoo Sharon's conception is a mystery (perhaps uncovered in the sequel which I still haven't seen). Is Sharon a clone of the sacrificed girl? To make matters even more puzzling, Alessa herself also didn't have a father, so was Alessa in fact fathered by Satan (i.e. that demon)? I don't play computer games much, so if any of you computer dweebs have the answer – given as how SH is based on a computer game – let me know.<br/><br/>I gotta say I am more than impressed with the results. Re-visiting this movie many years later only increases its quality. I went into this expecting crap precisely because it's based on a computer game – coz that sort of information that doesn't exactly fill me with hope. Quite contrary to my expectations, SH is a visually dazzling trip that shows the viewer a virtual maze of a small-town Hell (is it?); the outdoor scenes are beautiful, the indoor scenes are somber, dark and fascinating. The photography, the beasts, the sets, and the special-effects alone guarantee the movie being well above average. An interesting story helps as well. The director is a Frenchman which explains the film's high visual quality.<br/><br/>Another positive aspect of the movie is that it wastes no time plot-wise, unlike so many horror flicks that take ages to get started. Things get going right from the outset rather than waste our time with small-talk and other introductory nonsense. <br/><br/>The finale is rather well done, though obviously lifted from the ""Hellraiser"" series, and slightly reminiscent also of the finale in ""Dark City"". But, hey: who watches horror movies expecting total originality? The downer ending isn't bad either; perhaps the main reason why the site's rating isn't much higher as it should be.<br/><br/>Drawbacks are few, small and far between. For example, the mediocre dialogue in the church just before the mass-slaying. I thought it was a little on the cheesy side. Kim Coates' cop-portrayal was also a tad silly, but we shouldn't be surprised by such sub-par acting from the guy who brought us that silly ""ungh-ungh-ungh"" semi-caveman character from ""Battlefield Earth""."
"MrsPyramidHead","6","1","4","27 December 2010"," Good horror film? Yes. Good game adaption? No.
","Seeing this movie was quite an experience. I (who have played Silent Hill 1-4) watched it with my sister (who has never played a Silent Hill game) and we reacted completely different. I must agree with her; the concept of a story like this is very good horror material, the build-up and scenery is chilling, the monsters are disturbing (I'm glad that they put Pyramid Head in this one!) and the filming and acting is awesome. If you've had nothing to do with the Silent Hill franchise prior to watching this movie, it's probably a very disturbing, enjoyable horror movie.<br/><br/>But I was disappointed. I don't get the whole Christabella/Dahlia thing. Why did they decide to make Dahlia SYMPATHISE with Alessa all of a sudden and being AGAINST the burning, and throw in a completely new character as the leader of the cult? I'm also very very very disappointed about Harry Mason being replaced by a mother looking for the child. Was there any copyright problems that led them to throw in the Rose character, and change the name Cheryl to Sharon? It would have been so much cooler to see a movie version of Harry Mason - but, on the other hand, maybe they were afraid to disappoint game fans, and that's why they decided to change the characters' names and such.<br/><br/>Seen as a horror movie, it's brilliant. That is the reason why I'm giving it a 6. But as a video game adaption, it's not satisfying enough."

","Please only ever let me have dealings with the people that rated this film as utter codswallop, because anyone who starred it as half decent or above must be on a completely different planet. Without a sun. I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 on account of the special effects, which looked quite good, but to what end? Films like this make civilization seem so pointless. You'd get more out of staring at a cave painting. I'd have enjoyed it more if Sean Bean had stuck with his native Yorkshire accent and told us ""Eeh, by gum, there's nowt so queer as folk"". Or as bad actors, with bad scripts. I'm almost tempted to take back that extra point for fear of misleading anyone into thinking that the effects alone make the film worthy of a viewing."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","1","4","26 November 2006"," Wasted potential.
","Not that the movie is very bad but it's just that the movie, with its atmosphere and premise, had so much more potential than the eventual end result.<br/><br/>The movie suffers from numerous things. One is the build up and story flow. In all honesty this movie has an incredible bad build, which ruins the tension and mystery of the movie. Things happen in the movie too fast, without a proper build up. This way we never really get involved- and feel with any of the characters. It's a distant movie with distant characters and because of that neither the tension or mystery of the movie works out to the maximum. Non of the characters seems to be truly scared or surprised will all the unusual and scary things going on in the movie. It also sort of makes the movie ridicules to watch at moments.<br/><br/>This movie had all the potential in it to become a tense atmosphere horror movie. After all, The Silent Hill games are probably the most atmospheric, tense, mysterious and scary games around at the moment. But as a die hard horror fan I can assure you; this movie is not an horror. The movie really doesn't have any scares in it and although there is some gore, there is very little else to enjoy for the horror. So perhaps it's possible that a non-horror fan will like this picture more than I in the end did. The only thing horror about this movie is its atmosphere. Yes, the movie is great looking and because of that has a great visual look and atmosphere over it but the not so great story, characters, dialog and acting make sure that this movie never becomes tense or scary despite its fantastic atmosphere.<br/><br/>But yes, the movie is definitely still watchable, mainly because of the reason I just mentioned; the visual look. The movie uses some great camera positions (copied directly from the game I presume), good looking sets, make-up and visual effects. The movie also has some great highly imaginative sequences, that perhaps can also be described as art. You could say that this movie is a case of style over substance.<br/><br/>The story begins simple but as the plot thickens the movie becomes more and more difficult to follow. We're introduced to a totally new world and environment but the movie doesn't give us the time to adapt and get used to this strange 'alternative' world. The story also tends to make the movie unnecessary hard and difficult to follow, especially toward the ending, that even comes over as strange and not in every way completely understandable. No wonder, since the story is written by Roger Avary. The man behind the early Quentin Tarantino movies ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". He always tends to write stories with several layers, multiple story lines and other complex writing techniques but in this case it's not for the best of it. The movie suffers from its 'over-done-written' script. A simple understandable for everyone script would had sufficed for a genre movie like this one.<br/><br/>Sorry to say but Radha Mitchell will not grow into becoming a big movie star. This goes for about all of the actors in the movie. Sean Bean also somehow got involved in this movie but to be frank, I don't know why he ever agreed to appear in this movie. He feels out of place and on top of that he also gets very little interesting to do. The only interesting actress in this movie seems to be Alice Krige but her character is unfortunately introduced too late in to the story. Non of the characters are really handled well in the movie and the dialog also isn't always the best, or most realistic thinkable, so that also isn't exactly helping them.<br/><br/>The movie is still good enough to consider it a watchable one but considering the potential this movie in its core had; a disappointing movie, especially from the viewpoint of an horror-genre fan.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"drivenlikethesnow","8","1","4","19 October 2006"," Better than I thought
","I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is the greatest vg film ever made (that goes to The Last Starfighter), but this movie is pretty darned good, nonetheless. Good video game films are very, very hard to come by (Wizard, Super Mario Bros, Double Dragon, anyone?) and Silent Hill is refreshing in that you don't think of it as a film based on a video game, but as a good horror film, period.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like here. The atmosphere of the film is awesome and faithful to the game series. In fact, a lot of the camera shots/angles used in the film are nostalgic of survival horror games. I'm a pretty big video-game junkie, so I got a kick out of it. The film is a bit on the lengthy side, but with the proper amount of suspense and action the viewer can't gripe. The film's cast (and despite lesbian suspicions of Laurie Holden, I personally think she's hot as hell in this film) is not well-known (except for Agent 006) but does a great job and doesn't unnecessarily overact (except for Agent 006). Most noteworthy is Alice Krige (otherwise known as the horny cat-mom from the early 90's Stephen King slump, Sleepwalkers) who plays the McCarthy-esquire town proclaimer of heresy.<br/><br/>And the horror aspects? Oh, how delicious they are. The gore comes in such awesome spurts! It takes a while to get to the good stuff, but there are some great skin-rippin', body-splittin' scenes when it does. The monsters are original and fascinating, especially the helmeted dude with the buster sword. For fans of the video-game series (and we'll throw Parasite Eve in there as well, because it was a hell of a game with some nasty, nasty creatures), you won't be disappointed with the creature concepts and environments.<br/><br/>This is definitely a film for most horror fans to enjoy. Although it's very modern in its directing technique and special effects, fans of the old generation of horror will appreciate it for being one of the better new horror films to come out this decade. You don't have to be a fan of video games to enjoy this film; just pick it up and pop it in your non-PS2 DVD player."
"TdSmth5","1","1","4","16 August 2006"," One of the worst movies ever made.
","One of the worst movies ever. It nearly put me to sleep, long, boring, constant pointless running through hall ways. And frankly, who cared about any of the characters. We're getting to the point were these movie-makers are going to go back to mute films because they don't want to have any dialogue, just fancy visuals. Granted, there were two scenes that caught my attention. one with some creature behind the main character and the camera slowly pulls down revealing this creature. This scene was partially shown on TV trailers. The other the scene with the F117-head guy with the giant knife. That looked very videogamish but interesting. These are just visual curiousities. There was no interesting story, no interesting characters. As usual, after boring us to death with 2 hours of fancy computer effects, during the last 10 minutes they try to cram the entire story and have it all unravel and make sense. by then I just don't care anymore. You can't have 10 minutes make up for two hours on nonsense. I'm sickened by Hollywood anti-male sexism. I don't want to see anymore all-girl-superhero movies. That's a bunch of BS. If they want to keep their girl-power campaign up, fine. Just don't expect me to fork over 9 bucks for their twisted political agenda. And this movie represented the worse of that with male characters added only because studio execs rightfully and courageously protested. he should have demanded the the whole damn script be rewritten."
"silverrain-4","2","1","4","9 August 2006"," Slash, Gore, Blah, Blah - *yawn*. NEXT!
","Apparently this movie derives from a computer game. So? For those of use who don't fritter away time in fantasy video games, we're none the wiser. Comparing movies to books/video games is pointless as it comes to us as one or the other. Making comparisons is senseless. No movie can ever be made the same as a book, by definition. So, moving on ... Silent Hill. Hmm, another gore/slash mock horror flick. I wonder if this type of movie will ever go away and people will get a grip on reality. Probably not, as the vast majority lives in one fantasy or another, i.e. living in the past, or wishing they were someone/some place else. People are addicted to escapism. Probably because the planet sucks as it is - war, famine, politicians etc is enough to make us all seek escapism. But why gore and horror? Why not tropical paradises or happy-ending love stories? This flick (and it is just a flick) is yet another blood spill for die-hards to add to their collection. You can count on one hand the number of these flicks that are actually worth anything or can be called good movie-making. Name one. This one is no different and had me yawning from the start. Radha Mitchell looks like a shagged out Charlize Theron on bad crack. Nice though to see B-rated British TV extra, Sean Bean has done so well for himself in the US. He pops up all over the place these days. Good on ya, mate! Within 30 Min's of this movie you'll see every tired horror movie cliché in the book, and find yourself with a finger on the 'Fast Forward' button, just to skip the director's tedious 'artistic' attempt at suspense, i.e. holding shots for 5 seconds too long. Ho-hum, wherever this story came from, it's just another platform for movie makers to exercise their malnourished imaginations and splash gore on the screen. I gave Silent Hill a 2/10 as some of the FX were pretty good, to a point, then it's all just so much droll repetition. The story (what there is of it), drops us in at the deep-end and from here it's a case of figure-it-out-as-you-watch, which rapidly becomes boring. One just has to try and imagine ANY of the content of this movie in modern day America as feasible, i.e. helpful cops and a town full of bodies no-one noticed, an unbelievable past that nobody investigates, blah, blah. One line is ""We can't have civilians wandering around on their own"". Huh? All 'civilians' now require a police escort? I must have missed the memo. As you watch this flick you'll be tutting and rolling your eyes every few seconds as it stumbles along, trying desperately to incorporate clichés and the lame storyline. Stick with it though; it's interesting to see what happens next, i.e. new characters with no introduction, erratic scene hopping, annoying camera work (reverse panning and vertical climbs), etc. Thirty eight minutes in, my finger was hovering over the DELETE button, but, as I was waiting for a call from Tokyo, I left it running. If the town is so bad, why is there still a sign pointing towards it on the main highway, huh, huh? Silly. Like not one of the 500 million or so casual travelers will explore the town? By the end of the first hour, the script has gone the way of the town itself; disintegrated, and you find yourself realizing that the flick is indeed taken from a PC game, where it should have stayed, safely away from the general public. Alice Krige as Christabella is clearly a fan of Katherine Hepburn and tries her best to emulate her, even down to the hair-do! The zombie nurse scene will have you laughing, i.e. they all have a 36C chest. There's also an annoying 10 Min's of colorized/grainy film where they attempt to tell the story. It merely gave me a headache. The 'theme' is your archetypal, tired old demon and witches, goodness/evil, etc ploy, which is ALWAYS bizarre, inaccurate and wholly unbelievable. Two burly men, repeatedly beating a woman on the floor with lengths of 2"" water pipe are likely to kill her, yes? Not so here. She escapes with a facial abrasion. PlayDoh pipes, maybe? Anyone figure out the volcanic fallout? Was Silent Hill filmed near Pompeii? How many times have you seen the old animated barbed wire/tree branch effect? Brace yourself, they play it to death here (pun intended). You're going to love the closing scene. When someone figures it out, how about enlightening us all? My interpretation is that the camera man fell asleep and the camera drifted. Seriously, if you've nothing better to do on a Sunday afternoon and feel like killing time, Silent Hill is ideal. Just check your brain at the door, you won't need it."

Another problem i had with this film is that it did not stay true to the game completely, well some of the plot correct if you could call it that! Pyramid head was wasted, because he is in the 2nd game for a reason, he had no point in the film,except to rip the skin of a young girl.

","I'm a fan of the game, which explains why I was so eager to see this movie. I know that adaptations tend to ruin the originals, but this film outdid it. And the main reason is that it pretends to be faithful to the story of Silent Hill, but it destroys all the logic within its universe. The first twenty minutes of the movie are promising. Rose is taking her adopted daughter to the strange town of Silent Hill to discover the reason behind her sleep walking and nightmares. The atmosphere is similar to the game at this point: a deserted, foguish town, where it seems like it's snowing. There's no one around, no way out. I remember thinking ""yay, this is good"". But I was wrong. ""Silent Hill"" progressively starts to get ridiculous. In the game, the things that happened were weird, so weird that they scared the hell out of you. Here they seem just absurd and not frightening. The plot then gets even more implausible from there, with a poorly written script, too many plot holes to count and gorish scenes that, aside from making you want to laugh at them, do little to help this ""horror"" movie. The whole explanation behind the events (if you can call that an explanations, because in the end, nothing's explained decently) is frankly silly. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, much less to the fans of the game who will see a great story destroyed in a couple of hours."
"jakesnake323-1","10","1","4","26 June 2006"," Oh yes, there will be nightmares
","I have to admit, after this movie was over, my friend came right out and said ""What the f***?"", but the entire group I was with instantly decided we loved the movie. From beginning to end, it feels like you are inside of a nightmare, and that is something I haven't felt since ""Jacob's Ladder"".<br/><br/>The story basically starts showing a ten-year-old named Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) attempting to jump off of a cliff in her sleep. The second the camera looked down into the gorge she was about to leap into and flew into the fiery pit that she seemed to be seeing in this, I realized that this probably wasn't going to be the average ghost story or psycho-slasher film. The rest of the movie goes on, and when Sharon's mother, Rose, crashes, you are introduced to the foggy town of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>I am going to start out by saying that the visual and sound effects in this movie are amazing. It is easy to tell that the art direction in this movie was closely payed attention to. From fog to gritty metallic surroundings in the otherworld, you will feel surrounded by terror. The music helps capture the essence of what is happening, such as the metallic banging and grinding rhythms that play when the dark side of the town is taking it over, and the sirens that announce the town's periodical disintegration into that world will fill you with dread.<br/><br/>And the horror. Although there isn't many ""jump"" or ""suspense"" scares, that mostly works for the movie than against it. The entire experience feels like one of those surreal nightmares you have every once in a while, the type that changes from mysterious to horrible, and then back to mysterious. I have admittedly had nightmares about the screaming children and pyramid head monster nights after seeing this, and that is a rare thing for me when I see a movie. <br/><br/>While I agree this movie does have some dull moments and a few cheesy lines here and there, it is a sick, intense experience that is not easily forgettable. Yes, you will have to seriously think to understand some of it, but I agree with Lindsay. Since this is a surreal/nightmare movie, not everything is going to be laid out for you. If you don't understand it, that doesn't make it a bad movie. Even though I've never played the Silent Hill game, this movie inspired me to."

Some characters that appear are from the game, and as a non-gamer you don't really understand why that character is in the movie but it does not influence the movie very much.<br/><br/>It's a breath taking movie, top 3 listed in my favorite horror movie list and a MUST SEE!!<br/><br/>Great Story Great acting Great special effects"

","I wanted to like this because I loved Gans's ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"". I know nothing about any video game, let alone this one, so I came at this from a position of ignorance. The first half hour enchanted me. Wonderful opening sequence. Incredibly original score. Stunning photography. And Gans's transporting aerial shots. So far so good. The film references some of my favorites, including Soavi's ""Dellamorte Dellamore"" and, possibly, Hasebe's ""Assault Jack The Ripper"" (the abandoned bowling alley). It draws you into an intriguing, complex situation that will be explained later on, I guess.<br/><br/>Well, I guessed wrong. All the creepy weirdness, which is very well done, ends up amounting to not much. We do get some convoluted explanation when religious nut Alice Krige appears with her robed minions, but it still doesn't wash. The film becomes a mess. The blame lies at the feet of scripter Roger Avary and director Gans. Although Avary penned the thing, Gans surely had the opportunity to sharpen it and work on some clarity.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that the exposition is disconnected to most of the horrors we have witnessed. If Avary and Gans had chosen to explain nothing and dispensed with the annoying Krige character, the film would have been better off -- more like a waking, ""Eraserhead""-style nightmare. Unfortunately, ""Silent Hill"" tries to have it both ways, and it fails.<br/><br/>If the film had been an extended version of the trailer, it would have been much more interesting. As it stands, it falters half way through and never recovers."

I'm saying this to point that people don't have to take things too seriously and that is so irrelevant a 1 as 10 when it comes to movie rating.<br/><br/>This said, I must say that after seeing the movie and then after, seeing the amount of people who voted 10 for this movie I can't avoid being a bit stunned.First because,even if I can accept a positive note I CAN'T a high one. Second,and to me most important, to rate 10 the movie (or any other) is to say that it is among the masterpieces of cinema history. Meening that soundtrack,photography,acting,direction,plot and all other aspects of the fine ART of movie making are here mastered. And oh boy,they are not,not in terms of general cinema nor even when it comes to horror movies.<br/><br/>The acting is at most neutral with some ups and downs,more downs than ups but still nothing critical for a B movie.And so it goes for most of the aspects on the movie,sometimes it can please you, others,mostly due to the weakest aspect of the movie,the direction, you will wonder how can someone foul a production house to give them money to make a film.<br/><br/>To the part of this being an adaptation of a V.G. ...I must say that it was one of the main reasons to see this movie.It just happens that I'm a fan of the Silent Hill imaginary and ambiances and it was exactly that what made me even dislike this one more. When I thought of a movie adaptation for S.H., to me the obvious and ideal approach to it was an Asian production,and now I'm pretty sure that would have been the right choice.The aesthetic values of the franchise are all here,and I must say very well achieved,be it monsters,the village it self,the fog...and the demon (you got to love the demon).The story starts OK and keeps on a nice crescendo until the church scene,there,to me,all starts collapsing...seems like every one went out of ideas.The room scene is the best example,they had enough to make it all right but the very poor dialog and the awful actor direction ruin all...and it only gets worst until the end.<br/><br/>Closing the circle now.I don't know if most of the people who rated this 10 have much Horror movie experience outside the typical American trends,to this I recommend Asian movies."

I found the monsters in this movie to be more funny than scary. They were gory and gross thought, that I do have to add. And the CGI sequences were brilliant, in my opinion. The plot of the movie was very predictable, and I've never played a Silent Hill-game in my life.

","I find it so weird that even die-hard fans of the Silent Hill video game series for the Playstations are so hardcore proud of the mess that is the Silent Hill movie.<br/><br/>Despite a few obvious differences between the games and this film that are obvious right from the get-go, Silent Hill starts off just right for the first 30 minutes. Like the game, there is barely any soundtrack, the amount of fog is ridiculous, and our view is restriced to what Rose's flashlight can expose through the darkness. These tools are crucial to capture the SH feel, and are used well for the first little while...<br/><br/>What happens next is a retelling of the director's (Christophe Gans) previous work, The Brotherhood Of The Wolf. In essence, it is almost the very same movie: lots of gore, very moody, a pack of crazy God-fearing Christians acting as the enemy, and lots of boring, useless, obvious jibber-jabber. While SH isn't THAT bad in terms of story and plot, the over-acting and the constant and aimless walking and talking slow the movie down so much so, that characters are constantly reading off some of the most obvious dialogue, just in case we get totally lost in the utter boredom of it all. Basically, both films could have been cut down to an hour each, and the overall main point and most essential developments would have come across just as accurately.<br/><br/>Also, like BOTW, not once is the SH movie ever really scary. It deals with scary things (BOTW had blood thirsty werewolves, SH has monsters from hell), but never are there any scary happenings. It has some shocking scenes, but thats all they are, cheap eye-candy that is all too unrealistic (see Pyrimid Head vs. young woman outside of the church) to keep us up at night. All the baddies are there, but only for minutes at a time, and not once is it ever explained who they are and why they are after our heroine.<br/><br/>About half way through the movie, SH loses grip on the lonely and paranoid feelings that the games were so famous for, and becomes Christophe Gans' and Roger Avery's angry rant about Christian history and ethics, and a cloning of Gans' previous big-budgeted semi-horror. Those, game fans or not, who love this movie obviously cant see through the cheap bullshit that is Gans' film career, and his attempt at voicing his strong religious opinion over trying remotely hard enough to pay homage to a major horror franchise that never needed a movie in the first place. <br/><br/>Like every other video game-to-movie cross-over, in the end its just another get rich quick scheme pulled by some Hollywood hopefuls that had other means than pleasing the fans.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 stars, 1 star for every 10 minutes it was good."

","I hope everyone reads this.<br/><br/>It is extremely safe for me to say that Silent Hill was, by far, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the plot structure downright awful, it was severely repetitive throughout the movie. The acting was atrocious; the main character did not react to any of the ""darkness"" scenes as properly as any normal human being should. I feel completely embarrassed for the people who took part in this movie. They tried to make it seem as though the ""monsters"" in the darkness scenes were gross, but, on the contrary, they were quite uninteresting and dull. I thought Silent Hill was a ghost town. Half the movie goes by and suddenly there are lots of people around the town. Where did they come from? Nobody knows.<br/><br/>I must admit, some of the visuals were intriguing, but none of them made me jump out of my seat. The trailers put out in commercials for this movie made it seem as though it would be really scary. I was expecting something to jump out at me at least once during the movie, but, there was nothing. The actors in the story were so poor. Actors on daytime television could have blown them out of the water any day of the week. The beginning was okay, but it was almost as deceptive as how the commercials portrayed the movie. I thought I was in for a surprise. This was the most unpleasant surprise I have ever experienced. The movie lasted for way too long: 2 hours and 7 minutes of utter torture. My sister and I went to go see it on April 29th, 2006 because we were bored. I wish I had stayed home and driven nails through my eyelids for fun.<br/><br/>Anyways, all throughout the movie, they placed obscure religious quotes as if the audience were supposed to understand any of them. I consider myself to be an intellectual guy. However, just because you know what any of those quotes mean does not prove that you are smart. It means that you are religious. A previous thread I had just read said that this movie was for an intellectual audience (I know in the guidelines it says for me not to mention other's comments in my review, but this is important and it is specific). This movie is really meant for people who like to view superficial speculations of hell and gore and violence and is for immature kids. The police officer's script in the movie was so weak. Every so often, you would hear her say ""What the f**k..."" as if it makes her character seem strong. That is such a lame way to develop a character. Furthermore, the ways some people died were mind-bogglingly ridiculous and absolutely shallow. If the movie was supposed to be depicted as trivial and grossly awful, the directors achieved their goal. Please, I am begging you, do not see Silent Hill. I am upset that my sister had gift certificates to the movie theater and invited me go to. I did not pay and I wanted to ask for a refund of 2 hours and 7 minutes of my life."

","As a fan of all of the Silent Hill games, with their complex plots, disturbing visuals and gritty action sequences, at first I had a pessimistic outlook when I learned that a film adaptation was on its way.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by Gans' effort to capture the first game's plot line and include certain parts of its successors, as all of the scenery was beautifully assembled with great care.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals and especially soundtrack, ""Silent Hill"" is very impressive. Even if you are not a fan of the games I would still recommend you have a look at this if you desire a genuine horror film with unrelenting scenes of violence, gore and characters' psychological torment.<br/><br/>The plot is mildly ambiguous in places, but a carefully added explanation is added to enlighten newcomers to the unique story of ""Silent Hill"". Another let-down is parts of the script, yet these mistakes are mercifully few and far between. The only error which contributed to my vote slipping was Sean Bean's character, as in terms of relevance to the story and a believable accent, he is very much sidelined.<br/><br/>Apart from these shortcomings, this film lived up to my high expectations and I would gladly re-live the cinematic experience in the near future.<br/><br/>It pleases me greatly that a video game adaptation has made it to the top of the US box office, and that it remains loyal to the source material, unlike Paul W. S. Anderson's horrendously abstract production of ""Resident Evil"".<br/><br/>Overall a strong 8/10"

Here, just, are some thoughts: <br/><br/>What's with the evil little girls in horror-movies these days? And do they all have to have long, dark hair? <br/><br/>And please, please, please...proofread your dialogue, writers! There is no excuse for dialogue like that...It's so bad at times that my brain is incapable of remembering even any of it, which is especially amazing considering I just got back from the theater about an hour ago. Really. ""You have despoiled an Innocent!"" Or something like that. Bleeeargh! I could write better dialogue than that with an axe in my face. And I'm not saying that out of spite; I'm genuinely concerned that such dialogue didn't ring false to anyone involved in the making of the film. Moreover, there's only so much actors can do to rise above such abysmal lines, so too often, unfortunately, actors get blamed for what is more directly the fault of the writer (as witnessed by the small-scale argument I had with my friend in the car on the way home).<br/><br/>OK, enough of that. Still and all, the ideas were imaginative (I know nothing of the game on which it is purportedly based, so I speak with no special knowledge or preconceived notions about it from that point of view); the sets were believable and appropriately decrepit; and the general visuals did what they were supposed to do, I suppose. Plus, Alice Krige plays a great crazy person, in her quietly intense way. Her eyes say more than the dialogue dares utter. But I don't want to get started on that again...<br/><br/>All this is to say, if you like metaphysical horror which includes demons and weird religious cults  and possess a tin ear  you'll probably not mind this movie so much, unless you actually start thinking about the plot for more than two minutes.<br/><br/>(Seriously, the husband? Totally pointless. It does, indeed, seem as if they simply added his character just for the sake of adding a male character, which I read somewhere here on the IMDb. The one I wanted to know more about - and the only character who came even close to being iconic in any way - was the demon with the really big knife, who didn't even really need it, anyway, since apparently he could just rip your whole skin right off with his bare hands. He made me think of a really cranky Pterodactyl.) <br/><br/>These film-makers have definitely seen/read a lot of Clive Barker, and he should be half-peeved. End of rant.

Where were the monsters that I wanted to see? wheres blady hand guy and those giant ones and so forth. Yeah it had some game elements but I could w*nk out a better movie than that. The acting rivals that of a retarded squirrel, the plot was like used toilet paper, full of sh*t. No logic at all, and moments where you just want to punch the mum in the mouth for being such an idiot. The only good bit was when the big freaking douche bag monster with his big freaking helmet ripped a woman's skin off and threw it at a door, after that it was poop. Believing there are Witch believers in a modern town at the present is like believing Santa Claus had sex with the tooth fairy and out came Jesus.

"Aaron1375","7","1","4","25 April 2006"," Starts out very well...but it does run a bit long and it also explains to much.
","This one has music seemingly directly from the game it also has a lot of the atmosphere from the game as well, especially when you first enter Silent Hill. I was thinking, ""Wow, this has to be one of the best video game adaptations ever"". I mean they had the clues that characters would find in the game on display here, the monsters were exactly what you see in the game only more disturbing as here they are in the flesh. I was waiting for the heroine to open a random cabinet to find a shotgun or something, and maybe some ammo in a shelf, of course thankfully that did not happen. The story has a mother taking her daughter to Silent Hill in hopes that this will somehow explain her very bizarre sleepwalking behavior. Of course, for those who played the video game Silent Hill is not your ordinary little town. Upon arrival her daughter is lost, the air is full of ash, and when the siren goes off the entire town goes black and things of indescribable horror lurk in the darkness. A police officer is there as well, having followed our heroine into town and at first she is a pain, but later she is very helpful. However, the movie would have been a lot better if it did not try to explain so much. I mean in the games they didn't really explain anything about why the town itself was going crazy, usually it just explained to some extent the scenario that brought the people into town. I didn't really care for all the explaining as it narrowed it all down right to the cause of everything. Granted this made for a rather grisly climax, I still would have liked to have scene the little religious group taken out of the picture all together. I don't know I just think we needed something more out of the game for the end and less of the here is why the town and everything in it is happening. This also could have taken the movie down a few minutes as it seems to run a bit long at the end as well. Still though the movie had depth and while it wasn't the greatest movie ever, it was still very interesting to watch. Also, the cast is rather good and the scenes with Sean Bean were particularly good...I just he would have found a more vague cause."

","As an avid gamer and movie goer, I can not say I enjoyed this film. Correction, I enjoyed it, but it was not a good film. Don't get me wrong, it was directed wonderfully.(well, except the first few scenes) Anyways, the reason I found the Silent Hill games so attractive was not the violence nor the gore, which I am also a fan of. I enjoyed them for their depth. The monsters in the game were given character by the events that lead up to their fight. This is however, not seen in the movie. <br/><br/>People say that a woman lead was made to make her more vulnerable. I found that a woman lead eliminated the desperation of a father presented by the game. You were a man, and a terrified one, which breaks the typical hero of a game who is fearless and strong! You were strong, but you weren't fearless, and the movie just made the main character weak and fearful.<br/><br/>Now, another thing is the lack of meaning. In silent Hill 2, Red Pyramdid (big monster holding a massive blade, wearing a giant black helmet and butchers vest) was supposed to represent something. I do not want to spoil the game for any of those who have not played it, but if you play the game, and you actually think about it, the monster represented something. In the film, he is an empty shell used to carry out the ""darkness""'s bidding.<br/><br/>This movie was not great. By all means, I think it was less than stellar. It did however have a certain creepy feel to it that would leave one looking over their shoulder at the slightest sounds. The movie was also visually stunning and enthralling at parts.<br/><br/>This was no Award winning film, but it is possibly one of the best video game adaptations that have graced the movie screens. It is by no means the next Crash, but it is far better than the trash that is Doom."
"BludRedHedOnFire","7","1","4","25 April 2006"," This Movie is Creepy
","I have to say, I was surprised by this movie. It was a much more intelligent piece of work than I expected from a horror movie. It is full of literary allusions and interesting and terrifying imagery. The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in a horror film from the 21st Century, if fact, probably the best. <br/><br/>Most horror films tend to descend very easily into the well of violence and gore without much meaning. In this film, the scenes of violence and gore, which are quite extreme, hold some symbolic value. I think this is the key that separates this film from much more boring fare. <br/><br/>I mentioned literary allusions earlier, and, as an English major, this really made me happy. Just one scene has references to The Crucible (or just the Salem Witch Trials), The Arthurian Myth, and several other famous stories. However, these references will not make an average moviegoer uncomfortable with it, because they remain unobtrusive. They introduced with a great amount of finesse. <br/><br/>The greatest thing about this film is the mood. There is a central emotion that is conveyed in this film, and everything in Silent Hill moves toward this emotion. I think this is the first time that I have ever seen a horror film that exemplifies T.S. Eliot's idea of Objective Corellative before. The mood in this film is wonderful, and the emotion is held right down to the final moments. <br/><br/>As to the apparent confusion over this film, I am more confused by Roger Ebert's comments than by the film. Yes, the ending is somewhat confusing, but I've never played the game, and I understood it after a little thought. I think Mr. Ebert has spent too much time believing that horror films cannot make one think. Well, this one can. Maybe if he had put a little thought into it, he would have been able to understand it. <br/><br/>So, I gave this film a 7 out of Ten, because I think it was a very good film, but it definitely had some major flaws. It will not come to be known as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a great horror film. It transcends the genre, while still maintaining its conventions."

I loved the use of the theme song through the movie from the first video game, as well as the unnerving, chaotic soundtrack that the Silent Hill series is known for. For those that go to a theater to nitpick a movie for all its worth instead of to enjoy it, stick to your Brokeback Mountains, and leave the fun of seeing a movie to the people who really want it."

","I have to start by saying that I'm a fan of the games, I'm also quite forgiving of dodgy horror flicks and was looking forward to seeing this film. I even convinced my friend who's not exactly a horror fan to come and see it with me. I'm not sure that she (or even I) will trust my judgment ever again!<br/><br/>I found it assumed too much prior knowledge about the games to cover over the poor writing, the characters didn't seem to interact with each other in a normal way or appear overly surprised by what was happening around them, and the dialogue has to be some of the worst I've heard in a long time! I can't believe this is the same Roger Avary who worked with Quentin Tarantino!?! OK, so it's probably quite faithful to the games and it certainly looked the part but playing a video game is a different experience to watching a film - you can't just do a straight ""conversion"" otherwise you get the same effect that you might get from simply watching someone else playing and this is exactly what I felt here. It could have been so much better but it was just badly put together and far too long.<br/><br/>I think the amount of people in the cinema who walked out way before it ended sums up for me quite how poor this film was. I know the fanboys aren't going to like my opinions but I'm sorry, there isn't any hidden depth or meaning to this film, it's just plain ropey!"

","April 21 a Day that in my mind was the release of one of the worst horror films and Video Game films ever made in the history of Cinema. Silent Hill a great game made into a Horrible Film. In know way did the movie follow any concept of the game what so ever. Red Pyramid was the main villain in the Game,, But not in the Movie he was in the movie for roughly 5 minutes. He stabbed a door five times and stripped a woman's skin off her body and left. The Acid Spitter is another heavy hitter in the video game, in the game there are hundreds of them in the movie there is one and it gets shot by a very manly looking cop with bad aim. Also in no point in the game is there ever a monster that comes from the fire and spits barbed wire from its body.<br/><br/>The Only thing this Movie has going for it is the CG animation that is has throughout the whole Movie."

","I wanted to like ""Silent Hill."" I love horror movies and the games -- well. You don't so much play them as you endure them. They're more horrifying than some of my favorite horror flicks. While the movie did, at times, capture the feel of playing the game (not a difficult thing to do, really), it never inspired me with the same feeling of imminent dread about what might be around the next corner. The first 30 minutes or so were solid, but before you know it, people are re-creating the worst parts of the game -- searching moldy rooms for yellowed files and getting lost in these interminable sub-plots. Then they made the mistake of centering the evil of the titular town into a single character, which was a mistake, I feel. Silent Hill should be more of a haunted locale story than a ghost story. Right when I was pondering this, though, came the religious nuts spouting dialogue ripped from Monty Python's ""Quest for the Holy Grail."" I half-expected one of them to point and say, ""She turned me into a newt!"" This isn't to say the movie wasn't admirable in some ways. I liked that it was a ""hard-R"" and the monsters were everything I thought they could and should be. The music and the sound effects were used to great effect -- as they were in the games. While we're on the subject, the games were scary because of the feeling of loneliness and claustrophobia. Too many characters in the movie on screen for too long took the legs right out from under that concept. This could've been a better movie with a cast of five -- and kept under 90 minutes. Since this was an adaptation, I have to say there was better source material to work with. The storyline and characters of ""Silent Hill 2"" would have made a richer, more personally disturbing story. It was rife with symbolism and complexity, but the filmmakers here opted for a sort of recycled hodge-podge of elements from most of the other games. As a movie, though, ""Silent Hill"" just didn't work. In the end, I felt disappointed and lost in the fog like some wayward traveler on the banks of Toluca Lake."

","We went to a late night movie Friday night, well actually it would have been sat. But I have played the game before and it's really sweet. So I thought the movie would match the hype of the game. Boy was I wrong. The movie started of to long, but was not that bad. But there were some really bad mistakes in the movie like seeing the camera guy in the helmet of the cop and the windows of the room where they did the green screen. The movie was just slow and antagonizing the heck out of me. I was getting upset about the movie. I was going to work it out but there was a line in the movie that just made me jump out of my seat and leave for a few minutes. The story was bases on a city that burned and killed all the people. Well the comment was "" Man, this room look like it was on fire"" COMMON, No crap. Just horrible horrible things that just made the movie they way it was. I was giving the movie such a high score cause of the good camera work and the demons looked really well done. Besides that...this is the second worst film I have ever seen in my life, behind punch drunk love. So go take your money and go see inchworm's or just go get something to eat. Don't waste your time and patients on this film."
"j-douglasbagley","2","1","4","24 April 2006"," what a steaming pile of turd!
","before i decided to see Silent Hill my expectations were low and my god were they reaffirmed. i haven't played any silent hill games and don't have the urge to after seeing this film either. the first sign of anything supernatural in this film was that of crazy little green thing stumbling its way towards the Rose Da Silva character screaming a horrible high pitched scream, this was mirrored by the screams of Rhada Mitchell(who isn't a bad actress, watch ""man on fire"") which seemed to be her instruction for the entirety of the movie. the action was cliché and repetitive with at least 40% of the film, her running about in a horrified daze. the dialogue was sub standard and could have been written by a 11 year old, with the characters having no depth and seemingly no sense what so ever. all that the Cybil Bennett character can say is ""what the f**k is this"", ""oh f**k"", ""f**k, f**k, f**k"" all the way through out the movie. the blatant plot lines and necessary moments of stupidity were grating on the mind at the best of times. Rose Da Silvas unfounded moments of reassurance toward her daughter were laughable. towards the end of the film when we thought it was all over, moans were heard when it appeared that we were wrong and there was more to come. i could hardly class the film as scary, as the loudest scream was for a trailer before the movie. i feel the Sean bean was dealt a rough card when he accepted the role as Christopher Da Silva, his role was simply there to add plot depth and was completely trivial within the context of the film. one of the worst and rushed moments in the film was when he is enquiring on the phone for ""the records for silent hill...the police records"" in order to fulfil his characters duties in the film. he breaks into a record office and stumbles upon a room with scorched, damp boxes, when he see the first box he comes to labelled ""Silent Hill Police Records"". the lack of effort and time put into the subplots of this film were sometimes hard to watch. the score was OK and it could of been better perhaps taking tips from the recent ""the hills have eyes"" having a deeper, percussion focused score that drilled into your very heart. i am a fan of the silent hill sound-bite though, which reminds me of an abandoned Italian gangster town. Also the cgi aspect of the film including the wide pan shots of the town looked very fake. and there were many continuity flaws in the film including the scene where PH thrust his sword through the metal door and swings it side to side, then pulling out and leaving a round hole.perhaps one of the saving graces for this film was the make-up department, with all of the characters that were real people having great prosthetic features as well as those who had the removal of facial features as well. don't get me wrong i think that the talent on hand for this film within the actors could have made a great film. but with a poor screenplay and poorer script, this film didn't really have a chance (apart from with hardcore game and genre fans who don't really know a good film when they see one anyway). all in all this was perhaps the worst film i have seen for a long time full of cliché and rubbish action with a diabolical ending which left loose ends and a sense of emptiness"

","I really wish that movie makers would realize that most people can see through thin plots and can notice inconsistencies. There were so many things wrong with this movie!! Basic inconsistencies, to give weight to my judgment: When Rose first gets to Silent Hill, she attempts to walk around town, but is stopped by a ravine in the middle of the street. Yet, when she goes to the school, she manages to get the whole way without having another problem with the holes.<br/><br/>Rose manages to get to Silent Hill easily, following a road sign conveniently placed on the main road. Now, while Chris didn't necessarily know that there would be a sign, I'd like to see him feel stupid for paying so much money for directions, only to find a road sign for free.<br/><br/>When the cult burns Sybil, they build this HUGE bonfire to crisp her on, but when we come back to see Sharon burned, the bonfire has managed to burn itself down to just embers. Seriously, what? Blood clots, okay? When Rose's shirt turns completely red by the end of the movie, there needs to be some variation, some clue that it's either just a red shirt, or a previously-tan shirt completely stained with non-clotting blood.<br/><br/>That's all I'll do for now, but there're a lot. I wouldn't watch this movie a second time - I'm sure all the stuff I didn't see earlier will just become all that more glaring. And I'm not even going to go into the acting ability.<br/><br/>I will say, though, that I was happy with the sets and lighting effects, and the fact that there was hardly any CGI.

","OK....let's get something straight before I trash this film: I played this game when it first came out. I liked it. I will freely admit that it scared the crap out of me and I had to stop about halfway through. That may be part of the reason I had so much trouble with this film. However, I though this flick was just plain bad. I'm not one to shy away from violence and gore, but this was just wayyyyyy over the top. I think I'd have nightmares for weeks if I didn't bury my face in my boyfriends shoulder every 10 min. It even creeped him out and nothing scares that guy! And the plot holes????? I really had a hard time following why things were happening. I'm not stupid and I'm not 10 (like some people on here say you must be if you didn't get it). It just didn't make sense. I have so many questions....did Rose, Shannon, and the cop die in their accidents in the beginning? Is that why they were in the fog and not the husband and the other cop? Were those people in the church dead and stuck? What was the connection between Shannon and the other little girl? Who was the little demon chick and where did she come from? What was with all the barbed wire? AND WHO THE HELL WAS THE GUY WITH THE BOX ON HIS HEAD??!! What was that about?! I apologize to people out there who liked this film. I think it had potential and when I read about it, I was excited to see it. I was disappointed and seriously grossed out.

","I cannot believe the average user rating is as high as it is (7.0).<br/><br/>This movie was, for the most part, a joke. That was the general consensus of the opening-night crowd I saw it with - most of the theatre would burst out laughing at pieces of the 50's cheap-horror-flick dialogue (""The darkness is coming!"") and the poor ideas for monsters (the little people that I can only assume were supposed to resemble children, oh-my-how-twisted). It was filled with all sorts of stereotypes and rip-offs, including (but certainly not limited to) your stock ""scary little girl,"" a person suddenly appearing in the middle of the road while someone is driving, a young attractive woman lead, the demented drawings of a child, an ending curiously reminiscent (the same?!) of another fairly recent big horror movie, and - I mean, come on - a swarm of insects as a prominent figure in the cast of monsters (but the Fiend was kind of cool, even if he was used badly).<br/><br/>Now, I didn't give it a one, which would imply I didn't think it was *all* bad. This is true. Visually it was interesting in some parts, and I think the set-designer, the sfx team, and in some instances the chief cinematographer should be at least given a pat on the back for a good effort at saving a movie that was doomed to failure by its terrible script and lack of any situation that really went above the level of ""suspenseful."" I have not played the game, granted, so maybe I'm just way out of the loop and am not seeing the film's hidden greatness. But I actually think if I had played it that I would be insulted at the results of the transition of one of the great horror games to the big screen.<br/><br/>All-in-all, something to see if you liked the game, but nothing more."
"e_suavo","3","1","4","23 April 2006"," What Genre is this movie?
","**MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS** (but do yourself the favor and read anyway)<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I wondered to myself what genre best fits. Horror seems to not fit--I was not horrified, nobody I was with was horrified, and I think most people in the theater spent more time laughing than being scared, etc. There is a scene in the movie that had me waiting for Michael Jackson to jump out of the shadows in a red leather jacket--if you've seen it, you know what I mean. For much the same reason, Drama doesn't fit this movie. A drama presupposes that you care about the eventual fate of the main character, or ANY character, for that matter. I couldn't remember the name of the main character 20 minutes after seeing the movie, and to be honest, I'm not entirely sure her name is ever mentioned. I remember exactly one name from the movie (""SHARON!!"") and only because of the repetition of that name in the first 45 minutes of the movie. Adventure seems closer, except for the single fact that the director tries so hard to scare the audience--not typical for an adventure film. It is definitely not an action film, as the pace is way to slow, the visual effects frankly suck, and there are no good explosions. Comedy can be ruled out immediately, except in the 'Evil Dead' sense. Finally, I know this will not fall into the 'cult classic' category, as there are no riveting performances, no unforgettable dialogue, and the film takes itself much too seriously. So what are we left with? Perhaps a musical. Well, perhaps not, but were it such, it certainly would have been better worth my time and money."

","Grade: D- (2 out of 10) Only if the movie were as good as the poster.<br/><br/>Only if the movie were as good as the poster. Silent Hill does about as much wrong as a movie can do. Really, the only good things I remember are the cinematography and the music. The acting is horrendous, and I'm judging on a horror-movie level here, so it was really bad. Radha Mitchell is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. She was horrible in Man on Fire, and she's even worse here. She doesn't even have a chilling scream. Isn't that the prereq for getting a part in a horror movie? Her saving grace was that everyone else was so bad, so after a while I just got used to it.<br/><br/>Here's a plot overview: There is a kid that is a little bit crazy. She runs off in her sleep and says ""Silent Hill."" Mom, Rose, takes kid to creepy ghost town called Silent Hill that she found on the internet (damn you internet and damn you mapquest). Things go very wrong in the ghost town.<br/><br/>That's really all I understood from the plot. If you're like me and haven't played the games, you won't understand a single thing in the movie. From what I've gathered, even if you have religiously played the games you'll be pretty confused. Silent Hill cops out by using 10 minutes of exposition towards the very end to try to explain the entire movie. The problem is that by that point I really didn't care, it still didn't make sense, and the movie could have dropped hints along its excruciating two plus hour running length to make the rest of it more bearable. The strange thing is that by the end I wanted less explanation and more...well, I really just wanted it to end.<br/><br/>The entire first hour and a half could have easily been condensed into about thirty effective minutes (and that's being generous with the time). It didn't help that there was a completely useless subplot involving Chris, Rose's husband. The only reason Chris was added in the first place was because the screenplay initially had no male characters in it. Great job Hollywood producers: green-light a crappy video-game-based movie, and then find ways to make it even worse. Bravo.<br/><br/>Granted the screenplay, especially the dialog, is downright laughable. Horror movies always have bad dialog, but usually its bad and funny. In Silent Hill, not so much. For example: Cybil: ""They say this place used to be haunted."" Rose: ""I'd say they were right."" I admit, I did giggle at that one, but there is much worse. In fact the dialog might be the only thing scary enough to make you jump out of your seat. There isn't a single jump-out-of-your seat fright or, more importantly, moment of tension in the entire movie (unless you find break dancing zombie-like things frightening). There are some loud noises, lots of darkness, and some neat special effects, but that's about it. There's plenty of violence and gore for the horror fans, but almost all of it is towards the end. Though there is a part towards the middle where a young girl has her skin ripped off her body that woke me up along with the rest of the theater...and I'm not even a fan of gore.<br/><br/>The movie was so bad that the people sitting next to me passing comments at the movie were much more entertaining than the actual movie. Don't get me wrong, I think that talking in a movie is a cardinal sin punishable only by the most powerful, deepest, darkest hellfire. These people deserve praise, not punishment, for entertaining me for free because I surely wasn't being entertained by the movie I paid $7 for (heck, $14 if you count my bored out of her mind girlfriend).<br/><br/>From what I hear, the game requires a quick trigger finger, but also a good amount of brains and puzzle solving skills. Ironically the movie is a brainless puzzle that isn't worth solving even if there is an answer. I can guarantee this will be on my bottom five of 2006 list; through April it's the worst I've seen yet."

It was definitely a decent scary movie, not as good as the Ring though. There is no way you can compare Naomi Watts with the chick in this movie.

I have to admit when I saw the previews for Silent Hill I thought it looked unbelievably scary, but when I saw it last night with my friends we thought it was so horrible that we even walked out on it. The acting was some of the worst acting I have ever seen since Pearl Harbor. And the story. God Almighty. It was going absolutely nowhere. I mean, did anyone actually pay attention to the freaking story, because if you did then you would see how awful the film really is. I mean, it was as if they were writing the script as they were making the film. Or even playing the video game as they were making the film. The only thing I enjoyed about it was that it's cinematography was identical to the video game, but everything else... Pathetic. Huge thumbs down. P.S.: What the f**** is Hollywood coming to?

The strange happenings and terrifying images begin soon after the characters arrival in the town of Silent Hill. The burning, children demons (you'll see!) grab your attention immediately. Let me assure you, the plot rapidly deteriorates from here on in.<br/><br/>As Rose (Radha Mitchell) continues the search for her lost daughter, the plot becomes more and more confusing, with the addition a police woman, an unkempt looking child, and a highly religious, witch-burning cult hiding inside a church.<br/><br/>And a word to the wise, if you are a fan of Sean Bean, DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS FILM!

","I usually try to avoid getting drawn in by trailer hype, but I found it hard with this movie -- the trailers made it look like they really, actually had translated the game into a movie very well.<br/><br/>This was, overall, not the case. The movie does a few things well, but retaining the most important aspect of the game -- its tension -- simply is not one of them.<br/><br/>Silent Hill itself is very well-done. The environments, with few exceptions, were very well-rendered; this is the area that really shines as far as bringing the game to the screen. With the exception of a VERY poorly-rendered intro shot (panning around the main character), the outdoor 'day' scenes are very effective. The interiors are also very reminiscent of the games.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Silent Hill suffers from several problems which keep it from being a very good film.<br/><br/>One is the acting. While it's not bad overall, there are a couple surprisingly poor, ham-fisted performances, and not from the actors you'd think. This might be the fault of bad direction, but either way, it's there and it takes away from the movie.<br/><br/>Another is character development. You just don't get much of it beyond ""this is what's happening and this is who it's happening to."" All good stories are character-driven, and while this one is, it does not give you much at all to flesh them out. You will get about five solid minutes of backstory for the most important character in the movie... and you will get it right at the end. Not impressive, not effective.<br/><br/>A minor point, and one that will probably only jump out at people who have experienced the games, is the minimization and poor presentation of pyramid head. You see very little of him, and at no point is he scary.<br/><br/>Which leads to this movie's biggest problem. There is no tension here. It does not grab you the way the games did -- it probably will not grab you at all. There are ""woah, that's strange"" and ""wow, that was shocking"" moments (not many, but they are there), but it absolutely does not deliver on the games' main selling points -- the suspense, the tension that came from sitting in a dark room with the volume up, running around in the dark, knowing there's something out there that probably doesn't like you.a A movie theatre is a dark place... the volume is always maxed... and it's been years since I even saw the games. Even with these things going for it, though, Silent Hill the movie fails to deliver any sort of suspense.<br/><br/>If you loved the games, you might not enjoy this movie. If you haven't played them, you have a better chance of having fun with this one."

My friends did not now the game. This may be for fans only, judging by the other reviews.<br/><br/>The good things about the film: it looks great, and Pyramid Head is excellent but has very little screen time. The climax is OK and ultra CGI-gory with some nightmarish visions, but what a drag to get there. I was bored most of the movie. The dialog was very bad at times, and the screenplay is simply go there, find clue, go somewhere else, find another clue... OK for a game, but for a movie? it sure feels like watching the game, but in a bad way.<br/><br/>I loved Brotherhood of the Wolf and my main motivation in seeing this was to see if Christophe Gans could pull it off.

The set designs were VERY atmospheric and just plain nasty in some places, even the ones that didn't have blood or guts splattered liberally to the wall. I also learned that most of the monsters were not CG, which surprised and delighted me. I think filmmakers rely on CG way too much. I'd rather see Claymation than CG in every scene of a movie, just the fact someone worked hard to make an effect look real gets so many more points in my book than dime-a-dozen CG work.<br/><br/>The flayings aplenty also helped speed up the pace. When the creatures were out there was almost an instant feeling of dread that came over me and I'd like to say I'm a hardened veteran of the horror genre scene. So there were some really cool moments, particularly Pyramid Head's scenes.<br/><br/>So from a technical standpoint, I loved it. But here's where it gets bogged down. SPOILER AHEAD - If you know nothing of the story and will go to this movie regardless of anything bad anyone has to say, don't read. (Which I have to give you props for because I really have no respect for the sheep that read critic reviews and won't see a movie if it doesn't fit the taste of the reviewer, it should be about what YOU want to see and if no one else likes it but you do, it's OK. Movies are about ENTERTAINMENT, not popular opinion. Sorry, I'll get off the soap box now.) One last disclaimer before I start the Silent Hill dissension, I understand that the storyline involves the following elements in the game storyline. That being said if you read through the following, hopefully I can shed some light on why I don't think it works the way it is presented to the audience.<br/><br/>Acting and the script/plot were arguably the weakest points. Although not really all that bad, the writer's didn't seem to want to go beyond the call of duty and deliver the viewer a really top-notch story. I will say that the film has an effective soundtrack, although the best part of it was in the first 10 seconds of the movie.<br/><br/>But I'll get back on the soap box now. The thing that really irritated me is the bigoted, hateful way they treat religion in general, Christianity in specific. I never let any movie really get to me, but I actually became ANGRY at the filmmakers as they showed the scene of the girl on a metal grill being barbecued alive with a huge fire pit below her. Conveniently placed scripture verses taken out of context and cut up to get the filmmaker's views across pepper this movie with a very dim view of any redeeming quality in faith (Not necessarily just Christian.) I understand that they have developed a cult out of witch-burning fanatics from Salem, but the symbolism is so overwhelmingly linked to Christianity (One bible verse is one speaking of the righteous judging angels on a billboard for a church outside of Silent Hill, mysteriously reminding you of the fire-and-brimstone performance of Alice Krige) that all you are left with is a feeling of disgust for any sort of praying or church activity.<br/><br/>This really left a bad taste in my mouth, and as I do not want any sort of bigotry in my life or presented to me, be it racism or against religion or people who do not believe in God at all. The filmmakers here so seek to poison the viewer that there is NO COUNTERBALANCE ANYWHERE to a normal, positive person of ANY faith.<br/><br/>OK, I'm not kidding, this tells some of the ending, so SPOILER ALERT again for good measure.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, this just turns into a supernatural bloodbath with lots and lots of barbed wire (And believe me, I love a good flaying), and in Alice's case, barbed wire essentially ripping her from the inside out before slicing her to chunks. This is one movie where honestly the theme is that hating and mercilessly killing (albeit already dead and self-worshiping cult followers) is something to be admired. I would give this movie 2 stars for really fantastic work on effects, the writing, cast and sound were all standard to a little better than standard, although the plot will confuse people who do not follow the games at all. For viewers who just don't care about bigotry in all it's forms (In this film viciously attacking Christianity) they might give this 3 to 4 stars out of 4."
"spowis","4","1","4","22 April 2006"," Nice game, nice music, bad movie.
","I love the Resident Evil series, I love the Silent Hill games, however this movie really got to me when it tried to incorporate all of this absolutely random and unnecessary witch-burning, the mass killing with barbed-wire and the general way the movie went. That girl really annoyed me, as did Sean's voice, I've seen him in movies playing far better, Sharpe has always been a superb series of his, I don't know if he's best suited for roles such as this, even his part in The Island was just about on par (no offense. :p). The good parts of this movie I'd have to say is the way in that Silent Hill changed from normal to nowhere, the first 30 minutes were simply great, and from there on it got too painful to watch. I think to the average person, people wouldn't understand the crash issue the first time round, probably a lot of ""OMFGWTF?!"" and get angry, rather than get into more depth, which is a shame really because this movie did have potential, but it fell early at the second hurdle. A complete translation from the game to the movie would have been much neater, looks like some of those Pyramid heads are going to be stumbling towards the film crew's way.<br/><br/>An unsatisfied 4/10, I feel conned."

","The newest addition to the ever increasing video game turned movie list, ""Silent Hill"" opened everywhere on April 21st. It is easily one of the most impressive movies on that list, but sadly that doesn't say much. This film had potential, but squanders it all with a predictable storyline, shallow characters, horrible dialog, lack of scares, mediocre acting, repetitive scenes and ridiculous plot twists.<br/><br/>The cinematic adaptation of ""Silent Hill"" opens with a chase sequence. A woman named Rose is chasing her sleepwalking daughter, Sharon, to the edge of a rocky cliff. When the girl finally comes back to reality she is screaming ""Silent Hill!!"" Seeing as this is a horror movie, it is not surprising to find out that Sharon turns out to be adopted from an orphanage in West Virginia where Rose locates a ghost town called Silent Hill. So, despite the foreboding websites, Rose decides to take Sharon to Silent Hill in hopes of setting her daughter's mind at ease. <br/><br/>On the way to Silent Hill, an officer named Cybil Bennett who wears what looks to be an unusually form-fitting police uniform tries to pull Rose over, but Rose can't stop now, she's too close! So, she puts the pedal to the metal and speeds towards the town of silent hill, not even slowing when the car is consumed in a dense fog. However, she does swerve when she sees something moving ahead of her resulting in a painful looking bump on the head. She awakes hours later, alone in her car, in what appears to be another dimension where white fog and falling ash is always on the forecast. She sees the welcome sign and realizes that she has arrived. Now, to find her daughter<br/><br/>Normally I'd go into more depth with the plot up to a certain point, but that pretty much covers everything. The remaining hour and a half simply follows Rose as she runs from place to place in search of her elusive daughter. What we know about the characters is what I've told you, there is nothing deeper, no background, nothing at all to help the viewer relate to the characters and get somewhat involved in the horrors unfolding around them.<br/><br/>The film does a superb job at creating the town of Silent Hill and the various demons that dwell within it. The special effects used to transform the decaying daytime town into a hellish nightmare are great and the monsters are some of the most disturbingly realistic creations ever put on film. There's no denying that this is a pleasing film for the eyes, but it is a completely different story for the ears and mind.<br/><br/>The dialog arouses more laughs than thought, particularly when the few residents of Silent Hill begin rambling on about witchcraft, religion and danger and the only thing you can think about is why Rose keeps chasing something that looks like Sharon, but is clearly not. The actors do what they can, but the script doesn't give them much to work with. Radha Mitchell, who plays Rose has a moment in which some talent shines through, but it's brief. Like most horror heroines, Rose blindly puts herself in one terrifying situation after another. There's no denying that she is scared, but the same cannot be said for the theater audience. There are not even any ""cheap scares,"" every monster comes slowly and from a distance giving Rose and the audience ample time to prepare.<br/><br/>This film is very faithful to the games, but fails in instilling the psychological horror that the game does so well. This film has the entertainment value of watching somebody else play as you gradually grow annoyed because their turn is lasting too long. The obvious is clarified (I found this thing from a hotel, Sharon must be there) but the mystifying is left unexplained. By the end, I didn't even know who was who and I doubt it would have made sense even if I did. It seemed like a lot of things were being done for no other purpose than to generate an epic spectacle, but ultimately it's a little pointless when all of the characters feel disposable. Some great visuals are not enough to redeem a movie that fails in every other sense. 4/10 stars"
"jlieske-1","5","1","4","22 April 2006"," Almost but not quite...
","Just saw this film last night. As a big SH fan, I had been eagerly anticipating this film ever since i heard it was coming out. Here was a game that could be great on film. Everyone I know that played these games was almost afraid to play them after dark, they were so disturbing.<br/><br/>I'm not one of those absurd purists that were angry at the changing of the lead characters gender. Far from it. In fact Radha Mitchell is an excellent choice, and I've enjoyed her in other films including Pitch Black, Finding Neverland and even High Art. The little girl Sharon, played by Jodelle Ferland was also a good choice; she was a creepy little kid even in Smallville a few years back. Alice Krige is wonderfully creepy in everything. Sean Bean is a superb actor utterly wasted in this film. I've read that he was only added because of the complete lack of the XY chromosome in earlier versions.<br/><br/>I was also glad to see a film not use so much CGI, as a good portion of the monsters were actors in makeup. And some of these were straight out of my worst nightmare. The first scene when Radha Mitchell chases Sharon in silent hill was just great, almost exactly like the game, even the camera angles were captured. I know they couldn't get all the monsters from the game into this film but I do feel there should have been more scenes with those little white creepy things, that were all over the place in the game. And the little black spirits wandering around would have been a nice touch.<br/><br/>This film had its moments, but all-in-all I feel let down. It was too much like every other current American piece of crap Horror film out there lately. Seems every time I turn around, somebody is remaking a Japanese horror film that was just made two years ago in Japan. Don't remake it just release the Japanese version here with subtitles. Oh wait I forgot the American audience doesn't want to have to read. I think the cast and crew did an excellent job with this film, I just can't help but wonder if it might not have been better if it was made by an Asian director. They would have gotten away with a lot more balls-to-the-wall Horror."
"matty_tron","6","1","4","22 April 2006"," A little creepy, a little corny, but a good crossover.
","I saw this movie last night after I read some reviews, and my expectations were high. Well, the movie starts out kind of corny. The dialog seems a little clumsy, and I don't know why everyone is hyping the actors because most of them delivered their lines a little cheesily.<br/><br/>To give the movie credit, the special effects were pretty incredible, but sometimes the CG blood looked pretty fake. Characters from the game popped up now and then (i.e. pyramid head) and were pretty scary, and they definitely got the zombie/freaks exactly right, and they were pretty scary as well.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot was a little lacking, especially toward the end. It was a great concept, just not as well executed as it could have been. I didn't really feel that I cared about the characters, with the only exception being Sean Bean.<br/><br/>This isn't really the type of movie that would make me pee my pants, but it was better than anything else ""scary"" out there right now. It brought the feel of the game put together with a good new story, and I would recommend it to anyone who's played the Silent Hill games, or anyone who's got an open mind about odd/far fetched films."

","This movie was excellent. The script was well written. The acting was beautiful, and Deborah Unger's role as Dahlia was down right eerie.

It might ruin the movie. The only thing that leaves to be desired is the ending. I'm tired of movies not ending. This one seems to leave in a ...to be continued...manner.

","As an avid fan of the games, I was half impressed and half disappointed.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was set up perfectly. The darkness, the fear, the feeling that something is wrong and you don't understand what it is or why it is happening, are transferred from the game very nicely. The actors do a great job; very convincing in their roles - and the actors that play the creatures are AMAZING! Hooray for live action creatures instead of CGI! It's just a shame you don't see more of them. My only other complaint is that they do try to wrap things up somewhat conveniently in the last ten minutes, and one of the things I love about the Silent Hill games is that things were always left somewhat uncertain.<br/><br/>I see this movie as being pretty good for fans of the games, but somewhat confusing for those that don't know the background..."

","This movie isn't 3 hours long, but as it entered what felt like it's 3rd hour I just gave up, in fact I have no idea why I didn't give up after the first 15 minutes. If you, like me, are someone who doesn't appreciate movies based on video games or comics, avoid this at any cost. I know nothing of the video game it is based on so I can only review it as a horror movie and as horror , this is a cheesefest of bad acting, pathetic childish dialogue, the most fake looking sets I've ever seen, really bad special effects and all of it is over the top. Even the props over-act. I can see it being based on a video game because it looks like one, and one that hasn't aged well in the past 14 years. With as bad as it was, it wasn't even interesting and nothing about it had any depth. Why would someone even bother to make a movie from a video game ? If only I had reached for the remote sooner."

","Silent Hill is a very poor film. All areas are shambled with nothing in. Characters, plot, screenplay everything you can think of is missing. The cast adds to this addition of poorly shaped characters and a realisation that a game like that cant be copied to a film like this. Everything the game achieved the film failed. The plot is all over the place, plot holes being left and forgotten, acting that looks shameful and cheesy and finally effects that look like they would use in a B movie.

","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>Adapted from a video game (which I've never played) Silent Hill hits us on the big screen full-on with it's movie version of itself.<br/><br/>Rose (Radha Mitchell) is a lady who's daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) has been suffering nightmares about a town called Silent Hill. Determined to find out what's causing these, she travels out to the town itself with the hope of confronting her fear and stopping it. However, after a freak traffic accident, she wakes up in the snow covered town with no memory of what happened before- and her daughter is missing! In the distance, she sees a semblance of her little girl running away from her. But, after chasing it, she finds this is just the beginning of a nightmare journey into a terrifying hell-hole to get her little girl back.<br/><br/>This is just Resident Evil re-lived, for the most part, complete with minimal characterization, a naff narrative and a similarly apathetic storyline all round really, which makes no real sense through-out and is only barely satisfactorily resolved at the end. However, you can enjoy a few scenes with a nice soundtrack and visual flair, some enjoyable, nice (if obviously computer generated) special effects and Sean Bean in a co-starring role doing an impressive American accent (which only occasionally lapses back into his native Yorkshire.) Overall, though, this is one idea probably best suited to the games console. **"

Rose has to take her daughter to Silent Hill to find out the mystery behind her daughters dreams. Once in Silent Hill she finds that her daughter has disappeared and she is left to chase after her daughter. This is when the movie takes a turn. She chases her daughter into an underground area while there a strange alarm sounds(heh you know what this means), and the fun loving creatures come out to play. Well as soon as you see them and they started screaming, I along with almost all the theater start laughing. It became apparent that this movie wasn't going to be horrifying at all as a matter of fact it was a little funny at times. It wasn't hard to follow at all, but some of the monsters ruined it for me. CGI just hasn't progressed enough to meld perfectly with live action to make something horrifying. The story was fine, but some of the monster were just underwhelming and uninteresting. Pyramid-head wasn't bad, but he wasn't there enough and didn't play a big enough role to make it better. It felt as though he was there for cameo purposes only. Maybe if the entire movie was in CGI then everything would have fit together better.<br/><br/>The Verdict: While it does have a decent plot the movie is underwhelmed by boring monsters and uninteresting scare tactics. It would have been better had it been completely CGI, at least then the CGI monsters wouldn't have looked so ""out of place"". I know everyone doesn't have the time or funding to make a King Kong realistic CGI masterpiece, but this movie would only scare youngsters who couldn't get in anyway. Nice try, but not worth the price of a ticket. Watch it when it comes on TV. Rating 5/10."

","Christopher Gans: Sounds a bit like glands and its a synonym for that part of the male reproductive organ that could be a nickname for you if you gained any satisfaction from this pointless bit of game-whoring. Silent Hill the movie is a dead ringer for the video game except that you can't join in and therefore don't have a chance of getting involved. I've watched Mrs Frames play it many times and then, as now, I watched a girl run around a ghostly town over which atmosphere and the creeps had ejaculated to high volume. The problem with the film is that it offers no more depth because it absences plot and characterisation. These would be vital additions to any game to movie transfer because without them you've got a lose series of set pieces linked by a lot of running but sans, or should that be Gans, any emotional or cerebral involvement. Roger Avary who touched greatness with Pulp Fiction and then horribly relaxed, turns in a two hour gaming sample ripped from the screen of his PS2. What he fails to do is add anything to the mix. The acting such as it is doesn't convince because there's nothing for the cast to latch on to; Sean Bean's Sheffield-American accent being the only unintentionally amusing strand. It looks good - engenders dread in many places but as a piece of storytelling its pure bunk. Surely it doesn't take a genius to work out that gamers fill in the blanks themselves through the act of participation in these things. They make the story. When you can't pick up a controller and join in you need a script writer to flesh it out for you and sadly for Silent Hill thats exactly what no-one thought to do. Whats next, Outrun the movie? Enough is enough surely."

The problems start and never end once the mom (played well enough by the talented Radha Mitchell) and kid arrive in the foggy, dusty, zombie-religious freak filled town. The normally solid Laurie Holden (""X-Files"") is just plain terrible as an over the top, oh-so-caring motorcycle cop. She may be the creepiest thing in the film. Uber-cool Sean Bean is just plain wasted in his limited role. On top of everything else, the music and score are not up to the task and make a dull film even slower.<br/><br/>Wasted potential is always a shame and I realize fans of the video game are loving this movie, but most any fan of horror films will be very disappointed and will probably find themselves chuckling quite often. The only time you will jump out of your seat will be when the movie finally ends."
"broadfoot","5","1","5","25 April 2006"," Scarier Than ""Resident Evil""
","I thought the two ""Resident Evil"" movies were awful, but ""Silent Hill"" is a bit better. It has excellent special effects and some truly brutal and gory scenes. If you were unable to play the video game on which the movie was based, watching the movie allows you to see the whole thing from beginning to end without even using a controller! I live near Hamilton, Ontario, and the Grand Hotel exterior is actually a historic building called Lister Block that's sadly fallen into disrepair and is now one of our town eyesores...so it may have to be torn down. I also noticed the city of Brantford in the movie, because one scene was filmed in the building next to the offices of ""The Brantford Expositor"" newspaper.<br/><br/>All I can say is that Hamilton and Brantford look like friendlier places to live than Silent Hill!"
"dstigue","5","1","5","24 April 2006"," It let me down how about you?
","Well I will start by telling you I am a big fan of the franchise. It's funny a week before I saw a preview for this movie I saw the game in a bargain bin and I picked it up and started playing again. I went on to tell my new girlfriend how great of a movie this game would make. She agreed she liked the game too even as aged as it was. She almost killed me for making her see this movie. It started off horrible. Got a bit better. I had a little hope in the middle. And it ended worse than I had ever expected. I will say it's worth seeing if you are a fan. But just know that you will be pretty disappointed. I was impressed with one part. If you played the game you will know the first alley way you enter chasing your daughter. If you watch closely you will see that they use the same exact camera angles as in the game. The old green car is there too. That was pretty cool."

","I saw Silent Hill on Friday when it opened expecting a thrill. I was greatly disappointed. For me a horror movie is supposed to horrify me! Silent Hill was just another gore fest. When I see a scary movie I want it to be fast paced, start off with a bang and have me on the edge of my sit ready to jump the whole time. Silent Hill was very slow moving for me. It tried to pack too much of a story (and not a really interesting one at that) in it, if I wanted a good story I would have went to another movie, what I wanted was a scare! Also, for a horror movie it was much too long. I did find out after I saw the movie that it was based on a video game & I could see it making an interesting game to play, but as a movie I was disappointed. Overall, I would say see it if you want to see it, you might like it, just personally it wasn't my thing."
"cafesmitty","5","1","5","24 April 2006"," Disappointing
","This wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I guess that is all on me. Despite the performance of Radha Mitchell this movie just took too long in-between scenes. Don't get me wrong, there are some moments that I thought were intense, but just not enough of them. And there is just too many things that don't make sense. Between what the husband and wife characters were doing, it was as if you were watching two different movies and they leave way too many things unexplained. I haven't played the video game and perhaps that is where my knowledge is lacking. But one shouldn't have to play the game in order for the film to be coherent. It just miss the boat, but barely. It had potential, to quote Marlon Brando, it ""could have been a contender""."

The only thing that kept me staying at Harkins was because I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did.<br/><br/>Overlong and ridiculous.

","I know that I will get attacked for this, but . . . For those of you, like myself, who have no idea about the game Silent Hill - I didn't even know it was a game until I heard people saying so when it was over - this movie makes little to no sense. The plot is flimsy at best. There is nothing to truly follow if you do not know the plot of the game. Even the major evil character (the Bird-Man of Big-KnifeLand)made little sense to those of us not privy to the game. The writing was, literally, a joke. I am not sure if the writer's MEANT for the audience to laugh through most of it, but that is what happened in the Manhattan theatre I saw it in. And could someone PLEASE explain the Bob Fossey dance number with the Nurses from Hell?>!?!?! So, ultimately, if you are a fan of the game, or even familiar with it, you may love it. But, if you are clueless as to the background - watcher beware. For non-fans, just chalk it up as another over-hyped, underwhelming ""horror"" film."

At least the Tomb Raider movies have Angelina Jolie in them, but there isn't much redeeming value in this movie.

The scariest part is when she runs into a trashcan and it made everyone jump and for a ""scary"" movie, that is horrible.

"haji495","3","1","5","22 April 2006"," One of the worst films I've ever seen.
","For the film that most were looking to add credence to the video game movie sub-genre, it was a spectacular letdown. Terrible dialogue is the icing on top of a nonsensical plot riddled with horror and action movie clichés. The characters, especially the two police involved, are so stereotypical and one dimensional that I often found myself cringing at some of their lines or actions.<br/><br/>Of course, the games are known for how haunting they can be. I'm not positive if they were using slow pacing to pad out the film's creepy atmosphere to the level of the game series, but the movie instead felt much longer than its actual run time. Many have been saying that the gore is an important part of the package, but the level displayed in this film far surpasses the ridiculous.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this. Go play one of the games instead. It looks like we may have to wait for Halo to arrive before gamers can finally have a decent movie of their own."
"ebossert","6","1","5","22 April 2006"," Ultra-Cool One Minute, Ultra-Cheesy the Next
","This movie should have been great, but suffers from inadequate execution. This is not to say that there aren't bright spots. The monsters and beasts in the film are very well done, and there are a handful of ""classic"" horror sequences in the movie that include demonic children, faceless nurses, and the now infamous Pyramid Head. The score of the movie was also well done and the atmosphere of Silent Hill was sufficiently creepy, complete with snowing ash and fog.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is that all of the aforementioned coolness was mitigated by horrendously cheesy moments throughout (""cheesy"" defined as moments that are meant to be serious but instead come off as comical). One contribution to the cheesiness of this film is a slew of unnecessary dialogue. For example, our two heroines are at a hotel and find a clue in the mailbox of room 111. Instead of cutting to the next scene, showing the ladies attempting to find room 111, the following useless dialogue is given: ""What mailbox did you find this in?"" ""Room 111."" ""Well then, we should go to room 111."" Are American audiences really that stupid that they need these types of explanations in films?<br/><br/>Another grossly cheesy contribution was the introduction of religious fanatics, a concept that is already beaten to death by Hollywood. Not surprisingly, the religious fanatics in this movie are Christians, so we have endless minutes of the antagonists hypocritically judging the protagonists, which occurs in just about every other movie that's released in the U.S. With a concept as innovative as Silent Hill, one would think that the characters would not descend into cliché-ridden diatribes  but they most certainly do. The movie would have been better served if it focused on the Occult and other New Age concepts that were so prevalent in the video games.<br/><br/>Yet another grossly cheesy contribution is the 5-minute ""Idiot's Guide to the Plot of Silent Hill"", which was introduced near the end of the film. Again, are Americans too stupid to figure things out on their own? On a positive note, the explanation of how Silent Hill became what it is was quite good, but the failure to properly execute the communication of this explanation to the audience just added more cheesiness.<br/><br/>It is rumored that the original script was rejected by the movie studio because it didn't have a lead male character, so he was written into the storyline on a purely ad hoc (after-the-fact) basis  and it shows. The ""real world"" scenes were almost completely useless, and should have been scrapped completely. They added nothing more than cheesy dialogue.<br/><br/>All in all, it is my opinion that American studios are incapable of producing high-quality horror films. The decent ones that are released (i.e., The Ring, The Grudge, etc.) are ripoffs of movies already made in foreign countries, and it should come to no one's surprise that two of the most acclaimed horror movies made in the past half decade (i.e., Japan's ""Pulse"" and Korea's ""A Tale of Two Sisters"") are already scheduled to be shredded and remade for idiotic consumption in America. It's as if the concept of ""original screenplay"" is nonexistent in the Hollywood horror genre.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Silent Hill is an average to above-average horror movie solely for its cinematography and special effects, but the cheesiness that oozes from every other scene prevents it from being a great movie."
"chager","6","1","5","21 April 2006"," Starts out strong...
","...ends with the same tired old BS - and worse. The climactic scene utilizes props that look like something from a bad off-Broadway stage production and actually made me giggle - the hovering hospital bed with the dangling i.v. drips and the pasty thirty-something year old supernatural burn victim. But the story is interesting and starts out very strong with some really great visuals and suspense. The first time ""the darkness"" comes, ushered by an alarm that sounds like your average small town tornado alert horn, it was pretty intense. I give it a 6 to 6.5 out of 10. Without the really great beginning and the decent story it would be a 4.5 to 5. I was expecting more, but I've said that after almost every horror movie I've ever seen, so there you go."

","In which Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (Sean Bean) Da Silva's daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) keeps sleepwalking and disappearing into the woods at night. When her parents find her she keeps muttering about a place called Silent Hill. Rose finds the town listed on the internet and discovers the place is now a ghost town due to a terrible fire that occurred there some thirty years previous. As Sharon is adopted Rose suspects there must be a link and the pair drive down to the abandoned town without telling Christopher (who's reduced to a cameo part from this point onwards). But once there an apparition in the road causes Rose to crash the car and when she awakes Sharon is gone. Along with motorcycle cop Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden) she searches the town for her daughter, instead encountering numerous hellish creatures from another dimension as well as survivors from the fire who have formed a less than benevolent religious cult. As Christopher enlists the aid of the local police force, who are just as keen to locate Cybil Bennett as they are his wife, Rose and Cybil find themselves journeying ever further into the hellish past of the town as its undead inhabitants refuse to call it a day.<br/><br/>Although I've never played any of the Silent Hill games, it's pretty obvious from the outset that director Christophe Gans has made huge efforts to recreate the same look and feel. Some of the tracking shots and third person camera angles are straight out of a video game (Max Payne came to mind, as I have played that one) as are the visuals. It's a double edged sword as the strenuous efforts to recreate the correct look also directly influence the pacing of the film, meaning for huge chunks of the running time nothing much happens apart from Rose wandering about different locations, occasionally chasing after a distant figure who may or may not be her daughter. In other words, it's a bit slow and boring much of the time. Although when the various undead creatures appear things certainly do pick up for a while. Pyramid Head (Tanya Allen) is no doubt a key figure in the video game, and I have to admit every scene she/it appears in carries a real charge. Coming on like something out a Hellraiser movie crossed with David Lynch attitude, this bug encrusted knife wielding apparition is straight out of your worst nightmare. As is the corridor full of scalpel wielding shroud covered nurses, and the barbed wire trussed contortionist in the toilet. When Gans is presenting us with this sort of warped imagery the movie excels, and doesn't skimp on the violent aspects either (as is becoming all too familiar these days we find the UK 15 rating allowing more and more). But set pieces aside, the rest of the film falls short by comparison. The story is way too predictable and plodding and ultimately ends up in the same sort of limbo that the characters occupy. It's a shame as Christophe Gans has undoubtedly got some talent (Brotherhood of the Wolf is proof of that) but the need to fit into the video game format means that talent is always going to be constrained here. Overall Silent Hill has more going for it than say Doom although, despite some effective moments, it ultimately ends up feeling like a big 'so what' (same as Doom). So it gets a similar score then... 5/10."

The movie as a whole lacked common sense (for example, why did they run from the cop at the beginning? Or how about this one: if everyone in the town was already dead, how could they die again at the end?? Shouldn't they have become like the other town residents, condemned to torment? Oh wait, they needed some gratuitous blood splatter at the end, that's why.) Also, very convenient that the girl was found right before the final showdown with NO effort expended by the residents of the town.

Check the left side of the screen when the mom and cop enter the church building for the first time - one of the crew member's ENTIRE BODY can be seen.<br/><br/>For those looking for a good thriller, check out Wolf Creek. Unlike Silent Hill, it spends the first half simply developing the characters so that when they are eventually placed in harm's way, you feel like you are there with them. You empathize for them and sincerely want them to survive in the end.

Both were displayed candidly in unnecessary amounts. I'm not offended by gore on a regular basis but this was in the extreme. Everyone in the theater was cringing; the girl to my right was clinging to her boyfriend as if a tornado was also present in the room.<br/><br/>But I DO have something very positive to say about this movie. The creatures were PHENOMENAL. A certain distinguishable villain was a PLEASURE to witness, all the creatures where brilliantly detailed and VERY terrifying.<br/><br/>Also the music was a trip down memory lane. Akira adds some variations (mainly with the cello) on his masterpieces that shine above the sub-par visual material. Alothough these tunes are greatly pleasing they're edited into the movie in a strange way, sometimes only playing for about 30 seconds and fading (or simply ending abruptly) leaving you with your musical pants around your musical ankles. This give me the impression that Gans was attempting to immerse the fans in his flick with these familiar sounds but fails to execute this tactic sensibly or creatively.<br/><br/>The acting was average to bad; and we all know these actors are capable of much more.<br/><br/>I honestly wish I could dote on this film. However I'm sorry to say that I simply cannot. I will tell you the whole theater agreed with me, for when the credits rolled: the whole theater crowd erupted with groans, expletives, and ""I want my F****** money back!"" 's.<br/><br/>You are the judge of whether you'll see this movie but I don't recommend it in any way. You can't go with friends to make fun of it (MUCH), you can't really respect it, and if you have any problem with gore or scary images you will loathe it."

The town of Silent Hill has three 'realities'; 1)Silent Hill, ghost-town 2)Foggy Silent Hill where they see demons, falling ash 3)Third is personal hell/nightmarish Silent Hill. <br/><br/>The movie, Silent Hill starts off with the little girl missing from her home & the parents go looking for her, once they find her, she is about to fall off a large embankment. Her mother saves her and the girl begins screaming the name, ""Silent Hill."" Soon the mother takes her to Silent Hill & the adventure begins. The movie has storyline elements from the first 4 Silent Hill games. -Has the storyline of SH1, -Red Pyramid from SH2, -Female protagonist from SH3 -the blood patterns, etc from SH4. <br/><br/>The characters in Silent Hill go back what Silent Hill really looks like to an alternate ""nightmarish"" world. Rose begins looking for her daughter, Sharon, with the help of a biker cop named Cybil. The two go throughout Silent Hill looking for Sharon while transcending back & fourth into ""Foggy Silent Hill"" & ""Nightmare Silent Hill"". Meanwhile her Rose's husband begins searching for his wife but he's in ""real Silent Hill"", so they can't see each other. <br/><br/>The reason I gave this 4/10, is because I felt the movie was a real let-down. The movie falls into my theory on most horror movies, 'it's good up until the half way point and than they don't know how to end it.'Meaning, they pull you into the movie but the rest is a total let down. The ending was just absurd & pointless in my opinion. Personally I felt this movie was a big disappointment. But the cinematography was beautiful and the town looked amazing. Also the acting was pretty good by everyone in the movie. <br/><br/>But again, A lot of people were laughing during the movie at points & some even walked out. Just don't expect too much.

The film started off pretty good, it pulled me right in from the start and interested me. I could not remember the story line from the original game and will admit that i didn't play the others so it was like watching an original film. However twenty minutes later it started to lose my interest mostly because the story just seemed to be going nowhere and was left the viewer asking why did this happen. of course some people could figure out why the things that happen in this film did but all i could hear when the movie was over where people complaining that it just didn't explain anything that happened. The movie basically has a great idea but unfortunately poor direction, and acting. This filmed could have been the best video game to movie considering Redsident Evil messed that up. The final nail in the coffin for me was the ending, I want to feel as if the main characters have reached a conclusion, I understand they want to leave it open to make sequels except there is supposed to be a beginning climax and ending not a climax and a lead into a sequel? As for the look and fell of the town itself it was great and is what i remembered from the games so the filmmakers where successful in that aspect, but could not delivery a entertaining film for more than the hardcore fan.<br/><br/>Hopefully if there is a sequel and I see it when its aired on TBS it will be a lot better and give you an ending that doesn't tell you there will be yet another movie."

The practical effects are so digitally enhanced that they might as well have been CG in the first place...you know...to save more money for what they spent on Sean Bean's character. The story is about as well put together as this review, and you will not understand what everything means unless you have completed the first two games. Sadly, what they mean in the games has no real bearing on the film whatsoever. So, with that said, I'm off to bed. Go see a better movie. If you had high hopes (like me), thinking this might be the first good video game adaptation, I'm sorry for your loss. Clearly these genres were not meant to be.<br/><br/>And for all you message board junkies, that was my reasoning for disliking the movie. So stop throwing that ridiculous troll word around. It makes you look about as intelligent as the writer of this wonderful film. (sarcasm anyone?)"

","I've played silent hill 1,2 and 4 and yes they are good games. In the games there are loads of different types of monsters, but in the film they only use about 3. Waste of a good licence. Too repetitive and slow. The games themselves have fairly easy to understand story lines, but this just baffled me so much. No explanation was given at all. This may sound harsh, but not enough people die, there's all these monsters and in the film only 3 people die, except from all the people at the end, but you don't see any get killed. Personally i'am not a fan of the games, but i do enjoy them, even if i was i wouldn't be any more after seeing this crap. I only saw it because scary movie 4 had already started.<br/><br/>LAME"

","I saw this movie and while I do agree that Silent Hill is the most faithful video game adaption to date I felt it showed the weaknesses of many games and that is character development. The video game itself is creepy and the atmosphere in the movie does give you that unsettling feeling at times but you are not given any reason to care for the characters. Silent Hill is a great game but the lack of character development was always there and unfortunately when you are adapting the movie I wish they could have fixed that problem. Is this the worst video game adaption? Absolutely not. Uwe Boll has House of the Dead and Alone In The Dark and those two take the top two prizes for worst movies based on video games. I will put it up there as one of the better ones but there are not really any great video game movies to date so that really doesn't say too much about the genre.

","Gans is a very talented filmmaker, BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF was a spectacular film, and if there is one thing that SILENT HILL proves, its that Christophe Gans can work wonders on even the most shoddy material. And this is shoddy material. Its a miracle that Gans' visual imagination is able to bring so much imagination to the look (and sound) of the spooky town and its denizens, when the plot involves a woman running from one location to another for unspecified reasons, being menaced by unspecified things for unspecified reasons, for the entire over-extended running time.<br/><br/>If there's another thing SILENT HILL proves, its that Roger Avary is a talentless hack who clearly had little or nothing to do with the PULP FICTION script. If copy-and-pasting scenes from a video game into a film script is called ""screenwriting"" these days, I'm sure there is an infinite supply of 11-year-old schoolboys willing to do it for free. There are two simple options here: go for a dream-like mood-piece in the style of a Dario Argento film that doesn't explain anything, or go for a ""uncover-the-secret"" type straightforward mystery that explains the entire back-story and all the goings-on. Avary tries to do both, tagging on a long explanation about the secrets of Silent Hill (that smacks of stealing from THE RING), and thereby falls between two stools.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell does her best in a very limiting role, like Gans she doesn't have much to play with, and her support is extremely poor (weak child actors, Sean Bean trying to do an American accent). The best actors are the CGI-monstrosities, creep amorphous blobs and a giant demon with a massive knife and a triangle on his head. The scenery steals the show."

"jayjaycee","6","0","1","10 April 2020"," Ambitious yet heavily flawed adaptation
","""Silent Hill"" is a 2006 horror film and video game adaptation directed by Christophe Gans starring Radha Mitchell and Sean Bean. After not having watched a film yesterday and posting a faux review I decided on kicking of my birth month with a rewatch of what many deem to be the best video game adaptation. Given that this film is far away from being a masterpiece and is still a mediocre film doesn't really say much positive about this apparently cursed sub-genre. I actually have mixed feelings about it. First of all, I played the original PlayStation game and consider it to be an extremely chilling experience even it just rode on the coattails of the ""Resident Evil"" game franchise, which I personally adore (but still have to check out the reportedly terrible film adaptations though). Anyways, I expected an equally nightmarish film, but as I said, mixed feelings. The film obviously altered the main premise and has thrown together countless elements into what appears to be a mish-mash of all the original games. That's where the mess begins. While it was Harry Mason solely looking for his daughter Cheryl in the abandoned town of Silent Hill and uncovers one shocking truth after another, it's now Rose Da Silva looking for her daughter Sharon. Similar plot, other people. It's such a pity, as I thought that Bean would make a great life action Harry Mason, only to find out that he played an all new and on the other hand useless background character. The film rather establishes a philosophy about maternal bonds and how important this relationship is, what is anything but terrible and not even that disastrous, but I'm generally not a fan of extreme changes when it come to adapting a source material appropriately. The story of the film may of course vary, but at least keep the same protagonists I connected to while playing the game in the first place. Is this too much asked for? While the film doesn't ensure this, they at least did something else properly: The optics. The overall ash covered scenery and burned and abandoned buildings, as well as the nightmare sequences of the other world are definitely some important advantage this film has to offer. I mean, they even nailed this one famous shot and the general camera work isn't nothing to sneeze at either, the same applying to the fitting score, but if there's one thing that bugs me about the visuals it's the usage of effects. Some practical effects and CGI effects were decent, but well, some seemed to have come straight out of a PS1 game and I'm pretty sure that didn't happen intentionally. They fulfilled their use to a certain degree, but considering it's a mid 2000s film it's pretty cheap to see it done only like this. Now about that plot. Oh boy, what an enjoyable mess. It sloppily combines the best elements the original franchise has to offer and makes an abomination out of it. The first half follows the story of the original game step by step and slowly begins to establish a similar atmosphere, but as soon as other people enter the scene and the film focusses on the cult theme the film stopped being scary. The cult might have been used in the game as well, I know that, but what made it so chilling was how it was only subtly used. Seriously, from there on it might be gross or shocking, but it's far from the eerie and emotional hellride the original game used to be. The game sent you on a psychological and melancholic journey, your only friend being a radio and a crowbar - a lonely man on the search for his daughter. No other people, except for one or two faces. The change of focus therefore basically steals the whole vehemence of the film and is anything but scary. No, really. It didn't scare me anymore. What's even more frustrating is how it implies some of the games finest features (the radio/mobile phone that signifies an upcoming threat, the siren etc.), but leaves it underused eventually. The most immense disappointment is the appearance of The Pyramid Head. He's only there for commercial reasons, at most an excuse for the producers that they have included one of the fan favourite villains. Sadly, he's totally irrelevant for the plot, the characters and doesn't do much at all. He's the personal demon of James Sunderland. What role does he play here? Sigh. Oh, now that we're speaking of uselessness: The male characters and the Christopher sub plot are also not adding anything important to the story and are absolutely unnecessary. Almost seems like they were written into the movie just to have male actors featured ... wait, they were? Yes, indeed and that's another thing that made me facepalm. Without or without them, the story continues on the same mediocre level and doesn't really add something overly exciting. In the end, it only reveals all the secrets and explains the whole story in a single scene and shows of some gory but not scary effects. Oh, and don't get me started about that senseless ambiguous ending. All of this is so frustrating to witness, because it's far from what the original stayed for. Back then it became such a success for it's strange atmosphere, emotional depth, nightmarish visuals and deliberately unexplained and confusing plot. Some hints are given away from time to time, but it's never meant to be fully understood, because Silent Hill is a personal and subjective hell. It's extremely depressing, creepy and absolutely melancholic. What does this movie do? It offers a half-heartedly produced mishmash of generic genre tropes and labels it Silent Hill. All in all, this film is a heavily flawed adaptation that had so many chances to become this infernal journey, but ends up as nothing but an entertaining yet cheap mess with dozens of plot holes. It might be shocking at times and has at least a decent atmosphere, but it's so far away from being the devastating mystery the game is. It could have been if it had respected its source material more. A scarily wasted opportunity to become the greatest video game adaptation of all time ... wait, for a time it has been. Even with everything I stated before. Is it a great film? Absolutely no. Is it a perfect adaptation? Also no. Is it the closest to a decent game adaptation we can get? Sadly, I think so and it's still impossible for me to hate it nevertheless. That's where I give this film credit for: Mindless entertainment."

The religious sentiments are not far from truth, even if the depiction was exaggerating or elaborate.
The psychological aspects hit the right note. The feel of characters behaving like characters from a game was nearly spot on, especially the female cop, given that this movie is adapted from a game.

Yes, if you've watched the show, and understand the concept of something known as the ""Upside Down"", you start seeing this movie in new light & start recognizing the creativity of the movie. The concept was adopted before it was cool, and Stranger Things itself gets its inspiration from various movies from the past, not only from the 80s.

","Insane and nightmarish video game adaptation. The film plays out like a stroll through hell. The central issue of the film is the lack of character and purpose. The connection of Silent Hill to the Sharon character was undercooked, to say the least. This played well on the bigscreen, thanks to the cinematic scope of its filmmaker. A direct adaptation of the original game was probably a better option. Much like all video game adaptations, filmmakers attempt something different with the characters.

In the games the first Silent Hill game you play as a man called Harry Mason however the film is different the lead character is actually female called Rose Da Silva she and her husband Christopher Da Silva adopt a young girl called Sharon she has dreams and nightmares of a place called Silent Hill she must return to get answers. Scribbling over drawings representing evil Sharon starts to get Rose worried so they decide to go to Silent Hill it turns out to be a totally deserted town where mysterious things happen and those who are wanted by the town cannot escape so they are wanted for a reason. I also love this film because while its based on a game it also promises its own standalone type of story there are the same ideas in regards to the name but thats just the title. They couldnt have chosen a better lead for the film though Radha Mitchell performed excellently she's one of those actresses that are entirely realistic with her reactions I mean how would you act if you were trapped in a world full of creatures that were trying to kill you?"

","I have a feeling quite a few young people will see this movie given their ever growing interest in horror films and video games, and even a good portion of 25-30 year olds will make their way to the theatre since the game made its debut on the Playstation system back in 1998. Not only will people be disappointed with the film, they will be leaving the theatre with knots in their stomach, moments from regurgitating their popcorn or other movie snack. The violence is so graphic that you just have to wonder what's next in terms of gore. I thought Even Horizon (1997) was graphic, grisly, horrific (not to mention brimmed with demonism), but Silent Hill somehow exceeds this. There are mutilations, children being burned alive, contorted and bloody disfigurements, moments of barbaric hedonism, rotting corpses, and so forth. To be entirely truthful, the story itself is not very interesting or involving, but credit must be given to a revelation at about the 90-minute mark. It is a flashback sequence explaining things in a manner that makes some things clear but it is too little too late. At the end, I wondered why Sean Bean would even be involved, but was even more bewildered by the acting performance of Rahda Mitchell, who is essentially the weight of the film appearing mostly solo onscreen. I am very easy on actors, but her voice is not commanding enough for important passages in the film. She also talks to herself in a regular voice, instead of ""thinking out loud"" as any natural person would do alone. In one sequence, she evades a cop by speeding, and when she is picked up later and arrested, she unconvincingly bellows, ""What did I do!"""

"callum-mccolgan","3","0","2","6 April 2018"," Striking visuals paired with muddled storytelling
","Silent Hill is easily one of the best video game adaptations I've seen, which is to say it's slightly less awful than the usual output. There's obvious passion here to make something worthy of Silent Hill - the disturbing visual design brilliantly captures the eerie atmosphere of the games, with Yamaoka's familiar industrial musical beats conjuring an air of disquieting unease. It's a shame then that the character depth, psychology, symbolism, thematic depth and mature handling of taboo subjects all appear to be absent.<br/><br/>To try and sum up the story of this film would be a hopeless exercise doomed to failure. While many find the original game's story equally convoluted, it's cemented by a strong opening chord - you are lost in an abandoned town; find your missing daughter. The film attempts to expand on the backstory to this opening, but instead just creates nonsensical character actions that muddy our sympathies and generally add nothing meaningful to the plot other than to leave audiences even more baffled (and demonstrate the pointlessness of Sean Bean's character).<br/><br/>Because of this, once the familiar occult elements worm their way into the film, the story goes completely bonkers and off-the-rails with plot holes that yawn wide at the slightest scrutiny. It's less a complex series of puzzle pieces to be connected together than a disorganised mess of cue cards scattered on the floor.<br/><br/>The best example of this is the symbolism - this played a critical role in the psychological aspect in the games, where the monsters were all designed to reflect a particular character's psyche, it's largely what made the games so clever and engrossing. The film, however, seems clueless about this and instead pulls in a variety of monsters from all the early games and mixes them together. This is fatally flawed though: these monsters reflect characters from different stories and therefore have no purpose for being here other than for fan service, essentially reducing them to empty movie monsters with no deeper meaning or purpose other than to menace the main characters.<br/><br/>The loss of meaning in the town's symbolism extends to the other horror elements as well, which throw out disturbing implications (the games never showed a dead person's face, for instance) for cheap jump scares and splatter. The finale in particular is soaked in ludicrous gore which is about as far removed from the psychology of the games as is possible to be.<br/><br/>In short: the characters are thin, the story is a befuddled mess, the horror is schlock-y, the psychology absent and the acting sub-par. On the other hand: the visuals are incredible, the production design stellar and and atmosphere haunting. If you're someone who gets a kick out of gore and horror imagery alone, then it might be worth a look. To all others though, and especially those who think highly of the games, Silent Hill is an aimless amble through murky nonsense."

","I am a gamer and I enjoy films so I appreciate just how difficult film people seem to find converting a tense game into a tense film. Maybe it should be requisite for the people at the head of creativity in these kinds of films be forced to complete the game on the hardest setting; this should eliminate the idiots from the game players and ensure a truer adaptation.<br/><br/>Admittedly I never completed Silent Hill but I played enough of it to grasp what made it work; why it was scary, tense and why gamers (blokes) liked it. The film of Silent Hill is just really poorly scripted and choreographed, the introduction of frightening characters is fluffed. It felt half-hearted and that shone through."

To be fair to myself I watched this movie when I was about 13 years old, and at the time I didn't even know much about Silent Hill and all the metaphors and tiny details that made me like the series today, but even then, I wouldn't give the movie more than a 5 or 6. If you're a fan of the series and you know the lore, avoid the movies at all costs, if you're just someone who's looking for an average Hollywood horror to kill an hour, go for it, you probably won't find it that bad."

I never knew anything about the story nor did I remember anything about it; I basically watched this movie without any knowledge of the Silent Hill world.<br/><br/>Now on to the review:<br/><br/>I was impressed by the movie's atmospheric psychological aspects, and room left for audience self interpretation. The self interpretation aspect however went a bit too far in the ending; I've never known the Silent Hill series was actually an alternate dimension... I believed it was a place in their 'reality' infested with some kind of monsters.

"Pozdnyshev","8","0","1","15 October 2016"," Surprisingly Good, Imaginative Horror Movie
","Wow. I've been saying for a while that most horror movies made after around 2000 are bad. But this one was actually pretty good. I have never played the video game, so this is a review of the movie on its own.<br/><br/>A spooky little girl sleepwalks out to a quarry in the middle of the night. Her hot mother chases her and saves her from plunging to her death into some hellish hallucination of what looks like a bunch of rusty catwalks above molten steel.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty complicated, but basically the girl was adopted from this mysterious town called ""Silent Hill."" The mother, for some reason, wants to take her daughter there as a way to help her psychosis. When she does get there, she and this woman cop who followed her somehow slip into a parallel reality where this ghost town is always foggy and is constantly raining ashes. The place, it turns out, is infested with deadly and Lovecraftian things that attack them. And every few hours, everything turns dark and there are even more monsters around.<br/><br/>The movie really succeeds in creating a creepy atmosphere. That's what I really appreciated about it. Unfortunately, the way they tied up the reasons behind this hell on earth were a bit lame.<br/><br/>Like, it turns out that this literal Hell on Earth is some kind of fallout created by the town's former occupants. Okay, I totally buy that. But then, what exactly did they do to create a freaking tear in the very fabric of reality? An unholy combination of abominably black magic over hundreds of years, millions of incredibly horrific human sacrifices, and an already unclean location that God himself had forsaken? <br/><br/>... No... It's the vengeful rage of a little girl who had a crappy life and then was burned as a witch. Now this WAS creepy in a way, because yes, severe trauma DOES invite evil into the human heart. Totally buy that. Anyone is capable of turning into a monster after they've been tortured enough.<br/><br/>But... ONE LITTLE GIRL'S SUFFERING and ONE DEMON just isn't enough energy to create a damned interdimensional glitch in the matrix. Not on this massive scale.<br/><br/>Kill a few people? Sure. Drive quite a few people mad? Absolutely. Put together a small, messed-up death cult? Sure, I'd buy that. Haunt an isolated location? yeah totally. But they couldn't turn an entire town into a Cannibal Corpse music video populated with lethal demonic creatures. That's just absurd.<br/><br/>That's my only gripe. But I can easily forgive that because it was an otherwise smart movie (yes I said smart -- the bar is pretty low right now), and the monsters and locations were genuinely scary."

","Silent hill is just a big fat mess! This film makes absolutely no sense, it's disgusting and confusing. It's very difficult to keep up with this movie, I had to rewind so many times just to try and understand what the heck is going on. This movie had way to much blood and just gross effects throughout. I like the actors in it, that's basically the only reason I'm giving this film a 2 and not a 1. The cast did their best and were pretty enjoyable. But the plot was weird, confusing, and muddled. The visuals were alright I guess, nothing all that dazzling. The ending is weird and I honestly don't even want to try to understand it, this movie is not worth trying to understand. The dialogue is almost comically bad, and the acting is iffy with some characters and somewhat better with others. The creatures were not even scary, they were just gross and weird.

","Silent Hill does an amazing job of capturing the inherent creep vibe of backwoods West Virginia, and then warping that into a truly twisted conclusion. The movie incorporates shots which are composed based on the angles of the camera in the video game.. while you might not care about that, it ends up meaning that the film visually looks really unique, so even if you're Joe Horror & have seen everything, it will at least engage you on that level.<br/><br/>The acting is this films worst aspect.. (maybe because of the foreign language director?) While filming the actors must've had no clue what the final product was going to look like, I think. It certainly isn't ""bad"" but it stands out more because everything else is damn good.<br/><br/>The reason I give it 10 stars, however, is because I don't think any other film (really) has done such a good job in the mood & music department. When you watch this movie you really do feel like you are going into Silent Hill, discovering the truth, and then barely making it out through a truly twisted ending.<br/><br/>There's a reason this movie hasn't been forgotten like the other VG franchise movies that came out around this time (Bloodrayne anyone? Resident Evil also). It stands on its own as a damn good film. To be perfectly honest its a lot better than some of the Silent Hill games! To me, its perfect, but even if you don't feel that way, I think you'll feel its at least 8/10. Give it a chance. But oh god do not watch the sequel, it sucks."

"KawhyDesu","3","0","1","16 February 2015"," Mediocre and ineffective
","I was a fan of the Silent Hill game franchise prior to my watching of this film. I didn't expect much from it, given the poor record of other video game to movie adaptations, so my reaction shouldn't surprise me. But it did. This film does a good job of making the complex narrative of the games look schlocky and typical. Oh look, cultists! Oh, just kooky Christians, never mind. Oh look, a cop! Oh, she plays by the book and has a brooding past. Oh look, evil/otherworldly being! Oh, Satan. <br/><br/>Another problem of this film is a lack of effective/lasting horror. This movie follows a very western style of horror in which a scary thing appears and lets you get a good look at it. This contrasts deeply with a precedent established in the games, that the horror should be concealed or in some way masked. Changing this aspect creates a feeling of disjointedness between the psychological themes and the delivery of said themes, and ultimately reduces their effectiveness. <br/><br/>Speaking of ineffective premises that this movie claims to have, the mystery is non-existent. There are few clues that culminate into the solution, just essentially a solution given flat out. The ""clues"" just say what they are trying to say, and after the audience already knows what happened, the film decides to reiterate. <br/><br/>Conclusion: Don't bother with the movie, just go play the game."

It's one dimensional and flat. The upside? The visuals are fun. The bad guys are neat-o cool-o to look at, in the way small children enjoy ugly insects. That's about it.

Apparently, the only reason for doing this was to introduce cool looking monsters & show blood & gore - just like video game levels. Well, this works for a video game, but certainly not for a horror movie. There are huge holes in the plot - other reviewers have already mentioned it, so I am not going into details. There is absolutely no reason why this movie is so long - reducing 30-40 minutes wouldn't have made any difference to the story.

Rose crap was rather annoying but the rest was fun. then the third act starts...<br/><br/>The third and forth act are stupid boring nonsense gore, which is not creepy or disturbing it is just mindless and uncreative. The second scene of pyramid head was something you would see in tom and Jerry except with blood.<br/><br/>The third act contains rose and Cybil putting aside their differences to work together to find her daughter, this would be considerably good character development but the reasons for arresting rose was vague and confused, and actually put me against Cybil and i wanted her to die for being annoying and when she finally stopped acting like a complete twit i still did not care because she was still not developed and did not do a thing in the entire movie besides fighting off a couple enemies so why care?<br/><br/>The forth act consist's of rose having to battle the evil of this town to get her daughter back, it would sound touching and heart wrenching but it isn't, mainly because rose is an idiot for taking Sharon there in the first place! it is over all a clumsy, boring, unfocused, gigantic plot hole of nightmarish delusions"

","Silent Hill is a decent adaptation of the game, but it falls flat in all other aspects. It's visuals are very nice, the feeling of isolation that the games worked so hard to create is concrete here, and there are several parts that truly feel like the game. However, having said that, it has a few too many plot holes and stupid character decisions to keep the coherency of the plot going. <br/><br/>The biggest, most atmosphere destroying flaw in the entire movie is Sean Bean's inclusion. For those unaware, the main character of the original silent hill game is a male, Harry Mason. However, in an attempt to create a strong female character, he was replaced with a female. No problem, on paper, but two main problems in execution: There was already a strong female character in the police officer, Sibyl Bennett, and the exclusion of a main male character created the shoehorned in Sean Bean scenes. These scenes took the atmosphere completely out of the movie, no more was there a sense of isolation. Watching Sean Bean walk around looking stunned and dumbfounded does not, believe it or not, add suspense.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you could do worse. However, when people say that this is a great movie, they are strenuously incorrect. It only plays off of the already perfect setup provided by the fantastic game that it's based on.

","Let's see, this is my first review but since i'm a huge fan of Silent Hill i have to make a review about this movie. All start with this girl Sharon being a sleep walker and screaming in the middle of the night Silent Hill! (Why they change the name from Cheryl to Sharon, i'm not sure... but that's not really a big deal). Her parents, Chris and Rose DaSilva, they are worried and they don't know what to do, so Rose decide to take Sharon to Silent Hill and see if she can get a magical medicine or something for her sleepwalking child. Now here is the fatal mistake of the movie, WHY they have to change Harry for Rose? I read somewhere it was because Harry was to ""feminine"", so when ""Caring for your own child"" is a mother's thing? Anyway, besides that the movie goes pretty decent, the atmosphere is pretty well made, the monster are spectacular in my opinion (Al tough they could add more monsters) and the music is taken from the game, this is the strong point of the movie since Akira Yamaoka is a superb composer. If you are looking for a faithful adaptation (Just like me) then you are looking in the wrong place, this is more a re imagination of the first game with some elements of the other games. It's not bad but the original plot is hundred times better."
"DoubtfulHenry","6","0","2","6 September 2010"," Visually stunning. Lackluster storytelling
","I haven't played the video game Silent Hill franchise very much in depth, however i've always been a fan of its visuals. The tone, composition and lighting are breathtaking in all the games. The transition to film doesn't necessarily lose any shine but the stunted storytelling becomes more obvious.<br/><br/>The acting is fairly passable. It doesn't distract the viewer any more than the mediocre writing does. Radha Mitchell is head and shoulders above all other performers in the film. She conveys the fear and determination of a mother, searching for her lost and only daughter with poise and realism. Sean Bean is wasted with few lines and a pointless character that only serves to slow down the progression of the movie. Perhaps for the best, his character is poorly written and Sean Bean is directed for the role very well.<br/><br/>The sounds and music didn't quite pull me in. They fill their role but don't immerse the viewer into the films universe as well as they could have. The sounds are equally as important as the visuals, so in a film like this with strong visuals, the sound should amplify the experience. Sadly it didn't amplify at all.<br/><br/>Now as for those visuals, they were pretty astounding. The CG affects blended extremely well, i couldn't tell at times what was CG and what was a practical effect. The shot composition showed off the effects well and heightened the creepy factor. The monster design didn't meet par with the games but still impressed with deranged forms and creatures.<br/><br/>Silent Hill's story telling was weak in the film. All the interesting visuals in the world can't save a movie that gets as convoluted as this does. The climax doesn't make sense and cops out in the most unsatisfying way. Loose ends are not tied up and things just peter out in the end.<br/><br/>I would recommend Silent Hill only as an art gallery. Find clips of the movie to admire the visuals but don't sit down and watch the whole movie expecting it to form or complete any kind of story arc."

This movie is proof that not all movies that are made from video games are disasters. The script is good and the casting is pretty good. The music of course is awesome. As I was watching the movie I felt like I was playing the game by watching it just because of the music got it perfect:) Rhada Mitchell, Sean Bean, Deborah Kara Unger are really good at their characters. Laurie Holden I thought could have been better. Don't get me wrong, I liked her in X-files and The Mist. Alice Krige was just perfect at the part and at a villainess, like she usually does. They are suppose to be making Silent Hill 2 next year. Hopefully it will be just as goo as the first. Although the last movie sequel that was better then the original was Aliens.

","Not terrible, but quite a frustrating experience. Being less of a gamer and not knowing anything about the video games its based upon probably didn't help, however this a feature length film ( a strange one too) and not a interactive game. Visually I loved it (thanks to director Christophe Gans' appealingly slick and vast eye), but the story was hard to come to gripes as it doesn't go to much lengths to build upon its interesting set-up. It leads you on a nightmarish puzzler, and then tries to cram everything in towards the end. The usual explanation for the events. Due to some lulling passages, I found it hard to truly get in to with the saving grace being the very good central performance from Rahda Mitchell and the eerily disorienting atmospherics with the superbly presented, if exaggerated monster creations (make-up and CGI being used). These demons do like to hand out nasty, explicit punishment. The ideas were there, but the execution of it was cluttered and unfocused like one set-piece was thrown on top of another --- and in a way I found the side-story of the concerned father (admirably played by Sean Bean) trying to find his missing wife and daughter while also digging up the history of the tainted town Silent Hill to be a lot more engrossing then the leaden angle of the mother looking for her missing daughter while experiencing the town's many demons - unnatural and human. In all honesty the story is meant to be a teaser and what you call a mind^%#@ with random occurrences and an ending that's rather haunting in its suggestion through imagery (mainly the performances) and the use of an airy score (which during the intense moments can be bruising). Also the slaughterhouse climax in a church is a sight to see too."

","In the DVD features Christophe states the essential truth about adapting a work from a different media. You can mess the characters and the setting but you shall not mess the theme.<br/><br/>The theme is something that goes completely ignored more times than not, and it carries the difference between a great adaptation or a unwatchable work.<br/><br/>The theme to Silent Hill (Just the Alessa arc) is about parent and child love. And just how religion can transform people into monsters. The movie gets this right while visually keeping the cue from the video game. It develops in a story of it's own. There will be purists who will not enjoy the film, since it cannot recreate the long hours of playing and the feeling of being in control. Buyt it is just different media and the only thing that has to be really carried over is the theme and the spirit.<br/><br/>In a sub genre full of bad flicks. Silent Hill may be the best out there. That does not speaks great of the film, but means something, the production team understood what could be done and as a result even with the most different setting this movie shares more spirit with it's original material than the LOTR movies for example.<br/><br/>A worth rental at the very least. and for people who know nothing of Silent Hill perhaps a good chance to get into one of the most rich and narratologically complex videogames ever."

","Before giving my views on this film I must point out that I have never played the game on which it is based so can't say how it compared or how close it stayed to the original plot. After an introduction where we learn that Rose's adopted daughter Sharon is prone to sleep walking and while asleep keeps referring to Silent Hill; the town of her birth. Rose decides she must go to Silent Hill with Sharon if she is to discover what is the matter with her. Silent Hill isn't a normal town; it was abandoned after the coal seem under the town caught fire about the time of Sharon's birth. Shortly before getting there Rose is pulled over by a police woman, called Cybil, however as the officer approaches she accelerates off and drives at high speed to Silent Hill with the officer in pursuit. On arrival she crashes and when she regains consciousness there is no sign of Sharon.<br/><br/>There is something not quite right about the town; it appears to be snowing at first put it soon becomes apparent that it is ash from the still burning fire. Seeing a child she thinks is her daughter she runs after her but is confronted by strange creatures. Returning to her car she meets the police woman who handcuffs her and tries to take her out of town; they can't get out though as the road inexplicably ends in a precipice which wasn't there when they arrived. Trapped in the town Rose is determined to continue the search for her daughter and sets about searching for her, starting at the school as she remembered a picture she drew. Each place she goes gives a clue as to where she should look next... after she has survived the threat in that location of course. Eventually she finds a girl that looks just like her daughter but she claims her name is Alessa. Strangely she disappears soon after they meet and Rose and Cybil are taken to the church where a strange cult hides from what they call ""The Darkness"". These people tell Rose where she can find this Darkness, when she gets there we learn just what her daughter's connection to Alessa is and just what happened to the town all those years ago. While Rose is looking for her daughter her husband comes looking for her. Here we learn that she isn't in the real world as we see them in the same place at the same time but the weather is different and they don't see each other however he get a sense of her presence when he smells her perfume.<br/><br/>For a film adapted from a game I never got the feeling I was watching somebody playing a game as I have with other adaptations although the progressive encounters did have a sense of advancing game levels where a clue must be found to go to the next location. The atmosphere was delightfully creepy early on and the faceless creatures were quite chilling. Unfortunately the final confrontation between Alessa and the townspeople wasn't frightening, it was just CGI gore. I was pleased that even though the end suggests that all is not as it should be there wasn't the cliché of having one more attack after we thing the threat is over. Radha Mitchell did a good job as Rose making the character believable in an unbelievable situation and young Jodelle Ferland stole the scenes she was in as Sharon and her counterpart Alessa. I don't think this was a great film but it is worth watching if it is on late night television, it was certainly better than some game adaptations I've seen."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","6","0","1","9 March 2010"," It being an adaptation does it more harm than good
","I love the games, having played the four of them that were out when this hit cinemas; however, I am not a blind follower of them who can't handle alterations made to the source material. What I have to wonder is why they bothered using so many key elements of the original when they were changing it all so drastically. Think about it; let's say I buy a shirt. A well-made one, a ""name"" one. I go home, proceed to cut it up, and then I sew it into a hat. No, the result won't necessarily be unusable as head-wear; but that does nothing about the fact that it is, indeed, a strange way of getting to that point. Why not simply purchase fabric and start from scratch? While I won't deny that it bothered me that they went in such a different direction, what really stands out to me as bad is how they refused to throw away the shackles that using a lot of the same stuff as the 1999 VG(and some from the others) was; I suppose they really prefer ""you messed up ***!"" to ""where was ***?"". Yes, this has people, music, locations, angles and monsters that we can recognize, as well as a tad of cheap fan-service. Also, credit where it is due, this definitely *looks* extraordinary. The production values are nothing short of stunning, with areas, costumes, and FX(save for a little of the CGI) that are amazing and leave nothing to be desired. The cinematography and editing are marvelous. This manages to build a pretty good atmosphere, and it can be disturbing, if nowhere near on the level of the rest of the franchise(I find it hard to believe that this was meant to be as chilling as the story or the whole of any of them... the first of which(that this is meant to be a version of), I might add, could easily have survived a direct translation). There are a few scares that are loud and don't fit with the rest, and a handful of downright goofy instances. I'm all for equality, though the gender switch of the lead seems like misplaced tokenism(the already there strong female wasn't even removed; I'm referring, of course, to Cybil, who, by the way, looks like she walked straight out of the sexual fantasy of a guy into leather), and it wound up being an example of them shooting themselves in the foot... feet... whatever. The husband scenes break the delicately established mood, and not only *could* they be taken out(with literally no negative impact), they *should*, it would improve the overall picture. They take away from the sense of isolation... and so does other things. The acting varies, if the main cast do well, and the kid is phenomenal. Dialog ranges, a bit is forced and poor. The script doesn't completely hold up, it bears the marks of their being unwilling to fiddle with the structure too much; think of it as trying to invent chess, using checkers as the basis. No, really, the plot they had isn't the worst; it's dragged down by them writing it around what was put in place around one not like theirs. This did not have a fraction of the emotional resonance with me that the interactive Silent Hill's did. The rest of what's wrong with this is all linked to it essentially being a Hollywood flick; there's gratuitous eye-candy(seriously, half the women in this are hot chicks), the characters are entirely black and white, everything is tied(closely, at that) to the core conflict(do they not realize that background and details that flesh out the world are a positive? Must popular movies be dominated by this fear of the audience not being able to handle that?), and, showing a true lack of understanding of the effect of mystery and the viewers' own imaginations, barely a single incident in this remains unexplained(and for the vast majority of them, we are talking the straight, ""sit down, this omniscient voice is now going to tell you, with no trace of ambiguity, what has happened, including the parts you've seen"", not giving us the benefit of the doubt that maybe we could piece it together ourselves, perhaps we'd actually enjoy *thinking* about what we've watched). There is plenty of bloody, gory violence, infrequent swearing and brief references to sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a feature length documentary that I will review on its individual page here on the site, a theatrical trailer, TV spots and a photo gallery. For what it's worth, I don't consider director Gans untalented; quite the opposite(I'll consider checking out other of his films), he did the best he could with what he had to work with, that being what Avary put together. Heck, it may not have been his fault, either, with the other pieces he's done... well, whose choice was it? Who thought that it would be better to dis-, and then re-assemble, instead of just going somewhere new? I recommend this to those who like supernatural horror(not to be confused with psychological terror, like the rest of the series). As is nearly always the case, those who like what this was an adaptation of will be disappointed. 6/10"

"cartman442003","7","0","1","4 February 2010"," Poorly translated from the game, good as a standalone movie
","Someone said in a review I read a second ago that ""Silent Hill"" is something that he called a ""nightmare drama."" To clarify, there is no such genre as ""nightmare drama."" That doesn't exist. What he clearly meant to say is that Silent Hill is ""a drama with horrific elements that follows the journey of a central protagonist through a Lovecraftian nightmare world that ultimately leads her to confront deeper aspects of herself and humanity in general."" <br/><br/>That, children, is what ""horror"" is. <br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" isn't what has become accepted as ""horror."" Horror can be all blood, guts and cheap scares, but that's shallow horror. True horror uses subtlety, slow-burn, suspense, and its horrific elements are made up of things that, given another context, would be normal, or almost normal. Horror is, essentially, when everything in the room is horribly, disturbingly WRONG, but the room doesn't seem to agree. The tone (the feeling of the author or scene) is normal, smooth, almost blasé, while the mood (the reactionary feeling of the audience to the things on screen) is utterly disturbed. <br/><br/>Good horror = a man wakes up in his bed, sees his young daughter, who has been dead for years, walking across the ceiling.<br/><br/>Bad horror = A masked grotesquery wielding a chainsaw, in full, plain view, cuts a young woman's head off. The camera focuses on what was once her neck, spraying blood all over the room.<br/><br/>You're probably asking by this point, ""which is the Silent Hill movie, good or bad horror?"" To tell you the truth, a bit of both.<br/><br/>I saw this movie before I played any of the games. That way, I didn't find myself comparing it to every aspect of the games that it got wrong, and I was able to enjoy it to a far greater degree than I would have otherwise. The monsters (especially the Grey Children) were superbly recreated. They were extremely disturbing and the fact that why they look the way they are is never explained makes it even more unsettling; it helps you feel that the protagonist has stumbled into a world that really is completely different from what we have come to know as ""ordinary."" The creepy little girl is the best part, I think. Although creepy little girls with long, black hair are always scary, this movie uses the element cleverly, in a way that doesn't feel as though she's scaring us for the sake of scaring us- there's a reason for everything she does, however unsettling or seemingly random it may appear. This, in turn, adds to the creepiness.<br/><br/>That's all the good I have to say about this movie. It was scary at times, but the interjections with Chris Da Silva were pointless and broke the flow of the movie. The climax of the movie on is the best part by far. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but trust me, one of the final scenes in the movie almost makes the whole damn thing on its own. Pyramid Head is pretty cool, but he's just another monster here. He's not playing the role he played in SH2, he's just some guy with a giant, pointy hat and a sword that he probably should have considered scaling down a bit for the sake of practical use (there's a reason it's so huge in the game, but in this movie it's just a part of his costume). The acting is sub-B grade, the story is hammy, Sean Bean's character is more or less pointless, the subtlety was sliced in half by Pyramid Head's great knife, and many of the scarier monsters are put in simply because of their iconic status within the games. The result is that all of them are taken out of context seemingly without the writer of the movie having understood what they were meant to represent in the games. Pyramid Head's role is definitely the most painful case of a beloved Silent Hill ghoul's significance being nullified by his out of context placement in this movie, but the most pointless appearance came from the nurses. Really, why did they have to be in this movie? Was Rose battling with her own sexuality underneath everything else that was going on, trying in vain to repress a furious lust for women? If that's the case, it was never mentioned in the movie, and if it isn't, then the nurses are completely present as a fan service.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie if you judge it by its own merits. I still think someone more capable, that is, someone who actually understood the game, should have another go at the series some ways down the road. As a game to movie translation, this film is a swing and a miss. As a HORROR movie, though, it's well worth at the very least renting for a weekend."

It reminds me of these horror that are out to date not even scary and doesn't take the time and effect to come with the movie and make it into an powerhouse like Halloween, Freddy and Jason. I'm not saying have more that 3 prequels just take your time and make the movie, instead of just making a movie that no one is going to remember.

"david-robin","2","0","2","29 September 2009"," a flat, disappointing movie.
","Christophe Gans is a known amateur of B-series movies, and his previous creations (Crying Freeman, Brotherhood of the Wolf) were very talented entertainment movies.<br/><br/>Crying Freeman was a mix of romance and traditional yakuza story, while Brotherhood of the Wolf was a film ""de capes et d'epees"". Both movies were characterized by their suspense and the quality of the production.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is far from that. Unfortunately, this big production is very linear and its scenario is paper-thin. Too thin, in fact, to justify the duration of this movie, and the viewer will often feel that scenes are too long or even unnecessary (especially when explicit violence is depicted -burning people, etc- ) .<br/><br/>This film fully relies on an all-you-can-eat bulimia of special effects. Another constant is the use of deep shadows to create anxiety, as the spectator can only see monster in the light beam of the heroin. This technique was previously seen in numerous movies, Alien and Seven among many many others.<br/><br/>I have read comments about this movie being smarter than a typical gore movie, and being more profound than a simple video-game adaptation. Unfortunately, this is simply not true."
"notanothervctm","5","0","2","9 September 2009"," Why wasn't this better?
","I really, really wanted this movie to be amazing. I love Pyramid Head, the sets, the sound design, etc. but I do feel like Sean Bean was wasted. His scenes seemed so pointless. The explanation on here for the ending is interesting (Alessa creating a place identical to the world Rose and Sharon were used to, that's why Rose returns home yet it's still Silent Hill), but that doesn't come across in the movie. And even Gans seemed to lament the fact his film is not scary according to an interview he did post-release. I wish he would've gone with his original climax with 5 Pyramid Heads... that would've been pretty incredible. I think the biggest issue is I don't connect to the characters at all... they never seem like real people. I liked the cop sacrificing herself so Rose could go down the elevator, but then of course, the cop isn't dead so that ruins a really good moment. This movie should've been so much better."
"katdawg620","5","0","1","2 September 2009"," I don't even know what to say...
","I can't give this film any higher than a 5, but I can't rate it any lower either. I don't even know what to rate this film. I don't even know how to begin to explain how emotionally disturbed I was from watching it...I'll be honest though, I found it very captivating and interesting and spooky from start to finish, but the last 30 mins of the film I truly regret seeing. It wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, but the impression it left me with just haunts me. I know that this film is based off of a video game (granted I've never actually played it) but I definitely got that game vibe going on through the film with the fog and limited visibility when the night came. It's a suspenseful film to the point where you are watching it clenched in the fetal position on your bed, covering your eyes until you catch your breath, then you want to sleep with the lights on and having the covers pulled over your head all night long. My boyfriend showed me this film last night for the first time, and near the end I was crying because I was so freaked out and disturbed by what certain people were doing to others. He had to turn it off so I could calm down, but I wanted to finish watching it. And I really wish I didn't. I guess if you like films that make you jump then leave you with that empty feeling of emotional discomfort, then I highly recommend it. Like I said, it wasn't a bad movie at all, just overly disturbing and I will remain haunted by this movie for a long time. And believe me, if I'm rambling on about how screwed up this movie made me after watching it, you should know that it definitely does what a horror film is supposed to do. The acting is excellent, the sets are great, makeup effects are fantastic...it's just all to intense for me. But, the twist in the end is what makes the film all come together despite sitting through the movie dazed and confused. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is, if you enjoy intense gory decent horror films, then watch this one. You won't be disappointed."
"stg213","7","0","1","8 August 2009"," Good attempt... Could have been a lot better!
","I'll start with the good stuff: the movie captures the game's atmosphere pretty well, the visuals, the panic, the creepiness... it takes all of the good elements of the game and blends them together in a pseudo-original storyline.<br/><br/>It somewhat captures the feel of the game but sadly ultimately fails to deliver! <br/><br/>(Slight spoilers below) <br/><br/>First of all, monsters in SH games are not random apparitions... they aren't there for no reason, and their look and feel is usually custom-set for each game. The monsters are part of the experience as much as the story, as much as the scenery. Each individual one of them plays into the storyline and has symbolism attached to it (for example in SH 2, towards the end of the game you encounter some frame-bed-with people on top -monsters -> these blend into the story with one of the characters who was victim of rape - and the monster looks like an ongoing rape-scene - and with the main character's own story about his wife who's death-bed image he's haunted by) -> in the movie monsters are just there, there is no particular reason for them to be there or for them to look the way they do. They are all easily recognizable from the games but they don't make any sense with the movie's storyline.<br/><br/>Second, SH stories have always a double meaning... one in which you accept the premise of the SH monster-town and one in which SH is just another symbol for unconscious nightmares. All first 4 games have worked this double meaning masterfully (the 5th, which is very much based on the movie fails in this regard also). The movie just gives one explanation, the monster-town explanation and doesn't give room for anything but the supernatural explanation (the ending leaves nothing to imagination, telling viewers that the two main characters are forever trapped in the Silent Hill parallel universe).<br/><br/>And third, another crucial element in the games, is the storyline, how the character's experience slowly gives the player clues about what's actually going on, helping the player along in solving the mystery. The games do have one or more ""revealing scenes"" but nothing as poorly executed as the movie. In the movie there is practically almost no progression, by the time the stage is set and the story gets in motion, time's up and you get the explanation all blurted out at once in sort of a flash-back old-style reel. There is virtually no build-up to it, no progression in story, in discovery, in mystery.<br/><br/>And fourth, as another commenter already pointed out, SH is downright scary and disturbing. Playing the game alone at night is sure to send icy shivers down your spine, make you feel trapped, alone, isolated, confused, curious, sick, insane etc. Out of all of that palette of feelings the movie only manages to bring across ""eerie"" and that's about it. In the final ""descent scenes"" I had the feeling of watching the Doom game-to movie conversion in which game-fans are treated to the first person shooter perspective (in SH the familiar map-navigation and stumbling through the dark). But in the game that is a whole experience, something you live through... the movie only REMINDS you of that wonderful feeling, instead of GIVING you the feeling.<br/><br/>People who played the games will find themselves in familiar territory and will enjoy the movie more or less. People who are not familiar with the games sadly won't ""get it""... They won't ""get"" what Silent Hill is all about, they will only get a slight ""feeling"" about it... but it barely scratches the surface! <br/><br/>All in all it's one of the better game to movie transitions, but as most it fails in many regards to convey the elements that made the games they are based on great and make them come to life on screen. At least it tried, and it stayed true to the original in most regards."

Laura Holden is good as the lead, but other than that, the actors are not very good.<br/><br/>The creatures look fake and there's too much CGI. There is some nice photography and pretty cool looking set pieces, but this got boring real fast.<br/><br/>That's mainly because the pacing of the movie is REALLY slow, much slower than I thought it would be.

","After seeing what was done with the Resident Evil movies I was dreading what might happen to Silent Hill. But then I heard that it was being directed by Christophe Gans the man behind the awesome Brotherhood of the Wolf and I felt thing might just turn out at least adequate so long as the studio let him do is thing. I turns out not only is the film descent it is a truly fitting film adaptation of the games I love taking all the best bits from throughout the game series and spinning a new plot while keeping the same sense of terror and foreboding that you get when you play the games. Gans even uses the same camera angle shifts and lighting effects - this is the only movie of a game I have seen that truly delivers on keeping to the spirit of it's source material.<br/><br/>Of course as a film it is not perfect, there are clearly better horror films out there and those who haven't played the games or even heard of the games should probably try to learn a little bit about them before going into this even if it is a completely new story it is set in an already established world. But if you are a fan of the series and were worrying that maybe Hollywood may have botched up yet another game series movie let the worrying end, finally ... a success."
"sluggy-x","9","0","1","31 January 2009"," The most frightening film I have ever seen
","First off, I agree with what some people said about the film being very emotional. The ending, no spoilers here, was very sad, the way the woman could not be seen by her husband or anyone else, and was permanently trapped in a ghostly other world. The imagery was the part that got me the most. Every monster was extremely frightening, and there were some extremely tense scenes. The one in the school scared me the most, I almost didn't sleep the night I saw that. The photography succeeded in being very eerie, it was simply amazing. However good this film is, I don't think I can bring up the courage to re-watch it any time soon. I've seen some really scary films (The Grudge, for example), but this tops them all. 9 stars for amazing photography, special effects, and script, as well as for scaring the sh*t out of me."
"H_Spengler","10","0","1","25 January 2009"," Disturbing
","And this is in a good way. I'm often wary of ""horror"" films nowadays because just not scary anymore. This I think hit the nail on the head (at least in my view) where there is something so much more frightening about a film featuring visions like those twisted right out of a nightmare then mindlessly splashing blood around a screen.<br/><br/>I'll give you a few examples: ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake for me was terrifying, this film creeped me out, even the ""Blair Witch"" to an extent. Something about being helpless makes it all the more frightening. I've never played the games either.<br/><br/>Little girl & mother get separated and lost in the world of ""Silent Hill."" Mother spends duration of movie searching for daughter, and on the way encounters a ghost town, a sky raining ash, and unexplained periods of complete darkness preceded by an air raid siren. Encountered in the darkness are some of the most twisted and terrifying creatures ever imagined. Small ""damned"" people, an acidic spouting twisted creature, murderous nurses, the barbed wire finale and my favorites ""Pyramid Head"" and ""Colin the janitor."" <br/><br/>What really impressed me about this movie is that a great deal of the creatures and effects are NOT CGI'd! Of course some of it is out of necessity, but the ""creatures"" and ""nurses"" are dancers costumed in latex & makeup, they have the limberness and contortion needed for the part. Watching the special on how they made this movie is really quite fascinating. <br/><br/>I still am not quite certain as to what exactly happened at the end of this movie though, and with certain scenes throughout with the husband trying to find her, but they couldn't see or hear each other b/c of alternate dimension thing. Still worth the watch and highly recommended though.<br/><br/>BTW-Interesting ""factoid"" the town ""Silent Hill"" is based on the real life town of Centralia, PA, which has had a coal fire burning underneath for over 40 years, and has virtually rendered it a ghost town. I've been to Centralia and can verify this is true. Creepy."

","After growing up with the typical American horror films, this movie is a refreshing change from the same old garbage pawning themselves off as 'horror movies'. No groups of teens or 20-somethings hunted by a seemingly immortal killer. No eternal struggle with the devil. No other cliché gimmicks that have grown stale after repeated use. Instead, a select few individuals are pitted against an army of monsters that defy typical depictions, and in one of the most surreal and nightmarish settings I have seen in a movie. The cast is well picked, with special mention of Kim Coates as a cops who's past in Silent Hill weighs heavily in him in the present. It has been a long time since I enjoyed watching a horror movie because of how creepy it is. If you're tired of the Jason's, Freddy's and Jigsaw's, try this movie, and see what nightmares REALLY look like."

","I have never played the game. To me Silent Hill is the greatest horror movie I ever watched and I think it's heavily underrated. Although there are zombies walking around in Silent Hill, it is none of those typical zombie movies. Silent Hill is not a splatter-movie about monsters being ripped, it's a movie about fear of death. And like no other movie I ever watched, Silent Hill really makes me feel afraid. This fear is produced by sound-scape as well as by visuals. The howling sirens of the disaster alarm, the creeping darkness, the ashes falling like snow, it's all together has an incredible, indescribable effect on the audience. And finally the monsters. I've never seen that frightening zombies. Even though I could try to describe them, you should simply give this movie a try and see them with your own eyes. Nevertheless I want to give a brief description, which were my favourite monsters: First off, those at the very beginning, which neither have a face nor arms. Very impressive. But they are even topped by the monsters that are wearing masks that look like those of the pest-doctors in the middle ages and carrying guessed five meter knifes. If you are a fan of horror movies, you will love Silent Hill."

Though the movie may be a disappointment to the fans of the game, people who have never played the first game will be amazed by the visual effects and the superb acting.

","There are very few examples where anything remotely linked to a computer game has been devised in to anything other than a poor attempt at a film and Silent Hill is I am afraid to say lumped in with the likes if Doom, Double Dragon, and of course the shocking, Street Fighter & Super Mario Bros! From the outset, no matter how much you willingly suspend your disbelief you simply can not understand why what is happening IS happening. The entire film seem confused as to what it is but also what it wants to state. The story is unclear and by the time you get to the point you have switched off, either mentally or literally.<br/><br/>I much prefer a thought provoking horror/thriller to a slash em up, however I would say for the 148 minutes this ran for I would would have much preferred 85 minutes of a hockey masked, knife-fingered clad, ghost faced, hat wearing, rotted faced, patchy teen slasher any time."

","Based on the 1999 video game, just like Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Resident Evil: Apocalypse, it is another failed adaptation, and I have no idea if the actual video game has any relation to this pretty silly story. Basically Rose Da Silva (Phone Booth's Radha Mitchell) adopted troubled daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), and she is searching for her routes, because of severe nightmares and sleepwalking, so she is heading for the strange, desolate town called ""Silent Hill"". Rose's husband Christopher Da Silva (Sean Bean) warns her of all the terrible things that have happened in the town, but she pretty much ignores him, and as a consequence has a car crash, goes into may of the buildings experiencing quite random spirit attacks, e.g. melting walls, zombie like things trying to catch her, oh, and Sharon goes missing. It turns out Sharon looks exactly like a little girl named Alessa (also Ferland), and the town people, who eventually appear, are wanting to burn anyone that may be involved with her and trying to destroy the community, well, it's mainly Christabella (Star Trek: First Contact's Alice Krige) that wants that. Also starring Laurie Holden as Cybil Bennett, Deborah Kara Unger as Dahlia Gillespie, Kim Coates as Officer Thomas Gucci and Tanya Allen as Anna. Not all of the random moments scared me, in fact, until the cop showed up joining the main woman, I wasn't sure if it was in her mind or what, I would really need to see the game, but I'm sure even when I do, it's not going to change my opinion, that this film is pointless.

","I wrote a pretty favorable review of this under another name when I saw it in the theater. Having now watched it several times on TV, I felt it worth popping in here with a followup review. Believe it or not, I think SH plays better on TV, where its hypnotic pacing and wonderfully bizarre sets can be appreciated at one's leisure, especially, if one has a DVR. I agree with the poster who says SH is not a horror film but a nightmare piece. That is exactly what it is, and in that way, it works quite well. Rhada Mitchell is a convincingly distraught mother searching for her lost child, and she reminds me a good deal of Naomi Watts' similarly distraught character in the American remake of THE RING. No harm in that. The fiery climax with the devil worshipers or whatever the hell they are supposed to be is on the awesomely stupid side, and it is nothing we haven't seen before, except maybe for that barbed wire running itself up into Alice Krige's pooky and then ripping her apart. The devil kid is also pretty spooky. The very ending, with Mitchell and the daughter at home but in another dimension from the husband, is haunting in the truest sense of the word. A great ending to a pretty good, but not great, film."

","Viewers unfamiliar with the video game may find the events of Silent Hill a little baffling but watching it with the pre experience of playing the game sheds the film in a much more favourable light.I think Chirstophe Gans has structured a visually memorable piece that echoes the feeling of a bad nightmare.Radha Mitchell,in the lead role,is asked to do nothing more than run around and look the part but it is the visual aspect of the film that saves it credit.It has a very European feel,not a million miles from a Marilyn Manson rock video in truth but the look suits the subject matter.The film has its detractors and seems to have split opinion amongst fans of the game and general movie going folks alike.I say its a decent horror film with striking visuals a suitably eerie atmosphere. 7/10"

Im a very big fan of the Silent Hill video game Franchise and, at first, i was a little cautious about watching this but i have to say, after watching it for a second time, its much better than i expected. <br/><br/>First of all, you cant expect this to be the greatest movie of your life, because that will never be the case. Its not supposed to be a pretentious movie, its just a horror movie a great horror movie.<br/><br/>The atmosphere is very faithful to the game's, the plot is similar to the one of the first Silent Hill game released for the sony playstation and it really looks like the silent hill from the videogames. The acting is pretty good, considering the fact that it must pretty hard for the actors to see themselves under the such crazy circumstances, and i really liked the ending.<br/><br/>I think that, in the end, this turned out to be a movie that can please the video game fans and fans of horror movies in general. So if you like scary movies with heavy atmospheres, lock yourself inside your room, turn the lights off and enjoy this great film.<br/><br/>Just remember, you cannot compare this movie to other movies outside the genre. This movie fulfilled very well its purpose. Before you judge it, i suggest you think about other horror movies produced in these last 8 to 10 years. If you take this movie for what its supposed to be, and you re slightly open minded, you will see that this Hell/Resort town has much to offer."

Those that have played the game, and those that haven't - and those that 'got' the film, and those that didn't. For the record - I haven't played the game, and yes I 'got' the film.<br/><br/>This film has a very weak script - you can pick holes in it without too much trouble - but it is a 'horror' movie so thats not too surprising. Some of the CG is good, without doubt, but the characters are paper thin. They could have cut out the Husband without any loss to the plot. The female police officer is nice to watch, but ultimately pointless. The flash-back sequence really just goes to show how badly the rest of the film written.<br/><br/>The ending was good.<br/><br/>Silent Hill clearly has the Japanese influence of a 4 or 5 act structure, which partly explains why it's a full 2 hours long.

","For those who have played and/or seen Silent Hill, it should be obvious that the philosophy behind it explores the continuation of self-righteous witch burning in our society today. It remains the responsibility of each one of us to shut witch-hunters down, albeit peaceably so that we do not, in turn, become like them. In our own day, anyone who refuses to play the political game are the ""witches,"" and if we still lived in Puritan times, many people would be burned at the stake. Let us not forget the Red Scare of the 1950's. If people had not stood up against the witch-hunters of that era, the results would have been horrendous.

","I saw this movie a while ago, fortunately it was about 5 months after I started playing the SH series which helped my judgment. To be honest, the movie wasn't THAT bad. The beginning was quite sudden and the wrap up was a bit tacky, but it terms of being an interesting film, SH meets the requirements. The visuals, stunning, I have to admit that. Decaying walls, the monsters almost seem real, a complete dream for any SH gamer. Story wise, it tended to drag away from the actual game it was based on and strangely ending in its own made up way. Atmosphere was great though, simply horrifying and creepy. Overall I would of gave this a 6.5. Definitely not a movie for serious watchers, but more for a video game audience who's not expecting a complete tie between game and movie. But you have to be realistic, not many movies portray the game 100% anyway!"

","I guess this is the best video game adaptation I have seen. And not just that, it's a good, scary movie.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, the game was about atmosphere, combining settings and music to keep you guessing where the ""boooo"" was going to come from. And the movie delivers. Fog, ash, sounds, the changes between the two worlds are all faithful to the game, and , coupled with the monsters from the game ( Pyramid Head just rules), will make the Silent Hill fan very happy.<br/><br/>What about the rest of the movie-goers? I guess it should keep them entertained, because it doesn't require playing the games to understand the plot, it keeps you guessing and for the gore fan, we have that too. The movie, like the game, will suck you in, and scare you.<br/><br/>There are two things I'm not too sure about. One is the ending, which is a nice twist from the general happy-ending, but it really doesn't work for me. The child, Sharon, returns with her Mom, but also merges with Alessa, anguish, vengeance, trauma incarnate, and stays the same? The other one is the acting, which is above average on the whole, but Sean Bean deserved a greater part, Holden was pretty awful, and Radha Mitchell wasn't stellar. Jodelle Ferland and Alex Kirge were pretty good though.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot, good old fashioned stupidity in one scene: Laurie Holden's character is facing a few cultists, she has a gun on them, and then puts it down and fights them hand to hand. Who the hell does she think she is, Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan? On the whole, a good effort though. 8/10"

","Of all the video game to movie films that have come out this is the best. All the other ones were pure crap. This movie however captures the spirit of the game and throws in the dark drama the series contains. Staying true to the series the director does everything right using camera angles, the music from the games, and keeping the creatures and all else as true to the game as possible.<br/><br/>Purely dark, moody, dramatic, and disturbing. This movie stands above all other horror movies by not following clichÃ©s and by doing something different. Nowadays we have horror movies always about a group of backpackers (always teens) out on vacation the meet some weirdo murderers sex, violence, and lots of gore is what usually ensues. Not in this movie they keep tension, human drama, and yes it still contains gore, but it's not gory and violent for the sake of being exploitive it fits the story being told. All in all a great movie and shows that when a VG to movie is done right it can be something truly amazing.

If it had been 30 minutes shorter it would have helped. The production is excellent. As is the acting, sets, demon costumes and direction. However, there were 2 scenes that weren't good. You will know what they are when you see them. The first hour I was riveted and impressed! The 2nd hour I started to tire a bit-it became a bit repetitive. That's what I mean when I say it should have been shorter. Sometimes short & sweet is best. I can only give it a 7 based on the length and the 2 scenes that had me rolling my eyes.

"tonymurphylee","Null","0","1","19 June 2008"," Disturbing and grotesque, but beautiful and gripping
","Everything works except the story in the second half of the picture. I will say that for the first half, the storyline works great. There's a crazy back story involving the town folk being burnt alive and killed by an underground coal mine explosion. Ash rains from the sky, fog drapes the area, and all these deformed victims begin appearing. There's this one guy who crawls out of a rotten looking stall whose feet are tied to the back of his neck with barbed wire, dead children who implode into flames, and in particular, a giant of a man with an even bigger triangular shaped beak on the top of his head, The Pyramid Head, who carries around a gigantic knife and strips the entire flesh off of humans with one pull of his wrist. All that was all cool and interesting. But then about halfway through, they just dropped all of that and suddenly all the fun went away and the film became a horrific decent into cults and macabre rituals involving the burning of a little girl. The switch is so inappropriate and totally not at all what should have happened. The film is incredible looking, the sound editing and music are very haunting and clever, the acting is quite believable all around, and the film is really pretty creepy. There were a few parts that definitely scared me. However, the switch halfway through from ghost story to crazy cult fanatic story just mucks it all up a little. There's an interesting subplot involving the husband of the woman who gets lost that remains quite engaging and helps add more suspense. The last twenty minutes of the film are a real gore-fest. There is an incredible sequence in which people are torn apart and split open by flying barbed wire, including one woman being picked up and getting ripped open from the inside out by it. It's pretty creative, but unfortunately if you only saw the first twenty minutes and the last twenty minutes, they literally have almost no connection. The way the film ends is pretty chilling, but it also appears to be a little too reminiscent of David Lynch in some strange way as it revolves around parallel universes, alternate dimensions, and people getting stuck in a twisted variation of the space-time continuum. It all sat well with me, but what caused me to get quite disturbed by the film was a particular favorite character of mine got really brutalized and tortured before slowly being incinerated. That bothered me more than almost anything I've seen in years and it happens right at the end to just to add insult to injury. The film worked in that it got to me in such a deep way, but I still can't recommend it to everybody due to the sudden jump into weird supernatural demonic stuff. It's too weird. I love the video games, however, and I really dug the references and the camera angles. French director Christophe Gans must be congratulated for making a video game movie work so well. It's the best one I've seen so far. I think even people who've never played the video game would even enjoy it for what it is. It's a little gross, but I liked it. Hang tight though. It starts out quite slow and takes it's time before picking up speed about thirty minutes in."

However, the fact that it was not a horror film did not necessarily make it a good movie. About halfway through the movie, I came to the conclusion that the same theme had been repeating throughout the entire movie - she is in a town, it gets dark, things attack. Lather, rinse, repeat. As far as I could tell, there was no plot beyond ""Shadow creatures BAD."" So, when a plot finally did manifest itself, it seemed lame and tacked on. The flashback scene seemed especially pointless.

And there is no rational for why Sean Bean's character cannot see the world his wife has entered, nor is it clear what is going on at the end, when they 'go home.' If you are interested in a creepy movie playing with the mother devotion thing (with the added bonus of Sean Bean as father) watch the Dark instead (not as gory but significantly better as a movie)."

There are some very difficult scenes to watch, because they are awfully disturbing, and it's definitely not your common or garden slasher movie.<br/><br/>It's a weird movie actually - you do have to keep your brain in gear, which you don't often have to do for this kind of thing. The images are very cleverly thought out and (as I've never played the video game) there's no way of knowing what's going to happen next. The dream versus reality parts are very well done. The acting is on the whole good. Alice Krige is suitably creepy, Laurie Holden does a fab job (though the uniform is very non-standard issue!) Strangely the only one I didn't like is the lead as Rose. She did a good job it has to be said and did nothing wrong really, but there was just something that didn't quite work for me. <br/><br/>In the end it's really a morality tale about the evil of child abuse - and religious abuse for that matter. OK, it's gone to the nth degree, because it is fictional after all, but it's quite strange how the beginning of the film which seems to be a standard horror film turns into a different thing altogether.<br/><br/>So it's definitely a couple of hours well spent, won't please everyone, but does pack a punch beyond the CGI and horror effects. In fact, thinking about it, it would make a good film without any of the horror moments - just a woman looking for her missing child in a strange, unreal place and coming upon these weird religious nuts, who want to burn people they don't like or agree with.<br/><br/>And well done to the people who were the 'monsters'. It wouldn't have worked without those costumes and effects and they deserve the praise.<br/><br/>So enjoy it with an open mind."

And now they turned Silent Hill into a pretty steady psychological horror-flick that stays true to its virtual counterparts. The movie itself is a treat for the fan of the franchise - you'll recognize some sets and creatures from the games - and does have a solid storyline and visually stunning imagery. Some of the acting of the side-characters is a bit dull, but the main character Rose DaSilva ( Radha Mitchell ) and her wicked daughter ( Deborah Kara Unger ) do have enough charisma to keep you emotionally involved with the story. One thing: it all felt a bit artificial and over-the-top. They could've tuned down on the monsters and action sequences.

","i had purchased the DVD,and watched the movie,and watched all the extras they had on the DVD,and i must agree with the decisions they had made with the small changes ie..harry to rose...i especially enjoyed the transformation scenes when it turned to the alternate universe and the monsters were done quite well i must say.still cant agree with why they changed the story though...i still think the resurrection of a god vs revenge of a terrible past would have made the movie blow everyone away.all the actors did a very good job playing each character i especially liked Cybil's performance..she nailed it hard,and took it past the the limit.i voted the movie a 7 by accident i actually meant a 8/10<br/><br/>brownie points - good choice of actors - nailed the creepiness,in which the video game has done - sirens!(you cant forget this lol) - the transition over to the alternate state of silent hill - small changes were good choices - monsters had a nice touch,one of the key elements of the video game..weird looking monsters...<br/><br/>non- brownie points - don't see why they had to change the actual story(not counting changing of the main character) - would have wanted to see more darkness,i don't know how much it would have changed the actual movie,but trying to guide your way thru areas with just a flash light...oh god chicken skin(i think this would have made everyone shake with fear when the movie debut,surround sound..with those ambient noises...whistles..) vs running from something,i felt it should have had a combination of both<br/><br/>this movie was worth the money to go watch,and buy the DVD,it can be appreciated as a fan or non fan,if you can see past the whole direct translation from video game to movie,don't see why most people would hate this movie to be honest."

","30 years ago, a mysterious disaster has destroyed the once peaceful and glamorous town of Silent Hill. A young girl named Sharon has been sleep walking and babbling about the town of Silent Hill, her mother (Radha Mitchell) takes her there only to wake up from an accident. She looks for her daughter in the lonely and deserted ghost town of Silent Hill where evil spirits, raving villagers and strange creatures inhabit the place waiting to kill Sharon.<br/><br/>Spectacular and riveting supernatural horror shocker thriller that faithfully adapts the video game to the big screen in a very impressive way thanks to a screenplay by Pulp Fiction writer Roger Avery and French director Christopher Gans (director of ""Brotherhood of the Wolf""). The plot line maybe confusing for some viewers but this movie is a gruesome feast for the eyes with dark nightmarish atmosphere, sharp editing and creepy as hell creature designs, this is a movie in the tradition of H.P. Lovecraft, Stephen King, Clive Barker, Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci. The film co-stars LOTR's Sean Bean, this outstanding and disturbing shocker is one movie that does justice to the games right so i give kudos for Christopher Gans and Avery for bringing the game to life.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the sequel!!!"

","WARNING: MILD SPOILERS TO SCENES BELOW!!!!! I was motivated to see Silent Hill after reading a fan fiction on Fanfiction.net about a Naruto and Silent Hill crossover. (which was the best fanfic I've ever read, too!) But I asked my mother to rent it for me, so she finally did, and it instantly became one of my fave movies of all time! I was impressed when I found out that the monsters (besides the Creepers) were really people in costumes instead of CGI, and instantly became a fan of it's dark atmosphere and disturbing monsters, and equally disturbing story. But the ending was a definent cliffhanger, which made me beg for a sequel. I then got the Silent Hill 2 game and fell in love with it, too. (James is so kewl! lol!) But now that I'm a fan of the series, I hope and pray for a sequel with the same atmosphere but better graphics (the barbed wire climax scene near the end was a CGI giveaway, and the skinning scene was too, but overall it was great!) and even better monsters! I loved it and thought it had a very similar feel to the game and I give it an overall 4 out of 5 stars! (mostly because of the CGI parts that you could plainly tell were fake) but it was a great story, and great monsters with a disturbing and lonesome, vurnerable atmosphere! I loved it!"

","I absolutely loved Silent Hill 1, it was an amazing game; it was very well done and quite frankly it made Resident Evil look like crap.<br/><br/>I heard from a lot of people that Silent Hill was a horrible movie and I should waste my time, and I simply agreed and never bothered to see it, since I was greatly disappointed with Resident Evil and Doom's film adaptations.<br/><br/>But one night I was really bored so I headed to Blockbuster and rented this film with one of my free coupons, figuring what the heck? So I get home, pop it in and I am amazed for the first hour and a half, everything was well done and was almost better than the game. Then they started blithering about burning witches and went really in depth on the cult that was in Silent Hill, but even that didn't bother me(even though it was stupid and done really poorly). What ticked me off the most was the ending though.<br/><br/>The movie was built up for 2 HOURS and then you get to end and the scene in the church is cut way too short, plus the film isn't even resolved! They're still stuck in the fog of Silent Hill! They're out of the town and they're back home, but they're still haunted by the fog and no one can see them; NOTHING WAS RESOLVED, POSSIBLY THE BEST SCENE IN THE MOVIE WAS CUT SHORT, AND AN ENTIRE MOVIE WAS RUINED. It was a huge waste of time, I felt like I had just been offered a birthday gift but the giver decided he wanted it and took it away before I could open it; The first hour and a half of this film were done really well, and stayed really true to the game; Fans of the game will LOVE this movie(until the ending), while those that haven't played it probably won't know what the heck is going on ^_^ All in all, this film had great action scenes, the first hour was riveting, and the special effects were all done really well; I would not place it in a priority viewing category, but if you've got nothing better to do then you should definitely check it out."

With the use of rich sound and gorgeous yet bleak surroundings, Silent Hill establishes a rich and wonderful mood that will suck you in and keep you unnerved and riveted for your entire stay.

Get it? No? Then read this: http://faqs.ign.com/articles/618/618314p1.html Once you get through it you will understand why even considering to put Pyramid Head into a the plot that (not really) follows Silent Hill 1 is the most stupid thing someone can do. As such, it is a logical statement when I say that the director and all the people that support this movie, while previously having played the game, are retarded. I really don't know what on earth there is to do with Silent Hill 2 the movie when he already used Pyramid Head, so using him again would make him a whore, an unpaid one! Furthermore, the moron director took the music that Akira Yamaoka placed in the right spots and just randomly played it throughout the movie as if it just had to be done so that it looks more like the game. Well, it looks like everything BUT the game!!! The monsters are just monsters in the movie, so he really killed a load of philosophy, including the subjective reality and extreme reality parts. The main character is a woman??? Now that tops it, really!

","I normally don't care for horror movies because it's all gore just to show gore. I know everyone says this is ""unoriginal"" and that many elements come from other movies etc. but honestly, NOTHING is completely original anymore. What makes a good movie are myths and folklore from the past that could make a connection now. Look at things for storyline and special effects now, not for originality. Complete originality is impossible because everyone is influenced by something.<br/><br/>The story line was amazing. Maybe I only care for it because I can relate to rejection turning into hate and just blooming into something beautifully monstrous. Some gore was unnecessary, but it makes the point of the nightmare world. I never played the game, so Pyramid Head was silly to me, but I pretty much got sucked into the screen and felt like I was in Silent Hill battling for life.<br/><br/>If you put yourself into any character's position, you'd have to be heartless not to feel something.

","Seeing the poster and trailer when i went to Red Eye in 2005, I laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of Silent Hill, not knowing it was a remake of a game. Later that year when I really got into horror and watched everything in my reach, I stayed up until 3 am watching Silent Hill. Granted, it didn't keep me up, but then, nothing does.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Sharon, a disturbed little girl who has nightmares of a place called Silent Hill. For some odd reason (one of the film's only flaws) Rose, her mother, takes Sharon to the deserted town of Silent Hill, with only a couple hundred citizens, who we are introduced to later in the movie.<br/><br/>One thing that does not necessarily detract, but adds to the confusion of the movie, is that director Gans does not wait to throw gore and freaky little creatures at us, but does it 10-20 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>This movie interested me so much. It made me scared for one reason, and the second that got old, it switched to a completely different theme for that scene and scared me in that way. Although there was not too much character introduction, I was concerned for the characters.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this was a great gory funfest, with only one major letdown. The first hour and a half had great gore, realistic and intense violence, and decent acting. However, the last ten minutes disappointed me, for some reason. I just wasn't as intrigued. Still, every true horror fan should check this out."

","I don't know anything about the video game and whether or not the movie follows the game. What I do know is this movie was terrible and the story didn't make sense.<br/><br/>A woman, Rose, takes her ""weird"" adopted daughter to Silent Hill, the name of the town the girl repeats while sleep walking. Some how the 2 along with a cop end up in some kind of alternate universe or maybe it was hell or somewhere in between. I don't know. It was never made clear. The husband goes to look for them and is in the same place the wife is but is in normal time. He can feel her presence but can't see her.<br/><br/>The woman must battle the darkness and eventually a group of witch burners. The whole part about witches made little sense. What I think is maybe the woman and daughter are dead and are in a parallel universe before you get to hell. The witch burners are in hell paying for their sins. There is a girl Alessa who was killed by them and is out for revenge. She some how creates the darkness which is made of gross, evil creatures out to destroy. But I really have no idea if I'm right because it was not explained in the movie.<br/><br/>The ending is weird. It's why I think the wife and daughter must be dead.

","I have never been a gaming person, and I have never been much in contact with any of these resent years' computer-game-movie-spin-offs. And to be honest, I have not liked any of these movies that I saw.<br/><br/>Anyway, this was something else. I've been a fan of Christopher Gans, since I saw 'The Brotherhood of Wolves' (was that it's name?), and was somewhat disappointed when I found out he was to direct 'Silent Hill' - a movie based on a game - but I was wrong. He pulls it off! Ofcaurse, I have little, or no, idea of what the game is about, but I could still enjoy this quasi-modern horror. One of the best things about it, in fact, was that it, unlike 'Resident Evil', for example, was not built around these clichés that the genre has been stuck with: murderers flying out of the closet, the gool appearing in the reflection of a mirror and so on. 'Silent Hill', instead delivers a more, maybe just vaguely, but anyway, psychological thriller, more than a classic horror flick.<br/><br/>The story is chillingly creepy, the environments and moods are very striking, the ghost like town is brilliant, the monsters are very well made, in an old school kind of way, and - thank god - there really was not that much blood and gore. It's pretty tasteful, in many ways, something that I feel, also is one of the problems with the movie. It attempts to reach for something deeper than it could possibly get, and the very end really is a bit too hip (or un-hip, depending on who you ask) for a game-spin off. Or for any movie. It's an unfortunately bad ending that takes the twist one turn too far.<br/><br/>Maybe I just didn't get it. It doesn't really matter, since I really liked the movie anyway."
"schwarzes_lager","10","0","1","21 February 2007"," An excellent ride for the eyes and the mind.
","Silent Hill is a brilliant movie which weaves a tapestry for the imagination, with disturbing images and a vicious plot line. It takes you on the incredible journey of one little girl's nightmare turned one family's conjoined nightmare. It has a disgusting realism which sends chills down your spines, and yet it has a big enough streak of Hollywood glamour and unrealistic horror to keep one interested. It is an incredible story with a deep moral and a tragic beginning and end. It makes you realize the evil in the world, but also that there still is hope. It reveals the treachery of human nature in every sense possible and distinguishable, as well as reveals the determination and will of some characters to help and change the world for the better. It makes evident the judgemental character of some people, as well as how afraid some people are of things that are unfamiliar to them, and things that they cannot yet control. It introduces a sickening look into the paranoia and hysteria of some groups today, and the harmful effects that it can have on society as a whole. The ending is unexpected and leaves on guessing, and I'm hoping (and I know I'm not alone) that the sequel has nothing to do with the ending of the first movie, simply because that is how the games are played."

","From the very beginning, Silent Hill looked like one of those movies that was planned for an extremely long time, but could never really get off its feet. Suddenly, however, in 2005, the production started moving along at a steady pace.<br/><br/>The film was definitely worth the wait, as it seemed to play out just like the games. The special effects were amazing, and the town had the same look and overall feel of the games. The plot was excellent, but the explanation of events in the conclusion was slightly confusing. The actors and actresses (mainly actresses) did a great job, and the monsters looked like they were ripped right out of the game. One of the only complaints I have is that some parts of the movie really dragged, and the suspense was not built up as well as it could have been. Overall, the best video game adaption so far, right up there next to Resident Evil."

Some of the characters (for example the man with the triangle on his head) kept appearing over and over again without an explanation of who they were. The acting was atrocious.

I doubt Roger Avary foresaw so many crane shots when he wrote the script - ""crane goes up, crane goes down, crane goes sideways, crane does the shimmy shimmy shake...""

"stuffkikker","Null","0","1","12 January 2007"," nice suspense horror
","There's really not much to say about this movie, other than that is a nice thriller/horror. Looks are great; awesome sceneries, good cgi (which is seldom the case, esp. in horror movies), and mostly good acting.<br/><br/>Mostly, because as is often the case; a lot of the extras performing (the villagers, the monsters) were kind of detrimental to the credibility of the atmosphere, especially in the final scenes where the villagers are mindlessly shouting their lines (with body-language typical to amateur actors), without actually being part of the scene that is going on. So ignore those extras.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of this movie is Jodelle Ferland though, playing the daughter. Why she has performed in so many TV-shows is beyond me, because this girl can't act (edit: though I saw her in Tideland yesterday and thought she performed great in there.. so I'm at a loss here). Which is unfortunate because her appearances in the movie are usually during critical scenes, and her poor performance gives these scenes an undeserved amateur/C-movie quality.<br/><br/>Second to that is the song that kicks in the final credits. While the movie itself has a superb score, the songs during the final credits have the cunning ability of completely ruining the impression the movie itself leaves you with. A shame really.<br/><br/>But these flaws aside, the movie remains a perfectly well written, well performed and well executed suspense horror flick. Recommended to anyone in the mood for a bit of darkness and creepiness."

Much of the dialog is sloppy or hackneyed, and the first several plot points are so contrived it's almost embarrassing -- a lot like a very bad sit-com. Further in, it's clear the goal is to seem otherworldly & artsy, but that failed, and I had the recurrent urge to fast-forward. Now I wish I'd given in to it.<br/><br/>The child actor's long lecture about 3/4 of the way through is clumsy, ponderous, borderline laughable, and even recited poorly. Virtually all of the interior or underground shots are needlessly under-lit, and most of the special effects are cheap and pointless, even if a few might have merit for being startling in their grotesqueness."

"skluczkiewicz","7","0","1","20 November 2006"," I little slow, uncertain end, but overall entertaining
","Just got this in from Netflix and got to watch it with my wife. We are both horror/supernatural fans and this was right up our alley.<br/><br/>I don't get into retelling the plot of the story as you can read that anywhere. To me it's more important to get across what I got out of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Silent Hill was an intriguing and entertaining movie. As many reviewers have stated, the visuals are astounding. The atmosphere of the movie really lends to a somber, creepy and eerie feel when following the characters of Rose and the cop- Cybil.<br/><br/>In all honesty I wasn't too interested in the scenes involving the character of the father (Sean Bean). They helped add the back story but it almost seemed they could have been avoided.<br/><br/>The main things I enjoyed in Silent Hill were the atmosphere and the creatures. The director did an excellent job of creating that eerie atmosphere needed for a movie of this style. Also the creatures were very unique and came across as something out of a nightmare. Another thing is there were no cheap scares. It wasn't like a creature popped out from around a corner after two minutes of suspense music. When a creature was coming you saw it coming. It was the way it moved and the way it looked that made it creepy and unnerving, not a cheap shock to make you jump.<br/><br/>I've read some reviews where people knocked this movie for reasons that seemed very personal. I'm not going to attack those people but I've learned you really have to go into a movie with a completely (and I really mean completely) open mind. Yes this movie is based on a video game (which I've never played) but that doesn't mean it is the video game. Also it is in the horror/supernatural genre so if that's not your thing, then obviously this movie won't be either. In any case you have to let your mind go and let the movie tell the story, not your memories of the game or preconceptions of anything else. Being a horror fan, I love Stephen King books. I've seen enough movies based on Stephen King books to realize that the movie is not the book. The movies are either a screenwriter's interpretation or retelling of the story in the book. In some cases the screenwriter even goes on a tangent and loosely bases the script on the story. That's what I get from this movie. It is not Silent Hill the game, it is Silent Hill the movie. (I guess it should have had a disclaimer of ""Based on the video game of the same name."")<br/><br/>OK, enough analyzing the reviewers that didn't like this movie. I myself did find flaws but nothing to the degree most people hate this movie for. There is some bad acting but nothing that bad that you can't over look. (Being a horror movie fan I've seen some very badly acted movies and this isn't one of them.) Another sore spot is the movie does have some slow spots where you are waiting for things to pick up. I hate pointing this out as all movies need to slow down so the viewer is given some explanation for what is going on but sometimes this happens in an awkward spot or when the viewer would like some more action/suspense/whatever to happen. I felt some slow spots in Silent Hill occurred in this manner. Also, the ending was a little bit uncertain. I don't want to go into details but my wife and I had two conclusions about the ending and weren't really sure which one was the correct one or if there is actually a different conclusion. This is probably the most troubling of all the problems with the movie as when a movie ends badly, that's the last thing you remember and so even if the rest of the movie is good you feel like you just saw a bad movie.<br/><br/>In all I give Silent Hill a rating of 7 out of 10. I'd probably go with 6.5 if IMDb did halves but I liked it too much to give it a 6."
"antarcticapres","8","0","1","8 November 2006"," Wonderful and Disturbing
","I saw this movie and was then interested in playing the games. The movie was very dark, with graphic imagery, and with a wonderfully complete plot. Each character had an identity, thanks in no small part to the director and actors, and the monsters were surreal enough to be shocking, but not as fake as, say, Star Wars episodes I, II, II. The most fascinating part of the movie, however, was the comparison between the characters' views of the world around them and what was actually happening; it drew heavily from the movie, ""Jacob's Ladder,"" as did the games. It was also very psychologically draining, and contained an interesting indictment of dogmatic religion, which is always appropriate.

","I'm avid fan of the games. I've played them all, and beat them. And though the first game is awesome, because it's the first chapter, the fourth is better. Silent Hill 4: The Room.<br/><br/>I also noticed, that by watching this movie, they changed a lot of things around. Where as in the movie it's the mother trying to find Sharon, in the game, you play Christopher, who is trying to find both Sharon and his wife. They also used a song from the 3rd game, which is the song that Rose is listening to on the way to Silent Hill ""A letter to my future self"", is on the disk for the 3rd game.<br/><br/>Either way, they did a Brilliant job in casting people, and with sticking true to the majority of the games.

Did the film break any new ground in the horror genre? I don't think so, it's not original, I've seen the basic premise countless times. The ending was a let down, as was the trip to see the ""dark one"", or whatever. Pretty looking film, great sets and visuals, but just gross, and not worth the time.

There is not much gore or violence which lowered my rating but there are many creepy elements and all the scenes of gore are fantastic. Three of the goriest things I've ever seen come from this movie. The ending is a bit weird but i didn't care, the scares, gore and violence saved it.

","Silent Hill is a horror fan's wet dream. Full of sick and twisted imagery, monstrous creatures straight out of nightmares, and enough whacked out violence to sedate even the most die hard fan, the film delivers on almost every level. First off, I have to admit that I never played the game(s). They just didn't interest me because I thought they were more Resident Evil and i was never particularly stuck on that series. Having seen the film now, I would definitely be willing to play them if not to find out who and what pyramid head is. The actors all perform strongly given the sometimes slight characterizations they are left to deal with. In fact, this is my only true problem with the film. After dealing up a wicked backstory and great visuals, writer Roger Avary left the audience with weak characters and the director and actors are left to fill in the blanks which they do admirably. Particularly strong is Jodelle Ferland as yet another creepy kid (check her out in Kingdom Hospital for another turn). I also really dug Laurie Holden as tough cop Cybill. Worth a look. Check this one out."

A superb combination of CGI and old school FX, as well as a cast of good but lesser known actors and actresses and a great script make this one one for the books. This film also stays true to the games better than any I've ever seen, and the town itself is the spitting image of the place we all know and love.

","Although the fact that this was inspired by a Japanese video game did not sound promising at first, I was sufficiently impressed by the constantly arresting visuals that, in the end, it is a shame that the storyline is so hopelessly muddled and, consequently, all that care and effort was for naught.<br/><br/>The story of a mother and her precocious adopted child going back to a ghost town to seek out the roots of their nightmares only to be met by a nightmare of far greater proportions had potential but these are only partially realized by the film-makers: following on from the artistic and commercial success of BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF (2001), director Christophe Gans is let down by an overly ambitious script by Roger Avary, the co-writer of PULP FICTION (1994) which mixes in childhood fantasies, witch-hunting, nightmarish slithering creatures, the emargination of an individual by a bigoted society, identity doubles, the loss of a child and an examination of the disintegration of the family unit. With all of this going on, it is remarkable that a couple of performances - by Radha Mitchell (as the distraught mother) and Laurie Holden (as a police officer on her tracks who gets more than she bargained for) - shine through; Alice Krige, as the community leader, is quite hammy in comparison and the nominal male lead Sean Bean (as Mitchell's husband) barely registers at all - although this can be explained by the fact that his character was hastily added into the script to appease concerned backers who complained of the lack of men in the story! <br/><br/>As a matter of fact, the original script was around three-and-a-half hours in length and, although this was not filmed in its entirety, some additional material - even as an extra feature on the DVD - might have helped to make this more coherent.

There is definitely something about creepy kids in horror movies and this has really good creepy kid. It is really gory if you are squeamish, you would probably want to pass on this one.

"jacob-241","9","0","1","22 October 2006"," Silent Hill- My Review (By Jacob Saphra)
","Silent Hill is a movie based collectively on the first three 'Silent Hill' video-games- arguably some of the most chilling, yet also most psychologically challenging video-games made to date. The main idea of the movie is that Sharon, the young adopted daughter of Rose Da Silva, continually sleepwalks, often leaving the house and putting herself in dangerous situations (we are introduced to these situations straight off at the start of the movie). In her dreams, he continually screams out 'Silent Hill'. In a final act of desperation after all therapy and help has failed her daughter, Rose discovers Silent Hill is a once inhabited, now 'Ghost- town'. She decided to take Sharon there. She is then involved in a chase with a policewoman (Cybil- who later plays a big part accompanying Rose throughout a lot of the movie) who is suspicious of her. She appears to lose the cop but crashes the car. When she wakes up, she is at the entrance to Silent Hill and Rose is gone. She and Cybil go into the town to try and find her daughter- it appears ash is falling from the sky upon arrival, and neither can escape the town due to a huge earthquake styled rift between the town and the road out. In the movie her husband Christopher goes to the town trying to find her but is unsuccessful. We find out more and more about the town as the movie goes on. It turns out the town had a tragic past and was burnt down many years ago and is now still inhabited by some, but also an evil force which appears every so often in the form of many strange monsters, introduced by a siren, followed by darkness. The movie goes on to reveal more, including Sharon's connection with the town, which is that her real mother Alessa was burnt almost to death by the religious fanatics of the town many years ago and now curses the town. The town also turns out to still be inhabited by the religious fanatics that burnt her, who are kept alive only by hiding in the church, which Alessa/the evil spirits cannot enter. We find out that truly, it is these fanatics that are the real evil people and eventually Rose makes a bargain with the demon that is Alessa that if Rose gets Alessa's evil spirit into the church to kill the fanatics, Rose can have her daughter back. This happens and Rose wakes up again in the car with Sharon safely beside her, although Cybil is burnt by the townspeople before they are killed by Alessa moments before this. We are left wondering if this was a dream or not- but it is not, as when the two arrive home they are still in the strange, dreamy state they were in after Rose woke up at the start of the movie and Christopher cannot see them, though he can strangely feel their presence.<br/><br/>The movie uses a fantastic mise en scene, with an incredibly realistic 'Ghost town' setting, using hundreds of creepy, old and abandoned buildings (particularly such as the school house). The still 'living' characters in the town are shown realistically in raggedy, torn up clothing whilst the monsters are shown through incredible CGI, each kind of monster seemingly representing a type of person that used to live in the town- for example, some monsters appear to be young babies, whilst others appear to be nurses. The way the lighting changes in the movie whenever the siren goes off and the evil darkness falls upon the town is also very well done, suggesting elements of the unknown and a world beyond our reality.<br/><br/>The movie is also successfully based on the video game- shown particularly by some very effective third person camera shots (which are used in the game to show the character you are) suggesting the character is being 'watched' possibly, and also highlighting the incredibly effective mise en scene, as I mentioned about in the paragraph above. We also do not have much use of a hand-held camera, which is often used to display the nervousness of the characters in many horror movies. The movie also incorporates various features from all of the games, rather than just focusing on one of them- for example, use of the creepy and strange electronic music, rather than any man-made songs. We have various monsters, scenes, themes and ideas put across from various movies. For example, the siren used in the first two games to show the darkness falling, which inspires the sheer feeling of hopelessness and the loss of human consciousness that any game-player will have experienced.<br/><br/>I think this is almost a revolutionary film as such, because so little typical horror iconography and conventions are used. The strange, game like atmosphere used shows it as something that is much more than a regular horror film, and also points to obvious pragmatics, such as how devotion to faith can push people over and edge and into horrible situations (i.e religious faith pushed the towns people into burning a small, innocent child) and to how we live in a world, largely based on forgetting the horrible past many have suffered through. If there is one convention used, one can point to the 'Final Girl' theory, as our original, seemingly weak female characters, Rose and Sharon survive, whilst Christopher appears powerless to help them throughout the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Silent Hill is a scary, realistic, gripping and emotional movie with many social and political themes, ideas and metaphors arguably attached to various elements of it. All of these cannot be typed up in a mere review, so I suggest anyone who or has, or has not seen the movie to watch it and to look deeply into every aspect to uncover it's mysteries, much like one must do in order to complete the game."

","Video Game to Movie Crossovers strikes fear in the hearts of many (Mortal Kombat Annihilation, Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead), but as a fan of Silent Hill, I certainly was impressed with this movie. I've played all of the Silent Hill games, and I can tell you that this movie successfully captures the nightmarish world of Silent Hill down to pin-point accuracy.<br/><br/>The storyline of this movie did not relate exactly to Silent Hill 1, but that is completely understandable. You can tell that the Director tried really hard to stay true to the series, and he accomplished that, as well as appealing to the mainstream audience. They did a decent job with building up the eerie feeling you get while watching (just like how the game was). I personally feel that Sean Bean's character was only needed in the first few minutes of the movie, but other than that, he had no purpose in the story. Radha Mitchell, however, was a great replacement, since Harry Mason wouldn't be as effective.<br/><br/>I definitely loved how they used the music from the series on this film as well, definitely captures how creepy Silent Hill truly is.<br/><br/>I'll definitely be looking forward to a sequel, and if you've played Silent Hill, you'll definitely get a kick out of this movie!"

"nmyres-1","8","0","1","19 October 2006"," Silent Hill: When They Get It Right
","Silent Hill, based on one of the many Konami franchises is a video game movie finally done right. Although Resident Evil was quite entertaining and gory, Silent Hill retained a grittiness, paralleling more closely the realities presented in the game itself. I suppose that the halls of the mansion in Resident Evil is what made the game so much fun and is exactly what the movie was missing. It would of been even more fun to relive it again in the movie, had they created a set that was accurate to the blueprint of the game. Silent Hill on the other hand conveyed to the viewer, the same feelings and emotions that the video game produced in the gamer. Not knowing what was down the way; not able to see, guided by only a flicker of light and trying to survive. Of course, it is natural when adapting a game to film to omit certain parts of the game that would make no sense to the average non-gamer. The pterodactyls, for example. Enough said. It is a story of a mother seeking the origins and meaning of her adopted daughter's death-defying, night screams. In an attempt to cure her daughter of her mental illness, and against the wishes of her husband, she takes her daughter to the town she wakes up screaming to every night: Silent Hill an abandoned ghost town that fell victim to an infamous fire. She looses her daughter in the process, amidst a car accident in a high speed chase with a well-minded female deputy, and is swallowed by the beast itself. It is a dangerous goose chase this search for her daughter, as she braves deformed and merciless monsters. Fallowing clues to find her little girl, each clue bringing her closer to danger's harm. And yet, each clue brings her closer to revealing the secret of the purgatory that has engulfed Silent Hill and the Puritan cult that feeds it's evil hunger. If you can appreciate a good scary movie or if you love video games, Silent Hill is required viewing. Another enjoying video game-movie to watch is Doom. Movies to avoid: Dungens & Dragons and Blood Rain. I wonder when they will make Grand Theft Auto The Movie?..."

There are a couple of scenes where I was shocked because of how disturbing they were and how it can be a 15! Near the end of the film it tends to get a bit complex and the effects go out of control but its still not OTT.

Instead of making sure that the movie is filled with similar images from the video game, why don't you actually come up with a plot? This movie lost me in the first ten minutes when a cop pulls over the main character. Once the cop is off her motorcycle and walking towards the car, the main character then speeds away...FOR NO REASON! They needed her to be speeding so she could get into an accident, but you're telling me they couldn't come up with something better? After that, it was all downhill.

You might was well wrap yourself in Christmas lights and drag a portable generator along! Can't writers find another way to have the hero investigate the surroundings to move story along? OK that was only part of the problem. What the HELL was the story? A girl gets burned, dies, then the grim reaper visits and grants her a wish? The wish is to punish the ""DEAD"" people that killed her? So why did the nurse get hurt? If she was in the dream didn't she have to be dead too? Still she looked good after 30 years.<br/><br/>And the ending. The heroin and the child make it back home. But they aren't really there?!?!? They're dead! I hope the grim reaper has a several black marks on her/his/it's next performance review.<br/><br/>First it grants a wish, which is a mistake because it goes on for 30 years. Then it sucks in these innocent people to help correct the mistake, which kills them. Then the grim reaper lets them leave to roam around!

","I must say that this is probably the best video game to movie ever made. It has simply got all the things that a movie like Resident Evil missed out on.<br/><br/>A lot of the resources in the mood of the game Resident Evil, Paul Anderson never used in Resident Evil The Movie, witch made a lot of us fans mad and disappointed.<br/><br/>But that is not how it is in this movie. First of all it is true to the video game series, for instance the mood in the movie is exactly like the game created by the cinematic, camera angles and music (written by Akira Yamaoka). It has got several of the enemies and bosses from the games (witch I won't reveal here) And also the characters in the movie are from the game. Yet they are put in a context you haven't seen before. So even though you have played the game, you won't be be able to know what is going to happen in the movie.<br/><br/>I will say that this movie will seem a lot better if you have played the games, then you will be able to understand and catch the small things and hints that relates to the games, but People who haven't played the games will be very entertained and simply experience a universe and a type of movie they have never seen before.<br/><br/>I say: ""Enjoy your stay in Silent Hill""<br/><br/>9,5 of 10"

","Silent Hill is a fantasy horror movie, with emphasis on both words. If you like horror movies, you'll love this one. If you liked Hellraiser, you're probably gonna enjoy it even more. <br/><br/>The comparison to Hellraiser shouldn't imply that Silent Hill is some kind of remake, but there are a lot of similarities regarding locations and characters. Nevertheless, Silent Hill is a genuine and uniquely cruel horror movie. The story telling makes some unexpected changes in style along the plot which is quite refreshing. The dark passages soak you into the screen and keep you staring. Also, the movie makers had a sense for details, even humorous ones (and I've never played the game). <br/><br/>I really had a lot of fun watching this one.<br/><br/>PS: OK, the comparison to Hellraiser does not hold because Silent Hill is not as suited for a sequel as Hellraiser."

","Well, I'm a HUGE Silent Hill video game fan. that stuff is the darkest, creepiest, nuff-said. The movie I have been looking forward to forever. Unfortunately, I couldn't see it until it came out on DVD. Well......here goes...<br/><br/>If you're a big fan of the game, you may not like the movie as they scrambled up the story, trying to Hollywoodize it (what's new?), not that that's that big of a deal, just playwrite geeks should stick with what's there, instead of trying to make it theirs. The thing that annoyed the hell out of me is WHERE WAS ALL THE STINKING MONSTERS?!?!?!? I mean, come on, that game is full of the creepy-crawliest nightmares you ever saw, and all the movie was was, ""blah blah blah, story, blah blah blah, trying to pull you into the character's lives"". Now, this is based on a game where you bash in everything's heads with steel pipes, running from demons in a hell on earth setting, until you get a weapon good enough to fight really big monsters. Okay, so why was that left out? I'll tell you...Hollywood geeks.<br/><br/>Here's the spoiler: The guy with the head like a train cowcatcher was one of the coolest villains in the game, and they had enough sense to put him in the movie......but, not enough sense to give him any time. he was just stuck in enough to keep you from getting more interested in your popcorn. Dorks. Finally, they had the zombie nurses and what? Only about 20 seconds?!?!?! Okay, enough whinning. I did like the movie, don't get me wrong. It has some good special effects, and maybe even filled in some of the story line lost in all the action of the game....but who cares? Overall, I rate it worth watching, but somebody really needs to whip some Hollywood geek (censored) so they stop ruining stories. If we want a tender, heart-ripping, love/drama, we'll watch On Golden Pond or some such crap, am I right guys?"

"vincent-100","9","0","1","26 September 2006"," Enjoy the nightmare if you dare
","People who play the game after seeing this movie will often exclaim, ""Oh! That's just like in the movie!"" But the game came first, and I hope that is a fact not forgotten in years to come. Because it is quite remarkable how much attention was paid to the detail in this translation of game-to-movie, and it is the best I've seen with no doubt about it. Being a big fan of the games (4 to date), I was delighted by the camera angles, sounds, colours and textures. It captured the mood of Silent Hill perfectly.<br/><br/>What about the story? The thing about Silent Hill is that not everything makes sense. That is certainly true for the games, and it's true for the movie. Even in this sense the movie is true to the game, and that's a plus in my book. The story of Silent Hill is always the same: someone got in accidentally, and just wants to get out. And as the viewer (or player of the game) that's all you hope for. It is not an adventure that you enjoy; it is a nightmare you want to escape from. And when it's over, you will remember it with respect but it will not necessarily be something you want to repeat.<br/><br/>It was well-cast. It didn't require big names, and I think Cameron Dias would have been wrong anyway. Apparently the director wanted her for the character of Rose. Sean Bean and Debra Unger add all the star quality that was needed. The child was sufficiently freaky, but she could have been better. Rose and the cop were hot, like they should have been.<br/><br/>As far as the similarity to the game goes, the story was altered while retaining some of the essential characters. If you've played the games, don't think you know how the movie will end. Our favourite monsters appear, including Pyramid Head and the freaky naked babies. Rose's phone crackles and hisses when danger is near. Top-down camera angles of Rose negotiating her way through an alleyway, with rusty fences on either side, add to the claustrophobia of the town. There is mist that restricts your view. A map of a building even appears, perfectly replicated from the game. If only Rose found it sooner, so she could have marked her progress with red crosses and squiggles on locked doors. She also has the essential flashlight. It's just obvious from the very beginning that the director has played the games, and it was a treat to watch it brought to life. A few things that were absent and are missed are the zombie dogs and the crowbar or plank with a nail stuck in it that Rose should have found lying on the road. She could have used this to beat a few dogs! Part of the fun of Silent Hill is having an idea of the monsters waiting for you, and having only a plank to fight them with! In one respect that movie differs substantially from the games, and that is the violence. In the games the violence has already happened, and the town looks like the aftermath of something awful. The movie, however, contains a few very graphic scenes - things I have never seen before and which really disturbed me. I was left shocked and unsettled, as most of this action takes place in the last 15 minutes which also includes a bit of an explanation of the story. So by the time the movie ends, your senses have been assaulted and there is much to take in and think about.<br/><br/>Playing the games before watching the movie won't help a great deal with your understanding of the plot. But it will certainly introduce you to how the Silent Hill world works. It requires you to think on a certain wavelength that differs from the normal way the world works. I have no idea how someone without this experience will find the movie, but fans of the game will love it. It is true to the mood and theme of the games, is thoroughly entertaining, and is beautifully shot. The revenge scene is deliciously satisfying, and the ending is frustratingly perfect."

","I'm the kind of person who watches movies with an opened mind. But I cannot agree with gore for the love of gore, or killing main characters for fun in original ways, like burning them alive. The setting is pretty interesting at first and the backgrounds, filled with falling ash look great, but that's where the good things stop.<br/><br/>You start seeing things go wrong with this movie right from the beginning. One of those things is that it's highly predictable - you kinda' know the trip to Silent Hill is a one-way ticket to hell, you realize the cop is there for a reason. And the zombie-fighting is useless really, the main characters can't be touched by anonymous zombies, only by ""level bosses"". However predictable, the story manages to bring some interesting twists by the end of the movie, but too little, too late. It's still a ""zombie roller-coaster ride""."

I am sure this is what everyone else who has played the games thought when they saw the trailer. I don't know about anyone else, but it definitely did not disappoint me. The acting was right on, the visuals were stunning, and the soundtrack, which was taken right from the game, was as entrancing as the game was. If you played the game its a must see.<br/><br/>For everyone that hasn't played the game and are curious about this movie: This movie is based off of one of the first horror thriller games to come out called Silent Hill. It is about this town where really bad stuff happened earlier in history, and the town was tainted so to speak. I'm not going into detail because I don't want to ruin anything for you. In that knowledge it might be easier to grasp. I know for a fact that if you haven't played the games, the movie can be kind of out there. It is still a good quality horror flick, that can raise the hairs on the back of your neck. If you don't like out there horror movies and are really about the more realistic stuff, then this isn't for you.

I loved the use of real people instead of CGI animation.<br/><br/>The Acid shooter thing - unsure of it's real name but it was done so well. The way it walked was gruesome enough and the way the acid dripped down it's body was amazing.<br/><br/>Pyramidhead - brilliant...possibly could have done with some underwear, but hey, i'm not complaining. I loved the way he was put on stilts and his body was made 25% larger than everyone else's. I would have liked to have seen him kill someone with his sword but killing Anna managed to display his shere size and strength, which was amazing.<br/><br/>The Nurses - were perfect. I loved their costumes, they way they walked, and the way they interacted with one another.

"howardsanders-1","10","0","1","24 September 2006"," Disturbing, but strangely beautiful
","I know calling a film such as Silent Hill beautiful may seem a little odd, but the care taken over the 'feel' of this movie warrants the description.<br/><br/>From the very start it has the grainy reality of a classic Victorian ghost story, something both refreshing and effective. Peppered throughout are enough recognizable camera angles and long-shot views to satisfy the franchise's many gaming fans, but a few twists to the plot also provide the story with a fresh edge. High production values, great performances and obvious attention to detail make this one of the best game-to-movie transfers I have yet seen.<br/><br/>Thankfully CGI effects are limited mostly to the surrounding environment, leaving the nightmarish characters to be based on real substances and textures, the results of which sometimes defied belief. This 'old-style' approach to creature effects adds a powerful reality to the Silent Hill 'world'. So much so, that I couldn't shake an icy cold finger crawling up and down my spine for at least a couple of days. Try saying that about the last horror flick you saw.<br/><br/>If you like this kind of thing, watch it with the lights out and the curtains drawn. You'll be in for a treat."
"r_whiting","6","0","1","23 September 2006"," Such a Long, Looooonng film....
","I've got to admit that I've been really looking forward to seeing this film for some time. I'm a big fan of the video game series and it's one of the few video game to movie conversions that realistically stood a chance of being good, no mention of Uwe Boll amongst these credits ;) After watching the film, and trust me, it's a long film. Both literally and mentally, I was left feeling indifferent. Which is probably a good way to sum up the film. For fans of the video game they can rest easy at least because it is a faithful adaption and very respectful of the game and its cult status.<br/><br/>What made the game such a hit was the feeling of claustrophobia and the creepy story. When you're playing a game in the first person, that tension and dark setting keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes you want to keep following the story. When that converts to film and you're watching in the third person. You need to empathize with the characters, they need to be 'rich' and have a good back story. There were several points in this movie where I simply didn't care what happened to the characters.<br/><br/>The best analogy I can give is that it was a beautiful artistic creation of the game with all the story and excitement sucked out of it. If you were ever a fan of the game it's still worth a look, just to go 'oooh I remember that bit', or 'wow! That's exactly like the game'. For someone who's a neutral, I'll think there will be chunks of this film where you're left confused and disenchanted. It's a shame because you can see all the effort and reverence that went into it..."
"DonFishies","4","0","1","22 September 2006"," A great atmosphere, but not really much else of anything else
","Now, before I continue on, I am just going to put this right out there right away: I never really played the Silent Hill video games. As a result, I watched the movie purely from a film standpoint, and not as a comparison to the video game.<br/><br/>And in that respect, I found the movie to be fairly terrible, if only rescued by a few things that could only have been made possible by the game.<br/><br/>Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland) is having nightmares, all of which consistently mention a place called ""Silent Hill"". Her mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell), is getting increasingly frustrated, and one night decides to drive to the mythical place in an attempt to see if anything could be done to fix these nightmares. After an unfortunate run-in with a cop, Rose finds herself almost in an accident. She awakens in the town to find Sharon missing, and sets out to find her. While this is all going on, Rose's husband Christopher (Sean Bean), is out to try and find his wife and daughter, and uncover the secrets of the town on his way.<br/><br/>Thinking about this plot from a gaming perspective (even though the original game's lead protagonist was male), it works magnificently. The story, the set-up, the events, and more all work out in perfect unison. Hell, the camera angles are set-up specifically to look like they did in the game. Thinking of the film like that, as a grander version of a video game, may lead people into actually thinking this movie is good.<br/><br/>But it is not.<br/><br/>What works in a game, does not in a movie. Everything just kind of feels thrown together, with little to no explanation. Things just seem to happen. We learn more of a ""history"" of the town, and why it and its townspeople are in such rough shape, but because the game's characters and stories are not really fleshed out beyond the one-dimensional point, neither are the film's. Are we supposed to feel pity for these people, or are we just supposed to laugh at them? Are we horrified when the ""evil"" shows up after a loud bell sounds, or do we just stare and wish that we were actually being scared? None of it really seems to want to work, and none of the actors or filmmakers seem to give a damn in trying to make it. Making the film have the same spirit and feel as the game is one thing, but not making the movie actually work in movie terms, is another.<br/><br/>Like I said, all the characters are one-dimensional, and none of them really seem to stand out at all. Absolutely no one puts in a captivating performance, they just kind of look crossed between zombified and stupefied. How are we as an audience, supposed to make anything of the film when we get actors being stiffer than a piece of wood? The film is terribly boring as a result, and really, left a sour taste in my mouth. I was not sure what to expect, but I expected so much better than what was delivered.<br/><br/>But I digress, the main measure of where this film actually has failed potential is in its visuals.<br/><br/>This is a very atmospheric movie, and the look has not been skimped on at all. Glorious fog stays sparkled throughout the film, and the constantly dilapidating town looks really well done. Special mention goes to the effects used when the ""evil"" shows up and everything begins to fall apart. Mitchell is usually found right in the middle of it, and nowhere does it ever seem fake. This sudden falling apart, and the hellacious looking creatures that appear from the beneath the cracks in the ground are fascinating to watch. They all look horrific, and all make for the film to really rise up beyond its pre-determined range. If only we could say that for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is only worth the invested time if people expect to look at the effects. If they come for acting or a storyline, they are well advised to be better off renting and/or buying something else.<br/><br/>4/10."

I've never played the game, so I can't comment on whether it does it justice or not.<br/><br/>However, as a stand-alone film this is definitely one of the best horror films I've seen in a long time. It's genuinely creepy, the visuals of Alessa's dream are astonishing and horrific at the same time. The acting in general is decent, but the movie is really about the visuals and the story rather than the action. Yes, this is actually a horror film with a great story - a rare thing.<br/><br/>I thought Sean Bean was to play the lead in the movie, but it was interesting that he wasn't. It worked out anyway. My only complaint with this movie would be the painful scene near the end of the movie when Rose returns from the hospital and confronts Chrisabella. It was much too staged which made the acting painful to watch. Fortunately it only lasts about a minute, and doesn't diminish too much from the movie overall.<br/><br/>So bottom line - you don't have to know anything about the game to enjoy this movie - I don't, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Great story, great horror, and great visuals. Though if you're faint-hearted it's probably not for you! Reading some of the comments above, many that didn't like the movie were either fans who were disappointed their game wasn't translated purely enough, or Christians who are offended that the cultists are evil. I can't comment on the gamers' disappointment, but the ones commenting on the movie's portrayal of Christianity must not have paid much attention in the movie. They're cultists, not Christians! You see the symbol of their faith many times during the movie, and it's certainly not a cross. Not to mention that Christians in this day and age aren't evil gits that burn people for witchery."

BUT, this movie has SO MANY MORE reasons for people to watch it.<br/><br/>The production design is brilliant. The visuals are haunting and eerie and although it doesn't have many ""scary"" moments, it has deeply haunting and disturbing visuals, which in the context of the entire story are great. Nothing is there just for the sake of being there. And NOTHING is left out. Nothing is implied. It's all there. The blood, the creatures, the creepy atmosphere.<br/><br/>And then we have the siren. The movie gets into full horror mode whenever that siren sounds and ""The Darkness"" descends. It quite possibly delivers the creepiest feeling you'll ever have. I completely agree with all those people who said that it's the best game-to-movie adaptation ever.<br/><br/>The acting was really good from everyone. The only criticism I have there is that Radha Mitchell needs to work on her American accent a bit.

Like books which are turned into movies the directors seem to be under the impression that we already know the story. What Hollywood needs to understand is that everyone hasn't read the book or played the game and so a little bit of background information is necessary to aid in the enjoyment of a film. The acting was good and I will give them credit for the scary creatures, kept my hands over my eyes for more than a few seconds, however the lead actress running up and down the street in an outfit that was clearly meant for a teenager was a bit silly.

This is the best Horror film I have seen in years, in fact, I was quite simply blown away by this gem of a movie and I am quite surprised by its low rating.<br/><br/>The film looks fantastic, the effects are great and the tension is built up superbly. It's not without its flaws though; the pacing at the beginning can be criticized as a little slow and I didn't care too much for Sean Bean's acting. Also, if you like your movies to wrap themselves up nicely and explain everything by the credits, then I suspect you will not appreciate this and should probably avoid it. However, if you like your films to make you work to understand the story and have you thinking about certain moments for days after, then you will probably love this.<br/><br/>Apart from looking fantastic, there are themes within this movie that lift it above the average teenager horror film offerings; questions about motherhood, sin and belief exist and I love the way the real evil is not necessarily perpetuated by the monsters but by the humans. Another interesting aspect of the movie is that nearly all the main roles are played by women (brilliantly). Radha Mitchell is wonderful as the terrified but determined mother and Laurie Holden as the cop steals about every scene she is in. I shall definitely be looking out for her in the future.<br/><br/>I sure hope to see this franchise picked up and continue with the same level of thought and care that went into this film.

It never really ticked any of these boxes and seemed a bit jumbled up as a result. I kept waiting for something frightening to happen , or for the plot to thicken, or for the tension to build, but it never did. The characters just wander around aimlessly and run away from a dude with a tin of corn beef on his head.The ending was pretty poor-revealing the whole plot of a movie in a ""heres a 2 minute explanation as to what this film is all about"" segment , just seemed a bit lame and cheap. You can imagine the producers having a discussion as to how to wrap the film up - quick explanation , then lets blow the rest of the budget on the bloodbath.

","I am stunned. I watched this movie with a younger female friend who had already seen it, and just said it was ""really scary!"" (but then, she's the type that has to hide her face for the scary bits ;). I'm a life long gamer, and all gamers have come to expect VG-movies to be either very very bad, or quite corny and superficial. So I was kinda expecting another ""cash cow"" movie. But one must keep an open mind - so I did.<br/><br/>There are way to few movies out there that portray an ominous eerie setting the way Silent Hill does. The first scenes in the town of Silent Hill are just as beautifully serene as they are spooky, and simply left me amazed. Instead of littering the movie with ""cheap"" shocks, there's that feeling of ""oooh..sh*t"" that gets to me in a much more effective way. Not having played the Silent Hill games, I didn't know what to expect from the plot - so I just sat back and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The movie makes some strong comments on the major religions, and without giving away the wonderfully ""slow, steady build-up"" plot, it was a true pleasure to see a relatively mainstream popular genre and movie make such a strong argument. Your own fear of ""Evil"" might just lead you to create that very evil, and have it come back to bite you. An old Danish saying goes ""He who digs a grave for someone else, might wind up falling into it himself"".<br/><br/>I warmly recommend both strongly religious people - as well as atheists and others that might have an opinion on western religions - go watch this movie and enjoy what is not only a very well made horror-movie, but also a bold comment on what dangers lie hidden in the human psychology. It's not Schindlers List, but it's well worth watching - especially if you're a bit tired of all the typical teen-slash movies that dominate the genre.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of a well made horror movie, do not miss out on Silent Hill. I'm already looking for a Collectors Edition DVD - this one is worth watching again!"

That's the end of that topic.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a story of twin tragedies, one the public ruin of a West Virginia mining town which has collapsed into the (real and metaphoric) underground fires of its own coal mines, the other the brutal history of a young girl with a mysterious past tied to the town. The story unfolds as a series of clues are pieced together by the girl's adoptive mother, searching for her in the ruins, while in a parallel plot line, the semi-estranged father sifts through records of the town. The movie is a bit slow to get to the reasons behind all this, and relies too heavily on a single long expository scene (complete with flashbacks) to finally piece it all together, but the revelations, when they come, are satisfying (that seems to be a word I keep returning to in my consideration of the movie: it satisfies).<br/><br/>This movie stands on its own merits as a much better ghost story than we've seen on film for a while now. While most of the horror genre seems itching to see how many psychopaths it can cram onto screen at one time (Saw, House of Wax) or splatter-driven monsters (Descent, Hills Have Eyes), lost in the background is the self-contained ghost story. The key difference here is that unlike a horror flick in which the villain is a psycho (Hostel), or a monster (Dawn of the Dead), or a disease (Cabin Fever, 28 Days), the ghost story demands a *STORY*. It has to have an internal rationale, a reason for the ghost to be haunting folks.<br/><br/>Short of some of the Dark Castle productions, that attention to background rationale has been missing from many recent horror flicks. Enter Silent Hill, which takes a longish while to get to the reason for all the horrific ghoulies, but which satisfyingly delivers once it does. The story, when it comes, satisfies in a way I haven't seen since The Ring, though it also reminded me of the excellent Poltergeist.<br/><br/>Similar to The Ring, there are a number of visual clues as to the nature of the haunting which are explained by the end (i.e., it's not just random walking corpses, it's very specific, and I like that kind of detail), and similar to Poltergeist, by the end of the movie our loyalties are a bit split. We want the heroes to escape gruesome death and damnation, but we also sympathize a bit with the 'bad guys,' who have been driven to this horrific end.<br/><br/>A note on the visuals: any schmuck can (and many have) paint a room with dirt and rust. Any pinhead can animate a CGI monster to lurch across the screen. It takes CONFIDENCE to keep the camera ON that monster as it goes. Too many horror flicks these days rely on jumpy MtV-style editing to flash quickly to and away-from the monster, so the audience can never really see it (are you LISTENING, Dark Castle???). The movie makers seem to think this makes it more scary. It doesn't. It makes it impossible to see. It's annoying, and eventually boring. Thank the Gods of Horror Cinema that the makers of Silent Hill had enough confidence in their visuals to show the bloody monsters on screen, sometimes for long sequences, so we in the audience could appreciate their handiwork. This was particularly important since several of the nasties provide important visual clues as to the nature of the haunting going on. Good for them for avoiding a common pitfall.<br/><br/>Grade: A-/B+"

","Just to make this clear, the only reason this film gets 3 stars is because of the cinematography. It really does at times look like a Silent Hill game with the angles used. I have played the game, but not a huge fan, although i did find the game the scariest i've played. But the film, made no sense to me, there was so much explanation, yet so much was un-explained. Pyramid Head.. He was a cool character, pretty scary if he was coming after me, but why the hell was he there!?! And the nurses, i was expecting them to break out into the Thriller dance! If you were driving along a dark empty road in the middle of the night, not breaking the law and the police put on sirens to pull you over... why would you drive away, putting your child's life in danger? Maybe i didn't play the games enough to understand, but there are a lot of people out there who won't have played the game at all, and i don't see how this film provides these people with anything enjoyable within the narrative.<br/><br/>TC"

","Before you even press play on your DVD, you have to realize that Silent Hill is based on a video game, and that's usually a bad sign - note Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, and last year's Alone in the Dark. Bad movies come from even the best video games, so already Silent Hill has a strike against it.<br/><br/>But ultimately what does Silent Hill in is its incomprehensibility. Oh, the plot is fairly easy to figure out, and luckily enough there are a few moments of exposition in which everything is painstakingly explained to the faithful, luckless viewer. It's just that the movie is so darkly filmed, it's often impossible to discern what's happening in any given scene.<br/><br/>Rose (Radha Mitchell) and Christopher (Sean Bean, who's underused) have a young daughter named Sharon (ha, get it, Rose of Sharon? Nah, coincidence). Sharon sleepwalks and mutters about a place called Silent Hill so, against her husband's wishes, Rose decides in the middle of the night (?) to take Sharon to this mysterious place. I mean, who wouldn't? Surely the key lies there and not in, say, locking the door to the house so Sharon can't sleepwalk her way off a cliff, as she almost does in the first scene? Nah, that would be too easy.<br/><br/>So Rose gets it in her head to take Sharon there in hopes that the town - a ghost town with a 40-year-old coal fire burning beneath it - will somehow trigger a cure in her daughter. A cop pulls her over on the way, but Rose panics and floors her SUV, and a high-speed chase - at night, in the rain - is underway. Yep, real Mommy of the Year material, she.<br/><br/>Inexplicably (meaning a combination of stupidity and rain), the vehicle crashes, and Rose finds herself in Silent Hill - and Sharon's gone. So now she has to go find the little kid. Who she brought there in the first place. I kind of felt my sympathy for Rose ebbing at this point.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Christopher is trying to find both Rose and Sharon. He doesn't get to do much other than Fight the Man on the outside, but his actions provide some background to the whole mess (i.e., why is Sharon having these episodes, what is Silent Hill the town hiding, and so on), because he's able to search records, or at least try to access them, leading to confrontations with The Man. Well, the sheriff, anyway.<br/><br/>If you've never played the game - which I suspect would be a lot of you - then you'll likely find the whole thing to be a gobberslop of gore. (I'm thinking of trademarking ""gobberslop,"" because I like the way it sounds and I think I made it up.) It's particularly gruesome near the end, but really the entire movie is a crimson cannonball.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit open ended, which might be the movie's saving grace. It's left up to the viewer's interpretation. Overall, though, it's not very tightly plotted or interesting - odd, since it was written by Roger Avary, who co-wrote Pulp Fiction."

","Wow, I freaking loved the film, after all the negativity from the critics I was holding my breath with skepticism, but in the end the movie did deliver and it was really a one of a kind movie experience. Although I would have loved Silent Hill a lot more if the director didn't do the whole in-depth explanation in the end, it would have been better if we didn't get an explanation and he left things more ambiguous. The whole Christabella plot didn't have to be so overdrawn but never the less it did give us the barbed wire revenge mayhem in the end, which fed all our inner sadists like a pack of hungry wolves. <br/><br/>We also got Christopher's view point of things, which adds the reality dimension to the already two different ones we watch with rose. This really works for new comers to the film because unlike us gamers who already have some insight of what to expect newcomers start of clueless. I appreciated the Christopher scenes and thought they were an excellent addition to the Silent Hill universe. <br/><br/>The acting of the film is adequate enough to enable the story to flow smoothly, Radha Mitchell, Laurie Holden and Sean Bean all work well with the material they were given and although occasionally we do get doses of cheese here and there its affect is minimum and is not detrimental to the movie experience. Visually the film deserves to be nominated for awards because the attention detail is very high, everything is well carved and the hell version of Silent Hill was spot on to the games, especially the Janitor in the toilet!!! That scene was just horrific!<br/><br/>I felt a strong De Ja Vu to when I first played the game, I made all these selfish, rash and reckless decisions, which in the end awarded me the worst ending out of the four. Similarly while I was watching the film I couldn't help but feel connected to that first time I played the game, Rose did whatever I did! she was scared, she acted irrationally and made selfish decisions. The thing is the movie gave the protagonist a lot of choices and she chose wrong. For example,  Dahlia warned her not to enter the church, but she did.  Rose didn't have to leave Cybil alone at elevator, but she did. Ironically enough the ending we got was very similar to the worst ending from the game, that is why in terms of movie making experience this the first movie ever to give me this kind of an experience.<br/><br/>It was very obvious that a lot of thought and passion went into this film, there are no cheap scares in the film, the terror is invoked into the audience craftily everybody has their own scare-o-meter so whether the film scares the living daylights out of you is your own prerogative but I would have to say I enjoyed this film immensely."

","When I first heard that Silent Hill was to be made into an American movie, I was skeptical, to say the least. Past attempts to convert Japanese games to American movies have been patchy, to say the least. However, my opinion changed as the release date approached and the first reviews appeared. ""Doesn't make any sense unless you've played the games"" and similar. Sounds like my prayers were answered, I thought. I finally got around to seeing it yesterday (it's only been in cinemas for a few days here) and I can safely say that it's the best game-to-movie ever! I would even go so far as to say that it's the first American horror movie in 20 years that I have really enjoyed. If you haven't played the games (and you would need to have played the first 2 at the very least) then a lot of the story is way beyond weird. I was hugely impressed that the extra stuff (i.e. the parts of the story not in the games) meshes perfectly with the original storyline. In fact it, shock, horror, makes some of the more obscure stuff more sensible. The actual storyline is a amalgam of the first two games. Some of the situations and monsters from SH2 are present, but the core story is that of SH1. The gender of the parent has been changed and the role of the church beefed up, but it is essentially intact. In fact, you would need to have played the second game to see the parts of the movie which are SH2 and which are not (""Pyramid-head"" for example). My only two gripes, which are so minor they're almost not worth mentioning are as follows: 1. Akira Yamaoka is not credited with the music! WTF? All the music I heard comes straight from the games, and it's all written by him. Not Jeff Danna. I see that he is properly credited on IMDb, but not on the end credits of the actual movie. 2. The use of the mobile phone/radio as a warning of approaching monsters. In the game this adds a level of tension almost to breaking point. In the movie it is used once, when Rose and Cybil are faced with their first monster, but never again! Why? Rose runs through the rest of the movie with her mobile in full view around her neck but it never makes another sound! Another thing that really makes the movie is that all the STRONG characters are women. Even the ""bad guy"". Hey, a feminist horror movie! If only all American horror movies were this good!"

","First of all, I will clearly mark WHEN the spoilers will begin, so until you see SPOILER ALERT do not worry.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a series of video games that I have LONG been a fan of. I love every in and out of each game, every aspect and concept, I adore the whole basic idea. The atmosphere, the psychological effect, the symbolism... it's all brilliant. At first word of a film I was both incredibly excited and fearful, seeing as how several movies based on video games are very lousy, but when I watched the film I was astonished...<br/><br/>Despite what I had expect, this was not it. I had expected it to be a good movie on its own but pretty lousy in transition with the games, but...<br/><br/>This movie is amazing. While it must be created in a way somewhat different from the games for the audiences who have not played them (so that they'll understand), it still keeps the feel and essence of the video games.<br/><br/>Silent Hill, as a film, does have its problems, so those, first and foremost, is what I shall cover. I had three specific problems with this film, and no others.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT -The change in names and basic characters. While I understand that they had to have a main character in town so that it could help explain the plot a little more, and for the transition of the two separate worlds, using the mother instead of the father was unnecessary. All fans of the game wanted to see Harry Mason looking for his child, not his 'wife'. See, these characters also aren't Masons, but similar people with new names, Da Silva I believe. Sharon's name in the game was Cheryl, her father was searching for her, and the mother had died. I didn't mind this MUCH, but I felt it wasn't needed.<br/><br/>-There should have been more creatures involved. I would have liked to see a few more of the straightjackets (for those of you who don't know, that would be the creature that Cybil first sees, the one cast as ""the Armless Man"" that spits acid at her), I'd of liked to see the Grey Children in the school, that or the ghosts, and I'd of liked to see a little more of the Janitor. The creatures were extremely well done, very creepy, and true to the game for the most part, but needed to be more involved in the second half. Once you meet a creature, it's only in that scene, and then gone.<br/><br/>-Finally, (Red)Pyramid Head. Pyramid Head is my favourite character out of pretty much any movie or game, at least in the top three. He's brilliant, but half of his brilliance is due to his placement and meaning in SH2. He was an incredibly symbolic creature with deep meaning directed toward James, and only James. He was great in the film, but he needed more purpose, in the movie he just sort of played the ultimate creature rather than a symbolic daemon of guilt. Also, since he was placed in the movie he needed to be a little more involved. I liked what he did, when he kills Anna by skinning her... that was brilliant. I liked him disappearing where he did, but I'd of loved to see him appear in an entanglement of barbed wire at the end and just run forward and begin to hack people in half. In the entire movie he never kills anyone using his blade, which is somewhat strange.<br/><br/>Aside from all of this, the film was more of an addition to the series rather than a copy, really. You have to watch it as if it were just another movie, and NOT Silent Hill. Think of the Silent Hill creatures and cast as a cameo.<br/><br/>Some of the things I ADORED were: -The ending. Many people hated it, but if you EVER beat a Silent Hill game they never have 'happy' endings, or complete endings. They are always vague and confusing, and leave you wondering. That's exactly what the film did and it was BRILLIANT. The time before that,when the action slows down and it talks about the past, the part where people say it gets boring, is explaining a very in-depth, and creepy storyline that really amplifies the feel to the film.<br/><br/>-The atmosphere. Everything about the town and the creatures had the exact same feel as the game. The camera was the same way, where it's abstract, sometimes tilted or in weird locations, and pans with the character from far away or above. The design and layout of the town is very dark and gloomy, just like the game, as well as the movements of the creatures.<br/><br/>I could go on. I give this film a 10/10. I'm sorry, but it was a astonishing movie, the best I've seen in a very long time and the best I've ever seen of its genre. No horror or suspense is NEARLY as good. You have to be a deep person to appreciate it, and you can't be closed-minded."
"resadote","9","0","1","6 September 2006"," Game to movie... can it be done?
","Usually I am extremely skeptical of a game that's turned into a movie. Quite often the elements of a game are completely different because they involve player interaction while movies are a much more passive form of entertainment.<br/><br/>However, Silent Hill has always been a very cinematic game, both in the way the sets were designed so artfully in the games and also because of the extended FMV sequences trademark to the series. Because of these details, putting it into a good movie was easier.<br/><br/>Not that the cast and crew didn't work hard. Silent Hill retained the good old horror feeling we all felt when we bashed away our first dog or ran from our first nurse enemy in the game. The including of darkness and the fog everywhere was very well done, keeping us in a perpetual world of change.<br/><br/>The creatures are gruesome, but not gross. You want to look at them, at their twisted fate of being stuck in this hellish world. The actors inside the suits performed well, too. The scene where the nurses block the path was so well choreographed I had to rewind it and watch it a second time.<br/><br/>While there are some minor changes made to the characters and the nature of the cult, Silent Hill is amazingly close to the game plot-wise. You can tell that the script was well-researched.<br/><br/>All in all, Silent Hill is a good movie made from a good game series. The next time you're at Blockbuster, pick up a copy."
"FantasyLights","2","0","1","6 September 2006"," A blood bath I never wanted to take
","Let's get started, when I first saw the preview's for this I found it laughable. A mother loses her daughter and must go to Hell to retrieve her. However then I started hearing people saying how spectacular it was. Well I decided to wait for the DVD release none-the-less and I'm glad I did. This movie wouldn't even be worth the $1 theater. Mind you I did not make the mistake of wasting my hard earned money on this. I made my neighbor waste her's then I borrowed it.<br/><br/>The movie starts out fairly decent and goes downhill from there. I'd just like to take this moment to say that if your child is having nightmares, sleepwalking to the edge of cliffs and calling out the name of a ghost town do not, under any circumstances, go there! When Rose first enters the town it does look promising, it's creepy, it's deserted, and it's raining ash. Then all of a sudden those alarms that make you want to cut off your ears begin ringing. She follows who she thinks is her daughter into the basement of some building. I honestly think if it was her daughter the kid would have stopped, anyways, suddenly things change. She is walking through a maze of gates and heat, much like some sort of sweat shop. Next thing you know she finds half of a man strung up on one of these gates, and then these molten midgets start groping her. I have yet to find what is scary about this aside from the CGI. I'll admit there were some half decent CGI effects, which is why I gave this two stars. The movie monsters just get worse and worse. Like the guy with a large triangular head and giant knife, the over-sized roaches, the zombie janitor who appears to be doing yoga, the armless thing that spites black goo, and yes they've saved the best for last, the Thriller nurses. I kept waiting and waiting for the song to start playing, but alas I was let down yet again.<br/><br/>The movie is very broken, it takes you down a road of pain and misery, dragging you over barbed wire, open flame, barbed wire, knives, and yes more barbed wire. The main weapon of choice in this film seems to be barbed wire. This movie is straight out of the twisted mind of someone who should consider checking themselves into the local asylum. Since when did barbed wire become related to the devil? People need to learn that children, and witchcraft films have been overdone. Take The Ring, mix in the worst witchcraft film in your mind and set them on fire, you will have this movie.<br/><br/>This film left a lot of things unexplained, like how exactly did they pass through into the world they were stuck in? When did that occur? Why did it take the cop with them? Why was this town never touched after the night of the fire? <br/><br/>DVD worthy? Well if you really really want to see this, which I suppose if you enjoy self inflicted pain then this is probably your cup of tea. I'd say borrow it, don't buy it, and don't rent it. Why not rent it you ask? Even if you have one of those $1 rental places? Because as I said in the beginning it's not worth it."

It's brilliant, It's scary, It's like living a nightmare on your TV screen. The core of Silent Hill has been respected. This time the producers have just changed a little part of the original story of Silent hill. I've played the video games and contrary to Resident Evil, Doom, Tomb Raider and all others VG movies, the essence of SH is there and I can recognize it.

OK, being a fan of the games I obviously noticed that they weren't 100% accurate, but it was close enough for me to be called a success. The casting was spot on, especially Jodelle Ferland as Alessa/Sharon, and Sean Bean as her dad was a great choice, and Alice Krige was as awesome as always. I think they captured the atmosphere of the game very well, helped a lot by the very 'Silent Hill' soundtrack. It's hard to pin this down as being influenced by any one game as there are elements of the first three games, but I'd say more of one and three. There's some great FX and creatures, all directly from the games, nothing 'new' or 'invented'. I really hope they do more Silent Hill movies, bringing back Jodelle as Alessa!!"

","As a giant fan-boy of the games, I went into this movie (came out only recently in Australia) with high expectations, though didn't want to wreck it for myself by researching plot lines or anything. I only had the game in mind, as everywhere it seemed to be heralded as the best game adaptation (I don't like that term...).<br/><br/>In my first screening I was sadly disappointed. Some of the bits were a bit boring and seemed to drone on forever. Gans does a good job in capturing the 'look' of the game. The gore and violence contained within the horror scenes were excellent though, but as I left the cinema, I had this strong notion that I had missed something.<br/><br/>That's when I realised my mistake. I had been so caught up in anticipating the violence and horror that I had missed out on a detailed and complicated storyline. After keeping this in mind, I went to a second screening with a completely blank mind, as I had already known when the action would come, this time I focused more on the story. And all I can say is wow. When I watched it like this, the movie was a lot better. I could really see what Gans was trying to do with the film. As someone on IMDb said, it plays more like a ""Nightmare drama"" than a classic horror film. I agree. Silent Hill is definitely more a drama with horror elements. In my second viewing I felt more for the characters and even liked Chris Da Silva (Sean Bean), who seemed an unnecessary addition at first, but later I found anchored the film in contrast to Rose (Rhada Mitchell) and her time in Silent Hill. The story overall also moved at a faster pace without this hindering anticipation. By feeling more for the characters and the story, this also enhanced my visual pleasure of the elaborate sets and monster design (I had never realised the beauty of the fog until now...). It's amazing to think this film only had a budget of $50 million as it accomplishes so much visually and conceptually.<br/><br/>It is no wonder this movie has gone over critic's heads most of the time, resulting in poor senseless ratings. It is when you go into a film with certain expectations that a film can be wrecked for yourself. Don't think of it as a horror film, keep an open mind, and fall in love with the demented world of Silent Hill."

","Not a player of video games, I knew nothing about Silent Hill, but eagerly waited for the movie, as it looked amazing - not to mention the lovely Deborah Kara Unger is in it. Hopefully, because I haven't played the video game I can be rather neutral with my opinion of the film, which in summary, is rather disappointing. Maybe I missed out on enjoying the film to it's fullest extent because of not playing the game, but if an adapted film is going to be good, then one shouldn't have to have played the game (or read the book, or comic or whatever).<br/><br/>Without going too in depth into the plot of the film, which in itself, is rather interesting, but highly confusing and there seems to be too much left unexplained. However, what is obvious is done very well. Direction and cinematography are great, special effects are hauntingly amazing and at times it looks like a video game - intentional or not, is actually quite cool. While coming across in the trailer as a horror, ""Silent Hill"" isn't really that scary. There are some terrifying moments, but overall, it's more of a thriller-mystery. However, those little creatures that Rose first encounters at Silent Hill unbelievably scary - and the noise the make is nearly as terrifying as the noise made in ""The Grudge"".<br/><br/>The acting is mixed. Radha Mitchell is a fantastic supporting actress, but taking the lead of Rose Da Silva in ""Silent Hill"" she doesn't seem to quite pull it off, although her concern for her daughter is shown well. Sean Bean is convincing as troubled husband / father Christopher Da Silva and Laurie Holden is great as butch cop Cybil Bennett. The amazing Deborah Kara Unger (one of my favourite actresses) is barely recognisable as the outcast Dahlia Gillespie, a sad character whom one cannot but help have compassion for. It's a real shame she didn't get much screen time, but look out for Deborah in the flashback scenes where she looks more herself. The terrific acting continues in the form of Officer Thomas Gucci played by the wonderful Kim Coates and Alice Krige as the cruel Christabella. Rounding out the main cast is of course Jodelle Ferland who plays Sharon / Alessa, and does an admirable job.<br/><br/>While falling short in some areas, ""Silent Hill"" makes up for its mistakes by having a generally terrific cast, and for mentioning (though not until towards the end of the film) how people fear what they do not understand, and in Silent Hill, they burn what they are afraid of. Much along the lines of ""The Crucible"". Dahlia and Christabella's opposites are also interesting to watch. Finally, the amazing score and soundtrack featured in ""Silent Hill"" (which is in general a very loud film) are great, and help to speed up some of the slower moments in the film. Disappointing, but not a total loss."

","Like the games unless you really pay attention you might miss important details. But then again, even if you do pay attention you might not be sure if you know what happened. But that's quite okay by me - I like having too think a bit.<br/><br/>Some of the acting (very little)was sub-par but not a problem. The sets, the look of the film and all of that was unlike anything we've seen to date. And, Pryamid Head has got to be the evilest, cruelest, baddest thing ever to hit a movie screen - he puts the Freddy Kruger and Jason-types to shame. The only thing this movie lacked was enough PH. But that too is okay as I expect the movie makers to make it up to me in the sequel which I really hope is coming.<br/><br/>I was really pleased the movie remained so true to the look and feel of the games. And like the game it takes a couple of viewings to get a good feel for the story and characters - at least for me. It's a good excuse to buy the DVD which I did and have viewed it several times. But that's coming from a guy who has played the games dozens of times and still enjoy them.<br/><br/>I thought the main character R. Mitchell did a great job as did most of the actors. I'm not sure why but Cybil's part seemed forced at times - but that's okay since she's a babe.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the scenes that came right out of the games - unlike many video game movies that you're not sure the movie should have the same title because they are so different.<br/><br/>Like most of the films I enjoy it got horrible reviews and as far as I know didn't do so well at the box office. I suspect it will do very well over seas and in video sales. It's pretty much a given that if the critics hate it I will love it.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>My one criticism, all be it a minor one, is like the Tomb Raider series, I would have liked to see the main characters do a bit more exploring in creepy/dark environments with unseen monsters lurking in the shadows: Laura with her trusty flares and Silent Hill with a flashlight and radio in the school/dark streets environments. I guess because it's what characters of the games do most of the time. But it's easy to second guess.<br/><br/>Over all I thought this was a great film and well done.<br/><br/>Michael"

","First of all, i will say that i was a big fan of the second Silent Hill installment for the PS2 (i never played any others). That being said, i was NOT impressed at all with this movie. I thought the plot was dumb, and it had one of the most vague endings i have ever seen. However, the actors did a great job of playing their characters, Sean Bean being one of my favorites. I was completely confused for the duration of the film, which is probably why i hated it so much. The story never explained where the monsters came from, never explained who lived or who died, and it never even gave a clue as to whether or not the whole event actually even happened. Normally i catch on quickly with complicated flicks, but this one has me totally bumfuzzled...if anyone can help out with a brief explanation of what the heck happened in Silent Hill, it would be greatly appreciated."

","However, that's still not saying much.<br/><br/>It's better than the crap Uwe Boll spits out on a daily basis, but I still say that it's all but impossible to successfully adapt a video game into a workable movie.<br/><br/>The whole point of the video game is interactive enjoyment and puzzle solving. How are you going to enjoy a movie like that? Having said that, they almost accompolish that here. There are clues that are followed as the lead character searches for her daughter and tries to uncover the mystery of what actually happened....in Silent Hill....<br/><br/>Aside from a few changes to the original game, they did a great job capturing the horror and suspense you feel when you play the game.<br/><br/>My final advice would be--I recommend this movie as both a decent adaptation and an above-average horror flick.<br/><br/>BUT...if you truly want to experience the nature of Silent Hill, you have to play the game for yourself.<br/><br/>Final verdict: 6/10 or 2 stars out of 4 And a 3/10 on the ""endurance scale"" -- a new system I set up that estimates whether or not it's a movie you'd want to see over and over. So in this case, you might watch it once, maybe twice, but it's probably not something most people would want to watch frequently.<br/><br/>I can only hope the Metal Gear Solid movie is adapted this well."

","I played the game and the rest of the series games,but seeing this movie was by far the best horror flick in years.The characters were top rate in their nightmares of reality and dementia.To have a town surreal and exist out of our time and perceptions.With having the most horrible creatures imaginable,like an armless faceless creature which spews black acid to victims.Or the meanest one of them all is the eight foot musclebound behemoth who rips the skin off whole from its victims as well.Or using a near seven foot sword.I think this film was top rate in every scene,and what gave me shivers was the siren on top of the unholy church that sounded before night falls as a warning to the others.The premise was boundless,using fantastic cg animations that kept you biting your fingernails to the quick.Chris Gans really captured the sensation of being vulnerable without a lot of resources to keep you alive.Using wits and simple logic of finding out why this was happening to a mother and daughter.And seeing the most original demons and creatures the mind can perceive was outstanding.I have to say i cannot wait for the second installment hopefully to be made for silent hill fans like myself.Excellent film to be recommended to horror fans over the world,and for a last word,don't pee off a child who's mind can hold powers which can level a town."

","Like so many video games turned into films, ""Silent Hill"" is ultimately all about form over substance. There is a great deal of confusion surrounding the paper thin plot, and maybe only those who have played the game (I have not) can understand what exactly is going on. One must assume than Rose is trapped in some sort of Hellish dimension that changes back-and-forth from a deserted town that suffered a not-so-natural disaster (in this case, uncontrollable fires from coal mines underneath the titular town, Silent Hill, West Virginia) to an Hell-on-Earth world populated by mutants and monsters of unexplained origin or purpose.<br/><br/>The movie is rather interestingly rendered and the photography and FX are used to good advantage.

"solidgameboy12-1","8","0","1","26 August 2006"," One of the few good game to movie adaptations.
","You know, by now, video game movies should almost be a genre in cinema by now. With video game movies as early as the Super Mario Brothers Movie, which was mediocre at best, yet still enjoyable, we found there is no way to make video games to be good movies. Video games can be played, movies cannot. More of a story in be told in video games than the movie, which has only so much time to tell a story.<br/><br/>It's not that video game movies are destined to become bad, but unless someone can come up with a way to capture what everyone liked about the game before and put it into cinema, Video game movies will fall on their face in being bad.<br/><br/>This movie may have the answer. Silent Hill, a very dark, and stirring film directed by Christophe Gans, (The french director who directed The Brotherhood of the Wolf) who says he plays the games, and found this one to have a great story to be made into a movie.<br/><br/>The story follows Rose (Radha Mitchell) who lives with her husband Christopher (Sean Bean) and daughter Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), when one frightening evening, Rose finds her daughter saying ""Silent Hill!"" Rose believes that maybe taking her daughter (Rather, adoptive daughter) to Silent Hill, might be able to get some insight on why Sharon mentions this place.<br/><br/>Along the way, A cop named Cybil (Laurie Holden) follows Rose and Sharon, to ask a few questions. Instead of stopping for her, Rose drives down the road to Silent Hill to try and evade her, and in a rush, she takes a sharp turn down a curvy road to avoid hitting what appears to be a little girl in the road. Rose wakes the next morning to find Sharon is gone, and the road she drove on is gone. She begins to enter the town with only Sharon on her mind. After an encounter with several frightening monsters, she soon realizes this world is not what she would expect, and not only can she not leave, but only one other person besides herself has followed her this far, Cybil. With Cybil's help, and the help of several other clues hidden in other places, She plans to solve the mystery of Silent Hill, and doesn't plan to leave until Sharon is with her again.<br/><br/>The movie is indeed creepy, and will disturb some of those who cannot stand some of the more violent moments or more visually disturbing sequences. The acting is done very well, the fear doesn't seemed like they are trying at times. The story is a bit iffy, since it somewhat lacks a real good plot, but it's based off a video game, so you can't complain.<br/><br/>The monsters are inventive and original, with the exception of the Red Pyramid, whose a regular from the games. Some may assume, based on their brightness and gray color, they are CG, but in fact, all are latex and foam.<br/><br/>The ending is a bit of a disappointment, but it feels vaguely reminiscent of ""The 6th Sense"", in a way. All that aside, this is probably one of the better video game movies I've seen since Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. If you like the game, see it, if you haven't played the game, read up on it, then see it, it'll help you out a lot.<br/><br/>I rate this an 8/10."
"Xex-Arachnid","7","0","1","26 August 2006"," I'm going to tell you why I am surprised...
","It's because this is the first VG based movie ever to be transferred to celluloid successfully. But they say that Thomas Edison made about a thousand errors before perfecting his idea ""the light bulb"" (i think?)-so go figure.<br/><br/>At first the movie drags on a bit but things get pretty meaty towards the end of the middle and then excellent in the end. I didn't like Sharon's mom the DaSilva lady because she was just too ballsy for my tastes, just taking it upon herself to go this mystery ghost town named ""Silent Hill"" because Sharon always mentions it in her sleepwalking spells. Obviously, it shows that she has some anger for her husband but why, I don't know, they seem to not care to put the reasons why in the film.<br/><br/>If you look at all the demons, and burning babies specters in the Hellish dimension, you could see why it all adds up near the end. I love the big dude with the triangle on his head, dragging that big blade across the ground. The scene when the girls mother and the cop was locked in the closet/fan vent room, and you hear this guy walking (stomping actually) dragging that blade, was great.<br/><br/>Of course, it has CGI (which I'm not a fan of) because there are just some scene sequences that computers just can't do professionally as in actually blood, animatronics and related old school SFX; case in point: the scene where the big guy (I guess they call him the ""fiend"") grabs the girl on the steps of the church. I'm not give away what happens but you can tell that parts in that scene was CGI which is lackluster POOR. But on the other hand, the CGI effects were good in showing the process of being burned alive, which I had noticed in the remake of The Hills have eyes. <br/><br/>A key thing that grabs me is the scene of the elders meeting in the hotel during the flash back scene kind of reminds me of a certain religious group/org. but I will leave out their name. Not that I am assuming the makers of this movie was intending anything in subtle relation but I did notice the similarities.<br/><br/>Now, there are some questions for this movie that I must ask:<br/><br/>1. Who was with adult Alyssa (being all burned up) to have a baby and who would want to?<br/><br/>2. How did the church know when the darkness was coming in order to sound the alarm?<br/><br/>3. It's obvious to (and yet, I could be wrong) that Sharon's mom and the lady cop were dead in order to be in limbo, but where are their bodies?<br/><br/>4. Why was the lady cop still alive? I thought when that high priestess lady gave her minions that nod, it was for them to strike the final blow.<br/><br/>5. Last but not least, If Alyssa's mother was in limbo, obviously she was dead but she was alive after her daughter was burned up, so did she commit suicide out of guilt or just died later but out of guilt she was in that realm?<br/><br/>Other than that, there were great scenes in the movie and I do commend the filmmakers for making it very true to the first game and having a good dialogue for the characters."

","You don't like Videogames? Well, maybe you get interested after watching this Movie. ""Silent Hill"" is by far one of the best Horror-Flicks in years and for sure the most brilliant Video game-Adaption up to date. This is what ""Resident Evil"" and ""Doom"" should have been: a creepy and mind-blowing trip into the dark realms of the human mind. What makes this movie special is the great aesthetic the pictures and scenes contain. In some areas it reminded me about the Vision Clive Barker must have had with ""Hellraiser"" which in no way lived up to its novel expectations. The Ghost Town of Silent Hill, condemned to darkness by a revenge-forced mind, gives you the creeps and it is as close to the game as it could get. The creatures are projections of madness and they work well on the big screen exactly like they do on the TV-Monitor. They are a perfect reflection of darkness and insanity, dwelling in human minds. But the real horror is the religious fanaticism the last inhabitants of Silent Hill are showing, which causes all the trouble anyway. With the ""witchhunt"" subject they come extremely close to the fearsome, destructive potential of our reality.<br/><br/>The idea of a parallel dimension (parallel dimensions) works excellent and I love the part where the husband and his wife are in the same room the same time, he in our reality and just feeling her, she you can say ""in hell"", fighting for her life. A quite disturbing situation that gets its ultimate creepiness in the end sequence...<br/><br/>Silent hill is a true experience in horror, recommendable not only for fans of this genre, but for everybody who enjoys a piece of art in movie-making too.

","I was extremely disappointed in all of the bad reviews that this superb movie received. I just can not comprehend the fact that some people gave this movie only one star! (You know who you are... shame on you.) Some reviewers say that it makes no sense if you haven't played the games, but I went into the theater without having any experience in the games and understood it completely! And after reviewing game info, I am impressed with how precise the directors were with this movie in keeping true to the source material. Everything about this movie was perfect. At first, I thought that the sirens would get annoying, but it was done in such a way, that it almost got more suspenseful each time it happened. The monsters and environments in this move left me completely awestruck. They were truly beautiful, and at the same time, deeply disturbing. The monsters were very well picked out for the movie. Each had a purpose for being there, which was also true in the games. Pyramid Head was the incarnation of Rose's guilt for bringing her daughter to the town. The Grey Children represented the physical appearance of a child (Sharon) and Rose's need to find her. The Armless character and the Nurses seemed to represent the 'sickness' that plagued Sharon. And above all that, this is the only movie that has made my heart rate actually go up. Two of my biggest ""Oh, sh*t!"" moments were in this movie. The first was when Rose comes across the nurses and they all snap around to face her. That feeling could only be surpassed by the next ""Oh, sh*t!"" moment. After Rose gets stabbed and stands up and turns around, as the organ music begins to play, and Alessa rises up out of the pit behind Rose. I almost thought I was going to wet myself the first time I saw that! No other movie has ever evoked such a feeling in me at the end as this one has. Most horror movies I see, I like because of the action and the escape from reality... well, Silent Hill certainly accomplished the escape from reality, but in a far more emotional and poetically deep fashion as anything I have seen before. This is the best movie I have ever seen. Without Question."

The soundtrack (as previously mentioned by another voter), was straight out of the game. As soon as I heard the sirens go off, I had chills, anticipating what was about to come. The creatures were also very recognizable from the games as well, adding to the suspense. When the ""darkness"" took over, even the backgrounds were straight from the games, along with the creepy music and camera angles made this an eerie, yet very thrilling movie to watch. I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen."

"buddyboy619","9","0","1","23 August 2006"," better than average horror film
","Thought this was very well done and almost as creepy/scary as the video game. Performances and effects were excellent. Would recommend it to any fan of horror/fantasy films. Much of the criticism of this film comes from people unfamiliar with the video game. That being said, I still think that it's a worthwhile see on it's own, although it has much more impact if you've played the game. The film's cast is enough to recommend it: Rhada Mitchell's performance equals her superb job in Pitch Black; Sean Bean is always worth watching; Alice Krige and Debra Kara Unger lend their credibility to the film. Overall, one of the best video game to cinema efforts to date."
"wrlang","9","0","1","23 August 2006"," It's pitch black on silent hill
","Silent Hill had just enough transitions to keep it interesting. I stopped playing video games shortly after Atari Asteroids came out, so I only had other films for comparison. Radha Mitchell (Rose) seemed to be in the dark most of her last few movies, going from holding a bottle of glowing slugs up for light in Pitch Black to hold a lighter up in Silent Hill. Mitchell did a great job in a film that must have taken a lot of effort. She looks good, even covered in blood and screaming. Mitchell is in the same league as Bruce Willis in that they both suffer well on screen. Medium fast pace along with a strong cast, some wonderful camera work, a few twists, and good special effects helped this film through a pretty stale plot. I wouldn't pay to see it again in the theater, but I would by the DVD."
"CWEGojinn","9","0","1","23 August 2006"," Nearly Perfect In All Aspects
","Really, an incredible film! GREAT acting by the whole crew, and FANTASTIC effects. Soundtrack adds so much more to this thing, and I feel like this is one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time. Collateral barely tops this. Though some people feel there was overacting and ""unrealisticness"" to this movie, it's also based loosely upon a video game, meaning not only is it a horror (where ALL rules go out the window) but it's in it's own little world of it's own. The ending may confuse some people, but if you really pay attention you can draw some conclusions of your own. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. This movie isn't all blood or gore, but it's got its suspense, and a great story, so you won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>My only point missing is deducted for the real lack of Sean Bean in the film, and some pace issues. The film is about the mother and daughter mostly, but there could have been more scenes with such a good actor like him. Also there are parts of the movie that seem really slow and drawn out. They builds suspense for sure, but sometimes you sit there wondering when it will end."
"Adam0001","8","0","1","23 August 2006"," psychological ride into what can only be explained as a nightmare.
","Silent hill was an all round original viewing experience. By no means was this an excellent film but what it was, was an excellent adaptation of silent hill. I am only partially familiar with the game, however I did manage to notice a number of familiarities like the eerie score, the creatures and not to mention the location. <br/><br/>Right from the start of the film you are able to notice that this is going to be more than the average horror/video game adaptation, in fact it is in a completely different league from the lights of Resident Evil or Alone in the dark (Just to mention could have been equally as good if written and directed with more care). It becomes present that this is an emotional and psychological ride into what can only be explained as a nightmare. <br/><br/>Rose Da Silva's (played by Radha Mitchell) first contact with Silent Hill is when she notices the sign. Which has to be mentioned is a rather powerful moment, the mist is excellent and what at first to the unaware viewer seems like snow is in fact ashes. As she makes her way down the winding rode in the heavy mist a town becomes present. Not mentioning to much information but Silent hill has 2 phases, the night and the day. When she first enters the town it is about to turn in to night. Sirens are activated creating a very claustrophobic and wiry atmosphere as darkness approaches. Of cause Rose is oblivious of what is about to happen. <br/><br/>What is noticeable in the film which is very different from all other films is the small details. In the first darkness phase in the film when rose is wondering through a very dark corridor, she lights her lighter which creates light but not enough to stop her from stumbling over a bin. In the majority of films the light would have lit up the entire corridor. As mentioned this is only a small detail but it is exactly things like this what create an atmosphere.<br/><br/>The acting isn't bad but could be a lot better. Having said this Cybil Bennett's (played by Laurie Holden) performance deserves mentioning. Although many people might think she was just a little stiff, I believe she made her research. The way she moved and spoke is as if she was the game character. <br/><br/>Visually the film hasn't a uninteresting moment, each set crafted with distinction and also the way the film has been shot is unbelievable. The use of CGI is obviously there but not to much or an easier way of explaining it, is it has been balanced much better with real sets. The lighting is worth mentioning, for example the torch again doesn't light a whole room but only a straight line. <br/><br/>Overall There are some genuinely disturbing moments in this film. After receiving some mediocre reviews in general it has to be mentioned that this is probably because this is not intended for a very general mainstream audience. However it will be a memorable experience to those of us who enjoyed the game, fans of Christophe Gans and everyone who enjoys experimental, creative and psychological film making. Be wormed The film does contain some unpleasant moments, which at times can be bloody. 8 out of 10"
"ernojohannes","10","0","1","23 August 2006"," You can't get any closer to Silent Hill than this..
","I saw the movie.. did I enjoyed it? Well I can't say I didn't. <br/><br/>Because I think it's the BEST movie i have seen in this year. And I went to see it twice. And I have never went the see a movie twice on a big screen before, especially these kind of movies. But heck.. i enjoyed the movie as much as the first time i saw it. :) I must admit.. i have played all of the Silent Hill games and I like the atmosphere of the games, the plots, the characters and one of the most disturbing ""monsters"" of all our times. So I'm pretty much a Silent Hill fan. And I think this movie catches the whole package from the Silent Hill games. And that Silent Hill package seem to be too much for the most of the real ""critics"" out there. They Just DON'T get it. They probably thought that this is going to be another The Ring or Grudge clone so you can pretty much immediately understand the package. But guess what? It isn't. You need the THINK more in this movie the understand it fully. Because you won't be having all of the answers in a silver plate. Well I still think this movie explains Silent Hill better than any of the games does. So.. :/ Let's move on.. What about the actors? Did they match well the characters in the games? Well the answer is yes. All of the cast made excellent performance, and i especially liked Radha Mitchells and Jodelle Ferlands performance in this movie. Radha who plays the mother Rose Da Silva (by da way which isn't in the games) and Jodelle who is the daughter Sharon Da Silva and of course ""the dark side"" :). They really dominate the screen. Radha who is not equipped with big curves but is equipped with talent for acting. And every move she makes, even if she blinks an eye is very well performed. She is really up for the leading star challenge. Congrats to that.. And what about Jodelle? She makes really strong performance for she's age. Playing both Sharon and ""the dark side"" must be tough, but she pulls that of nicely. Many has said that Sean Beans role in this movie was unnecessary. But I think he made a nice pacing the overall movie. And his ""search"" explains a little of what happens or has happened in Silent Hill. Nice acting for his part. What about the hideous monsters? Oh boy. They are.. (one word) awesome! They work almost perfectly in the big screen. Nice CGI blended to creepy real actors/actresses and their costumes. The CGI is one of best I have seen in years in these kind of films. And I think this movie has one of the best BadAss villain/monster ever. And with that I mean of course the Red Pyramid or Pyramid Head. That dude just made me sweat almost like pig when i saw it first time in the movie. I was so nailed to my seat then, Thanks for those chills Gans. ;) And The Real actor of the movie, the town itself.. Silent Hill. It feels, acts like the town we all know from Silent Hill games. From intense fog to buildings it's a basically dream come true. :) The whole atmosphere in the movie is breath-taking, and Gans (the Director) keeps that feeling throughout movie.<br/><br/>Okey probably, many wont understand this movie because there is too many odd things happening on the screen. But heck two of my friends who never had played the games liked the movie. And one of them said: best game movie adaption (and thats pretty nicely said i think :)..). And they seemed even to understand it, mostly :). So people who haven't played the games can still enjoy this movie as much as we fans do. It's basically a trip to your deepest nightmare where you will be hanging around for 127 min.. so have fun..<br/><br/>Once you enter Silent Hill, there's no turning back.. literally! So Gans.. will you make a sequel for us..? Will ya Will ya? ;)<br/><br/>Enter Silent Hill.. Enter the Nightmare of your life.. Top points 10/10.."
"krael74","6","0","1","23 August 2006"," Fascinating
","On the one hand, I could almost dismiss Silent Hill as another confused bundle of horror convention masquerading as a story, i.e. ""The Grudge"". However, as sloppy as the plot can get at times, I came away from the viewing tossing this movie around and around in my head. Not having played the video game upon which it is based, it's hard to tell how many of the story elements generated elsewhere, but for what it was I think Roger Avary has created an ambitious storyline that digs a little deeper than its B-rate subject matter. The look of the film is a beautiful mix of looks and colors, shifting smoothly between 'reality' and nightmares. Gans does an expected pro job with this, even lending his CG bogeymen a certain texture and presence many others have failed to do. At no point is the movie ever exactly terrifying, and I doubt Avary and Gans took this as their mission. It's an unsettling tale of darkness and the places it lives. The film never exactly ties together in a satisfying enough way to rate it higher than a seven, however I enjoyed the film and the effort enough to leave it with a healthy 6 1/2. If you like your 'horror' films thoughtful, this is certainly worth a watch."
"gila_film","8","0","1","22 August 2006"," Disturbing yet Beautiful
","In his 'Silent Hil's review, Rober Ebert said ""Perhaps those who have played the game will understand the movie, and enjoy it"". Well, I never played the game and I understand the movie and I totally enjoy it. Frankly, Silent Hill is one of the finest horror movie that I ever watched recently! Silent Hill is based on a video game and thankfully Uwie Boll doesn't put his hand on this.<br/><br/>Sharon Da Silva (Jodelle Ferland) is suffering from night-walker and kept saying 'Silent Hill' in her dream. Despite the hesitation of her husband, Chris (Sean Bean), Sharon's mother, Rose (Radha Mitchell) take her to the site. Now deserted, Silent Hill is a ghastly looking town and full with secrets that Rose must reveal if she want to save her life and her daughter life.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is about mystery and maintain it with full of disturbing yet terrific visuals and scares. The mystery is so captivating and never let our attention wander around. Silent Hill also barely rely on just scare tactics. In my humble opinion, the horrors are not so scary, but Mr. Gans succeed to keep us as the audience to seat still. Yes, the story somewhat surreal and have some holes, but is hard for any horror movies without holes. And the holes this movie contains is not in the annoying rate, but still tolerable.<br/><br/>This is the third movie of Christophe Gans, after The Crying Freeman and Brotherhood of the Wolf. Once again he shows his ability in images and scenery, which is beautiful as visuals. He also could keep the atmospheric elements from the games and that I might say is also borrowing from the J-Horror style. I do not complaining about it since the result is good.<br/><br/>The acting is always could dependable form the cast, since Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean and Deborah Kara Unger is amongst of the finest actors that I ever know. They bring a solid performance that delivers the tension that the movie need.<br/><br/>As conclusion, Silent Hill is a first rate horror movie and must watch for the genre's fans or the video-gamers that love the game."
"rbeph","7","0","1","22 August 2006"," Well I notice a lot of people didn't like it.....
","It's no blockbuster sure. It doesn't stick to the game storyline very well either. The acting wasn't any worse than the game voice acting, so I'm not gonna knock credit here either. As for the plot, it's all over the place, yet I can't rightfully say that I'd expect them to use the plot from say, SH1, that would leave all but the most attentive wondering WTF?! I don't ride the fan-boy fence so I'm not A) gonna 10 star it or B) knock stars off for veering from the storyline. I enjoyed the movie, the cinematography was VERY well done as far as recreating some of the more notable camera angles from the game. The monster characters were beautifully rendered to mirror their in game portrayals. Sure the plot was a bit all over the place, but any of you played the game? Those plots went all over like a blind man running a 10km race. My only real complaint is that from VG to big screen if they were going to modify the plot as much as they did, don't use characters we know from one plot in a manner that contains no continuity with the original plot of it's predecessor. I enjoyed the movie, it was a bit long but it held for me the same feeling I got from the games, confusion, tension, dramatic sympathetic appeal, and those damned air raid sirens always got to me. I give it 7 stars; That being said, if this movie was only to be judged in the category of VG -> Bigscreen conversions, it would receive 10/10 simply for the fact that while it did move from the games general plot, the overall enjoyability of the movie for me in comparison to any other VG->BS movie I've seen is exponentially greater. It's not a 10, but far from a 1..."

","I just got done seeing Silent Hill I have been waiting all summer for this movie. Not that I play the game's because I don't think I have ever touched one. It just looked like a good movie. And overall I felt it was. Some people do not like the constant talk of the story line. And for the most part it did make out for a long movie but for people like me who have never played the game it helped me to understand a little bit about what was going on. In the movie that is. The ending is what got me though. I am sure it is obvious but as I said earlier not playing the game I have no idea what the ending was about. If someone could tell me the whole point of that ending and what happened I would be most grateful"

","I probably had an advantage when I saw Silent Hill, having never played the games and never actually viewing a trailer for the flick - I had no idea what I was in for. The acting is highly underrated, especially with the likes of Sean Bean. Radha Mitchell is really coming into her own versatility, and the kid was top notch! The movie is more nightmarish than tense or even scary. It gets under your skin on an entirely different level. The ending is so achingly beautiful and tragic... it left me hoping they wouldn't attempt a sequel, but in learning later on that the film is based on a video game, I know a sequel is inevitable. Now I can hope the sequels don't take the ideas over the top and ruin a good thing...<br/><br/>As for the comments I've read, let me set all my feelings for the movie aside and just say one thing:<br/><br/>1. Grow up, and please engage your brain before posting a comment. Some of what I've read just on the boards for this film alone are enough to subtract from the sum of human intelligence.

","Compare by other movies such as Resident Evil series, Doom, Alone in the Dark and other, by far Silent Hill is the best faithful adaptation based on video games. Christopher Gans and Roger Avary may satisfy all fans video gamer of Silent HIll. It has scary atmosphere, strong violence, good direction and best acting. The difference is only now the heroine is played by a woman/mother named Rose (Radha Mitchell) to create more emotional side of this film. This is the perfect decision. Hands up for Jodelle Ferland, which I think she deliver this movie and more talented than Dakota Fanning (which was very annoying in War of The World, Taken, etc)."

"MaximumMadness","8","0","1","20 August 2006"," ""Silent Hill""- - A more than decent video game adaptation...
","""Silent Hill"" is a film I was not looking forward to. With the recent trend in video-game inspired films, especially those of director Uwe Boll, (""House of the Dead""/""Alone in the Dark""/""BloodRayne"") I had very low expectations for this film.<br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when I saw the movie, and realized it was not just a hollow shell of violence and CGI images, struggling to be scary. The film packs suspense, emotion, and some genuine story.<br/><br/>Rose, a frantic mother, is dealing with the strange night terror episodes of her daughter Sharon. In her sleep, she wanders away from her room, and speaks of a mysterious town she has never even visited before - Silent Hill. Rose, being a get-it-over-with type of person, decides that perhaps the best way to fight these episodes is to visit the town of Silent Hill and find out just what it's connection with her daughter is.<br/><br/>Before arriving, she is in a horrible car wreck, and awakens alone, Sharon missing. She stumbles to her feet and walks into the dark void that is Silent Hill, where she must face horror and risks beyond imagination to save her daughter.<br/><br/>That, of course, is the basic storyline. And while it may seem hokey, in the course of the film, it works. We believe Rose and her struggle to help her daughter, and we understand why she would chose to go to the town and confront what needs to be confronted.<br/><br/>But there are some downsides to the film.<br/><br/>My first complaint is that the film just isn't very scary, but rather is more suspenseful. However, I can understand this. Part of the horror of the ""Silent Hill"" video game franchise is the fact that ""you"" are the main character. It is ""your"" life on the line. When translated to film, we loose this crucial piece of the puzzle. However this can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Another downside is the use of special effects. Several times during the film, we see Computer Generated Images that are just not necessary, or scary. Take for example, a scene where a mannequin-like creature attacks the main character. The CGI work on this scene was alright, but it made the character less threatening. Poor judgment on the part of the filmmakers there.<br/><br/>My final complaint is the usage of the famous/infamous Silent Hill villain ""Pyramid Head"", whom shows up several times in the film. While it is fun for us fan-boys to see him on the big screen, he is without purpose, as his role in video games (""Silent Hill 2"" specifically) is to be a metaphor and contrast to the character of James Sunderland. A metaphor of his sexual frustration, and his sadness, and his emotion towards his wife. It doesn't make sense that he appears in the film.<br/><br/>However, despite these complaints, I found ""Silent Hill"" the movie to be a thoroughly enjoyable, and even very-well-done film in the genre of Video-Game inspired film, and the realm of modern horror/suspense. It is also great for the fan-boy gamers such as myself to see and hear references to not only the video game series, but Komani in general.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who would like a good, mildly creepy, suspenseful ride into oblivion."

A lot of the camera angles and of course the music were so true to the game that i was smiling greatly. The special effects were top notch. I was impressed with the Colin monster. Very cool. No real scares or jolts in this one though. It delivered on the big budget feel, though. At least Silent Hill had a fair shake at being done right. It wouldn't be the same if it was done on a low budget. Or with mediocre actors. I tip my hat to the Silent Hill crew. Now if we could only get a good Resident Evil movie i would be happy."
"snareguydave16","9","0","1","20 August 2006"," Disturbingly similar to the video game
","Usually, when a video game makes the transition to theater, the production is a far cry from the video game, usually having a different balance of good/evil, or a random side story thrown into the mix. This is not the case with Silent Hill. Watching this movie is literally like playing the game for 2 hours. They captured every element of the environment perfectly. It was blatant that the studio tried it's best to be true to the vibe, and it seemed like a respectful attempt to please the fans of the game.<br/><br/>I won't give any details, but I can't give it a perfect score because at points it gets a little cryptic. However, it gets a 9 for doing it unapologetically! Watch it... truly disturbing."

"yurshta","9","0","1","19 August 2006"," This is the type of Horror Movie I would create.
","Horror, Sci-Fi, and Fantasy are the three major types of books, movies and video games I like. I seldom have anything to do with anything else. I have seen thousands of movies, being a bit of a horror aficionado, and I have seen virtually all of them, even B-grade Japanese and Italian creations. Of these horror films, very few stand out, and frankly, most of them suck. The typical slasher film is the most boring, the most overworked theme, and I hate such films with a passion. I love horror movies best when dark, disturbing and possessing a large element of the Supernatural. Certain movies have become huge hits and changed the genre considerably, from the low budget Blair Witch, to the famous Nightmare on Elm Street series, or the Friday the 13th series or the Halloween series. Additionally, I love a good horror spoof, and the Scary Movie series (now with 4 movies out) are the best. It will be interesting if Silent Hill is spoofed in Scary Movie 5, should they make such a movie. Viewing reality as dull, boring, insipid and inherently absurd and stupid, esp. human society, I prefer a book, movie or game that for a short time gives me some respite, some escape from the idiotic modern world and its stupid safe-society laws. Silent Hill is just such a movie that for a short time, takes you out of this boring world and puts you in a world that is like this one, only dark and twisted at the core. A good horror director can make the commonplace frightening or twisted. Having seen so many movies, I'm working on a script now for a horror movie to end all horror movies. A movie that shows that a dark core hides beneath Nature and the Human World. To some extent, Silent Hill beat me to it. For people who tire of the same ol' same ol' teen slasher movies---do horror directors hate teenagers more than other groups?. I can't stand slasher movies and zombie movies because they are so overworked, so boring. I also despise movies where the villains or monsters are made of cardboard: dull, boring and unbelievable. A good Horror movie makes you temporarily believe in the Supernatural, in evil, in the monstrous. If it can't, then the movie has failed. Silent Hill is based on a video games series created by a Japanese writer and have the darkest themes ever put in a video games. For years now Hollywood writers have gotten stuck in a rut and are pushing out the same trash over and over again. Some directors are finding in video games, in comic books, and escapist fiction a cure for the disease of Hollywood normalcy and boredom. In such fiction, anything is possible, any theme is viable, and the imagination is allowed to run wild. I rather like that. Where the typical Horror director is spinning out yet another stupid zombie movie, or slasher movie, the director of Silent Hill gave us a treat for Horror fans, a bit of rain after a long long Horror drought. A few modern films of late have stood out from the crap surrounding them like The Ring, Saw (Inventive theme, I like that), etc. Of these Silent Hill is the darkest, boldest and was probably one of the most difficult movies to ever make due to the extreme attention to detail.<br/><br/>Modern audiences expect a lot, and there is no excuse to ruin a good story by a low budget and lousy affects. The effects in Silent Hill caught me by surprise. I won't spoil it for you, but you can discover the truth for yourself in the Special Features section of the DVD. The movie Silent Hill, tho' is not a movie rendition of a particular video game, but rather a movie that captures the essence of the strange world of Silent Hill. Frankly, my home town is so boring, I think I'd move to Silent Hill for something different. I am strange and dark and twisted myself. This movie was made for me and my kind. Buy it, rent it, steal it. You haven't seen real Horror until you've seen this masterpiece."

","Game-to-Movie adaptation is a new wave in movie business. History of this adaptations is not very long, but we can see a true leaders of it. ""Silent Hill"" is one of the most impressive video games franchise of all time. No one can scare like this game. You can't even go to sleep at night. ""Resident Evil"" and ""Doom"" was simple game-to-movie adaptation, but they disappointed a lot of game fans. ""Silent Hill"" movie makes game fans to play all ""Silent Hill"" games again. Those, who not played this game... they will be very impressed.<br/><br/>Idea of this movie was supporting by a game. A lot of details was from the game. But I wasn't played ""Silent Hill"" games, so this is discovery of the year. Real and another world was showed original. Script is very good. All conversations was like that time atmosphere. Actors acted fine. Even a Sharon/Alessa had different characters.<br/><br/>So, ""Silent Hill"" is a clear leader in game-to-movie adaptations. It's 5 timed better, that ""Doom"" and 3 times better, than ""Resident Evil""..."
"oneloveall","5","0","1","19 August 2006"," Silent Thrills
","Visually, this video game adaptation is spot on at recreating the eerie, detailed stillness and psychological atmosphere associated with this long forgotten ghost town of Silent Hill. Fans of the cult franchise will not be disappointed at the near perfection of recreating some of the morbidly surreal horror fantasy scenes, inspired primarily from the games first installment, ultimately confirming the real star here is the set design. Unfortunately, eerie atmospherics a substantial movie does not make, and like every other video game movie before it (just in a slightly less obvious, better produced way) this port to film is somehow lost in translation. Written by Roger Avary of Pulp Fiction fame, the primary focus on milking everything from the franchise that is visually compelling ends up overpowering the weak plot. Instead of getting a unique storyline to match the unique visuals, the script offers something of a rehashed synopsis of the game's history, which by the time the uninteresting supporting cast predictably relays, most non-fans will likely be too apathetic to care about."
"pukka21","8","0","1","15 August 2006"," deep story, hard to get (?)
","i think this movie is pretty good. i played the game before, and this movie really satisfies me. the set, the soundtrack, the plot were similar to the ones in the game :) although there's some addition/ reduction from the game version but it's a good improvisation :) but i don't know if i'll feel the same way if i hadn't play the game before. cause some people say the story is hard to get. and yeah, i think it needs a little bit concentrating to understand it. i honestly sorta need to analyze the movie a little bit during it. but it was pretty fun. if you didn't play the game maybe u'll get a little confused at first. although i think there's a little bit flaws in the acting and the scenarios. but it's nothing big. it's not a horror movie by the way.. i think the story is deep, COOL soundtracks. it's really worth it :)"
"rotaerc","10","0","1","15 August 2006"," Disturbingingly Awesome!!
","This movie was really disturbing.... Some people will love it and some will abhor it just for that single reason.... (A wonderful family movie, just kidding~ :p) The atmosphere is what really makes Silent Hill.. well, Silent Hill....<br/><br/>It's a dreamy(and sometimes NOT so dreamy) world very similar to ours, perhaps it is our world from some other mirror dimension where the darkest dreams of the convicted innocents roam free....<br/><br/>It is a world with unanswered questions where the strangest of creatures roam about attracted to light and sound. Where the sound of an air raid in the distance screams that the 'darkness is coming'. And the darkness does come....<br/><br/>Some of the stuff you'll get to see are... strangled by barbed wire janitor in the toilet for molesting little girls, a woman ripped of her skin by some monster with a trigonal head by its bare hands, a child burned alive to 'cleans' sin, a nurse losing her eyes and in servitude for who knows how long for just being curious, and religious fanatics ripped apart by barbed wire from the inside out....<br/><br/>Well this is some of the awesomely gruesome stuff you'll get to see. The design of the monsters are slightly similar to H.R.Giger's style and tastefully imaginative and original. The world of Silent Hill is a reflection of the society that used to be, the janitor, the zombie nurses in the hall way, the school and buildings, all before the so called 'apocalypse' tho in truth it's a bunch of fanatics trapped in the darkest dreams of a child.<br/><br/>I would have to say this movie had some lasting effects. The ending is happily? tragic because Rose survives all but never really gets to go back to the real world(our world), so gets to live happily? with Alessa in the ethereal world of Silent Hill...."
"RaeganBeaumont_99","2","0","1","14 August 2006"," Not what I hoped
","Well the best part of this movie was seeing Sean Bean, and possibly the effects of the zombies. It was slow, and the heroine was annoying the whole movie, the cop in the movie who went out of her way to help was killed and that was a huge disappointment. It should have been the other, the ending sucked.. You think one thing until you realize its completely not.. It made no sense it wasn't scary as much as it was drawn out and long.. boring and slow. It could have been better. The acting wasn't so good either. The main character isn't that good and actress anyway but this was bad. They never really have reasons for these things. Don't waste your money here."
"maxthapilgrim","8","0","1","13 August 2006"," Way better then any of the games!!
","OMG!!! This is NOT at all what i thought it would be. No- this is WAY better. Silent Hill is originally a horror computer game for the playstation 2, and like so many other games with a massive storyline, it been turned into a movie. The Resident Evil series did it, the alone in the dark series did it, but Silent hill is the first of them to capture a really interesting story, and a satisfying plot. The actors are great, and you can tell that the director really knew his part of the games characters, and how to get it on film. Well done! As a computergame salesman, i really wanted to see this movie. But after many of the above named from-game-to-movie titles, my expectations was not of the highest. Directors often have little respect for the games story and universe, and often let's own ideas interfere with the game-story. But this one completely took me by surprise. The whole Silent Hill atmosphere is so well kept, that you even recognize most of the locations, identical to the ones in the game. Everything has been captured perfectly, and i can not describe how awesome the visuals and special effect worked in the film.<br/><br/>The plot itself is of the highest quality. The writer really fought, and won, to prevent this from becoming another ""Doom""! The best from-game-to-film so far! BRAVO!!!"
"stephie_what","8","0","1","13 August 2006"," the moral here: hell sucks ass so be nice to your parents
","hello scary movie, well it was certainly freaky enough and bloody enough, and I must say the sound effects of people being burned and the whole nurse scene was unbeatable. But of course during the movie I suddenly had the extreme urge to go to the bathroom not a second after the creepy guy in the bathroom scene I had managed to score a world record on making it to the toilet and my seat in approximately 1 minute. Point in a nutshell, definitely a good buy and and good scare, you'll never be mean to anybody again. Overall however, its not the type of movie to scare you so bad you'll wet your bed when you hear the slightest noise because it's pretty much unrealistic since every thing scary in the movie occurs in hell as opposed to earth-bound supernatural occurrences. Highly recommended if you crave a good plot."
"Yoshi594","10","0","1","13 August 2006"," Silent Hill stays true to the game
","Unlike the resident evil movies where they changed the genre of the games from horror to action, Silent Hill the movie sways towards the game. It even contains music from the game (Why not? the silent hill series has a great soundtrack!).<br/><br/>Those who have not played the game should probably play silent hill 2 first if they want to be familiar with the Pyramid head! Cybil kicked soo much butt in this film and i thought her actress was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>This movie will feel like the silent hill games minus the cryptic puzzles.<br/><br/>This is a must see for Silent hill fans and future Silent hill fans!"
"insomniac_rod","5","0","2","1 August 2006"," Very good for a younger audience...
","There was a lot of hype surrounding this Horror movie. It's based on a popular Horror survival game that came out in 1999, which is one of the best and most scary games every created. The movie adaptation looks and feels like the game, I'd say, exactly the same. The direction is almost a carbon copy of the game's camera angles. That's not a bad thing as die hard fans of the game will love this adaptation. <br/><br/>My problem with the movie is that the events are difficult to follow as there is a lot of non sense information that barely makes sense at the end. If you are not fan of the movie, you will have a hard time trying to figure out what's going on. The movie is filled with CGI gore, ""shocking"" scenes, violence, monsters, etc. But it's never justified their appearance. The effects are good I must admit but that's not enough to consider this a good Horror movie. A little more plot connection wouldn't harm. <br/><br/>Don't take me wrong, I think that this movie is visually stunning but that's it. It's a Horror movie that works only for the eye. It also deserved a PG-13 rating in my opinion which leads me to a conclusion, this movie is dedicated for a younger audience of Horror fans. The visuals are the best feature about this movie that it seems that will become a huge favorite over the years.<br/><br/>Special mention deserves Deborah Kara Unger for looking like the lead female in Broadway's ""Cats""."
"dizzydarkness","9","0","1","25 July 2006"," A good video game movie? Who would have guessed?
","As we all know, movies based on video games aren't always that good. So, as I entered the theater, I reluctantly took a seat, ready to tear this poor movie asunder.<br/><br/>But I ended up really liking it! This movie had a solid storyline, gross-you-out moments, characters with feeling and depth, and beautifully nauseating environments. Even those unfamiliar with the game can thoroughly enjoy the movie. And for those who did play the game, well then, they have unlimited surprises in store.<br/><br/>One can't help but to feel absolutely helpless as they follow in the footsteps of a mother with nothing to lose, and only a flashlight by her side. At every corner, you expect something to pop out and scare the living daylights out of you. Without even realizing it, you'll find your fists clenched and your teeth grinding inside your mouth, as you mentally prepare for the next plot twist or hair-pin turn.<br/><br/>Hold on to your life, and get ready for one ""hell"" of a ride."
"fires599","10","0","1","15 July 2006"," A Gruesome Descent into Hell....
","Being a huge fan of the games, I watched Silent Hill on opening night. And honestly, I've never been so torn about a movie. Part of me loved it-- The part that understood the ashen and rusted beauty and intricacy of the film. The other part of me knew that the casual viewer wouldn't like this film. This is made for the fans of the game. Or at least for fans of the survival horror genre.<br/><br/>Gah, how to describe it all. First off, this movie just revolves on video game logic. The dialogue is cheesy, the actions are incomprehensible, and in the middle of a scene, a person just says a piece of unnecessary explanatory dialogue. As another reviewer said, the dialogue falls into either unnatural exposition or instructional. This was obviously done on purpose to recreate the feel of the game, since Roger Avary (a co-writer of Pulp Fiction) is highly capable of writing normal dialogue. The main character automatically knows that if she gets a key to a certain area, she must get to that area to move the story along. There is even a moment when a level is beat, the screen goes white, and a voice says, ""Congratulations"" followed by a cut-scene. This is as loyal to a video game as humanly possible. This will either make you hate the movie with a passion or adore it. I myself enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Another very interesting touch is that when Rose is running down a hall, the camera quickly switches angles just like in a survival horror video game. (You know, those frustrating moments when the camera angle switches and you find yourself walking into the exact same room you walked out of? Especially annoying when some terrifying creature is in that room.) Oh, and when she's memorizing the map, she keeps saying Left, Right, Left, Left, etc., and someone told me that that's actually a code in the game. I thought that was an interesting touch. Long story short, this movie is as accurate to the game as possible.<br/><br/>And the beauty of the film-- Wow. Just... gorgeous in that screwed up way. The creatures are stuff nightmares are made of. They're vicious and symbolic, meant to get under your skin and creep you out. Its rare that you'll see creatures like this in another film or outside of Silent Hill. Their movements and appearance represent something, though its not used as intricately as it is in the game. And when that siren sounds... A sense of dread sweeps over the audience. You know you're going to descend into even more of a nightmare, the next dimension of hell. There has never been such an ominous sound as that siren. The descent into that hell dimension is gorgeously done. The ash that permanently descends on Silent Hill melts into darkness, then the screen dimly lights up to reveal the walls rusting and melting apart. It's beautifully disgusting.<br/><br/>Oh, and the music, which is taken almost entirely from the video games is at its best here. Akira Yamaoka, the composer, uses these grinding, threatening sounds to make your skin crawl. When the monstrous Pyramid Head appears, the music rises to a grating groan that beats into your head and makes you feel like you shouldn't be there; That it is wrong to be in that room. The games created that effect perfectly.<br/><br/>But then comes the plot. This plot is utterly incomprehensible for those who haven't played the game. Not only that, but it's convoluted. For the first half of the film, nothing happens. Then all the explanation occurs in the next half, and it still doesn't make any sense. Don't get me wrong. This movie isn't supposed to lay everything out for you. Silent Hill is a place filled with clues that make you piece them together into something vaguely comprehensible. If they explained everything in this movie, I would've been very disappointed. The warped world of Silent Hill isn't for those who are out for a quick and gory horror film. It's something to reflect on, to sink into your dreams at night. However, I felt as though some things could've been delivered slightly better in the grand scheme of things. The film drags in some parts, and at a little over two hours, its too long.<br/><br/>This film is not for those that haven't played a survival horror game nor for those who cant appreciate a survival horror game. Its that simple. Christopher Gans set out to make a game FOR the fans-- Screw what the rest of the world thinks, and he did it well. No other director would be that loyal. I'm not going to give this film a rating, since it'll mean different things to different people. 95% the moviegoers are going to despise this film. The rest, who can understand what he was trying to accomplish will love it. Its that simple."
"emilyweiland","7","0","1","15 July 2006"," good, but not quite good enough
","After playing all the released games and hanging around on Silent Hill, forums, I heard that a movie was being made out of (mostly) the first game, from 1999. My first thought was something along the lines of, ""dear god, don't let it be so."" But after seeing the movie, I wasn't nearly as offended as I thought I would be.<br/><br/>I already knew form the trailer that the great music from the games (mostly from Silent Hill 2) was preserved for the movie. The monsters were mostly pulled from the second game as well, which was kind of puzzling considering that their design and actions were so closely tied to the events of Silent Hill 2, not the original that the movie was to be based off of. Once they appeared in the movie, I stopped caring that they were out of context.<br/><br/>All the monsters in Silent Hill are played by people in costume, not CGI (with the exception of the famous cockroaches.) This was very nice, as it just isn't the same with CGI. All the monsters were amazing, all identical to how they appeared in the games (again, with one or two exceptions, this time from monsters not in the games at all).<br/><br/>The plot was... different. I was disappointed that Harry Mason was replaced by Rose DaSilva, and couldn't fathom why they would rename Cheryl into Sharon. It just kind of irked me.<br/><br/>Most of the plot elements came from the original Silent Hill, with a dash of Silent Hill 2 and a few added points.<br/><br/>I was very happy with Laurie Holden as Cybil Bennett, though disappointed with her final scene (NOT how it happened in the game!).<br/><br/>The new-for-movie ending, though an interesting twist, eliminates the possibility of ever having a movie with Silent Hill 3's plot, one of the best of the series. And having the theme from Silent Hill 3 play during the credits was a touch random...<br/><br/>All in all, the movie captured the essence of the game, with spectacular music and visuals, but had a few points of annoyance.<br/><br/>Note: when the IMDb credits list Claudia Wolf of SH3 and Henry Townshend of SH4 as being characters in the movie... pay no attention."
"gigioiaderosa","8","0","1","14 July 2006"," Extremely fascinating!!
","There we go . . . I was so afraid for this movie. I just thought "" Let's hope this ain't a ""The Eye""-like stuff"". The eye was great, but to see a copy of that movie wouldn't have been a great deal of entertainment. I have to admit, this movie is far to be just entertaining. It is built on the honest will to make you very concerned about the characters. Of the survival horror video games transposed into a movie, this is the best. The plot is very thick. You watch Rose and Cybil make her way through the school, the hotel, and you say ""Oh poor girls!! Why the hell those monsters don't leave them alone? I hope all of you freaks just die this instant!"", then, the movie goes on, and I've realized why in Italy we say that ""hell is not as ugly as described"". All of that nightmares you see have an origin. Basically (and here the spoiler), Rose's daughter (Sharon) is very much linked in some way to a girl (Alessa) that, in the 70's, living only with her mom, was pointed out as a witch. The community of Silent Hill decides to burn Alessa, as a witch. Of course, everything is documented with beautiful old-style shots. So everything starts from Alessa's hate, which is in some way perceived by The Death herself (which appears as a mix between Alessa and Samara in ""The Ring""), which decided that ""Her horror (of Alessa) should be theirs (of Silent Hill's community)"". So, the curse on the town begins. Visually speaking, this movie is awesome. The special effects are really the best for a movie of this splatter level, and in more of an occasion, the monsters were as ugly of the ones you can see in the VG ""Doom 3"" (and it's definitely something!); 60% in CGI, 40% of consistent material. Very credible, also helped by the general setting of the movie , which is in the darkness, or into a snow (actually, is ash) landscape. Actors are just fine, the one that had convinced me the less has been Sean Bean, which is always with the same expression for all the movie. The girls have been more various. Soundtrack is ""kinda"" good; there are some holes here and there that I didn't like. But we're speaking in terms of scene, so you can just ignore this ""con"". Direction has been very very good. Great light choices, great shots, excellent dynamism. Monsieur Gans, after ""Le Pacte de le Loups"" has done another great movie. Bravo!!!"

The cinematography was an incredibly close representation of the game play, the story was changed and it actually made a lot more sense than the game, and the ending was inspired.<br/><br/>If you liked the original game, I would hope that you could appreciate how close this comes to it even though many things are different game to movie. It's hard to explain without giving it away, but I thought it was cleverly adapted and well done.

"ozymandiaskingofkings","7","0","1","11 July 2006"," best. adaptation. ever...
","I'm sticking my neck out here... This is the best computer game movie so far. This is, however, not hard considering the competition comes primarily from Uwe Boll and Paul WS Anderson, two men so incompetent I would judge them unqualified to direct a wedding video.<br/><br/>Fortunately director Christopher Gans realised that the survival horror element, rather than the video game element, was the most important aspect (unlike ""Resident Evil"" which, while fairly entertaining bore no resemblance to the game) and for the most part succeed. Now let me clarify here, I haven't played any of the games and so the fact that the plot seemed to border on incoherent may be due to my ignorance, but to me the script seemed to have no third act.<br/><br/>To begin with everything was fine, the dreamlike smoky decay of Silent Hill exuding woe and tragedy whereas the dark alternate world, complete with ash foetuses, contortionist nurses and armless zombies had a real spine tingling menace to it that caused a delightful feeling of panic for the protagonist when the mine siren sounds. Also excellent was the opening in which the protagonist's creepy clairvoyant daughter seemingly stood on the brink of hell itself looking down into a fiery abyss. The films great strengths are its cinematography, beautifully eerie recalling in parts ""The Shining"" and ""Don't Look Now"" as she searches for her lost child, and in particular sound which is sharp and startling (even a car driving through a puddle seems deafening) and really adds to the film's ambiance, as does a melancholic haunting score.<br/><br/>However, much was unexplained to an unenlightened audience. Pyramid Head, a fan-favourite I'm told, seemed inappropriate and even comedic in such a dark film, who he was, what his motives were or why he had a pyramid for a head unexplained. Also, interesting subplots involving a suicide at the mines, a location I would have liked to have seen more of, were dispensed with to make way for a Crucible-esquire witch hunting subplot which seemed totally contradictory against the grimy industrial feel of the town. Had the film been set 100 years ago it would have seemed more plausible but otherwise seemed stupid, as though the scriptwriters just decided to pinch the ending from the ""Wicker Man"".<br/><br/>The notion of alternate dimensions of Silent Hill are interesting as are the twisted renderings of many stereotypical small town locales such as the school, hotel, church and hospital but the rapid movement between these, following clues and retrieving items along the way, is obviously taken directly from the game and instead of creating a feeling of faithfulness gives a rather passive, bored feeling of watching someone else playing the game.<br/><br/>Performance, crucial for creating a convincing horror tale is also lacking as, while Radha Mitchell is quite convincing as the desperate mother, Laurie Holden as a tough by-the-book cop aiding her positively creaks. Similarly, Alice Krieg as witch-hunter Christabel hams it up terribly, making Vincent Price in ""Witchfinder General"" seem understated.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film looks terrific and has some classic horror moments but lacks a strong coherent narrative meaning that it is not as satisfying as it promises. Having said that, the director's ambition and skill should be commended and the film stands head and shoulders above any other video game adaptation.<br/><br/>3.8/5"

So what we end up with is a series of disturbing visuals which are poorly connected.

"roegasu","9","0","1","9 July 2006"," What One Would Expect, And a Little More
","Short put: Silent Hill delivers.<br/><br/>I've never played the game, never even seen anyone else play it. From what I've read here though, and heard from one annoying individual in the theater who kept repeating it, this movie is more faithful to the game than most of the other movies like it out there.<br/><br/>It's what I expected really. And that's a good thing. The effects are awesome, creatures and horror scenes believable. Acting is top-notch and the soundtrack is quite good. There were a few parts where it seemed as if the game-influences demanded a bit too much ""rock"" from the music, something that tends to put me off. But it never really went as far as being annoying, as there was always that good melodic tune to it. There was one tune that I'm still humming, and that happens in like one of every 10+ movies I see in a theater. Meaning like once every year or 2.<br/><br/>Silent Hill manages to be a good, interesting horror movie without the typical angst or over-intensive action to it. It gives you breathers when you need them, and guarantees interesting and innovative action. Action being a subjective term, as this is by no means a movie about some chick who goes in guns blazing. It's all about survival.<br/><br/>The plot is OK and then some, but nothing spectacular. If there's one thing Silent Hill shares with other horror movies, it's that after the original mysticism and whatnot when you finally find out what's really going on, it's nothing that remarkable. You want to believe it's hell on earth, about stakes the size of a universe. And in the end, it's something so small you'd probably find far more hellish places elsewhere on earth with far more bloody histories than this particular town happens to have.<br/><br/>Regardless, horror flicks aren't that common. And the good ones are extremely rare. There's not really anything ""wrong"" about Silent Hill, save for the fact that horror is horror and never quite manages to get to the perfect score of 10 for me. I definitely recommend this movie, it's bloody, and it's gory. But not needlessly so. Few movies these days manage to pique my interest well enough to make me immerse myself as well as I did watching this one. Go see it. ;)"
"gianluca-favaro","9","0","1","8 July 2006"," Brilliant ""inspired to video game"" movie
","Silent Hill: 8,5/10<br/><br/>Let me explain this high vote.I think that, for a movie based on a video game, nothing better could be done. Soundtrack was brilliant, scenery was perfect.I have played all the silent hill chapters and i must say that the movie perfectly reflected the game-play tension and scenery. On the contrary of many video-games-inspired movies like Resident Evil, the director gave a lot of attention to the plot. The only lack of the movie was approx. at the end, when Rose enters room 151 and they explain all the plot in 5 minutes. The explanation was brilliant, but i think it had to be done during the whole movie and not just in the last 10 minutes. I really loved also the moral of the movie, which was already known to me since i played the game. It proves how ignorance and blind faith can take to intolerance like happened with Alessa, who then, thanks to the hate that she accumulated during her pain, manipulated reality at his will. The young girl was very appropriate for the role of Sharon/Alessa. The best ""inspired to video-games-horror"" movie i have ever seen, and one of the top horror movies ever."

","When I went to watch Silent Hill I didn't know what to expect. Now a days people can't seem to create scary films. They either have too much blood or too much action. Silent Hill, however, is the scariest and most intense horror film I've seen. It begins well, throwing the viewer into a situation that has been going on for a while (the girl's sleep walking), and then starts to move at a perfect pace. The town itself brings back all the memories of the game. Probably the best part in the whole film is about 20 minutes in. The whole atmosphere changes from a deserted town to a nightmare world. Walls become cages, objects get warped, and the freakiest babies ever seen try to tear the main character apart. More suspense is added when the air raid siren goes off. It warns the viewer that something is going to happen, something bad. Overall a great film that actually fits into the 'horror' genre. Look out for a cameo from Silent Hill 2 that will be the new villain/creature to fear from now on."

","I'm a big fan of the game, and while the movie's plot differs from the game in key points, that doesn't make it a bad movie.

'Silent Hill' is one of only a handful of movies that really made me uneasy. In fact the only problem i have with it is the ending...like most people.<br/><br/>As far as story discrepancies, there are plenty, but don't be dismissive, as long as you think of the movie as more of a sort of tribute to the game rather than the game playing by itself, you'll love it.

"ian-purnomo","8","0","2","30 June 2006"," Silent Hill, the first video game to be adapted to a movie
","OK, lots of you will surely protest against my statement. Of course there were other movies which were adapted from video games, but as long as I (a video gamer) concerns, all of them only shared the title with their respective so-called adapted video games. I don't even know where to begin with. Super Mario Brothers (what the hell?). Street Fighter (seriously, guys!). Resident Evil (even Dawn of the Dead felt more like the game than that Milla Jovovich movie). Tomb Raider (pretty decent, but NAH!). Doom (Ow guys come on! They only adapted the 3 minutes first person scene). I might have missed the others, but I just can't stand them anymore.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's get back to Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Why this movie is 'video game' to me? It is simply because the filmmakers were faithful to the visual style, the look, the feel and the plot of the game. For those who haven't played the game, Silent Hill games put you in the role of characters who are lost in the town called Silent Hill. Each Silent Hill game has its own character and plot/mission. Therefore if the plot in the movie doesn't have anything to do with the games, it is because that it is kind of 'another tale' of Silent Hill, although the movie version has a lot of similarities with the first Silent Hill game.<br/><br/>Anyone who had played the games would soon recognized that the strange creatures are very much alike the ones in the games. The filmmakers also made a very good compilation of the creatures from the video game series to be featured in the movie. Those creatures did a great job in the movies to be very freakish and out of this world, just like in the games.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the filmmakers implemented some element of the gameplay in the movie and its story. Without giving out anything, there is one point when the main character has to memorize a map in order to reach a specific place. That part surprised me so much; it is because that in the game you actually have to do exactly the same thing as well. There were moments when I played the game that I had to check the map, paused for a bit to memorize it (sometimes I drew myself a simple map), and then returned to control my character. Also, for those of you who had played the game, you'd know that Silent Hill is about finding out clues and sometimes items in order to reach the main goal. And that was also implemented by Christophe Gans and Roger Avary. The main character in the movie had to read some old newspaper articles, asked other characters, and finding things. I think those game play implementation was pretty well done, although there can be more.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, it is quite obvious that Christophe Gans and Roger Avary are huge fans of the game that they pour all their skills to faithfully adapt the game. However, this caused that only Silent Hill players would likely to enjoy the movie fully. I heard some of other viewers who never played the game that they did not really like the film and it was a bit too confusing to them.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I give four thumbs up to the filmmakers. One thumb is for making such a great adaptation. One thumb is for implementing the game play. One thumb is for respecting video gamers. One thumb is for having the Pyramid Head."
"EldoranDark","9","0","2","26 June 2006"," A great movie, but hardly for everyone.
","I think I can understand how many people seem to have a rather poor opinion of the movie. Some previous knowledge about the game series and the world in them is probably necessary to really enjoy it or the events shown may seem rather bizarre, unconnected and way too rapidly evolving. The latter may also seem that way because as far as I know, an hour of the original footage was cut out in order to shorten the movie to two hours. Some may notice that some less significant frames shown in the trailer were cut out from the theatric version and I really hope to see them on the DVD.<br/><br/>If you really want to have a chance to see the movie as it was intended, I'd like to suggest reading up or better yet - playing the games. There's a marvelous world you could discover, chilling with it's dark secrets and fascinating with it's deep plot lines. It would be a shame to miss out on it."

","""Silent Hill"" is just another entry in the video game to movie craze that has been really sweeping our nation in the last 12 years. Directed by Christophe Gans, the guy that brought us the 2001 film ""Brotherhood of the Wolf,"" ""Silent Hill"" tells the story of one woman's journey to find her little girl in the strange and eerie town of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>What really makes this film terrible was the lack of suspense it created, IMO. This has to be the first horror movie ever that I felt never built up to the tension nor even created scenes that would make the audience jump. One thing I will say is that the set direction is very good in this film because it truly looks like a realistically deserted ghost town. The main parts that made the movie lack was it'a less than average acting and it's less than sub par script.<br/><br/>Maybe the reason why I didn't like the film was because I had never played the video game. All in all ""Silent Hill"" was another attempt at cashing in on the video game craze that was started with ""Super Mario Brothers"" some 13 or 14 years ago."
"mm-39","4","0","7","23 June 2006"," video = bad movie
","The last 2 or 3 video game/movies have a bad translation to the big screen. Silent Hill is a prime example. Thin storyline with no character development and an over reliance on special effects. Hollywood has a anti Christian message lately. The Tom Hanks' film and Slient Hill seem to portray Christians as burning or beating, and hurting people. I personally have not seen other groups picked on in this matter, maybe a anti Passion reaction; I know no group is perfect, but the agenda is over the top. The ending came as no surprise, and the viewer sees the plots slow ball coming way too soon. 4 out of 10! Soon to your 99 cent rental on Wednesday. Save your money and watch The Sniper 3 on Spike TV or watch classic pro Wrestling re-runs. I know I would. The summer has been void of any good movies so far. I hope the new Bond film will be good."

","The word running through my head during this entire film was, ""Atrocious"". After we sat through this monstrosity, my brother looked at me and said, ""Well, the popcorn was good."" There are so many things wrong with this film, it's hard to choose even where to begin.<br/><br/>First of all, nobody acts like these characters in real life...hell, nobody acts like these characters in a video game! The acting was terrible -- everybody overacts. Sean Bean would've gone into an utter rage if the restaurant would've said they were out of complimentary toothpicks or mints.<br/><br/>The special effects were incredibly good, but there simply was no script. I got the feeling they created all of these creepy effects shots and then just told the actors to improvise. In the beginning, there was an actual place that was a gas station, restaurant and tattoo parlor rolled into one. I said to my brother, ""It has everything you'll ever need!"" At times, the scenes were so absurd, that I started busting up laughing -- so hard I was in tears.<br/><br/>The first hour, in spite of the absurdity of the story, does have several creepy scenes that weren't all that bad, but during the second hour, the film completely changed with a whole new plot even more insane than the first! I got the impression they could've finished the film after the first hour, but since it needed to be longer, they just threw some even more crappy plot line together. Not even the presence of Alice Krige (Borg Queen, ST:First Contact and VOY), or Laurie Holden (Marita Covarrubias, The X-Files) could save this train wreck. I wasn't even scared once! Save your money and wait for this when it goes on the cheap shelf at the video store, and it's only worth that for the effects. Thank god I used a pass to get in to see this, because if I would've paid to see this stink bomb, I'm sure I would've asked for a refund."

","I've never played the game so my comments would be solely based on the movie. It is a movie afterall, so no offense to the gamers.<br/><br/>For the first hour, I was tumbling down this rabbit hole that seems like no end. When a movie makes me look at my watch more than once for the first hour, something is definitely wrong. However, it was not that bad because if it was, I would have just walked out of the theater<br/><br/>Problem with the movie is that it was not scary, at all. Nothing was. And the pace, oh my. I know the director was trying to slowly reveal the mystery so it was expected but it was done either too slow or simply not arranged well. That is why I was disappointed. When a movie has the potential to be good but ruined by something else, it just frustrates you. Leaving the movie left me with a lot of what ifs because the plot was OK fundamentally, just that the execution didn't give the full effect it should.<br/><br/>Acting was not effective because I don't feel of the charactersexcept maybe the last part with Sean Bean's character. When you don't care about the characters, either they die or they suffered or anything, how can you get into the moment of fear or sadness of the movie. I don't even remember the character's name except maybe Sharon because it was repeated endlessly through out the movie.<br/><br/>The only good thing about the movie were the special effects and probably the biblical reference it made.

I went to this film looking for a horror film, and it was basically some time sitting watching what is essentially a stark, scary dream sequence, following a fairly linear plot, for the most part.<br/><br/>The acting was good to great, especially with the female roles. The woman who portrayed the Motorcycle cop stole the show, from her first appearance. The male lead was written to be a bit too passive, but did a good job with what he was given. Some of the supporting cast were stereotypes, but really I think more writing / development was needed.<br/><br/>Overall, visually beautiful, good acting, the story was weak, and didn't make a lot of sense to me.

"DICK STEEL","7","0","1","8 June 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Silent Hill
","Never cheese a mother off by taking away or threatening her child. We've seen plenty of tough mamas in contemporary movies, and Jodie Foster comes to mind in having personified the tough-as-nails mum in Panic Room and Flight Plan. NO, she doesn't have a part to play in Silent Hill, but the premise, about a mother on a journey to recover her daughter from the clutches of harm, couldn't be more familiar.<br/><br/>And before you dismiss this movie as just another run off the mill video game adaptation, this movie is surprisingly good, in setting up its atmospheric moments. We've had plenty of misses with this genre, and only a few hits. Staying faithful to the setting of the source using CGI enhanced sets and SFX, it took its time to introduce the mystery surrounding Silent Hill, teasing you with long sequences which seem to journey nowhere. Which by then, some of you would have already given up, as you ache to see more of the beasts which go bump in the darkness, only to have an all too quick daylight interrupt the flow of carnage, and having to endure through long moments of silence and basically beating around the bushes.<br/><br/>Then again, it's precisely this hide-and-seek that the movie stays an arm's length away from the usual expectation of action, action and more mindless action. Silent Hill is a very adult adaptation, staying true to the spirit of gaming, with its endless round after round of puzzles and encounters before everything starts to make some sense. Those expecting a splatterfest will be disappointed, as there aren't many. While the monsters and creatures are a sight to behold (they're disgustingly beautiful), most times they get introduced and addressed too easily. Just as you get into the swing of things with a particular beast, it gets hauled away from view, whatever the reason. I dig the spasm-induced dancing faceless nurses, but they're given too little screen time.<br/><br/>It's more mystery than downright horror, basing its theme on superstition and misguided faith on different planes. There're little ""boo"" moments, as everything builds up gradually, adding to the suspense. Eventually, you'll get to the closure, with the big mystery and back story unveiled, adding some gravitas to the movie, and could serve as a springboard to any sequels if planned.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell plays Rose Da Silva, the mom who partners cop Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden) who assists her in the paranormal realm of Silent Hill to track down Sharon (Jodelle Ferland), yet another creepy kid (the other kid's the Anti-Christ in the remake of Omen. These days creepy kids are in!) who holds the key to the entire whodunnit. Sean Bean was wasted as Rose's husband, in a role that is created only because everyone else substantial in the movie is female. His role is actually to accentuate that Silent Hill exists on different realms, with him being in the ""real world"" while the others are trapped in another plane of existence. And of course in movies like these, the acting's nothing really to shout about, since expressions are limited to looking scared and looking bewildered.<br/><br/>It'll take a while before you can scratch past to get to the storyline, as your eyes and attention will be peeling away the layers of beautifully crafted production sets and awesome graphics, and your ears appreciating the music adapted from the games. And with a satisfactory story as justification, this could perhaps see a new beginning to games wanting to make it to the silver screen, if done correctly."
"headfulofghosts126","7","0","1","7 June 2006"," I'm not ashamed to say I liked it... a lot.
","Look, I'm a fan of the games. In fact, they're the only reason I own a PS2. I'm not a big video game guy. But I rented Silent Hill 4 last year and I was absolutely blown away. It was scary as hell and I'd never felt so immersed in a world as I did when I was playing that game. It didn't take long to figure out that SH fans hold the second game up to be the greatest of the series so that was my next purchase. Followed by the first and then the third. Even now, SH4 is still my favorite. Probably because it was my first experience with all of this. The only reason I bring this up is that I think my love of this mythology was essential to getting the most out of this movie. And a dense mythology it is. It would be very ignorant of someone to shrug off SH as being ""just a game"". They spin circles not just around other horror games (man do they make Resident Evil look wimpy) but around most other horror media as well, be it movies, books, etc. They did not follow any of the games verbatim. Which was probably a good choice. And I think all things considered they delivered a very solid adaptation. What you need to understand is that this is a movie made for the fans. And in that respect it is a glorious success.<br/><br/>This IS Silent Hill. This is the town from the games. It's been brought to the screen with astonishing detail. Even those who find faults in the story have to admit the film looks gorgeous. The cinematography and the score are reason enough to give this a look.<br/><br/>This is not a jump out of your seat scream your brains out horror movie. It doesn't aspire to be. This is a film more concerned about instilling you with a sense of uncomfortable dread and making the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end. This is not Scream. This is not Saw. It's surrealism. It's fantasy. And perhaps in some ways it's a triumph of style over substance. But I was too involved in it to care. I was too anxious to see what was waiting around the next corner. There are images in this film that will be impossible to burn out of your brain.<br/><br/>It's not perfect. The scenes with the husband and the cop seemed to exist mostly to pad out the running time. If that subplot had been regulated to just exposition about what happened to the town it would have been more bearable. But there are way too many scenes of them running around in what we know is a safe reality so there's no sense of suspense or danger.<br/><br/>I hear a lot that people didn't understand the movie or that it was too confusing. I could not disagree more. I think once the identity of the girl in the hospital bed is explained so is the entire plot. I also don't feel that the ending is open to interpretation. It was pretty clear to me what had happened. But then, maybe I'm wrong. All I'm saying is that this is hardly the mind trip a lot of people are making it out to be. I think the problem was revealing too much too late. The information should have started earlier and come more frequently. Because I think the first half does get a bit repetitive.<br/><br/>Video game movies automatically have this stigma attached to them. And I can't help but feel that if it weren't based on a game people would be taking it much more seriously. But it doesn't matter, because this was not made for those people. As I said before, this is for the fans. And if you consider yourself one you have no business not seeing this film."

I was disappointed at the reaction of the critics early after the movie's release, but knew if they hated it I would love it. And I did. I give it a 8 out of 10 rating. I thought the main actress did a great job as did all of the actors. And the graphic images were world class. I might have included less of the husband figure and more of the main character exploring rooms in the school or the hospital.

This had the unfortunate result of yours truly having to watch this while being somewhat motion-sick. Not the best way to watch intense gore. I will say this, though: despite my queasiness, I really did scream in fear many times, and I almost NEVER do that in any movie. The last ones that had me cowering so were the Ringu series and Audition.(BTW, I still fear Sadako like nothing on earth.) I watched my friend play all the games before seeing the film, so that did help, but I must admit that I wanted to make that stupid woman stop yelling for her kid every 3 seconds. If I were in an evil town with demons running loose, the LAST thing I'd do is run about making lots of noise. All in all, I give it 7 out of 10.

The fears from the fan base of the Konami's horror extravaganza that the movie version wouldn't fulfill the expectations appeared in each and every gaming forum. Nobody expected this movie would be even a decent one.<br/><br/>Fortunatelly, after watching it, was pleased with the results.<br/><br/>I think the point of view from where you watch this film can change your opinion about it. Looking it from the purist eye of the Silent Hill mythology created in the video game might blur the final work of Gans, as he twisted intelligently some facts regarding this mysterious town. Also, this movie it's not the gore extravaganza that everyone was expecting. The psychological horror, trademark from the Japanese horror films, was present, along with well managed dramas and some suspense included.<br/><br/>Fortunatelly, for the fans, the entire soundtrack from Silent Hill 1, 2 and 3 was present in the score of the film, making present the talent of Akira Yamaoka. The movie just plainly couldn't be as good without the genius of the Japanese composer.<br/><br/>As wasn't the masterpiece of all the video game based movies, Silent Hill goes a step away from the curse of flopped video game films.

","Movie was good in that with most big box office movies with a 2 billion dollar budget you can have stunning CGI and special effects. This movie had that , however there are way too many holes in the plot that can only be explained by guesswork and clues to come up with your own ending. My take was based on a quote from the original game ,"" I get it now. Why I'm still alive even though everyone else is dead. I'm not the only one who's still walking around. I'm the same as them! I just hadn't noticed it before."" that she was already dead just like the people at the church, and when she came home she was still in another reality. It really would have helped if that line was in the movie , which is kind of backwards , things that are really obvious are read straight off in actors lines, and things that are really not that obvious are not even explained or excused. Oh, and I am one of those MST3KER's and it was very easy to make fun of, like the the part when she sees what thinks is her daughter in the corner facing away from her, I could not help but quote the Exorcist when her head starts spinning around, which I am almost predicted they were going to do that, they came really close but must have stopped themselves from stealing that bit. Another really funny MSTK thing to do is when she sees Cybil, the cop, stopping her at the gas station , and then while she is chasing her quote lines from the Terminator. LMAO."

","Good thing someone told me C.Gans directed this flick - after boring me to sleep with Brotherhood of the Wolves I had this coming, tho I was glad Uwe Boll didn't seize the rights for this one.<br/><br/>What makes the games so creepy, yet fascinating is the almost complete lack of any explanation, it doesn't have to make any sense at all, it is just disturbing and absurd. But no, Gans had to make a nice, round story to push the audience through. Here Silent Hill suffers from the same indetermination as Crying Freeman, where Gans just disassembles the freeman's mystic character halfway and then doesn't finish it by not making him whole again with something else. The same side dish story takes away the possibility of the insane yet brilliant movie Silent Hill could have been. It's just like putting plastic arms on the Venus de Milo."

","Silent Hill is an above-average horror drama, which benefits from a magnificent visual style and shocking cgi effects and suffers from a mediocre story with sometimes ridiculously bad dialogue. what does roger avery intend to say if he is having the policewoman say ""looks like there's been a fire here"" when it's crystal clear that the whole damn town has been burnt and ashes is still flying through the air? the side story, which fails to deliver the plot, is so unbelievably unnecessary that you almost feel sorry for sean bean. and radha mitchells character is a joke, doing strange things at the wrong moments, changing moods every 5 minutes and delivering crappy one-liners (plus she's absolutely burning her hand with her zippo!). the story itself has it's up and downs, basically it's good enough to keep the audience entertained, although the ending again is a major yawn. if you have played the game (like I did) you'll be pleased with the music which is almost the same as in the games and with the visualization of the monsters and the town itself. the effects are a mixture between creepy and gory and the final battle scene is pretty hard to swallow. all in all this is a watchable horror movie, compared to most of the junk that flooded the market in the last 3 years. switch off your brain and enjoy the ride."

Criticz and others who didn't understand that movie say that it takes itself to literally for a horror movie. Thatz because (if you've played that game or understood that movie) it not just a ""horror movie"" it'z an experience. Silent Hill is a place of extreme sorrow and despair. It'z so strong that it has opened up that gates of hell. People didn't understand why she took her daughter there, its because when Silent Hill calls you have no choice.

","I will admit that I saw Silent Hill for the first time under a decent amount of duress through a friend's pressuring and insistence that I go. I've never been much for horror films, but I was ridiculously glad I'd seen this one! What a phenomenal cast, to begin with. The casting was sensational, and I was so relieved to not see Sarah Michelle Gellar running about in a blood-covered wet shirt pretending to act when she could never have pulled a role in the film off. Radha Mitchell was excellent, believable enough to be pitied, and a strong actress worthy of recognition. I've always been a fan of Alice Krige and she played an excellent antagonist who actually came to be my favorite character throughout the movie. Deborah Kara Unger was exquisite and frightening, and no one can say enough about the young Jodelle Ferland whose portrayals of an innocent child and a near incarnation of Satan itself gave chills that ran up my spine.<br/><br/>The film was immaculate as far as horror goes. It's impossible to create good, solid horror interwoven with drama these days, but Silent Hill surpassed that obstacle with incredible ease. While the film will never receive all the recognition it deserves, what with mediocre films such as United 93 and the Da Vinci Code overtaking the headlines, true and avid movie-goers will not be disappointed with Silent Hill.<br/><br/>I'll definitely be seeing it over and over again!"

","I have been fan of the Silent Hill game series for years now and I played all the games for several times. I was observing the movie progress since it was announced and I was euphoric about any news that were revealed concerning the movie.<br/><br/>So finally the movie was released here in Germany. I was picking the opportunity and going to the cinema two days after it started running here. The first fifth part of the movie I was impressed but then disappointment came over me. I really enjoyed the visual transformation but I got confused with the story and all that. Then I went out with a quite irresolute look on my face.<br/><br/>But I was thinking about the movie and discussing with so many persons, I don't even know how long. And so I decided to watch it again. Well, I went in very relaxed, drank some beer and tried not to concentrate that much on details. Lo and behold, the movie was much more impressive. I was enjoying the first half so much, I can't even describe. The story was far away from the original but that didn't mind because it was still great. The effects and all the monsters were superb as they could get.<br/><br/>But in the second half the strongest weakness of the movie showed up again. The story was way too confusing to enjoy all the beautiful effects around there. All the important facts were packed into one hour of movie and a normal person gets really overstressed with all that.<br/><br/>So what do we have? An enjoyable movie that is nothing important to normal persons and a great movie that inspires fans of the series to think over all that. I myself am deeply impressed now though I still get excited about all the confusing in the second half. I REALLY do hope that there will be an extended edition that will show some more story in the nightmare world of Alessa. Because that was missing, some cruel tension within all the information.<br/><br/>Watch the movie and like it or don't like it."

Its about the imagery and the camera angels that follow just above the actor. You can't see whats ahead of them and which they (for lack of a better word) stole from silent hill 1. They replaced the male character from the game and added a female lead instead. Which made me think that the movie was going to be all 3 movies in one.

","I'm not entirely sure how I felt about this film. I thought it started off pretty decent, with an interesting premise and atmospheric visuals. Unfortunately, the poor thing just dragged on and on, like a puppy with a broken leg that wants to be shot. The build-up didn't amount to a whole lot more than a plethora of nightmarish, ghoulish visuals. Granted, the visuals were cool and all, but there was very little explanation for any of it, and too little of a ""story"" to hold much of it together. This movie is about the equivalent of entering a haunted house: while you're in it, it can be fun and spooky, but as soon as you're out, you realize how meaningless and forgettable the experience was. I suppose I would recommend this on DVD, but only if you rent it from the .99 bin at Albertsons, and aren't expecting to get your socks knocked off. Good luck!"

","Personally i didn't feel that the movie was perfect. A perfect video game/ comic book rendition has yet to be created. For us gamers/comic book readers that look at these films and think, ""How badly are they going to crucify this one...."" I think this movie wasn't THAT bad. Yes the acting was dry, the plot was weak, and the Husband's role was rather pointless. The special effects were very well done, the creatures stayed true to the game series, and the environments were 100% believable. Hollywood has a good way of putting a spin on certain franchises that will allow them to make a quick buck from die-hard fans and fans of the genre alike. With this movie as IMDb says in the trivia this was done with the husbands character. But my stance is that at least they didn't TOTALLY f&@# it up...it was decent for a Video game movie and I think it may only TRULY appeal to fans of the game. But it's really a step in the right direction for game/comic book movies. Video Game movies may only be a step behind great Comic Book translations like Spiderman and Sin City....and i'm just happy to see progression. I won't deny that I wish Silent Hill was done AFTER this progression.....but it was done decently at least...hey look on the bright side...it could have been done by Paul WS Anderson...he's a GREAT! director....."

The special effects are flawless- there's not one bit where I was like 'Hmm that looks a bit sh*t'. And Although I'm not a big special effects buff, I cant actually remember the last time I said that about a film. The story was decent, and nicely faithful to the game. The acting was pretty good, but it is the films visual style that left me in awe. The cinematography is superb, with some awesome camera movements, and the lighting feels like your playing the game its so faithful. The music was f'ing brilliant, the type of sh*t you hear and you're just like 'That would make an awesome sample'. I got scared by this film but still had a huge grin for most of the films 125 minutes.

Sean Bean is used to minimum effect and the exchanges between Rose and the cop are pretty forced. Some of the CGI is pretty damn dodgy, particularly in the opening scenes although it does improve as the movie goes on. It's worth a look, but only if you're a fan of horror movies, or of course the game.

"razedown","7","0","1","13 May 2006"," Loss of reality and destruction through faith
","For the most part, the film has stayed with the game's basic conception of Silent Hill, and the characters who give the town its essence which fans of the game would highly appreciate. With good cinematography, especially with the Otherworld scenes, the film can boast its aesthetic quality, with all the monster/character designs and production to boot. And the industrial music that accompanies the movie almost throughout the film adds up to the disturbing atmosphere of the movie. I especially liked how Alessa killed the antagonist and the whole townspeople, and the eeriness of the Janitor, as well as the nurses.<br/><br/>But, the critique: there was a sort of languidness with how the actors portrayed their characters, and honestly the main antagonist was the only one note worthy. How Alessa told the truth should have used other ways of telling it than in an expository scene... and the script, well some are quotable actually, the rest seems unfit for such a poetic and disturbing ""atmosphere"". Rose, to boot, seemed like an automaton who just kept on ""following those clues"" without consideration or doubting said clues. And I honestly still don't know what the Pyramid Head is doing in the movie, since majority of the monsters are given symbolisms.<br/><br/>But to an extent, the film gives the idea of letting the audience think and/or interpret the film (especially with regards to the ending) just like in the games, as well promote critical evaluation of the characters. It is not one of the greatest films, and probably a lot would be disappointed, baffled or humored; but as the film's main point: it's about loss of reality and the destruction/power through and of ""faith"" - and actually good at that."

They seemed to rush to get to the point and left a lot out in the beginning that was sloppily placed throughout the movie to connect events. I had a mindset that the movie adaptation wouldn't be as detailed as the games but I was surprised at the total lack. Overall it was a good movie and the visuals were great but what about the ending?

","I would say one of the most toxic kisses of death a movie can have is 'based on a video game'. I mean, let's be real here, video game plots suck. They suck because they don't have to be intriguing, most games the object is simple = shoot the sh*t out of the bad guy. That's it. I mean, some video games have good plots, but that is a good plot for a video game, not for a movie. 'Silent Hill' is a perfect example of this. It doesn't make much sense but when played as a video game it doesn't have to. When watched as a movie it sure as sh*t should! I had a lot to gripe about while watching this tiresome exercise in nonsense.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot is terrible, like I said before. I was having a hard time getting everything, because even at the end they didn't explain anything. The ""twist"" of the movie made absolutely no sense at all and defied all logic. The acting was another 'eh' quality about it. I usually like Rahda Mitchell (Pitch Dark, Phone Booth) but in this she just plain stinks. Sean Bean is good as her husband but he has a very brief role, and Laurie Holden is just plain awful as the ""bad-girl"" cop. Alice Krige makes a nice wack-a-doo religious cult villain, but she always plays that role (see Stephen King's 'Sleepwalkers'). One very positive thing I can say about the film is the visual effects are wonderful and dare I say, f*ckin' awesome, but everything else in the film is out of whack.<br/><br/>I do not recommend 'Silent Hill' to see in the theatres. If you are a horror buff, I recommend waiting for video, but if you are like me and aren't too into videogames or horror films, don't even bother looking at the movie poster.

The girl I took to see it, though, thought it was VERY scary, so it's really just a matter of what you think is scary.)<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to this film, and was both disappointed and pleased after seeing it. On the one hand, I was glad they did such a good job turning the game into a film. On the other hand, as a movie, it just wasn't very good.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie to everyone. If you want to see a horror flick, this is probably a pretty good choice. If you are a fan of the video games I'd recommend it. If you want to see a good movie, this probably isn't for you. If you're a HUGE fan of the video games and know every in and out of the story and the characters, seeing it may just anger you.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the, if not the, best video game to movie adaptation I have seen yet (I thought Doom did a pretty good job as well) If you look at it as a movie by itself, without it's video game heritage, its visually very appealing, but can't stand up on its own."

","A decent scary movie, with a good twist ending, it is not often that I don't have the entire thing figured out half way through, but this surprised me. Not on par with the Ring scary, but it had its moments which made you hold your breath and jump. I walked out thinking ""Now that wasinteresting."" The monsters were interesting and the set even more so. Visually there is a lot to look at. The 2nd female lead is unnecessary to the over all plot, and seems out of place some how. The performances are very good especially the young girl. All in all a decent horror flick worth seeing on the big screen. The lighting will make it hard for DVD living room viewing as it is very dark though half of it."

","I don't think I am this movie's biggest fan. I seriously wanted to get up and leave the theater after a short time it was that bad. Then later I wanted to leave again and then later I had a strong need to leave again.<br/><br/>But I toughed it out just to see the ending and endure along with the rest of our audience the groans and ""what in the world?"" moments. At least I wasn't alone in my groans. I wish we'd just gone to see RV at least that had Robin Williams and we knew it was gonna be stupid.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING: Overall the premise of the movie is very cool and unique. The effects were good and it used some really great techniques to get the dream-like state through to the audience. But the little girl's acting was poor, I cared none for the other characters except some crazy chick that came along for about 15 minutes in the movie. I felt the climax was eh. and the ending really left most of the audience annoyed to say the least. There were also a few GAPING holes in the tale, the one that bothered me mostly was the Sheriff. (why didn't he age?) I thought it was cool how the Husband sensed his wife's ghost around him and how things in the real world would move as she went through the area. I also like Sean Bean. (makes my happy) When the cop made her appearance someone in the theater actually said out load ""Who dresses like that?"" It was priceless.<br/><br/>Over all our conclusion was that the characters all died in the crash and since it was in this possessed purgatory of a place ended up suspended there with the other seemingly condemned souls. However, it seems the bodies weren't anywhere with the vehicles so there was another gaping hole as to, well were they dead or trapped in a alternate universe/reality with their physical bodies.<br/><br/>My opinion was this movie was too long and boring to be worth seeing. There were some really neat and disgusting monsters, the cinematographic style and the dream-like quality of the filming, at times, was really unique and inspired. Effects and Cinematography Great! Story and acting forgettable and generally quite uninspired.<br/><br/>Overall, most people I've run across have loved the film, and most movie critics felt it left much to be desired. This time I wish I'd listened to the few movie critic reviews I read, and saved my money."

","As a fan of the games, I was very happy with Gans' interpretation of the series. Visually, this movie was fantastic. The creatures looked awesome and the environments were fantastically creepy. The story was fairly cohesive, although some prior knowledge of the characters and plot lines helped me follow it a bit. I hope this one does well enough for a sequel. It will give them the opportunity to do more of what they got right (mood, atmosphere, creature effects, etc.) and improve on the stuff they didn't do so well (dialogue, some of the acting, etc.). Overall, not the most frightening movie ever; it's more of a ""what the hell is that thing?"" kind of excitement when the next demon appears. I can definitely see where a sequel would take the story... I hope it happens!"

","Contains spoilers The movie was pretty good. the first 30mins is god awful definitely, but it progresses better and better.... The creatures range from the old games SH 2 etc. Silent hill the movie is for me and some others i know a movie that actually goes with the plot. in a way, its turned around. 9 - 10 from me the negative point is due to the daughters acting She doesn't stop being so dull, but its okay. i guess its because' the movie is already scary for her. the yellow god creature is one of the coolest looking monsters in the movie next to the pyramid head which is my favorite. If you don't know anything about he games, you can buy them for PC or PS2, Silent hill 1 came out for PS in 2000. +. with the release of the game spawned a new area of survival horror in a tremendous way!"

","I can't believe how badly this movie has been slated, and under voted.<br/><br/>Heres a PROPER review from a true hardcore silent hill fan, and of age instead of immature bash. We all remember following old Harry down those foggy alleyways and bloodstained rusty hotel corridors, now is the time to experience it on the big screen. The gore, the surreal nightmaristic creatures which pay the series dear respect. Nurse, zombie child and pyramid head to name a few. There is even a scene which strongly represents The Room, with the ""Victim"" coming alive from a death scene.<br/><br/>A cast of not so well known actors and actresses was probably the only flaw if one must pick and choose, from a fan's point of view of course. I will first state a few things : 1: If you haven't played any of the Silent Hill games, you wont have a clue who the most symbolic character of the whole franchise is, Pyramid head. He is the sword wielding guy with the metal triangle for a face. Fans of the game will recognise his appearance, brutality and down right coolness. Tearing skin straight from the muscle and bone of a defenseless cult member to name one of his appearances. I hear all the fans thinking how typical of PH.. and damn right! All the games have small relativity to the film, including camera angles, monsters, music and just symbols in general. As a horror film it tends to stay away from such ""loud drum BOO"" type scares that are so overused in the industry today by sticking true to the series with down right creepiness, mood setting music, tasteful blood and guts with a faint but sincere and brutal ""WTF?"" factor.<br/><br/>Fans of the game will NOT be disappointed, others will still be able to enjoy the story but will probably not understand most of it, and some scenes will be confusing.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to all true Hill fans out there."
"malmacar","7","0","3","3 May 2006"," Very Good , but flawed
","I was initially interested in this movie based only on the fact that I was a big fan of Christophe Gan's previous film Brotherhood of the Wolf. So I did have high expectations and I'm glad I read quite a few positive and negative reviews across the net before I finally saw this. So what did I think? Yes I quite enjoyed it, not the best film ever and it does have its flaws. The flaws for me were some of the dialogue was a bit dodgy but it didn't detract too much from the film and Sean Bean's accent-he should have just stuck with his normal English accent as it was all over the place,but his performance was convincing other than that, and I like the way his scenes lead into the end of the film which was subtle and quite a sad ending. The creatures, set design and photography were outstanding for a horror film,the film oozed atmosphere and dread although not outright scary,lets face it I don't think there is barely any horror film nowadays that truly scares me, for me this film really succeeded in drawing me into the world of silent hill and absorbing me into its hellish dark and nasty atmospheric misery. I liked the explanation section of the film,again nicely shot and downright creepy . I think I will need a second viewing as not being a gamer I was a little muddled by some bits and although this did not detract from the quality itself,I see how some people saw this as a reason not to like this film. I would cautiously recommend this to anyone with an open mind who wants to see something that is original,different from the usual teen slasher horror thats out there,you wont be disappointed."
"especialk8104","9","0","1","3 May 2006"," Root for the bad guy!!
","This was, by-far, one of the best scary movies I've seen in a long time. It resembled a TOOL video. It had all the matching elements, twitchy dead people with sharp pointy weapons, smoldering tar babies, fire, blood, and the occasional disemboweled corpse or almost corpse anyway. The build was quick and long lasting. I found myself questioning the plight of the characters at the end of the film. The ending perplexed me as I tried to piece together the circumstances that lead to such a conclusion. There was also a bit of subtext, a quality you don't often find in thrillers. Such as, the lengths a mother would go through to save her child, was evil really evil or was were the ""good"" really bad...etc. I really liked the predominantly female cast. It added a greater emotion to the film, another rare trait of thrillers. Also, women can be far more vindictive, harsh, cruel, evil, than men, it's just in our nature. My only issue was the choice in costuming for the female cop. Her wardrobe was a bit distracting. Her skin tight leather pants and huge chest didn't really say authority, more like stripper. Don't get me wrong, she was hard core and kicked arse but her attire made her less believable as a police officer. I highly recommend this film."
"DoctorBunsenHoneydew","4","0","3","3 May 2006"," Weak film, weak acting, poor editing, great visuals.
","This film brings around the old adage that a good story doesn't equal a good movie. I guess, when it comes down to it, we should revamp that to ""a good video game doesn't equal a good story."" While loosely adapted from Silent Hill and Silent Hill 2, mostly all you find is the feel of the games in the film, and no quality content. This movie, as one other reviewer stated, just got worse and worse. There were no redeeming moments for the actors (note that I said actors, not characters) after the first ten minutes, and every scene was more poorly developed than the last. This means, as was previously stated, that EVERY scene you watch is , as yet, the worst scene in the whole movie. It just keeps going like that all the way to a shoddy, rather hastily thrown together ending not at all congruent with the quality typical to the Silent Hill video game franchise's plot sequences. Furthermore, the addition of Sean Bean's character at the last minute just to balance the lack of male characters in the film does not help to do anything but muddy the waters as Bean does his best to act as a strange version of a Greek chorus with no frame of reference to the action that is actually significant. BAD BAD BAD. The only good thing about this movie are the visuals, and I can say the same thing of the House of Wax remake, and we all remember how that turned out.<br/><br/>Rent it from blockbuster, but NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU LOVED THE GAMES, do not go see this in theaters."

"mb_webguy","6","0","2","2 May 2006"," Visually stunning but ultimately lacking
","If I were to rate Silent Hill purely on its visuals, I'd give it an 8. The special effects, while not the best I've seen, are well done and support rather than dominate the film. The sets evoke an appropriate sense of otherworldliness and dread. Make-up and costuming are also very effective in contributing to the general ambiance of the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Silent Hill is yet another example of a movie with an abundance of style but lacking in substance.<br/><br/>While the visuals and soundtrack instill an eeriness to the movie, the plot and acting fail to follow through with the movie's promise. While for the most part Silent Hill avoids the cheap scares of slasher flicks, it also fails to provide the terror of a good thriller. The manner in which the history of the town and background of the story is presented feels contrived and a bit forced. The story meanders somewhat aimlessly following the main character (played by Radha Mitchell) on her search for her daughter through the streets and abandoned basements of the ghost town of Silent Hill. One tenuous clue leads to another, ultimately revealing the buried secrets of the town and a final confrontation with its dark forces and a somewhat ambiguous ending (which some, no doubt, will claim a tribute to the multiple alternate endings of the games on which the movie is based). The manner in which the final revelations just before the climactic showdown are offered is so trite and jarringly disparate in presentation from the rest of the movie that it shreds any remaining suspension of disbelief to which the audience might be clinging.<br/><br/>The acting -- from actors I normally respect -- was also a disappointment. Radha Mitchell doesn't quite convey an adequate sense of terror and desperation for her situation, Sean Bean seemed more concerned with attempting (and failing to produce) a New England accent than with finding his family, and Kim Coates seemed unusually bland in his role as the local sheriff.<br/><br/>And yet, Silent Hill still manages not to be a *bad* movie. It's creepily entertaining, and its visuals are spooky enough to haunt your dreams for a few nights even if its plot fails to instill nightmares. As long as you keep your popcorn handy and your expectations low, you shouldn't be too disappointed. Heck, you might even stumble into a goosebump or two."

","great movie for anyone who needs a revival of the horror genre. i played the 2nd and third game and the story line for almost all the games was incorporated in some way. GO INTO THIS WITH AN OPEN MIND and try to listen to what the characters are saying and pay attention to the scenes to understand what the REAL, ALTERNATE, and OTHER or DARK silent hill are. Radha Mitchell does a great job of playing a female version of Harry Mason, the main character from the first game, however the actress playing Cybil Bennet did not do a very good job in this movie in my opinion. her acting was very cheesy in my opinion. Sean Bean is a favorite actor of mine and it was refreshing to see him in a Good guy role for once and although his character is a little unnecessary he did a great job. Great movie! GO SEE IT!"

","Love the video game series, played them all, now time for the movie. Like Resident Evil and Doom - the movie does a decent job of keeping elements from the game, certainly better than Doom manages, anyhow!! Some ropey acting and wardrobe from the ye oldy cult people - please remind me why we needed to see them - felt like a bad episode of Startrek Next Generation - this ruined the film for me - direction was also very average and for me the films only redeeming factors were the ""coming of the Dark transformation"" and SH style ending!! If this were made by the Japanese (like the Ring etc) and tweaked quite a bit, this could have been a belter of a movie, i never really had the feeling of dread you get from the games!! Unfortunately this is a Hollywood production (sigh) and like so many other video game adaptations is full of cheese, cheddar and the inability to create real class - when the original story is very weird but highly credible!! Oops i didn't mention the CG - WHAT was going on with the first ""lurker"" monster - 1. Why did they look absolutely awful and 2. Why were they glowing???

As Rose ventures through the dimensional horror town of Silent Hill in search for her daughter, she encounters mutilated corpses, the living dead, swarms of cockroaches, Pyramid Head, squealing, mutated abandoned babies and ""regenerator like"" corpses.

"Trangor","8","0","1","1 May 2006"," Silent Hill - A Disturbing Film
","1st off this movie is not everybody's cup of tea. It is genuinely creepy in a nightmarish way. The scenes are fairly powerful and tolerating them will require an inured psyche or a jaded one. Indeed one wonders about the many reviewers who said the film was not scary.<br/><br/>I did read a few reviews before seeing the film. I can say I was drawn to the film having been exposed to the computer game (Silent Hill 4 for PC). I never did finish the game, principally from not wanting to spend the long hours associated with playing video games in such a ghastly environment. If 'you are what you eat' well then  <br/><br/>But the film seemed like it could be an interesting diversion, particularly if the producer had managed it well. And my first impression was positive. After checking IMDb, indications were that the film had received a high number of favorable responses. I don't recall the exact number but it was in the high sevens on a scale of 10. At that point it seemed there was reason to go. Imagine my surprise a few days later when, after discussing my intentions to see the film with a friend, I am directed to the Rotten Tomatoes site where the film is slated (ranking 2.5 out of 10). A closer look showed that this was the 'critics' rating, the 'users' rating was in the 7's. Well, not being a fan of professional critics, I set out to read some reviews (on IMDb of course).<br/><br/>Since the 'Hated it' reviews generally provide the most amount of insight (when they provide any), they were first. The gist of them seemed to be that the acting was poor. Bad dialogue was a close second. There were a lot people very upset that the dialogue did not measure up. This was rather mystifying since dialogue in horror films almost always sucks when it's not outright comedic. Some folks were angered by the ending of the movie and this is a complaint for which I usually have a lot of sympathy. There were also a lot of rather snide remarks about the film not being scary or 'little girls not being scary anymore'. Besides being unhelpful, the way they were phrased made one curious about the writers.<br/><br/>Checking the positive reviews they almost uniformly praised the quality of the adaptation and the cinematography. There were also comments about the poor quality of dialogue and plot flow. After seeing the film I can say that I agree with most of them. By the time I had finished checking reviews, I had learned the nature of the ending by catching a spoiler or two. Surprisingly, it did not ruin the film for me, I still wanted to see how it came out. It did remove the ending as a potential issue. Watching movies (like politics) is a game of expectations. If the audience's expectations are too high, even a decent film is bound to disappoint.<br/><br/>The Film's Impact:<br/><br/>The core issue is that whatever elements and effects the director, Mr Gans, did take from the game are adapted and implemented almost flawlessly  creating a genuinely scary and disturbing experience over much of the first 1/2 to 2/3s of the movie. It is true that during the last portion of the film it hitches and sputters a bit as a back story and some rather crude caricatures of villains are hatched to fill out the plot. The storyline created to fill the world of Silent Hill doesn't really mesh well and I sympathize with some reviewers' disappointments. However, if clumsy, the plot line serves and so is not a fatal flaw. The same comment applies to both the acting and the dialogue.<br/><br/>The director does not use all of the creepy elements of the game. In a way I was relieved that he did not add (for example) the ceiling crawlers to the movie version. The movie was scary enough and, though it would have added much to the surreal nature of the movie, it would have also taken away from the aspect of the female lead as he chose to have that actor play it (ie. limited combat ).<br/><br/>Lastly, some advice, don't see this movie if you can't stomach the fright. Some of the scenes (walls weeping blood, mal shaped human forms) are quite intense. You just might not want these images inside your head. I do accept that some of the reviewers may have found the film not scary - simply because of the variability of human experience. What scares one may not affect or even amuse another, etc. But then, this film was not amusing.<br/><br/>The director did shortcut the exploration of Silent Hill, the clues, etc. The eerie radio cueing is only used in one scene with a cell phone substitute. But the issue is not what was left out but how the director succeeded with the elements and sets he did use. This is a horror film that is different from the rest, at least until the final portions of the film where it is wrenched into sort of a standard plot. Even then it keeps its differences. Silent Hill may fade at the box office but it won't be forgotten."
"Hamwise","6","0","1","1 May 2006"," If you like the games, you'll like the movie.. if not...
","Silent hill is a decent film, and it draws heavily on the imagery and the atmosphere of the computer games. Fans will notice the little touches - the music is straight out of the game, and some of the cinematography is very reminiscent of the way the camera would work in the game.<br/><br/>The story has the obvious parallels, but what I particularly liked was that it was not cut and dried - just like Silent Hill should be. Ambigous to the last.<br/><br/>If you don't like the games, or don't know them, then you will probably find whole sections of the film a boring chore - they way that the darkness is brought into the film is clever, but not as scary as it should be. To be fair, I don't see how it would have been possible to avoid the Darkness comes, goes, comes, goes, comes, goes thing. I just got the feeling that if it was niggling me, then it must really be getting to everyone else.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the acting is fairly wooden, the plot is just about acceptable and the effects are good.<br/><br/>As far as Game to Movie goes its the best I've seen - and its still only getting a 6."

","I'm one of those people who has never played the Silent Hill games in my life. I went to see this movie with an absolute fanatic of the games so she could explain some of the finer details of the plot {plus I needed someone to grab a hold on at the really scary bits XP}. I have to admit I never expected the movie to be this good. The visual effects are amazing and are put to excellent use, especially at the beginning of the nightmare. The psychological suspense that the Air Raid Siren brings when it sounds to alert us to the darkness is absolutely brilliant and gave such an adrenaline rush that I had to walk it off for half an hour after the movie had finished {I'm going to get really nervous any time I hear the local foundry siren go now}.<br/><br/>The acting, I felt was very well done, and the fact that the actress playing Rose portrayed a distressed mother looking for her child in a nightmarish town very believable. The subplot involving the police officer and the husband was also very well done, though I can see how it might irk some movie-goers.<br/><br/>What happened near the climax of the movie was very gory, but, again, very well done both visually and psychologically, though I feel they could have left what happened to the fanatic church leader off-screen.

"babapepsi12","9","0","1","1 May 2006"," A horror film that makes you think
","I've been a fan of the Silent Hill games since the first one came out. They're practically one of the only few video games titles I ever play anymore. The thing I loved about the Silent Hill games was not just the amazing graphics, gameplay, concept, and strategy of the game, but the main thing I loved the most was the thought put into the story lines. When you look at this series, it's amazing how far video games have come. You're practically participating in a movie when you play these things. As a fan, I've always had the utmost respect and dedication to the Silent Hill games.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was very impressed with this film adaption of Silent Hill. Walking in, I'm one of the toughest critics of video-game based movies. I know, as everyone else does, that most of them have been so horrible. Something happens when the film crew tries to transfer what's on the game console to the silver screen. In fact, I considered Resident Evil to be the biggest disappointment of them all. So as you could see, although I was aware of the potential of a Silent Hill movie, I assumed it would be wasted like most other opportunities.<br/><br/>I was wrong.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with what Christopher Gans did with Silent Hill. Since he was such a fan of the series, I should've given him more credit walking in. I regard this as one of the best Horror/Scary movies ever produced (let alone best video game adaption). Because unlike most other horror movies, where 90% of them don't even have a plot, let alone are either too cliché, not really scary, or are just plain dumb, this one goes the extra mile to deliver you a frightening, mysterious, nightmare experience. It's a story that uncovers slowly as you progress, covered in mystery and amazing graphics that would make you scared half to death if you put yourself in that situation.<br/><br/>As a video game fan, I believe most other fans will be very satisfied when they see how close Christopher Gans brought the concept to life, as well as sticking close enough to the original story as possible (at least as close as you could ever expect for a video game adaption).<br/><br/>As a movie fan, this is one of the only horror films that has ever entertained me from beginning to end. Unlike most horror films, this one makes you think. It's not a bunch of cheap slashings with lame characters and stupid humor. It reads like a mystery novel that makes you afraid to turn the next page. And if you really like the movie, you should play the games to get the full effect.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to Christopher Gans on a job well done that did way more than exceed expectations."
"piemonkey2","7","0","1","30 April 2006"," This movie is for gamers
","I am a fan of the silent hill video games and would like every one to see it. BUT, I believe this is a movie ONLY FOR THE FANS. I went to see this with 10 people and only 2 of us liked it. This is because they were fellow gamers. We all appreciate the subtle parts of the movie that makes it feel like they recreated the game for the big screen. I can understand why any regular moviegoer (as in didn't play the game) would dislike or even hate this movie. It makes no sense to them and is not scary. I have watched many people leave the theater before the movie ended and I knew they didn't have any silent hill background. WHYExactly do I like this movie? This movie was a recreation of the entire silent hill areas played in the game especially in the beginning. I felt like I was playing the game once again on an enormous screen. From the town to the school to the alley way where rose was first attacked was near perfectly reproduced. As for the story line I did see faults among it including A VERY BAD ENDING. Though if you understand the silent hill world the story makes sense. Though this takes much time reading forums and playing the video game. I appreciated the small details in the world of silent hill also such as the hopscotch game drawn on the ground during the school scene. It had the typical 1,2,3 setup in the boxes but the top was labeled heaven while the bottom was labeled hell. This is a reference to one of the darker things that children did in silent hill. Countless other things can be noted. As for the bad things in silent hill, Sound was very nostalgic but not nearly enough. They did not use the booming rusty gear sound not nearly enough. The sound that I believe is the scariest in the games. Also, the end was terribly corny. In all I would give this film an 8/10 for GAMERS while a 5/10 for NON-GAMERS."

","OK~ I understand why some people disappoint this movie, just not many monster(maybe, the ones people like in the game) scenes, not many bloody frames(perhaps, people have gotten used to the cruel act in some horrible movie), and several nonsense plots(possibly, people, used to thinking so, prefer the movie proceeded in the straight and logical way to in implicit and confused way).<br/><br/>However, if people think except for the above cognition when watching this cinema, to consider a adaptation movie from TV game, I believe it indeed does the best! The atmosphere, the sound effect, and confusing plot surely inherits the essence in the game, which has you uncomfortable greatly, and they call you to mind and ponder over it again and again!"

","I read a few of the reviews and talked to a few friends of mine that had seen this movie, getting mixed, but mostly negative remarks. Some said it was laughable, some said it was boring, some said it was actually pretty good. Bottom line is in my opinion this is a very good film.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was perfect, the creatures were dead on, and the story was definitely Silent Hill quality. Some of the acting was kinda corny, but so was some of the acting in LoTR, but I didn't complain for that one. Watching it from the perspective of a fan I was pleasantly pleased with the outcome. The gore level was about what I expected, there was one part in the movie were I got confused as to how something happened, but I wont say what, but I might have just missed something.<br/><br/>I could however, see how people not familiar with the Silent Hill universe might be confused or slightly annoyed with parts of the movie, but it all connects in order to make sense in the end, which is how the games were generally built to be.<br/><br/>So if your a fan of the games its a must see, if your not but you enjoy good story driven horror story its for you as well, however if you generally don't like horror movies or could care less about having to think a little about whats going on you don't bother going to see this movie."

I found the movie more comical than scary. My husband wished all policewomen dressed like the one in the movie. Some of the ""scary"" characters just looked like people with limps. The nurses in the hallway looked like sexy Thriler dancers. The only part that made my husband jump was when she bumped into the trashcans. Overall, this one could have waited to be viewed on DVD.

","I am a huge fan of the silent hill franchise of games, and I was so excited about the movie, especially since the look and the sound in the trailers seemed so true to what made the games so great. Because of that, I expected greatness, and a feeling that matched the vibe the games so skillfully send across. I did not find it. What I found was a deficit of psychological scares, a multitude of gore, merely for gore's sake, and a film untrue to the spirit of the game. I know some people were genuinely frightened by this film, and I guess I can understand that, sort of. I think, however, that many fans of the game will be sorely disappointed by the film. The attempts to throw in scares that would be familiar to gamers (i.e., Pyramid Head) seemed to be just that: thrown in. There were holes in the plot big enough to put my hand through, the end was unsatisfactory, and the gore was just pointless. In my opinion, despite the fantastic look of this movie, the feeling was just all wrong. Sigh. What a letdown"
"dj_bassett","Null","0","1","30 April 2006"," A Decent Stylistic Exercise
","People who complain about the plot certainly have a point, it makes little sense. But a movie like this is not really about ""making sense"", it's about delivering trippy imagery. On that basis alone I can recommend this -- while not especially frightening, it's incredibly nifty to look at. If you liked HELLRAISER you'll probably like this.<br/><br/>There are nods to the video game roots but I think they're handled pretty well, with essentially a wink and a smile -- the bit with ""memorizing the map"" comes to mind.<br/><br/>Only two complaints. First of all, the final reveal of who the bad guys are is disappointing in the extreme, painfully obvious. Ironically, the biggest weakness in SILENT HILL comes when the actual plot kicks into gear, during the only time that the story really become paramount.<br/><br/>More importantly, I think the pacing's off. Again, it's the climax. A movie like this needs a real firework sendoff, a real visual barnburster. I found this disappointing. (The coda is nicely ambiguous, though.) Still, it's worth seeing. Especially if you think you'd like to see it, you probably should. You're already on the movie's wavelength."

","I saw Silent Hill last week, two days after it opened, and since then I haven't been able to stop talking about it to everyone I know. This is the best horror movie I've seen since I first saw the exorcist last September. I don't count both Saws as horrors-more like thrillers.<br/><br/>Anyway, getting back to Silent Hill, keep in mind I hadn't played ANY of the games before watching this. Well, I played Silent Hill 3 for like a half hour about 3 years ago. The plot is a bit of a cliché, but still good. The monsters/creatures, whatever you want to call them, looked amazing. Of all the monsters, the ones that really stand out were that first mannequin, and, everyone's favorite, Pyramid Head.<br/><br/>One complaint I have though, is the length. I felt it dragged on a little more than it should have.<br/><br/>Getting back to the good, the performances were great, especially Jodelle Federland as Alessa and Sharon, but she really stood out in my mind as Alessa.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a good horror movie, don't let the fact that you're not familiar with the games stop you. This one is not to be ignored.<br/><br/>Final rating: 7.5/10"

","I will be first in line to buy this sucker when the DVD comes out. I am a huge horror fan, and not a gore guy at all. I like tense movies like the Shining, the Exorcist, and Hellraiser (ok that one is gory but the story holds up too). I've played the Silent Hill games as well. Anyway, this movie does not disappoint in any way. The graphics are stunning and detailed. The story is good. The acting is solid. I loved it. They paid homage to the video games without being corny or goofy and it probably helped that the games are story based anyway as opposed to most shoot 'em ups. The CGI that was used did not look cheesy in the least and did not distract or look forced. I have to say I was very impressed and I recommend this movie wholeheartedly to anyone who likes artistic horror. I hope this movie makes a bundle just to send the message that classy horror has an audience! Amazing - they made a movie out of a video game that didn't suck.

"mjlc265","10","0","1","30 April 2006"," Awesome Adaptation
","The plot is based in the story of the first Silent Hill game. There's a small alteration in the characters, but most of them keep their original names. The movie only adds a small intro, before it starts to progress along with the game's plot, which is really nice. The atmosphere is something more than exceptional. It successfully brings to the screen the ash rain, foggy, white dream-like environment as well as the dark and twisted side of the town. The creatures have the same sick tortured design like the series, only with more detail along with violent scenes. The thing is that it's not the way that gore is presented but the whole twisted atmosphere under which it takes place. The sound effects are somehow innovative as far as the creatures are concerned. Instead of using the usual monster sounds they had human altered screams which gave a more creepy feeling. The music was the same background music that was in the games that blends nicely with the whole scenery and gives you a nostalgic feeling if ever played the game. Finally it creates the same background story that was built in the game when you collected clues. All in all it is an excellent adaptation of the game to the screen and using all the things mentioned, it keeps you from finding liabilities (if it has any ;-)."

But the imagery of everything that happened in the movie is what makes it so good. The creep and distort the Silent Hill video games are famous for are well portrayed in the movie. The director did a good job at making it happen. The lines are a little bit dumb but it is not a major problem. I love it. Just that you can freaking kill the s**t out of everyone who has done you wrong gives me orgasm! WOOHOO! F**king kill 'em all! I can watch it again. Damn. The ending may seem a little bit sudden without further explanation of what really happened, more like that kinda movie that leaves you to make up your own ending.

","""Silent Hill"" is one of the better horror films I've seen this year (so far at least). It has a really interesting story (based on a video game), great special effects, good acting, and some intense scary moments.<br/><br/>""Silent Hill"" starts with Rose DaSilva, who wakes up to find her daughter, Sharon, missing from her house in the middle of the night. She runs down to a waterfall and saves Sharon, who was about to fall off the cliff while sleepwalking. Sharon continues to scream ""Silent Hill!"" in her dreams, so Rose decides to take her daughter to the abandoned ghost town to try and help. Bad, bad mistake. As they arrive to Silent Hill, Rose crashes the car after almost hitting a young girl, and wakes up to find Sharon gone. But there seems to be something strange about the town now. There is an eerie fog that blankets it, and ashes fall from the sky like snowflakes. Unknowningly, Rose and Sharon are taken into an entire different dimension, and Rose must fight off evil creatures that are linked to the town's gruesome past, and save Sharon before it's too late.<br/><br/>I've only played a tiny bit of the video game, ""Silent Hill 3"", so I really have no idea what goes on in the games. But from how I understand it, this movie combines elements from all the games, and molding them together in one movie. Director Christophe Gans creates a very atmospheric setting, and the makeup and effects in this movie were wonderful. The plot is molded precisely and leaves lots of of twists and turns through the course of the film. There are plenty of slick visuals, amazing sets, and some twisted creatures that are all really amazing looking. The film looks great, I was really impressed with the sets and cinematography. Plenty of very scary moments abound, and there is also good acting from all involved.<br/><br/>Basically, if you are a fan of horror films, go see this. Whether you have played the games or not, you'll still enjoy the movie just as much, I really don't think it matters. ""Silent Hill"" is an original and very scary way to spend a couple of hours. 9/10."
"vietbeanie","8","0","1","30 April 2006"," A fan of both worlds
","I went to see this one over the weekend, and I must say that this has got to be one of the most horrifying movie I have seen in a long while.<br/><br/>Now my comment is coming to you as a game fan and also as a movie fan. In the realm of games, there are certain things that do not belong in movies. One thing for certain is that the player in the game will have to find clues, coherent to the plot or not, in order to progress through the game. In a movie, the clues found has to be coherent to the plot with some exceptions in order to actually have the audience not questioning the motive of the protagonist.<br/><br/>How and why Rose knew exactly what to do and not even question how the clues were placed there in the first place is incomprehendable, which is this movie doesn't deserve a perfect score.<br/><br/>The score in the movie is kept faithful to the Silent Hill game series, which is a big plus to gamers, but can also add plenty of tension to a movie fanatic. Each individual track in the movie can sometimes seem out of place, but certain scenes have done it perfectly to help build suspense.<br/><br/>The picture in the movie is incredible! From the most detailed hell-spawned settings to the heavily fogged town that almost represents an eerie heaven, which is almost kind of symbolic. No doubt about it, Silent Hill looks as scary as hell itself. CGI and heavy prosthetic makeup kept made it look as authentic as a screenshot from the actual game. Both movie and game fans will appreciate the work that has been done to make this horror look amazing.<br/><br/>The plot is something that a lot of harsh critics have bashed on, probably because some of them are right. The beginning started out strong, with very few dialog, in which each line were only place in order to keep the story going. During the middle, almost no lines were placed, which had the ending triple in line-drenched flashback scenes that had left a lot of audience members confused. If only everything has spreaded out evenly, instead of introducing a new plot turning at every scene near the end. This is will be understand by game fans because most of us would have been satisfied by the end anyways, movie fans on the other hand will probably question everything that there is to be questioned in this movie (aka confused).<br/><br/>My opinion: This movie will scare the crap out of you,during and after it. Silent Hill breaks a lot of movie formulas and rules, which gave it its charm and artsy feel. During the end, everything will seem as if hell breaks loose, and it probably did from most people's point of view. Overall, Silent Hill will disturb you beyond belief as it goes on to its climax, and its not a movie to be taken lightly, although at times it seems as though it should."

And the nurses were great too. The graphics/makeup/special effects were awesome. The janitor was exceptionally creepy! The acting was not that great, IMO. And the movie was not scary. Gory, disgusting, and a little creepy in some parts... but never scary. If you love the games, by all means go and see this movie.

","I have played the games and I'm a huge fan. I went to see SIlent Hill hoping this was gonna be great. For the first 45 minutes it's very good, excellent, just like in the game. And then comes the cult. That destroyed all the movie. It's so bad you're asking yourself if Gans didn't try to make a remake of Monty Python Holy Graal. BURN HER BURN HER. My god this was lame. After the cult appears, you don't see a single monster, they try to explain all the movie in a sequence with dialogs like ""congratulation rose you've won the grand prize, know i'm going to tell everything about this town"". Plus, Sean Bean's character broke all the tension, he's useless and the final sequence is ridiculous. VERY DISAPPOINTING AND EXTREMELY BAD. Although the music and sound effects were great. Gans didn't understand the game at all. In the game you're alone, you can't communicate with the people outside the town. Here, Rose is always with the cop, she can call her husband and there are 5000 people from the cult always screaming: BURN HER BURN HER. And contrarily to the game, this movie doesn't scare at all. There is only one big moment of tension and terror, it's with the Janitor but that's it. Plus the movie is too long, everyone was yawning and laughing at some sequences, like when Rose, Cybill and Anna jump to another building and rose saying: "" where are we?"" and Cybill: ""looks like were in the other building"" DUH?! The nurse scene is a remake of Micheal Jackson's Thriller. The only thing good in this film are the janitor sequence, the music and the first 45 minutes. The rest is pretty BAD.

If you are a fan of solid horror movies and have never heard of Silent Hill, you can relax too, because you'll like this movie. Silent Hill games are all about the atmosphere. No other game has creeped me out as as much except for System Shock 2 maybe. The movie delivers the creepy atmosphere from the games in droves, while infusing just the right amount of action to keep the plot going. After all, this is a two hour movie, not something you are going to finish in 15 hours at your own leisure. Is it an excellent movie? No, by no means. There is room for improvement in several departments, especially the dialog delivery. In all, Christophe Gans and his crew have done well with Silent hill, and as a comparison, if you liked the Resident Evil game to movie translation, then you'll like what they have done here. I'm actually tempted to give this movie an ""8"" just for delivering a good, solid horror film in a time when we, the fans, are only getting really bad scary movies to watch. Hellraiser Hellworld and Deader anyone? Gasp*...<br/><br/>Movies based on games have a really bad reputation right now, largely thanks to that nitwit Uwe Boll. Although he's not the only one to have made a bad movie based on a game license, his movies are just that more ""half-arsed"" than others. Actually, a half-arsed attempt to make a movie from a license Boll used so far would result in a better movie than his movies.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is just one of those movies that you have to see for yourself, regardless of what you heard or read about it. Go on then, treat yourself."

","The first sign of a bad script is either a long description at the beginning or towards to end to explain the story. Personally I could have lived without the long winded explanation near the end of Silent Hill. If the writer can't work it into the story he shouldn't resort a monologue to catch the viewer up. The first half was impressive but then it fell apart. Most of the best visuals and scenes were in the first half hour to forty five minutes. Another reviewer said it was unlike Doom and I'd like to correct that, it had parts that were more like the Doom 3 video game than the movie Doom was. Really showed it could be done well. I don't want to go into any real spoilers but there are several scenes that stand out and show what it could have been and the style of the film is quite beautiful. Storywise it's a bit of Jacob's Ladder meets The Ring. Even a little Poltergeist II thrown in. There's a lot of name dropping so obviously the Director is a fan. There's a school they keep repeating the name, it's called Midwich as in Village Of The Damned. I wanted to like it but there's a side of me that wished I'd walked out halfway through it, it would have left a better impression. Kind of like King Kong in that I want the DVD so I can fast forward to the good parts. Some parts are really disturbing and it's worth seeing but the script really needed a rewrite in the worst way."

It's almost as if the movie gives evil more integrity than Godly things do, more so near the end of the film. If you see it, maybe you'll understand what I'm talking about. If you have a weak stomach, this movie is surely not for you! Gobs of gore and blood, evil beings...etc. No doubt, these 'evil, satanic' characters are unique.

First of all, if you haven't even played the games, don't go see this film. The two mediums are strongly interwoven (more so than any other previous film of this kind that I saw before) and you WILL be lost. Fortunately I have played said games, so that wasn't an issue for me. But the excruciating dialog, the lame acting, the lulls in the film (at more than 2 hours, you'll be glancing at your watch countless times), and the waste of the one talented actor of the bunch, Sean Bean, were a big issue for me. The excellent ""Brotherhood of the Wolf"" this is definitely not. My friend Dave, who drug me to this piece of excrement, however loved the film.

Yes, it looked very 'pretty' (as far as you can go with lots of barbed wire and rusty fences!) and the sound design was extremely proficient. The game's stylised decor and apparel was strewn throughout the film, but little else remained intact.<br/><br/>Shame.<br/><br/>The 'plot' was left flawed, holey (like the cheese), and distractingly convoluted. I guarantee that you, along with at least 75% of the rest of the cinema, will have a big, fat 'HUH?' on your faces when the lights come back up. So much is left unexplained.<br/><br/>I don't want to post a 'spoiler', so I'll stop. BUT, what the monkeys was up with Sean Bean's voice?! If you go and watch it, you'll see! I can't say I'm completely disappointed, because I'm not (my partner may have to disagree!). It DID look pretty, and because I've played the games, it made some sense. However, if you want a strong, character-driven horror/drama, you could do with looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Not one for the DVD collection, but worth watching once for the experience."

","While at times the movie can be utterly chilling and frighting to most the plot of the movie is nonsense to those not from the video game world of which this movie is created. I have understood every movie I've seen in my lifetime until I saw this one.<br/><br/>While the movie offers top notch acting,sets, and many twists and turns throughout its 2 hour and 15 min running time it was not worth my time or money.<br/><br/>Many problems plague this movie while confusing me and everyone i saw it with the plot if clear well everyone's attentions are not. This cg created wall peeling seemed almost cartoonish and the monster of the underworld were also something to laugh at.

","Maybe I'm not the best person to judge movies, but I know what I like. And what I didn't like was Silent Hill, it the plot moved painfully slowly, I admit It was a pretty scary in places,but it just seemed to go on and on forever. Maybe I'm just to dumb to understand it, if so please explain it to me. So I understand this was the girls dreamworld. Or nightmare world that she created while laying there. but does that mean she's still alive somewhere? I mean from what I took from the movie there were two plains of exsiting, the dream world that the women and little girl, (and Annoying cop, BURN BABY BURN!) where stuck in, so does that mean somewhere in the real world that somebody was keeping the girl alive? anyhow if you'd like to try to explain to me why I'm moron and why this movie was so great, feel free.

","I was really disappointed in Silent Hill. I didn't know that it was based on a video game, but I don't think that really mattered much. It would have been a disappointment either way.<br/><br/>The characters were not well developed, and I didn't care who lived or died. I thought that the story looked strong based on the trailer but the movie itself was weak.<br/><br/>While Silent Hill strives to shock the audience, the shocks are just not shocking. They used gory imagery too much, to the extent where it became expected and unnecessary and lost its effect. Silent Hill also fails to bring in anything scary.<br/><br/>The movie is less than 2 hours long, but I felt like I was sitting in the theater for about 8 hours. It seemed like it would end, then it just kept going and going. The pacing did not keep my interest.<br/><br/>When the movie was over, the only word I could describe Silent Hill with was 'ridiculous'."

","The Joe Cool Review: Silent Hill(2006)<br/><br/>Starring: Radha Mitchell as Rose DaSilva, Jodelle Ferland as Sharon DaSilva, Sean Bean as Christopher DaSilva, Laurie Holden as Cybil, & Alice Krige as Christabella<br/><br/>Plot: A mother takes her daughter to a town called Silent Hill, where they become trapped in an alternate reality. Sharon, the daughter, ends up missing and the mother must search for her in a town where everything is not as it seems, and when it gets dark it changes into something far more sinister.<br/><br/>Openers: Just to start things out I am a huge fan of the Silent Hill game series. I was tentative to see this movie because let's face it, video games adaptations have not been kind to the fans. The best adaptations are simply okay(Resident Evil), some are bad but are guilty pleasures(Mortal Kombat), and some are just plain terrible(House of the Dead, Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter, etc). But when I heard who was behind it I gained some confidence in the project. Then they released pictures and trailers and I became very eager to see it. It looked like someone adapted a video game to the screen that not only stayed true to it's source material, but also was a good movie in itself. Did that happen?<br/><br/>The Good: For the most part, yes. Silent Hill's biggest triumph is that visually it is amazing. It stays true to the games in that it has a real gritty feel to it. You will recognize a lot of the creatures if you've ever played, and even if you haven't, the monsters are just plain scary looking. They look CGI in this movie but apparently they are actual people with costumes for the most part, so good job. When the town itself is transformed, there are great effects there as well. The story, while having some tweaks here and there, pretty much fit into the Silent Hill universe. So far so good. It stays true to the games. As far as a movie itself, it looks great visually, as I said before. Some of the acting is decent, such as Sean Bean, who only had a minor role here. Laurie Holden was pretty much a perfect choice as Cybil as it looked like she was pulled directly from the original game. She also held up her role in the movie as well. Jodelle Ferland wasn't annoying in her role, which is all you can say for most child actors.<br/><br/>The Bad: This movie had it's share of flaws too though. The script had some terrible lines in it, mainly from the fanatical church. Radha Mitchell pretty much annoyed me too as Rose, and I couldn't care too much for her as a result. The plot had some holes, not many but some, and the ending itself was anti-climatic and just took me out of the vibe that I had settled into. Felt like a lot of stuff was cut out(which I read that the original cut was 3 and a half hours so that may be why) and the movie itself felt disjointed in some parts.<br/><br/>The Ugly: Good news is there is a LOT of gore. Someone gets their skin ripped off, and there's one big scene with a lot of gore that I won't reveal.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: In spite of it's flaws, Silent Hill is not only the best video-game adaptation yet, it's also a good horror movie on top of it. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Rating: **** of *****"

","what was this movie about?! Definitely not one of the best I have seen and if somebody is comparing it to ""The Shining"" (more ambitious suspense cinema) I really don't understand it. Woman drives to the ghost city of Silent Hill. She takes weird daughter with her. The girl disappears after her mother crashed the car. Mother tries to find her and that's basically it. She runs thru the empty streets. There's time she's brave then she screams and freaks out but then she's brave again...Oh, there is father too, female cop in tight leather pants and few more weirdos. Everything dipped in the dark, unreal parallel-world-like sauce. How many movies similar to this have we seen? Isn't it boring yet? Probably the director wanted to create bad dream-like experience but it's just didn't work out. This movie is an ""empty"", creepy picture show with no point. Will scare you for sure if horrible, hellish creatures and fog is enough for you. To me, real nightmare starts when my brain is a bit more engaged. I enjoy good plot. If you're not demanding you could see it. You will like the citizens and the metal-head man(?) with a very big knife."

","I know people that love the game will disagree, but this was the WORST movie that I have been to in years. People in the theater were actually laughing at what I am assuming to be ""climatic"" and scary points, and many left early. The movie made no sense, had very little plot, and awful acting ( what was up with the female policeman????). I have seen the game being played at various times and it did have interesting points, but it should have stayed a game. If you aren't familiar with it, you aren't going to know who these characters are, and why they should scare you. Those nurses with the Robert Palmer doing Thriller-esquire moves were just over the top. I love how their outfits were cut just low enough to see their breasts bounce around. Give me a break!!!!! I've never seen a nursing dress that hot except for Halloween costumes!

The previews are pretty misleading. The monsters in this movie are simply laughable.. I mean, I think most of the people in the theater were laughing at what was supposed to be scary. And they had good reason - the monsters looked ridiculous. If you played the game, you will be very disappointed. The game is extremely scary, and the movie was just plain ridiculous. It was also full of plot holes and inconsistencies. The acting was horrible, and the plot was impossible to follow, mostly because of the numerous plot holes."
"duncanralston","3","0","4","28 April 2006"," Scary and very flawed.
","First off, you people reading so much into this film need to think again. Confusing does not necessarily mean deep. Donnie Darko and the Machinist come to mind. Confusing for the sake of being confusing--so the audience will think, Wow, I don't get it, so it must be brilliant. Lynch can get away with this, but not many other directors can. Maybe Chronenberg. Gans has fallen to the level of Uwe Boll in this film.<br/><br/>Yes, it was terrifying. Twice. Those burning baby things almost made me sh*t my pants, but only because the sound was so deafeningly booming, it was almost in the range of the brown noise.<br/><br/>The CGI was mediocre at best, a little bit better than the game. And that really takes you out of a horror movie. Ooh, those graphics are really scary. Never heard anyone say that before. Made me long for the days when Harryhausen's clay animation from Clash of the Titans was state of the art.<br/><br/>The game was a lot scarier. Because you are the character. You are immersed in the game. You don't want to die. In the movie, I didn't care if whats-her-name (that's how much I cared for her character) lived or died.<br/><br/>Also, why so many little girls? And what the f*ck was with Red Pyramid? I thought the little girl's vengeance created all that (and wouldn't that be a useful skill?), so where did he come from? The ending was super lame, also. If they were going to end it with Rahda and her daughter still in that other plane or dimension or the mist or whatever, they should have at least turned that air-raid siren on and had the screen fade to black. That would have been the sh*t, because that siren was the scariest part of the freaking movie."
"checkouthank","7","0","1","27 April 2006"," Where's the Pyramid Head filling?
","OK, before I go anywhere with this, I'm going to explain why I give it a 7. If you manage to throw everything that you've learned from the video games out the window it's a great movie. It's what horror movies these days should be. However, if you prefer it to follow the games a bit more, then you might want to consider watching something else. So 7 is kind of the happy middle, I guess you could say.<br/><br/>Here's why I say this.<br/><br/>The movie's got its inaccuracies, that's a given. But there were several things that I just would've liked to have seen worked with a bit more. Like Pyramid Head. He kicks ass when he's on the screen, but I just don't think they took advantage of him enough. For a character that was as vital to the plot in the game, they just kinda let him slip in the movie. Though he's not nearly as big of a let down as Nemesis from Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Not by a long shot. I'd also liked to have seen the purpose behind Silent Hill (the whole gather and punish sinners aspect) worked with a bit more. They use it, but just not enough.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a great movie if you can forget about the meaning behind various things, like why almost every character in Silent Hill 2 was a woman or what Pyramid Head was actually there for or Dalia's actual purpose. I dunno. I liked it, but there was definitely room for improvement. I want to give it a higher rating because they did a good job on it, but I still can't help but feel short changed out of the deal."
"salmonspartan","7","0","1","27 April 2006"," the best video game movie of all time. as if that meant something.
","this is, without a doubt, the finest video game inspired movie i've seen on the silver screen yet. the atmosphere was fantastic, the acting was good, and the film over all got, as far as i'm concerned, a rock solid seven out of ten. the movie has a few flaws to large to go past, though. i am a fan boy of many a media, silent hill being a smaller one, but this movie does little to explain much. i like mystery. the viewing audience does to, or the movie wouldn't be number one in the box office the first week it's out.<br/><br/>but the movie has no common sense. i.e., when rose leaves to go to silent hill, her husband cuts off her credit cards. we know that he does not want her to go. why? their daughter is ill, he says,and needs to be treated, but that's no reason to financially cut off a loved one. why not try to help, or try to go to this town she talks about? also, when rose crashes the car, it is in fine shape. she looks about for her daughter, and when she can't find her on the highway, what does she do? move her car? drive on looking for her? no. she just walks.she later try's to start the car to no avail, but there is no way she could have known that.she just walks. down the highway. in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>and Cybil is clearly out of her bounds as an officer to follow rose after they first meet, as well. and she may have been speeding, but if that was the case why would rose speed off, away from a police officer? this may be nit picking, but little details ruin the movie.<br/><br/>also, the amount of allegory in the movie will confuse nine out of ten viewers. thinking of Allissa as the devil, Cybil as an agent of god on earth, silent hill(when covered in fog) as limbo, silent hill at night as hell, and silent hill in the clear day as our world will not go over well. one of the two best known reviewers alive, roger Elbert, said that he was confused. that's a bad sign. i think that roger Avery's love or religious symbols confused the masses in this movie.<br/><br/>to end up, the film looks great. there is a constant amount of Christan metaphor and scenery, i.e. the cross' everywhere and the hopscotch board reading hell to heaven. Debra Kara Unger does an amazing job as Dahlia, Sharon (whatever the girls name is) is great when possessed by the devil, Kim Coates does a great job trying to hide something, and the church is all well cast. the only poor acting jobs go to Sean bean, who i love. he was convincing when looking for his family, but his accent was so bad i was removed from all that great atmosphere. and i found all the creature acting hokey, except the nurses. which were great. namely, Colin. that was the worst monster since the bride of Chuck y. the special effects are a bit lax, but pyramid head is just right. not over used at all. by the by, a fine movie to see once. not as scary as i had hoped, but great for any young director to reference."
"folster86-1","10","0","2","27 April 2006"," Silent Hill: Superficial Concepts Need Not Review
","Story: 10/10, Acting: 8/10, Dialogue: 7/10, Direction: 9/10, Visuals: 10/10, Overall: 9/10<br/><br/>I remember watching the trailer for this movie a few months back. Although I have never played the game nor had any desire to, the movie looked pretty exciting. I could tell from just the previews alone that the visuals were going to be beautifully disturbing. My lack of knowledge on the game really sparked my interest. Wow, I was really amazed and my interest to play the game has risen.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is set in fictional Toluca County, West Virginia. Christopher and Rose Da Silva's daughter, Sharon, has nightmares of a place called Silent Hill. Rose decides to take her daughter's mental condition into her own hands by bringing her to this foggy ghost town and facing her dilemma head on. Sharon soon finds herself in what can only be described as a hellish and contingent environment where reality is in the eyes of the beholder. When she arrives in Silent Hill the nightmarish tone is almost immediately set. The music (Which could also just be random demonic sounds. Another ingenious ploy to again set a creepy tone.) and camera angles work well to define an odd and out of place aura around this deserted town. The first siren blast sets an even more ominous feeling of what could possibly be coming next. <br/><br/>At times, the dialogue in this film can be a bit dry and the acting wasn't exactly the greatest in the world but the redeeming qualities lie in a strong storyline and the amazing visuals that reveal the full nightmarish environment that is Silent Hill. There are many random aspects that are never explained, but are there to enhance the viewer's final interpretation. <br/><br/>This was surprisingly an artsy film if broken down into certain aspects and definitely contained some metaphorical allusions. Many people who hate this movie do not understand the overall direction of what was going on. This was not supposed to be a typical horror movie, per se, but what I believe to be as rather an artistic approach to bend the minds of its viewers and leave open many possibilities as to what the heck they just saw. <br/><br/>I definitely recommend this movie to people who love to see a film that would require them to put rational thought into what they just saw and anyone who is not afraid of disturbing visuals. I would not recommend it to someone who expects to be spoon fed every solitary detail, so to speak, nor anyone who has a weak stomach."

","Many gamers will remember Silent Hill as one of the scariest franchises ever, the nastier, gorier cousin to Resident Evil. Many film goers will know it as one of the longest experiences of their life. That isn't to say that Silent Hill is a bad film, it's not, it just seems really slow in the middle portion and doesn't have the scares to make the tension build-up worth while. One of the best parts of the games was the use of darkness and shadows, but this is sadly one of the movie's biggest failings as some of the scenes are in so much darkness you can't even make out what's going on. Apart from some dodgy acting and (from the normally reliable) Sean Bean's 'American' accent, the film starts well, in fact the first 40 minutes is one of the best first acts to a film i've ever seen - scary and exciting in equal measure (specially when Silent Hill 'turns'). Sadly it's after this that the film loses it's way and starts to fill dragged out and slow. You almost feel as if you're watching someone play a game instead of watching a film. You often feel that you are just going from one level to the next and meeting a boss at the end of each one - one that doesn't even pose a threat. The only good thing about the middle section was the use of 'Pyramid Head' - the 2nd game's famous badguy. Sadly he's underused as if the film makers didn't want to mess with the game's character too much. Also the sub plot with Sean Bean just feels useless and doesn't really do anything for the story. Luckilu the film picks up again in the final act, with a gory attack on a church involving barbed wire and a lot of blood. It doesn't quite make up for the last hour however. My advice, stick to the game's = they're a lot better."

","When you make a movie out of a video game you get mixed results. If the movie is done right, you get a decent film like Laura Croft: Tomb Raider. If it's not done right you get Resident Evil or House Of The Dead. Where does Silent Hill fall? strangely enough, right in between. I love the game Silent Hill. When I heard that a movie was being made out of it, I didn't know what to think. The plot for the game is great, just like Resident Evil and as mentioned R.E. was terrible. A friend of mine got us passes to see this film (Thank You Joe) and I was accompanied by my wife (who also loved the game), my friend and his wife. When we left I can say That my friend wasn't sure what to make of it, his wife hated it and my wife though it was okay. Silent Hill is the story of a little girl named Sharyn who keeps having hallucinations that bring her (spiritually, I think) into a demonic possessed world. When her mother Rose decides to get her daughter some help, against the will of her husband Chris, Rose brings Sharyn to the place she keeps seeing in her vision/dreams Silent Hill. S.H. is a town that has a reputation of being a mysterious ghost town. Now when Sharyn and Rose get to S.H. that's when ""The Darkness"" comes and all kinds of strange zombie looking things start attacking Rose who has lost Sharyn and is fighting off these monsters to find her daughter. Silent Hill held my interest and had a great mixture of CGI and latex costumes (something that is a rarity in movies now a day's). However it's when the film hits it's big climatic ending that leaves you scratching your head. When ""The Evil Reaper"", who comes in the form of Sharyn starts explaining what is going on to Rose I became confused and I could hear audience members becoming just as confused and one person behind me asking what was going on for like the 50th time, and asking her boyfriend if they could leave yet. I know die hard fans of the game, tat also saw this film and they were just as confused. Plus there has always been an unwritten rule in Hollywood that horror flicks should not go over 90 minutes. Silent Hill goes on for 2 hours and 11 minutes. Overkill. Silent Hill could have been a great horror film in the same vein as Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, and other great zombie flicks. Sadly with a confusing ending it comes off as more a George A. Romero rip off, and your confusion turns into complete frustration. While Silent Hill is better than Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat, it's not nearly as good as the Tomb Raider movies. Don't get me wrong those films won't earn Acadamy Award winner Angelina Jolie any more awards, at least they were entertaining, and didn't confuse or aggravate you. On a scale of 10 I give Silent Hill a 5. Better than most video game movies, but not nearly as good as the few that have earned the right to be called good."

The grimy, dank otherworldly atmosphere looks gorgeous on screen in all it's bleached out watercolor glory.<br/><br/>The cast gets some serious props too for making the best of what they're given, especially young Jodelle Ferland who impressed in a difficult, creepy role. It's also good to see that Laurie Holden has life (and work) after ""The X-Files."" <br/><br/>The big problem with ""Silent Hill"" however, especially for those that haven't played the game, is sadly the script, which seems to go out of its way to make its characters do stupid, implausible things, with a complete lack of motivation, especially in the first 15 minutes of the film. A lot of people walked out of the theater during my viewing, and many more were laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot and dialogue. I think the closest comp of ""Silent Hill"" is ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within,"" another video game movie that looks fabulous on screen but was barely watchable due to the insipid plot.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Wait for the video. Should be out right around Halloween."

","I saw Silent Hill on opening night and it was great. I am a huge fan of the games so I may have enjoyed it slightly more because of that. **The movie is an intense psychological trip rather that a full blown horror movie.** It follows Rose(protagonist) on her quest through Silent Hill to find her missing daughter and unravel the mysteries of the town as well as her daughter's true past. ***For gamers:: This movie follows the first Silent Hill game ALMOST exactly in the first hour or so. The story is generally LIKE the first one but starts breaking off into something totally different by the end (this makes it feel a lot like the game but at the same time very original). The monsters are all mainly from silent hill 2. The music is taken straight out of the the games. Pay attention when watching the movie,you'll notice a lot of little unnecessary things that are references to the games (i.e. the entire setting in the beginning and the bowl-a-rama from the Silent Hill 2!) ***For movie-lovers not familiar with the game:: This is a bit difficult. The games had intense and extremely twisted story lines and that does not change for the movie. If you are into the strange twists and confusion that will leave you talking about a movie for weeks(like i am)than hurry up and see it now. Others who decide to see it without expecting to THINK A LOT than you may have to see it a few times to get everything. The acting/dialogue is ironically lame considering the great actors involved. FINAL WORDS:: For everyone interested in seeing this movie I have 2 words for you. PAY ATTENTION. Don't let the cheezy dialgoue throw your concentration from whats going on and remember as much as you can. It'll inevitably be up to YOU to put the full ending together. It is an amazing Psychological trip that I would love to see again and I'm sure if you're not a lazy movie watcher that wants every clue and detail of the plot to be fed to you , than you will enjoy it. Visually intense and environments match the games' exactly!! I gave it a 9 out of 10. -1 POINT FOR BAD DIALOGE."

Throughout the whole movie I recognized details from the soundtrack(beautiful) and SFX, to the sets and props that were carbon copies of the game. They even use the air raid sirens!!! The ""enemies"" were all mostly taken from a bunch of the games. More than a few times I got goosebumps watching the protagonist running from the same enemy, to the same music, with my heart racing like it has so many times before.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie follows the plot of the first game almost exactly. It eventually mixes it up a bit more, but still makes constant references to the games throughout. BUT! If you haven't played the game(s), the movie may seem kind of hokey. You'll also be left with a lot of questions. I even had some confusion, but as with most movies, you have to watch them several times to digest EVERYTHING.***<br/><br/>Worst of all during the final scenes of the movie, some older rednecks (couldn't pay attention for a measly 2 hours) heckling when the would fade to black : (""Is it over? haw haw haw"") So obviously some people may really not appreciate it or even hate it, but either way Silent Hill was definitely the best video game remake to date... really. So if you love the games, go asap, before they pull it from theaters. But if you just saw the preview on the TV and thought it would be a hot new breaking edge horror movie, wait to rent it.<br/><br/>*** I've only seen it once.

(She also never played the game.) This is a movie that I believe can be respected by many members of the gaming community. While the normal movie goer will be confused, the gamer fan who's played will have an incite as to what is going on. This movie's cinematography was breath taking. Very eerie! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD.<br/><br/>P.S. Gamers! There is a rumor that Clock Tower 3 is being made into a movie! I totally hope that it gets there! LizLadyNinja"

","There have been a few video games gone movie (Doom,Resident Evil) and I really have to say Silent Hill has been the best adaptation yet.I think Silent Hill has a creepy culture not everyone will appreciate, but I think anybody who is a gamer or knows something about the game can really appreciate what Sony did with this movie. I thought they did a great job bringing the creepy little town of Silent Hill and its monsters to life. I felt disturbed watching this movie, and that is exactly how I felt playing the game!Definitely one of the better movies I have seen on the big screen, and I was so glad it was RATED R, like a horror movie should be!"
"phillipstephenso","9","0","2","26 April 2006"," Artistically Startling
","This horror film does a good job of providing artistic special effects along with a horrific plot. For example, closeups of a cigarette lighter flashing in the darkness provide an economical method to startle the senses. Darkness and light are used to provide artistic contrast. And, religious motifs provide another layer of forbidding mystery. Natural disasters such as Katrina and man made disasters like Chernobyl are capable of causing whole towns and even cities to become uninhabitable for an extended period. Just such a town is Silent Hill, West Virginia, wiped out by underground fires and now full of mold and decay. Even the road to the town is blocked off by a strong metal fence. So, an adopted child from Silent Hill begins to experience visions of a former life in Silent Hill. Her mother wants to put to rest this psychosis by driving her daughter to the destroyed town and by presenting realism to combat the fantasy. Thus, begins the horror. This is an extraordinary film, superior to others of its genre. The complexity of the plot is only cleared at the end during an incredibly bloody and climactic sequence, unlike any other horror sequence in its startling violence."
"mtppg1","7","0","2","26 April 2006"," A little too gory... but somewhat scary...
","To begin with, I haven't played the games. I went into this movie with very little idea of the plot. On the plus side, I think it was filmed pretty well. Though the story was a little ""off"" at times, it did set up the plot pretty well. It was one of those classic gory movies. In my opinion, the film makers focused too much on the gory aspect. Although there were many instances where I was somewhat scared, there were also instances where I almost burst out laughing at the misfortune of the main characters. If you've liked the games, I suppose it'd be worth seeing. If you haven't, but you like scary movies which focus on gore... well, this one's for you. And if you're anyone else... I'd tell you it's worth seeing only if you're in the mood for it...<br/><br/>Don't read this next part, it gives away part of the movie.<br/><br/>For those who have played the games, a question:<br/><br/>What's up with the pyramid headed guy? Why do the spirits of the dead people (who hide in the church) try to attack them at first?"
"KamiNoNamida","7","0","2","26 April 2006"," In absolute: a quite good transcription; in relative: the best adaptation ever. In terms of a movie: a good job....
","In spite of a pretty bad beginning to my mind (due to some quite laughable dialogs, incredible situations, or even reactions), the more we go through the movie, the more we get attracted into it, and the more it works.<br/><br/>Although, what must have disappointed me the most is the lack of similarities with the game on the following points: 1) not enough stress, not enough gore. 2) too many people in there ! in the original game, you're alone about 80% of the time. 3) not enough darkness (plus: I only detected 2 or 3 distinct dimensions)<br/><br/>Silent Hill sometimes seems to be more ""widely inspired by"" the game than it's a direct adaptation of it. And even though the screenplay isn't bad (in spite of some mistakes), i still can't figure out why they felt obliged to modify so much elements of the video game... there's nothing psychological there, more like mysticism, which makes the movie lose some depth. It's highly illustrated by the long (too long ?) scene where /!\SPOILER/!\ evil Alessa explains the truth to Rose and, in the end, it makes the movie more about understanding the city itself than learning to know oneself. Pity...<br/><br/>The actors did a quite good job, in spite of some stinky parts (mostly due to crappy lines, mainly at the beginning, like Gans shot it first while he had forgotten how to direct well, and remembered along the shooting).<br/><br/>We could also put a little criticism about Sean Bean's parts, which are not real bad (not too good either, but nice to watch), but don't find their place there. It cuts the movie so that you can hardly get into it. Cut mistakes ? Looks like, since the most shocking transitions between the ""inside"" and ""outside"" of the city are the ones which occur during very interesting scenes of the ""inside"". Then, these parts aren't crap, they're just not inserted correctly.<br/><br/>You might regret discrete monsters too. They're unfortunately put aside the major part of the movie, and only give quick appearances, but good ones. There're also not enough types of them (only 4).<br/><br/>So after all this, why would I give it an 8 ? Well...<br/><br/>First of all, the ""beauty"" of the images. This has clearly been carefully worked out, with an impressive precision. The result is really magnificent. I can assure you, not only the sfx are barely detectable, but the lights and sets are undoubtedly REAL perfection ! The ambiances explored are kicking some asses too. The shots are also well-thought all the long, and i even read that, at the arrival in Silent Hill, they're nearly a copy/paste of the game. I feel like it's true, and that brings me to another quality: respect of the original game style.<br/><br/>Indeed, Gans has put a particular attention on getting the game's spirit transcribed to perfection. We can say he's failed in some ways (see the 3 points higher), but he did a great job anyway ! In fact, though the full game spirit isn't there at every level, most of it will punch you in the face like ""see ? i'm a video game on the screen !""... for anyone who knows the game a bit, the film will ring a bell, like you've already seen that somewhere. I would also like to remember that the game itself is not about fear like we know it in any horror movie, but more like insanity, stress, or whatever, but not being frightened. So all these criticisms about ""not a single fear"" are just crap. It lacks a bit of frightening, that's right, but if you go see this movie for it, you're mistaking since it's absolutely not its purpose. You'll experience a new kind of ""horror"" movie. All this to say that some things might be absent or not consistent enough, but the very soul of Silent Hill was nearly caught with perfection, enough to say it's a success. When was the last time you saw a good game adaptation ? Never I guess. Well, see silent hill, you'll change your answer.<br/><br/>To finish with, let me tell you the OST is a jewel. It's highly due to the fact that most titles are from the game itself. Nevertheless, the rest of it fits too, making the soundtrack a pleasure for ears. A little black spot that made me sorry is there are sometimes musics that don't fit images, which obviously disturbs the spectator for few seconds.<br/><br/>So, to sum up, there are, as any movie, some defaults, but in the global, they drawn in an ocean of qualities that proof that Gans is capable of doing very good job. The problems of the film are small ones, whereas its qualities are to be appreciated to their true value. Gans tried his best to give the fans and himself a good adaptation that would satisfy both gamers and common public. This must have been hell hard, and was a real challenge. Sadly, nothing can be perfect, and silent hill doesn't dodge the rule, but for the first time, it gave us a movie from a game that respected the original, as i've never seen one before, and succeeds in getting it's own identity anyway. That's why it got an 8."

"Boarder4892","10","0","2","26 April 2006"," Nothing Short of Amazing!!
","For people who've seen this GAME or have PLAYED it, would most likely understand this movie. Most of the critics and opinionators giving this movie a bad review have most likely not seen or heard of this game. I waited between 3 to 5 months for this movie to come out when I read the game was being turned into a movie, and I thought it was right under amazing. The way the camera moved, the creatures, the storyline of the movie pretty much followed 3/4 of the game, although not to rain on any parade, the fact there was maybe a few things from the second game that were in it, I hope to see in a second one, that is if it comes out. The movie was a good adaptation to illustrate and show what the game was about, and to tell the story. You might have been able to tell the cgi stuff, but that alone looked pretty good, but trying to put the game into movie perspective without losing the kick it has as a game was done so much better than I thought. This movie in my opinion portrays the game(I believe it was based throughly on the 1st one, there is currently 4 out with a new 5th one starting up, very very well, and makes other video game movies look OK or like they tried. I did not encounter any plot holes that I recollect, and the only person that was not given any background info about that we hardly know of is Pyramid Head( his name from the game Silent Hill 2( the guy with the metal pyramid looking thing on his head)) although the ending for some people might be hard to understand or follow. I think this movie will be given half bad rap due to the fact, 1. people might not have played the game. 2. they might not care for the amount of horror or scaryness in it. 3. Plossibly all the gore. 4. And thinking it's just another teenage blood and guts movie. But some of those things are WHAT MAKE THAT GAME THAT GAME. When this was to be made, they didn't want to make it like every other movie where you were able to actually understand, they want to put you see a determined mom in a state of courageous desperation, with it really not stopping once. That is what gets you waiting for the next time IT starts up again or keeping your heart racing, with you pinned to the edge of your seat. I know I was. There have been over 250 million copies of each game currently out, sold, and it's the the scariest game series on the playstation(2). And to see people that play that game, that are fanatics, that have all the different ones, and who get sucked into the sound, music, atmosphere, stories, and the characters see that this has been turned into a movie, make it more that totally exciting to them. I'm happy I saw it and it was well worth paying. I'm GOING TO SEE IT A SECOND TIME. I don't think they could've done any better. I very much applaud Director Christopher Gans and Konami."
"eidolonse","3","0","4","26 April 2006"," Not good at all.
","What can I say about this movie? Well, simply put, it wasn't good at all. Sure, it started out with a lot of potential but that quickly disappeared after watching the mother run around like a confused and stupid deer for over an hour. Then came the story line, unraveling itself through predictability. After this, there really wasn't much to expect aside from the poorly created ending. Further adding to the over-all poor quality of the movie was the completely unnecessary side-story with the father.<br/><br/>Now as far as the characters. Their personalities and reactions were completely unnatural and forced. The mother, again the center of stupidity, kept switching emotions much like a bi-polar sociopath. One moment she was panicking and screaming for help, the next moment she was the heroic figure of guidance. This, along with her purposely running into every possible danger, made her one of the dumbest characters in a horror movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, what upset me was the following IMDb fact: Contrary to popular belief, Silent Hill hardly uses any computer generated imagery. The most notable use of CGI is the fog that drenches the town. Most creatures are live actors covered in latex and makeup.<br/><br/>This was for the most part, wrong. Over half the movie was littered with CGI.<br/><br/>I will say that there was some interesting imagery, and the first hour or so was suspenseful and creepy. However, it quickly withered away to a boring and dumb horror flick."

","If you're a fan of the game, then you will love the movie because it recreates a lot of what you love about the game in the movie, and it works. The one thing I didn't care for was what happened to Cybil, and hopefully if there is to be another Silent Hill movie, they will find a way to ""un-do"" Cybil's fate in this movie. And work in the White Claudia contribution. Other than that, the movie was like a flashback of the game. I hate horror, but I make an exception for Silent Hill. It'll make you want to dig your old PlayStation 1 game out and play it again!!! The fact that Harry was replaced with Rose wasn't that disappointing, there is a lot left open to another movie, and it would be nice to see Harry surface in the future, or at least have that ending explained a little bit more. The baddies were awesome, I didn't think they could be recreated as well as the makers of this movie managed to do, so for those familiar with the game, this movie definitely won't disappoint. For someone who goes to see it and is not aware of the game, it may pique their interest after the movie...(The game should still be available in stores on Play Station 1's Greatest Hits, or look on eBay."

I went to see this at the drive in, and if this had been the second movie, i would have left at the beginning. After seeing this movie, i was soo happy to see a decent movie like the hills have eyes. Silent Hill was so bad that it was almost undescribably. First off, this movie was so far out there that i couldn't be scared, i just had to laugh. Secondly, this is THE WORST written movie that i have EVER seen in my entire life. Thirdly, it made no sense what so ever... none at all. I could go on forever about things that i hated about this film, but it would be even more time that i wasted on Silent Hill. The last thing that i have to say about this movie is that this was the WORST ending i've ever seen in my life. It reassured me that watching this movie was for sure a waste of time. The thing that makes me angry about a film like this is that it actually had the potential to be a decent movie. All in all, this movie made me lose some respect for horror films. This was soo disappointing and i wouldn't recommend you waste your money or time seeing it!"
"heckchap","5","0","2","26 April 2006"," If this is ""the best horror flick in years"", God help the horror flick industry
","I'm a huge fan of Christophe Gans' ""Brotherhood Of The Wolf"", one of the most fun and inventive horror flicks of the last 10 years.<br/><br/>However, with ""Silent Hill"", Gans turns right around and throws himself back to the level of tedium he demonstrated with ""Crying Freeman"". I've been anticipating ""Silent Hill"" with much excitement since I heard about it, and after the fevered reviews here, was expecting something at least on the visceral level of the first ""Poltergeist"".<br/><br/>How wrong I was.<br/><br/>Much of the blame for this movie has to be levelled at Roger Avery. The motivations for the characters in this movie are sub-par laughable, the characterisations non-existent, and the dialogue completely forgettable. There's simply NO story. For reasons unknown to ANYONE with a brain, the lead character takes her disturbed daughter to a town she references while sleep-walking (oh: and someone buys a house WITH a child, next to a virtual Niagra Falls drop-off!?! Gimme a break!) From then on, this is the whole plot: the woman flees a police offer for virtually no discernible reason. Ends up in a spooky foggy town (was anyone else thinking of the ""Maple Street"" original Twilight Zone episode?) Cop briefly arrests woman. (Horribly underwritten scene) Characters lurch from one set of fairly lame (though visually arresting) monster-apparitions after another after each ""Pit Siren"" warning. A bunch of religious nuts are introduced (in a scene rendered in inexplicable pseudo-8mm film flashback, that went on far too long.) And the movie ends in limbo.<br/><br/>I took my girlfriend to see this, a film industry professional who gets scared at totally harmless drivel like ""The Grudge"", ""Ring"", etc. After reading the reviews here, I was actually concerned as we were driving to the move theatre, as I was worried this would traumatise her for days. Her bored reaction as she turned to me during the end credits said it all: ""That Was S**t"".<br/><br/>I was bored, bored, bored, bored by this film. I've got scarier things at the back of my refrigerator.<br/><br/>Kudos to the set designer. Kudos to the FX guys.<br/><br/>Pyramid Head (is this the same character described as ""Red Pyramid"" in the end credits?) is a wonderful, wonderful creation. Sadly, he makes absolutely no sense in the movie, and was woefully underused. (I was expecting at least one more appearance by him towards the end, and felt severely gypped when he didn't show.) If McFarlane don't make an action figure of him soon, they're missing a trick.<br/><br/>If people here think this movie's scary, they need to stop watching their tapes of Animaniacs and try something challenging. Rent ""Alien"", ""The Haunting"" (original version), ""The Changeling"", ""Halloween"", ""The Thing""...just anything that actually makes you jump.<br/><br/>This movie was a waste of my money, and my time. I'm beginning to wonder if Gans is a one-hit wonder."
"mkl_1967","7","0","2","25 April 2006"," Good, but not Great, Silent Hill
","First, I need to make it perfectly clear that I am a *huge* fan of this game series. Because of that, I had impossible to live up to expectations going into it, and I was completely prepared for this movie to suck. Well, I can safely say that the movie does NOT suck. However, I cannot say it is the slam dunk of a movie I had hoped it would be. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I wanted to rate it higher, but there are some issues. Again, this comes from someone thoroughly in love with the games, so your mileage may vary.<br/><br/>The visuals are excellent, and there is a loving attention to detail to try to mimic the world of Silent Hill in this film. The rust and decay of the otherworld is very apparent and it feels every bit as dank and ""oozy"" as it does in the games. The expanded spaces, however, make them feel less ominous than they could have been. Silent Hill is a world that envelopes you, fills you with dread, and ratchets up the tension while you work your way through figuring out what is going on. The games thrive on claustrophobic places, intense decay and a world that warps from (relatively) normal to completely abnormal with the passing of one room into another. While there is an attempt to mimic this, the scope of the movie and the visual scenery is much larger. As such, that tension never quite gets worked up. There are definite moments where you jump, but the ""feel"" that you get from the game doesn't quite get replicated here.<br/><br/>The strength of the Silent Hill games is the engrossing story, and the movie does its best to create a story that uses elements of the first three games and harmonize them, while introducing new and unique story elements for the movie. This is where I think they faltered. For fan-boys like me, there's lots of fan service in the movie. There are many areas where you flash back to the game and see this element or that scenario or that creature. While fun, it's with this blending of old and new that strong enemies of the series are rendered to be just another menacing figure on the screen. The biggest example of this is ""Pyramid Head"". In Silent Hill 2, he represents something *very* significant, and the discovery of what exactly he is drives much of the story. Here, he's just a hulking creature with a really long knife and a tendency to destroy people... and then nothing. Huh? To be fair, the most interesting creatures of the games came from Silent Hill 2, which is much more visually strong in comparison to the first Silent Hill, yet it felt strange to see many of these creatures and so little significance placed upon them. While the attempt to get all of the ""favorite creatures"" in the game is certainly appreciated, it made several story sections feel ""mashed"". Also, many of the new elements (lots of people never part of the games narrative now having large roles, the secondary story with Rose's husband), while they add layers to the story, they don't really add additional clarity. Were I to give any one suggestion to the filmmakers on this (like they'd care LOL!), it would have been ""tell the whole story as it appeared in the game, or create a whole new story"". Flitting between trying to create a story from the game narrative and preserving so much, but then altering many of the points that made the story work so well in the first place, made for some confusing moments.<br/><br/>I was overjoyed to hear during the production of this movie that Akira Yamaoka was doing the songs and the sound effects. In that capacity, the movie ranks head and shoulders with the games. Akira's music and atmospheric noises have always been integral to the story of Silent Hill, and hearing the opening refrain from ""Homecoming"" made for a great buzz and set the stage nicely for the rest of the movie, as did hearing so many other key passages from the first three games. It was also a nice touch to include Mary Elizabeth McGlynn singing two game's signature numbers, ""You're Not Here"" and ""Letter from the Lost Days"".<br/><br/>To those not familiar with Silent Hill, this is a good survival horror film with an interesting and convoluted story. For those who are long time fans of the series, it's a nice homage, and it does a number of things well. However, since this is Silent Hill we're talking about, using adjectives like ""good"" and ""nice""... is a bit of a letdown."

But because of the very last scene of the movie, I was left feeling empty about the whole thing. Reading someone else's interpretation, it kind of makes sense now,but still. I didn't get cone-head's purpose either. He must just be a mini-boss from the game. There was no reason why he was there...unless he was just a manifestation of the ""Darkness"".<br/><br/>But the ending just left me feeling blah.<br/><br/>Otherwise, not too bad.

","The idea is that a child, Sharon, is terminally ill and sleepwalks, often talking of a town in West Virginia called Silent Hill. Her mother, Rose, played by Radha Mitchell, takes her to Silent Hill against the will of Sharon's father, played by Sean Bean. Along the way, police officer Cybil Bennet stops Rose. However, Rose speeds off as Cybil approaches the vehicle. She pursues Rose, and they both crash on the outskirts of Silent Hill. When they wake, a dense fog has fallen on the town, and Sharon has disappeared.<br/><br/>Gans does a superb job of translating the disturbing atmosphere of the games. I was pleased to see he doesn't resort to the ""tap you on the shoulder"" technique of quick frights as a monster suddenly leaps from the darkness or a loud crash sounds in the silent darkness. Contempory horror filmmakers seem to resort to such tactics, sometimes hurdling at you in every scene. Also, the film isn't that gory, which I was pleased to see. At some points, it reminds me of Hellraiser, but the tortured cenobites seem to be played down. Instead, the film is riddled with a disturbing atmosphere, especially when the siren sounds and Gans takes you to dark Silent Hill.<br/><br/>This one really is a unique horror film; however, the film's strong points seem to be the product of video game design, not great film production.<br/><br/>It's true. I am a fan of the video games, and I'm writing to tell you all that if you also are a fan of the games, you may be disappointed. Then again, apparently some fans are pleased.<br/><br/>Gans seems to have been afraid to change much superficially. Several of the scenes from the games are directly translated into the film. The film's score is song for song from the series, most notably from the award winning soundtrack of Silent Hill 3. While it was cool to see the scenes translated in such a way, I hoped for something new because as far as I'm concerned, in the Silent Hill universe, those things already happened, and the film is undermining that. The music, while it is great music, is completely recycled. A whole new score might not have been the way to go. I would rather have liked to hear variations on the original Silent Hill scores. Catching hints of familiar tunes would have been enough to take me back to those same feelings I had, playing the games in the dark.<br/><br/>Gans, however, had no problem with changing major plot points. I wouldn't have minded a whole new story that captured the feel and narrative truth of Silent Hill, but Gans seems to have used a conglomeration of the four games. The problem is the same as recycling scenes from the games that I mentioned above. These things already took place in the Silent Hill universe. In addition, Gans changed a major plot point of the Silent Hill mythology, which the average movie-goer may find sufficient at best. I found the history that the games offered much more effective.<br/><br/>Speaking of story, the script was not very well written. Often the characters' lines seemed ridiculous. For example, as can be seen in the trailer, Rose wipes a piece of ash off her cheek, and then, as if we could not tell, she says ""ash."" Another example occurs later as Rose and Cybil walk through a burned building. It has obviously been burned. The set designer saw to that; however, Gans insisted on having one of his characters say ""looks like there's been a fire here."" While realistically speaking someone may actually say that in such a situation, we start to regard the characters as stupid and obvious because we can see that the building has been burned very badly. This kind of thing is frowned upon in film-making for obvious reasons. It crosses a line of expected interpretation. On the highest level, it suggests Gans thinks we're stupid.<br/><br/>Speaking of set design, though, the special effects and make up are amazing. Most of the monsters are actually latex, and they look very good. Gans did not rely very heavily on CGI, which I was also happy to see.<br/><br/>The strong points of Silent Hill exist mostly in the visuals. While the general story is, simply put, unique, it's not something Gans and Roger Avary are responsible for. The script is just not well written, and therein lies Silent Hill's biggest weak point. I would recommend Silent Hill for fans of the game. While some may be disappointed, it is enough to see that world come to life in an extraordinarily well done fashion. I would also recommend it for the optimistic student or appreciator of horror films. There is value in this one. However, I wouldn't recommend it to the average scrutinizing movie goer. The weak spots are too easily exposed. I gave it a six out of ten because I couldn't quite give it a seven. If you can wait until video, you might be a little happier and a little less disappointed."

Naysayers be damned, this is a masterfully controlled film. Helmed by screenwriter Roger Avary (Remember the hillbilly rape scene from Pulp Fiction?) and director Christophe Gans (Necromonicon), Silent Hill is disturbing, thrilling, disgusting, and beautiful. Instead of relying on cheap parlor tricks that have become a horror staple and cliché, Silent Hill actually warns you when something bad is about to happen, and then dares you not to turn away.

","It might be a good idea to play the game before watching this movie, I personally haven't played all of the game myself, thus making the movie quite confusing at parts and I think that it needed to be a bit longer in order to fully get the audience into the story. The acting in the movie is somewhat believable. I gave this movie a six because it was fun to watch but all together not a terrific film. If I do go see it again it won't be without playing the game first. If your in to the whole supernatural thing with a couple hot girls and the villain from Golden Eye then you might like this one.

","Synopsis: <br/><br/>A mother who is worried about her daughter and her recent bizarre behavior which includes the mention of a town by the name of Silent Hill, desires to take her there in the hopes that once she gets there they will be able to help her. Her husband is less inclined to go and openly states that he believes it will not hold the answer to their daughter's problems. Against his wishes, she goes anyway and once they arrive, the young girl goes missing.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is based off of one of the most scary game series of all time (My sister and friends like watching me play the second and first ones which held, in my opinion, the most cinematic quality to grace a video game. Especially the second one). And as such, it seemed only natural to create a movie adaptation of the game to really expose it to the world. However, there are a few points which need bringing up.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>If you are a player of the game and have enjoyed it, you will doubtlessly be entranced by the way in which the game stays faithful to the atmosphere. The streets which are clouded by a dense fog whilst ash rains down from the sky like a cruel mockery of snow is artfully brilliant and does well to replace the actual snow in the Playstation video game. Everything feels deserted and empty, making one feel very alone. You may even recognize the same eerie camera angles towards the beginning of the film when our protagonist reaches the actual town of Silent Hill. Monsters that were in the game that are also in the movie remain faithful to their original design (Subtle but noticeable changes are apparent, sometimes in design, other times in behavior). The change from a male protagonist to a female one is reasoned very well (As the male protagonist in the game was very maternal towards the care of his daughter).<br/><br/>If you're not a player of the game (Released by Konami), you will still be able to greatly appreciate the horrifying atmosphere, terrifying monsters, and wonderfully executed sound effects (They also the very excellently composed music from the game, which is used notably). Acting is pretty good, with my largest gripes being the inartistic use of the F word a couple times (Yes, you can use the F word artistically).<br/><br/>The first half of the film is excellent and oozes potential and possibility, even if it begins a little less subtly from an artistic point of film-making. The most gripe I had about the beginning was the rather tepid use of dialog. Not great, but not cheesy and frown inducing either. It all runs fine and well and keep you intrigued until the middle, which brings us to...<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>I tried, VERY hard to remember that this was going to be a movie with it's flaws, and would undoubtedly deviate from the games story in a few ways. I try to look at things from both angles before and after making a judgment in any way.<br/><br/>If you haven't played the game, it seems like they lost sight of what made the first half, and even Silent Hill in general, such a place of horrifying intrigue. Any emotion that was in the first half is lost in the second. Characters react unbelievably to their current situations more in the last half than the first, and their acting seems to have taken a large blow. Cliché's pop up more than a few times (In scenarios which characters find themselves and dialog), and gradually, the film goes downhill with a few positive moments to distract. The pacing is a bit off, with a bit of a shallow, unimaginative explanation and ending. It seems as if those who wrote and directed the movie were getting a little to comfortable with their creative license.<br/><br/>Players of the game will note the cameos made, but will find them lacking. Where the game had little explanation of the events which transpired in the game (though had enough clues to piece everything together), the movies will explain everything in thorough detail toward the decent-at-best climax. The storyline is also changed to a point where it feels like just a huge cliché' and not something which was put a great deal of thought into. And again, some incredibly unrealistic reactions from characters, especially ones in torturous and life threatening situations (you'll know when you see it). A very special monster character is dropped halfway through the movie, and it leaves bits and pieces left unaccounted for. I felt only distantly sympathetic towards the heroine close to the end rather than the beginning.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, you may be going, ""Umm, okay... What the heck? Why'd they do that?"" Which is sad, given the great first half. The only reason I personally would want to see a sequel, is to tie up loose ends and rectify acting and storytelling flaws which keep this from being a simply great horror movie, while keeping the same elements such as the atmosphere and the ambiance that made it great. As both a person who watches movies and has played the game, I am built up and then let down.<br/><br/>I still love Silent Hill, even if my faith in it's foundations is now a bit more shaken and cracked than they once were."

","Being, I have been on these boards for so long, I knew the plot. I understood it. After watching this masterpiece of a movie I found myself explaining the plot and games to too many people.<br/><br/>My theory is this . . . The American public is becoming dumber and dumber as the years pass.<br/><br/>To me it was obvious that Sharon and Rose died. This is open to interpretation of course because that is the way Gans wanted it to be. The acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Anna played a naive girl perfectly. The script never got confusing to me. I think this is just a movie for semi-smart people.<br/><br/>The gruesome sequence at the end was a bit overdone, as well as some of the dialogue throughout the film, but it was easily overlooked. The accents somewhat bothered me, as well as some continuity issues that easily could have been fixed. The great lie that hardly any CGI was used in this film is laughable. I saw more CGI than I could count. Not that it's bad, it was just apparent. One phrase slaps Gans CGI myth in the face . . . Barb wire and a bed.<br/><br/>The visuals and music perfectly fit. Right from the game onto screen. It did seem a bit drawn out at times, but I didn't mind at all.<br/><br/>These so called ""Plot holes"" were non existent in my book. It just seems to me that people couldn't understand the movie so they automatically dissed it. but like I said, this just shows the ever growing stupidity of the American public."
"Iceaxe0410","7","0","2","24 April 2006"," Wasn't a bad movie
","I saw the movie today and it wasn't that bad. Of course you do have to keep in mind that I've played a couple of the Silent Hill video games, 2 and 3 in particular. Many aspects in the movie can be drawn from the games and I think this helps the viewer enjoy the movie more if they had played the games. One particular instance includes the appearance of the masked guy with a big large heavy sword. He plays a memorable part in the games. I forgot his actual name if he had one since its been several years since I've played the Silent Hill games, please forgive me. If you haven't played the games I still think you could enjoy the movie. I do have a few complaints about the movie though. The main actress like many movies of this type acts in an irritating manor that I could have just done without. I feel the emotional loss of her child is understandable but it kind of drags on throughout the whole movie up until near the end. This emotional loss leads her to do what a rational person may thing would be otherwise stupid, jumping into action without thinking clearly of the consequences or fear of running into one of the monsters. The other point *spoilers*<br/><br/>is the ending is quite confusing I thought. It led me to ponder the thought that maybe the main character was dead already when she got into Silent Hill (car crash) or maybe she died when she got stabbed, but I don't fully understand. Despite this, I thought it wasn't too bad."

","So the cast and crew says Valtiel and Eddie Dombrowski were characters in Silent Hill? Pyramid Head floored me, I was awestruck, but I never noticed Valtiel. Or Eddie for that matter. Did I miss something obvious, or were they cut from the movie? Believe me, with the references to Silent Hill 1, 2, and 3 in the movie, I WAS looking for Valtiel playing with some valves or something. The cast mentions Henry Townshend from Silent Hill 4 also. Can anyone help me? ""So they want me to use 10 lines. I say, blah!"" I loved the apartment jumping scene, the car ride with the song scene, stuff like that. the little touches of the games really made up for the crappy dialogue, in my book, BTW.

"DJRumpy","6","0","2","24 April 2006"," Might be thrilling for game fans...decent fare for the rest of us
","Hmm..where to begin. I'm not a player of this particular game, so I had no idea other than the most basic, of what the plot involved. The story tends to be a bit slow at first while the mother and daughter characters are developed a bit. Once they hit the town of Silent Hill, the pace becomes quite acceptable.<br/><br/>For fans of the game, I'm sure they already knew the in's and out's of this town, as well as a larger understanding of what was happening. I'm usually quick to pick up plot points, and rarely have to 'think' about a movie. They just make sense. This movie actually requires a bit of thought if your not familiar with the game. I'm still not exactly sure what happened at the very end ;)<br/><br/>The acting is not steller, yet it's not bad. The mother stands out as one of the better performers, as well as the tough as nails cop. Both are likable by the end of the movie. The others don't really shine here.<br/><br/>The movie is two hours, and I did notice that it seemed a bit long at times. Those moments were few and far between though. It has some tense moments, and a few creepy moments, although I don't recall anything that had me clinging to the edge of my seat. That said, the visuals are very good. Think Constantine, although with a little less budget, but very original. This movie is also far more bloody, which in my opinion is a good thing. I'm an adult. I don't need the diet movie when I can see the real deal.<br/><br/>I don't recall the soundtrack at all, which I suppose could be viewed as a good thing if your the blend in the background type. I'm wishing it could have been a bit more memorable.<br/><br/>Acting 6 out of 10. Visual Effects 8 out of 10. Sound/Music a 5 out of 10. Plot 6 out of 10<br/><br/>Overall a 6 out of 10. If your a horror buff, a fan of the game, or just into something that's not your usual hack and slash, this is a decent bet. Might possibly interest those into mysteries, or suspense flicks. You could certainly do worse."
"medinamihalis","6","0","3","24 April 2006"," A good effort
","Finally got to see SH about four hours ago and I haven't quite made up my mind if I like it or not. I think I do. But then again...I don't think I've ever felt this ambivalent about a film before. I am a fan of the original game series, which in a way both helps in understanding the film and makes things a little frustrating. The new take on the Dahlia/Alessa background kinda threw me, not to mention the change in the basis of the local religion. I think it would have probably made a lot more sense had they kept the original background, but then I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to adaptations.<br/><br/>Do I hate it? Definitely not. I did enjoy the movie quite a bit. Little nods to the original game like Rose following Sharon's drawings to the school (still named Midwich...not to mention ""Bachman St."" on the street map) and the air raid sirens sounding before the Dark version of Silent Hill takes over were very fun for me, as indeed was the fact that the three levels of reality in SH were all shown (Normal -where Christopher was-, Foggy -the deserted, ash-strewn version-, and Dark -bloody, rust-covered, and crawling with monsters-). I suppose the only real problem I had was the background change, mostly because the strong basis the entire game series had in the town's dark mythology. Turning it into a ghost town that was abandoned due to a coal fire sucked a lot of the fun out of it for me, as did the change of the main religion from a demonic cult to a puritanical cult (I won't even go into the whole ditched sub-plot about White Claudia), but then again the demon that is referred to constantly in the film is most likely the same one from the first game (Samael), simply brought about by a different circumstance.<br/><br/>So, bottom line I suppose is that while this is certainly a good film in it's own right, I think the original concept was better suited. So, for the moment: 6/10"
"starats","5","0","4","24 April 2006"," Hhhmmmm...
","I think I'm gonna agree with those who thought that somewhere around half of the movie is good. I can completely understand why someone including this reviewer left the movie scratching their heads. Although I don't think the very end worked well cinematically, I can see why it was used as a potential tie in to the next installment. From the little I remember about the games(although I enjoyed the games, I'm not in general a huge gamer or what not)I believe that one has a male character looking for his wife who never returned from Silent Hill. The ending with this motive in mind makes a little more sense, although I could have done without it.<br/><br/>I think for me the problem I have with the movie is it second guessing itself, which is why I didn't really enjoy the second half. In my humble opinion this movie could have been a great surreal horror film if the director or producer or whoever had trusted the visual queues and imagery a bit more. There are many scenes in the beginning that are both beautiful and genuinely creepy. The scenes which go from ash to iron and then back again were extremely beautiful. Once in hell or the iron or fire or burnt side of Silent Hill, the damned or monsters are very, very grotesque and effecting, but I'll have to agree that they all come and go with little consequence to the ending. I mean they never really make an appearance again in the second half(except perhaps the nurses, which in my opinion were neither as frightening or effective as the others). A viewer doesn't always need to know why something is happening. I mean people do have imaginations. I guess the ending just didn't fit. ****spoiler***** I mean witch burning and so forth. There was really no need for the movie to go overboard with this kind of explanation. I would have been just fine with this woman and officer going trying to save her daughter from something, without the ending within an ending within an...hopefully you get my point here. And where the hell was the actual daughter the whole time anyway? She just decided to pop up again at the end? The times the town turned from ash to iron the dark one could not find her. And why did this thing need all this hoopla just to possess her.(shaking head)***end spoiler*** All in all, I'm glad to have seen it free with a pass I got for Christmas and had yet to use. Again, the first half is enjoyable. I think the writer just got carried away; thought too little and gave too much."
"VGrevolution","8","0","2","24 April 2006"," A gritty, unique, horror movie that will take viewers through the darkness that is Silent Hill
","To begin, I was lucky enough to not be impacted by the string of bad reviews by the critics when I seen it. When going to the film I was hoping for a good movie, though I was a bit worried considering it was being kept from screeners.<br/><br/>My background on the games is limited; I have played the first three but never got close to completing them (which I hope to do sometime). so I don't' believe I was impacted much at all by the game's story or really how well this matched up to the games. Anyway, enough talk, let me get on with the review.<br/><br/>It wasn't a movie you could shut your brain off while watching, since it was full of so much symbolism and allowed you to answer some of the questions (the ending was great, in that it was open to interpretation without feeling tacked on for shock value). The important ""protagonist"" character deaths were limited to only one main character dieing, and that scene will stick with me for a long while. That was one of the creepiest sequences I've seen in awhile. Also what the cultists did to Analese when she was a child was truly a disturbing cinema moment.<br/><br/>The atmosphere was superb throughout the movie, with some of the best creature designs I've seen in awhile. Towards the beginning, where the sirens start and things turn black, was a tense moment which snowballed when the demonic children started attacking. This really stuck with me, along with the appearances of Pyramid Head and his roaches. I've read that some people laughed during the ""nurse demon"" scene, but I did not view it that way, it was yet another tense moment along with the end ""Battle"".<br/><br/>One knock I did have against the film was the dialogue (mainly acting) along with many of the character reactions being slightly off base. It seemed at times the main character would be scared when she shouldn't be yet in others she is screaming when it didn't fit with what was going on and what happened.<br/><br/>Besides that, I thought the plot worked great within the context of the movie, it was strange and gripping, at least it was for me. I've had very little experience with the games (they are kind of on the back burner for now), and had no trouble with the plot, which was brought together decently towards the end. The plot was no more video gamey than many Japanese horror movies, and that is ignoring the fact that even if the movie was close to the game, that the game seemingly lends itself quite well to a movie (at least from the basics I know of) To conclude, if you are looking for a film that hands you all the answers, or are looking for top notch acting, this is not your film. Also, like the games, if you want ""boo"" scares, you should look elsewhere, there are a couple but this film is mainly full of psychological scares. Even with my complaints about the movie, I do not understand the bad press it has been getting from critics; it is a relatively smart horror with some of the strangest and creepiest atmosphere I've ever encountered. I suppose it isn't for everyone, but I do think you should give it a shot if you are the least bit interested in a psychological horror. So that is why I enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Overall 7.5 (I am forced to take off points for the sometimes campy acting, and for it being a bit too long)."

","This is a movie that you will either love or hate. I have heard no middle ground as of yet. Lets start off with the visuals. <br/><br/>Visuals & Camera-work-- The visuals are nice and clean when need to be, and gritty and dark when needed. The scenery is beautiful, but this depends on if you think a abandoned city covered with ash beautiful and like rust covered bathrooms(more than just that just using examples). The costume department outdid themselves with a lot. The monsters, sans the Grey children and the roaches, are all real people, and they all look great. Very horrific and 'beautiful' at the same time. Several parts blinded your eyes however when the transition from Dark to Light. (Youll see what i mean when, if, you see it.) - The camera work was very nice. There were a few scenes in the beginning where the camera was shaky but the rest of the movie was clean and smooth.<br/><br/>Sound and Music-- The sound was better than average but could be improved. There were several parts where it was VERY loud (although it was appropriate) but nothing needs to be that loud. Example is when Sharon is screaming and the radio is going berserk, everything is just SO loud. The music however fit in with every scene except one scene where the Rose and a few others are walking to get ready to go to a 'certain spot'. <br/><br/>Story-- Starts off with a conflict, ends with a weird result. The script, i think, is very well written. Most of the beginning consists of searching for Sharon with a break up with a few horror scenes. However some of the subplot things aren't followed up good. Example: The monsters aren't explained that they are people clearly, and it doesn't explain Pyramid head or where the Darkness is coming from. Doesn't explain the demon inside Alessa either. But what can ya expect, most stuff in the games isn't explained unless you look closely or just imagine it up yourself. But its not enough for you to be worried about. There should have also been more monster's stories than just the Janitor's.(who has the same name as me :( ) You may or may not be lost if you haven't played the games or can't comprehend things well.<br/><br/>Overall: This movie wasn't very scary, or as gory as everyone says it is. However, You really get into the movie and the death scenes are awesome. I DEFINITELY recommend seeing this if you are a fan of Silent Hill or played at least one of the games. I don't recommend this to people who want to see a Slasher flick.<br/><br/>And also Don't expect a happy ending.<br/><br/>I'm giving this an 8 out of 10 because I personally loved the movie, and I think it suits the Silent Hill series just fine."
"mathmission","7","0","2","24 April 2006"," ""Silent Hill"" a hit for gamers and movie-goers alike
","One of the important things to remember about ""SILENT HILL"" is that this film is based on a video game put out by Konami, on the Play Station. Seeing as though I am a huge fan of this game series (Silent Hill, Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill 3, and Silent Hill 4: The Room) I was one of those people that had to see it on the first day, first show.<br/><br/>The majority of the audience did not know that this was a game before it was a movie. We all remember the attempt at video game cross-over years ago with Mario hit the screen in Super Mario Brothers. We were reminded again at the poor job of game crossovers when Final Fantasy came out, keeping very little for the original concept of the game. Recently, we were reminded of this event when both Resident Evils came to the silver screen.<br/><br/>BUT LET ME SAY THIS: SILENT HILL WAS DONE PERFECTLY, and that's why people don't like it! I've read countless reviews saying the music was done poorly, mixed poorly, and have even read that it ""Sounds like video game music."" It makes me wonder if anyone did any research into this film at all. The film makers used all original music from the game, even the first one that dates 7 years ago.<br/><br/>Much the same way Sin City was criticized for using strange cinematography; Silent Hill has been criticized for its abstract camera movement, and placement. Again, those that have played the games would tell you that several of the scenes are exact images from the game, including camera movement and style. Tthe monsters were all done with real people inside, something rarely done anymore. This brings a much more tangible aspect to the film. Pyramid Head wasn't just a CGI man walking around.<br/><br/>I don't really want to give much away from the movie, but I can say that the film is a rendition of the first three games: the story is a basic outline of the first and third games, and there are several characters (mostly monsters) from all three. The biggest to note, is the Pyramid Head monster, one of the main characters from the second game. He is somewhat of an undertaker, and is a constant threat in the film.<br/><br/>Silent Hill opens with the exact theme music from the game, and quickly develops into the story: a woman and her search for her daughter in the mysterious city of Silent Hill. Once there, she begins to have nightmarish visions of the world crumbling around her, and turning into a living-hell. She must find her daughter, and more importantly, she must discover the truth about her adopted daughter, and why she resembles the child demon Alyssa.<br/><br/>The point I want to make is that this film is going to get bad reviews. Judge for yourself. I personally, have to say that it's one of the best video game to silver screen adaptations ever done. It's got the violence in it, it's got the screen shots, and it kept pretty true to the actual storyline of the games. I would highly recommend you go see this if you're into horror, and video games. Keep in mind that it's based off of a 7 year old game, and that the film makers were so dedicated to it, that they refused to change even the music.<br/><br/>Though I enjoyed this film on such a high level, I do feel that I should comment on several things that I did not like. Though the film did stay true to the story as much as it could, there were several modifications that stuck out in the form of poor acting and exposition. There were several instances where the characters would start talking about things that happened years ago. Not that that's a bad thing: it just seems to happen a little more often than would be desired. The acting was pretty solid for this type of film, and mirrored the insanity demonstrated in the game. <br/><br/>Overall, I would say 7/10. It's a good film. As an adaptation from a video game, I've known no other film maker to do as good a job of bringing the game world to the screen. 10 of 10 in that department."

Although it does help to understand the movie, it is not necessary to beat the game to understand what was going on.<br/><br/>One of the aspects I didn't like of the movie was that the acting was horrible. Many times I found my self laughing at how the characters portrayed themselves. The main character, like most girls in horror movies, suffered severely from dumb-chick-in-a-horror-movie syndrome, and a lot of her decisions left me yelling/laughing at the movie screen. Two other aspects that I was disappointed at were the atmosphere of the movie and the soundtrack. The soundtrack featured songs from the Silent Hill video games. I never liked many of the songs from the video games because they tried to be emotional, but never really quite made it. The atmosphere of the movie wasn't as scary as the game, and didn't give the same edge-of-your seat type thrill. The game still freaks me out, but the movie just didn't go as far for me."

","I think it's safe to say, that the movie based on the video game ""Silent Hill"" is the most faithful adaption to a video game that has ever been inducted onto celluloid. The movie starts off with a semi-cheesy scene at an awkward pace, but about 15 minutes it picks up the pace. Some genuinely creepy atmosphere akin to the second game, ""Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams"" - a score that is accurate to the game, and some generally acceptable acting made the movie a real treat for horror or video game fans. And I say horror fans with much pride, since that genre has gone wayyy off the handle from ""the good old days"" when horror was a blend of psychological and actual gore. Not this teeny-bopper ""I know who you did 5 summers ago"" ""Jeepers Crappy"" nonsense. This film really pushed the ""R"" rating, with scenes of a young child being roasted alive on an open pit, ol' Pyramid Head from the games ripping off some womans flesh right from her body, then throwing her still screaming body into the church doors as it explodes from the impact. I was like ""wow"" .. I have to see this movie again. They never really go for broke with horror films anymore. I mean, look at ""The Hills Have Eyes"" remake, of which everyone was going on about how good or gory it was. Lets face it, the film was crap. Maybe not as crappy as such remakes Hollywood has churned out in recent times, but still a boring piece of crap I walked out of. ""Silent Hill"" is a must see, however. Thank god it wasn't another ""Resident Evil"" ... Blah."

","I'm gonna sound like an short attention spanned teen by saying this , but silent hill is only really enjoyable when it cuts to the action-stuff like weird mutant babies gallvanting around, a monster with a pyramid for a face freakishly stalking our shreeking heroes and when hordes of satanic bugs swarm the place: When things get creepy in silent hill- thats when things are interesting.<br/><br/>When characters are talking however, things become dull. Christopher gans has succeeded in delivering an incredibly disrturbing looking film with an unnerving atomstphere and beautifully nightmarish set pieces but when it comes to making the characters interesting and the acting decent he falls short-the frights and the creepy creatures is where you'll get your enjoyment with this game adaptation.<br/><br/>Great when its trying to scare you, but dull in other departments, silent hill is worth a watch ."
"castostarlight","6","0","2","24 April 2006"," Beautiful imagery and chilling moments, but a weak plot.
","Silent Hill was the best horror movie I've seen all year, but it could stand to be a bit better.<br/><br/>The good: The imagery was fantastic. Many moments were hauntingly graceful and beautiful, and then others can make you turn in your sleep with horror. The camera angles were fantastic. Many shots made you feel like you were in the scene about to fall into a great chasm, or burn to death on the rotting floor. The monsters were horrifyingly creepy and were done with stunning CG and make-up effects. The first scene with the monsters of Silent Hill had me screaming in terror. The movie touches on very primal fears such as a lack of faith, and losing a child, making a great chill factor throughout the film.<br/><br/>The bad: Though the creatures were terrifying, there were no moments that made you jump in your seat. It was all progressive fear, which can be nice as a change of pace, but not what people want from a horror film. Some of the dialog felt unnatural and corny. The 'cop' character was weakly developed and had a muttled personality. Sean Bean was constantly dropping his American accent, making for strange dialog. Also concerning Sean Bean, the character, 'Christopher', had no resolution; his part in the story pretty much felt completely useless. But the utterly most annoying thing with this film (spoiler) is that it has NO ENDING! The story progresses and starts its falling action, but many things are left unresolved. Your just about to get those final resolutions...and the movie's over. I'm sure there was something symbolic about the ending, but it was simply disappointing. After I was creeped out beyond belief, this horrible ending had me walking out of the theatre regretting spending nine dollars and over two hours of my life. I hope there is a sequel or something, because this film was just one long and scary lose end."

","A deliciously dark film of fear mongering, Silent Hill takes you on a terrifyingly absurd quest. Where to? That is a question this film doesn't answer, but enjoys twisting round you to find it.<br/><br/>Of course playing the game helps understand this film. I found the game itself to be relatively arbitrary and linear, rather like this film. However, the game is foreboding and visually gorgeous, much like this film.<br/><br/>The film contains fantastical set-pieces - demons tearing flesh, walls melting into grills and steam, men swimming in a sea of carnivorous cockroaches. All the time the fiend in question is embodied in the form of a child. Quite how such an assured performance is given by an actress of tender years is perturbing  perhaps Laurie Holden shows a deviant flash of malevolence that comes when you allow a child to get away with anything for one flash of the Bambi eyes? <br/><br/>Not quite the classic the trailer presented itself as being, and sets itself up for a sequel in a rather open-ended manner. But far better than any computer game conversion film you've seen yet."

","Being both an avid fan of the game series and a movie buff, I was really excited to see the film adaptation. If there is one game out there that could actually translate well into a film, it'd be Silent Hill. But alas, many crucial elements of a great film are missing. Director Christopher Gans has nailed the look of the town but has never heard of an editing room. Writer Roger Avary has pulled some of the better plot points from the first three games, a daunting task, only to have everything muddled by awful dialogue. The on-screen chemistry between most of the characters, especially Cybil and Rose, is just downright awkward and even laughable. The redeeming qualities of this movie are too few and so spaced out from one another that you'll stop caring."

","I've got to say, the first 20 minutes of this movie were pretty good, but it was all down hill from there. This movie is terrible. It comes down to the fact that video games usually don't translate well onto film. It's very different playing a game for 20 hours or watching a movie for 2. There's different standards for story and plot. What seems really cool while playing a game seems really dumb if you're just watching it happen. it's fun to solve puzzles, not see someone else solve it. And when you try to apply the boss system from a game into a movie it is even worse. Also, retarded violence is not scary. it's stupid (or can be comic). Capping it off, the acting was pretty terrible. save your money don't see this movie. or just buy the game, i haven't played it personally but i'm sure it's much more entertaining"
"emuprophet","7","0","2","23 April 2006"," Vivid, different, and interesting
","If you would like to hear from a non-gamer/non-biased perspective:<br/><br/>Silent Hill overall is an unpleasantly enjoyable cinema scape. You will spend at least half of the movie with an uneasy feeling in your stomach and they manage to do this without any shock factor. Most of this comes from the cleverly crafted ambiance in the film. The pace, mood, cinematography, and unusual music all align perfectly so that little is needed of dialog. A major problem arises with one specific character which with any logic does not justify their actions/sacrifices let alone their existence, so not much thought was put into character development. Another flaw might be that the dialog is pretty dry. However, I do not believe the film's importance lies in the dialog but is heavily conveyed through its visuals. If you enjoy films that are very imaginative and unique I would recommend Silent Hill."
"RamenNoodle","9","0","2","23 April 2006"," The Best Horror Film of the Year!
","If you love the Silent Hill video games, you will absolutely love the film. Although it doesn't relate to any one game, but it is a whole new story itself while containing locations and monsters from the series.<br/><br/>Pros: So the story is simple. A mother is looking for her daughter who is lost in Silent Hill. While she is searching for her, she encounters some of the most ghastly creatures in film history, and is in the most horrific locations you will ever see. The background behind the storyline is a complex one so close attention is needed but once you get the hang of things, you will aboslutely crave more info on what is going on.<br/><br/>Cons: The acting for some of the characters is just plain bad. You will actually laugh at how horrible it is. There are many walking scenes which could be downright removed from the film. The special effects are great in some scenes but look horrid in others.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Definitely one of the better films of 2006. (We are going at a bad start so far). So if you have'nt played the games, bring a fan with you or research it because it is vital. All in all, a wonderful horror movie."

","OK... I am a 34 year old and I love the Silent Hill video game series. Each one had its own unique level of creepiness and genuine scares. Yet, each one had the continuous, fun similar storyline. So when the movie came out, I was pretty amped. Oh, the disappointment! First, I feel sorry for anyone who has never played a game in the series- they should be as lost as the souls in this movie. Second, where was the senseless violence on the freak shows? Where were the ""inside out dogs"" and the ""winged harpies?"" I spent hours running around in fog killing these things, stomping them into messy spots on the roads, yet the things that made this series so fun were absent.<br/><br/>Now that I vented my frustration- I'll calm down and say it's not that bad of a movie. There were some great spooky, disturbing scenes (esp. the child ghosts/demons). And the story took on a unique twist by actually trying to explain the entire game series. Not a bad idea and they found some way to pull it off. I guess I sound like I have two different takes on this film and I do. If you loved the game, you should like the movie. If you've never played the game, save your money- or better yet, go pick up a used copy of the game and get a real scare."

","(Forgive me if you find another review here by yours truly of this film. I wrote one but now cannot locate it.) SILENT HILL is a very faithful adaptation of a popular video game, according to my 19-year-old daughter. As a movie, it is certainly atmospheric and spooky, although it lacks any real scares, the gore is subdued, and the plot is all over the place. And it comes to an incredibly ludicrous climax. Radha Mitchell searches for her missing daughter in the abandoned W. Va. coal mining town of Silent Hill, only to cross over into an alternate dimension where she encounters a veritable army of creepy crawlies and assorted and sundry monsters. She finds allies in the form of a motorcycle cop (Laurie Holden) and a bag lady (Deb Unger) who also has lost her kid years before. All is made plain by film's end, perhaps too much so. Too much explanation tends to spoil the broth, Mr. Gans. Sean Bean plays the distraught husband searching for his wife and daughter. Mitchell and Bean are competent, nothing more. B movie queen Alice Krige as the head of a satanic cult plays it way over the top. A lot of the dialog is simply laughable, especially toward the end, and the film is too long by half. This is not the second coming of THE RING or THE OTHERS, but if nothing else SILENT HILL looks terrific. The set design alone should be an Oscar contender."

","Let me start by saying i have been praying since 1999 when i first played Silent Hill 1 for playstation that this story would be turned into a movie, and that it would NOT be a game to movie adaptation that falls into the same pitfalls that all of it's predecessor's have. Well I think my praying has paid off! I think the first and most important thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it will not appeal to all audiences. For fans of the game, this is a must see experience, however i can easily see people unfamiliar with the story getting lost or not understanding a lot of what is going on. Fear not though as care was taken to at least partially update the viewers near the end of the film as to what the movie was all about. Gans has done an excellent job of adapting the original game story into the movie, with many familiar characters, creatures, and places. Some of the scenery looks identical to scenes from the game, and the CG creatures look great and very convincing. The only complaint i have about this film was that it almost seemed as if Gans was trying to put too much of the games into the movie (yes i said too much). Anyway, as i said...fans of the game will love this film while others may only see it as a C to B horror flick."
"elandyll","8","0","2","23 April 2006"," Very good horror movie, some average dialogues keep it from being a Masterpiece
","Admitedly, I have been waiting years for an horror movie to pack a scare/gore-punch like that. Squimish at heart, do not apply.<br/><br/>Oh, and gore-fans of pieces like Hostel, do not apply either. There is true gore here, but it feels much less gratuitous.<br/><br/>Last but not least, it probably is the best video game adaptation ever. As simple as that.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple, but still powerful. The movie begins with us being acquainted with Rose (Radha Mitchell -Pitch Black- very good in this movie) and her daughter Sharon who are about to embark on a journey to Silent Hill, where the past of the little girl might be revealed. There, dark and unknown forces are waiting for them.<br/><br/>Christophe Gans (Crying Freeman, Brotherhood of the Wolves) produced a superb movie, graphically and directed masterfully. The acting, from Sean Bean to Jodelle Ferland is really good, especially if we must consider this film as a video game adaptation.<br/><br/>And this is where it hits. Not only does Mr Gans stays true to the atmosphere of the original art, he transcends it by making a wonderful movie. Some critics have panned the film for its video game feeling at times, and for the dialogues. I have to say, on the first point, that the feel of the movie is in that regard original, and goes from very eerie scenes (Rose walking in the town) to pure horror scenes where the director obviously did not want to try to please some ""familly"" target by backing off his original subject : a Horror video game.<br/><br/>Truth be told, this movie could have pretended to be placed on the same level of movies like The Ring or The Thing, but dialogues come in play. And they are pretty bad in some parts, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Now, they are not painfully- bad either, and I still enjoyed the movie very much, having waited a long time for an Horror movie to actually deliver.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mr Gans."

There is a good block of time where the only dialog is the name ""Sharon"" yelled more times than really necessary and gory splatters of body fluids than what I would have preferred, but if any had been taken out I think it would have changed the movie too much. <br/><br/>Pros are simple. You are kept guessing and trying to solve the puzzle one step ahead of the characters, lost of unexpected ""jump in your seat and shriek"" scenes (without the corny old standby of a cat jumping off a trashcan)and a good chunk of background story that makes you want to talk about the movie when you leave the theater.<br/><br/>But....I would suggest seeing the movie before reading the boards, gamers in endless debate down there."

"alexdark06","9","0","2","23 April 2006"," A True review of Silent Hill Non Bias
","This movie is one of the rare movies that can attract maybe both Fans and movie-goers. I can't stress so much how this movie got so many bias, irrational, n stupid reviews. First, this movie is based on the video game but when u watch the movie it doesn't tell you that. The story i close to the first game but changed it to a more simple plot that they can explain and tell within a 2 hour limit. Most people who gave it a low score probably can't comprehend the deep meanings n subliminal clues that the story has. You can't just use only thinking to understand the story. You will need thinking and a high plot analysis skill to understand all the subliminal storyline. Most people don't get it because they can't analyze the story. Or that they don't know anything because they haven't played the game. Even for fans of the game, only a selected few can truly understand everything. You'll need to analyze the plot intensively. Even I thought i understand it but i was wrong when i read some of the plot analysis because i didn't think there would be so many subliminal hints in each and every clue of the entire plot. Even the names of the character has some kinda of subliminal clues hidden in it. It goes to the creations of the monsters. Like in the movie the baby monsters u see is there because of Alessa's power that uses Rose's emotion and dark thoughts to make it real. The babies r created because of Rose's yearning for a child that she couldn't conceive have (because she adopted Sharon)so the monster ends up opening its arms to her as if it wants her to hold it. it grasp onto her like a baby would to a mother. That thought was made real in Silent hill. the monsters and the Alternate world( dark world) is different to every person because it is seen by the darkness in each of the persons heart. it might be similar but different in some ways. a good example of y u see the nurses is because not that she is in a hospital but her regret of not being able to take care of her daughter and nurture her ( as u know nurse take care of people n nurture them back to health). Pyramid head is easy to read because he is the executioner. He is her guilt of losing Sharon so she wants to punish herself for losing her child. So Alessa's power(aka the evil entity's power) made pyramid head real n thus u see him stalking her relentlessly. The reason why Rose always seem to Not die at the moment of death is because Alessa needs rose to exact her REVENGE on Christabella. Who ever goes to silent hill or Drawn to it immense power (its very strong that wherever u are it calls u to it) deserve to die in it. Sharon is a good person but every good person has a bad side to them that they don't show or take action on it much. she has that bad side of her by doing justice that is right. that is helping Alessa exact her revenge. This kinda comprehension n analysis skill is needed to fully understand the complexity of silent Hill's plot. To the guy/girl zychowski2.. he doesn't understand it. Not all fans can truly understand its plot only a few do. and to the girl who is just a plain fan christy jean.. u obviously only play the game n has basic understanding of the story since u didn't get the easy ( throw it in ur face with full explanation Plot hole the movie gave u) story n ending. Rose n Sharon never made it back to their home because Alessa's power (the Demon) is passed on to Sharon. she controlled it now n she was sleeping when Rose drove off. Meaning Sharon only gave Rose a Fake illusion to help her ease down from wat happen by showing her their house again n to feel her husband's presence once more because they will never be able to leave silent Hill. U can tell by the Fog... the bridge was only a Fake illusion as u can clearly see that it is Vaguely an image of the unbroken road leading into silent hill. at the end where they showed the bushes and the corn stalks. It tells u the metaphor of the 2 worlds that u encounter in silent hill. the bush represents the normal world (vis versa) and the corn represent the alternate world (vis versa). all of this isn't expected of everyone to know n analyze. So don't judge it without the correct knowledge. I was disappointed that they throw in some weird dialog to crack some jokes. and that the story was fully explained that the cult is truly behind Silent Hills Evil powers. The hotel is named differently it suppose to be Lakeside hotel not the one in the movie (i might be wrong as i dint't play the first game). This is entirely psychological horror but more of a mixture of Japanese style story telling, psychological horror, and the common scare mixed with malice,despair, pain, sorrow, guilt, evil, melancholy, n disturbed violence. It is true to the core but only changed a few things to fit in as a MOVIE. Yes i have played SH2-SH4 but half way done with SH4. So i can n do comprehend it in a deep thought. I've beaten it multiple times and got all of the endings n played it more to understand it better n to find all of the hidden subliminal things they have in it.<br/><br/>I hope people go to the movies n watch this without nay expectations and keep a very open mind as it might just warp ur sense of reality."

","I kept myself in the dark prior to seeing this film, largely because I did not entirely trust anyone to adapt Silent Hill to film successfully, or even semi-successfully. I was pleasantly surprised to find that most of what I love about Silent Hill is here, and in exactly the way it was originally envisioned, but the faithfulness of this work is also why most people will inevitably walk away confused, or disappointed.<br/><br/>As a film, this is not everything I could've asked for. Ideally, the film would be cold, alienating, unnerving, and more thematically unified. For me to be completely happy with it, I'm fairly certain it would have to be filmed in such a way that absolutely everyone else would hate it but me. Unfortunately, some people besides me still liked it, but hopefully it will gross enough at the box office to warrant a sequel that's even more alienating to people not in its target audience.<br/><br/>In other words, Christopher Gans has succeeded in creating a movie for fans. The shots are amazing. The creatures are amazing. The music is amazing, and the story is (apparantly, judging by the confused reactions of reviewers across the country) nearly impossible to follow if you're completely ignorant of the franchise. All of the elements of this film that work are the elements that are unapologetically ripped directly from its source material. While these elements have been successfully recreated, Gans doesn't really do anything new with them.<br/><br/>However, it's obvious that his intentions were not to convert anyone, and every negative review I read further validates my thinking that this movie is nothing but fanfare loosely strung together with a plot and some sub-par acting. What he's really done is roughly the equivalent of writing a novel adaptation of a film. There's really nothing wrong with that when the source material is as strong as Silent Hill.<br/><br/>As a fan, I felt this was the movie's greatest strength, but being realistic, if I didn't love Silent Hill as much as I do, I would've thought this film was terrible as well. Neither the acting, or the writing are really where they need to be, and there's entirely too much exposition towards the end. Stopping the film to play catch-up at the end was a mistake. This is Silent Hill, not the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Some things were meant to be inferred.<br/><br/>Fortunately, when Pyramid Head flayed a woman alive, nothing could've been further from my mind than any flaws the film might've had. All in all, I consider this film a success, and it grossly exceeded any expectations I could've had."

","My anticipation for 'Silent Hill' has been satisfied. Being a fan of the horror genre in all it's forms I can safely say that this film is not going to be a complete disappointment for the true horror fan and the movie-goer who goes to see a movie and be entertained. We live in an age where we can come to expect movies such as Jeepers Creepers and The Grudge to receive outstanding accolades from fans and critics alike and I am pleased to see that this movie would be thrashed by those same people.<br/><br/>I agree whole-heartedly with a former IMDb reviewer about this film, it is by no means a 'scary' movie, it is not a film to be compared with The Ring or Hostel. This is a Nightmare Drama filled with horrible gore and the kind of soul-tearing views of hell that easily puts a movie like Hellraiser to shame.<br/><br/>As far as the adaptation goes, I must say I am a bit disappointed in the 'all female' cast of the movie - as in the 'Silent Hill' game you played as a man but this is by no means a drawback. It simply adds another dimension to the raw fear that is excellently achieved.<br/><br/>I'll finish this rambling with the quote of the evening, after a particularly gory scene in the movie one of the more vocal movie-goers in the theatre stated this quite eloquently, ""That has got to be some of the most F***ed up gruesome S*** I have ever seen."" How can you possibly beat that? Should you go see this movie? If you want to be entertained and you want to see a movie on par with Jacob's Ladder and Hellraiser. Yes. If your a fan of the video game. Yes.<br/><br/>If your overly critical and can't look past a few misplaced ""captain obvious"" lines of dialogue, don't waste your time or anyone else's, go back to the art-house and wait for trash like Cabin Fever."

","** I don't think I'm giving spoilers...but let's rather be safe than sorry ;) **<br/><br/>I have to defend this movie from those who, unexplainedly to me, seem to ""hate"" it so viscerally. My comment on the movie is excellent, I loved it. And the friends that have seen it with me (and they have never played the SH games) liked it very much too.<br/><br/>Now, my impressions: The director is a fan on the game, and this is really felt in all the little details he carefully places through all the movie. It is NOT a 1:1 copy of the games though...it is heavily based on the story of SH1, and it also steals some cool ideas from SH2 (like PyramidHead)...but it's a completely unrelated story. Many character names, for example, are the same as the game...but the roles and identities in the movie are all different.<br/><br/>The story, as in the original game, is very simple and straight once you get to the end of it. A religious cult...a missing child...tragedies from the past... It's not so complicated to figure out even though, just like in the game, there are many twists and details that make it all so dark and fascinating. As they say: The important thing is not ""the destination""...but the ""journey"" itself.<br/><br/>Technically... All the settings are very atmospheric, the characters do their job very well and the action is well dosed. But there are moments, I have to admit, when the plot is developed somehow ""artificially"". Rose is supposed to be lost and confused...she ACTS as she is lost and confused...but sometimes she goes here and there as if she had a map telling here exactly what to do. Well...I say: whatever! It's a great movie and little bugs like those are not serious enough to earn it a bad rating!<br/><br/>The ending is also awesome. I expected something ""clear"" and definitive (even if hinting to a sequel)...but the director chose one more time to be true to the spirit of the game. Instead of the multiple endings of the game, impossible to translate into a movie, the story was left somehow ""suspended"". First of all, I liked it ""as is"" because it transmits an infinite sense of sadness, so true to the game. Secondly, there are different hints and allusions that can lead to very different interpretations...thus somehow recreating the ""multiple ending"" effect.<br/><br/>An excellent movie :)"

Silent Hill was a great movie, and most of all, it felt like Silent Hill. They used aspects from all of the games, and the scenery was flawless, you truly were watching silent hill on the big screen. This has made my day very great. The people who made the Silent Hill movie did what I wish most would. They made it so that if you had never seen or played the game, you would get the feeling that the game gave off. And that what I want to see, I mean A lot of people who watch these movies are not familiar with the game. There fore they get the wrong image for games such as resident evil. With silent hill you get the TRUE image that the game had created and that all I could ever ask for. You don't have to be exact or dead on, just keep it how its supposed to be. <br/><br/>people could make a lot of arguments about the movie however. I'm sure people were disappointed at silent hill to the extent of how I was disappointed with Resident Evil. But I think they should just relax, because this movie did not mess up the Silent Image what so ever. I mean the music was even perfect. And yeah the Cahracers and story lines were all jigsawed into the movie, but I think the director put all aspects of the game in the movie because he wanted people to know what silent hill was, and not just the first one, but the first three games. I went into the movie theater with no hope for the movie, expecting the worst and to be more disappointed then I had in the past year. But when I watched this movie, it was like a blessing in disguise. Its a groundbreaking Movie thats based off a video game. Its important because its the only one film that has gotten it right. I'm not going to complain about this one. Its managed to restore a tad bit more faith in the movie industry when it comes to game based movies. I would give this film a definite 4 of 5, when it comes to horror."

","This movie is incredible! I've never been so creeped out by anything in my life. Most movies have these unbearably ugly monsters that look like they come straight from the imagination of some twisted freak. In most movies the monsters are shown to us, and we are afraid because those monsters want to do us harm.<br/><br/>In Silent Hill, it's different. The monsters have their own beauty to them, their own uniquity in the sense that they look humanesque. And they all look, rather than blindly destructive, they all look like they're suffering.<br/><br/>Also, in this movie, the very concepts of right and wrong are thrown around. It's so perplexing that, by the end of this movie, I had no idea who was who; in the sense that they all seemed to do evil things, and good things. All in all, a terrific movie.<br/><br/>My only grip is how fast locales change. Dizzying."

","As a huge silent hill fan who has completed all of the games, I knew it was going to be almost impossible to capture the terrifying world of silent hill. They did have a lot of game related aspects, including the musical score.....but they also added some irrevelent parts and kinda strayed from the ideas of the game. They used some of the game monstors, but to be honest they are scarier in the the game. the ending is also just ridiculous, and makes little sense. I was kinda expecting them to mess it up, if they had made it just like the game it would probably be extremely terrifying. If you haven't played the games you should not see this movie, because it will make even less sense. all in all they did factor in the game a fair amount, but failed in capturing what should have been the scariest movie ever, and it is very short of that."
"filmmakerchick19","8","0","2","23 April 2006"," One of the most amazing looking horror movies ever...
","Silent Hill is based off of the Playstation video game of the same name. The story follows a woman named Rose who takes her daughter Sharon to a ghost town called Silent Hill. Sharon suffers from sleepwalking were she often mentions the town's name. So after outrunning a female cop (Cybil) and crashing the car in attempt to dodge a young ghostly woman in the middle of the road they arrive at Silent Hill. However when Rose wakes up from unconsciousness she finds that her daughter is missing and so the movie begins. Now there are two sides to watching this movie: 1) is if you've played the game and 2) is if you haven't played the game. I personally have played all four games but the two people who went with me didn't and they had to same opinion of the movie as I did. First thing is the plot. It does follow the movie in the beginning but however in the middle of the movie to the end it starts to change things. It introduces a cult into the movie which is kind of annoying since Silent Hill is a lot more immersive without 20 or 30 people around. I know it seems kind of a petty thing but it really distracts from the movie in my opinion. The next thing was the seemingly tacked on parts with Sean Bean's characters. I really wish that they would have just cut these scenes from the film. I know the whole purpose of it was to add back story to Silent Hill but I didn't think it was needed. My two non gamer friends and I agreed that it wasn't necessary and they could of just explained the story through Rose somehow. <br/><br/>Now onto the look of the movie which is the high point of the film. I honestly have to say and my friends agreed with me that this film is one of the best looking horror movies we have ever seen. The town of Silent Hill was so well recreated that it was shocking. The creatures were done perfectly as well especially Pyramid Head. But I don't want to say too much about it cause I don't want to spoil it for anyone. <br/><br/>If you are a horror fan I would highly recommend you see this movie. If you don't really like horror movies then I would avoid this movie like the plague. I do think this movie will be too intense for some so watch with your own discretion."
"vampirepoet25","9","0","2","23 April 2006"," Opinions, opinions, who is right?
","So it seems that everyone has a very definite impression of this movie, whether it be good or bad. I will not scream vehemently either way, since I believe that if you like it, that is your right, and if not, that's fine too. No need to go on the offensive. Allow me just to say that at least Gans DID make an impression with the movie, both visually and in terms of his pacing. Without giving anything away, it had its moments where it lagged just a wee bit, but otherwise I felt more creeped out at certain moments than actually playing the game, and mostly because, when playing the games, if I needed a breather, I could put down the controller. Not being IN control changed the mood for me, to one of apprehension. And, although its a left handed complement to call this the best video game adaptation to date, I will say that I'm intrigued enough to see any sequel that MIGHT be forthcoming (although who knows where they could go with it). I hope the DVD, when it comes out, includes multiple endings (ala the games themselves). I'd even love to see the UFO ending or some such thing! But honestly folks, this is a movie that you will either love or hate. It will either grip you and take you on the ride, or leave you behind snoozing it your seat. But the theater I went to was on the edge of its collective seat for the whole screening, with the girl next to me squirming uncomfortably at times. I say see this movie, let it make some $$$, and maybe we'll get more like it, and possibly, if Gans directs the next one, someone else can write the script for an even BETTER movie experience. So see it, tell everyone you know to see it. Let's not let this one flop."
"nervouswreckhana","8","0","2","23 April 2006"," A good film- but you'll probably enjoy it more if you're a fan of the games.
","I'm not going to stand here and say 'you have to play the games to get this film, duh' because well... I don't think you do. A friend of mine who saw it loved it and has never been near one of the games in his life.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a fantastic adaption of the game. It really captures the feeling, look and essence of the Silent Hill games and that was definitely pleasing.<br/><br/>The Plot looks something like this, Sharon DeSilva sleepwalks... and not just little walks either, we're talking walking into near and certain danger walks. Desperate for a solution that doesn't involve Sharon being institutionalised Rose ( Radha Mitchell) goes against her husband's wishes and takes Sharon to 'Silent Hill', a place Sharon speaks about in her sleep.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, en route Rose has an accident, and when she awakes Sharon has disappeared forcing Rose to venture into the strange and foggy world of Silent Hill. It soon becomes clear though that this is more than just some ghost town.<br/><br/>This film is exceptionally scary and equally disturbing, it's not your average run of the mill horror story- something owed a lot to the source material. Only Silent Hill could produce something quite so unsettling. It includes Akira Yamaoka's fantastic music from the games and some wonderful nods to the game series.<br/><br/>Although not flawless ( suffering from spots of bad scripting and a few little disappointments) this is a very good film. Don't listen to the critics and go to make your own judgement. If you've never played a Silent Hill Game in your life this is going to be a bit of a surprise."

","I do not like going to the movie theater solely because a lot of movies are not worth it. Every time I go, I have to buy tickets for both myself and my better half. This movie looked as though it would either be very good or very bad. Fortunatelly it wasn't horrible, and I saw it during a matinée. Is is worth the matinée price but it pushes it's luck at an evening rate. I feel it rushed a little in the beginning. The mother was a little bit irrational. The story was a bit predictable at parts, and the it was missing that scare factor. I feel it wasn't too scary, too graphic, or jumpy at all. I found myself a little curious as to what happened in Silent Hill, so the story did more or less save it for me. The little girl did a great job, the mother was over-dramatic, and the father's role was played great. Don't expect to be scared, it's more like a murder mystery with demon's in it."

","I saw this film with the expectation of jumping out of my seat, hiding my face and wanting to see more. Silent Hill provided hiding my face, but it didn't make me want to see more. The film is very well written and it poses a lot of questions to the watcher. The actors in the film provide very convincing roles, which makes you want to learn more about them. The film does drag on a bit, some people may loss interest, but at the same time, it makes you think a lot about what the film is saying. I would recommend this film, its well written, has a good bit of gore in it and the story makes you think beyond what the film provides you with."
"goofoffco","7","0","1","23 April 2006"," A Diamond in the Rough
","I had been looking forward to seeing what they did with this movie since I first found it listed on IMDb about a year ago. I am a huge fan of the games, but otherwise not much of a gamer. My main love is movies. And by that I mean GOOD movies, not Saw or Devil's Rejects. When I watch a movie it better have an engaging story line (or at least have that magic touch of comedy, a la Evil Dead 2), and Silent Hill certainly delivers. While the plot line of the games is rather confusing, and often gives one the feeling that the game designers didn't even know what was going on (at least for the first two), the story for the movie is comparatively simple.<br/><br/>As far as that goes, it's difficult to say if that's good or bad. I enjoyed the mind-bending complexities of the game, though I understand the need to bring it down to a level where non-gamers can follow. I greatly appreciated the way in which the filmmakers detailed the parallel world nature of Silent Hill, even included the ""real world"" Silent Hill that was never shown in the games. This more than anything unlocks the potential of the storyline.<br/><br/>I must admit that I am not certain where they intend to go with the story, given the changes they made from the game (most notably the nature of the cult and of Dahlia). I am curious though.<br/><br/>Anyway, I have now seen the movie twice. The first time, I went looking for similarities to the games and answers to the questions the games brought up. The movie DOES NOT answer many of these questions, but brings to light it's own ideas of the mythology. The second time, I went to see it as a movie independent of the games, and actually enjoyed it better on its own merit.<br/><br/>So do not go expecting a video game movie, do not go expecting a horror movie, and do not go expecting a psychological thriller. Silent Hill has more in common with the more disturbing scenes of The Exorcist than with any of these. And as an added bonus, the town itself has a distinct personality, and is as possessed as Linda Blair's famous character.<br/><br/>The visuals are nothing less than amazing, with certain angles reminiscent of the foundry at Isengard from Fellowship of the RIng. The comparison doesn't stop there. The makeup effects for the creatures reaches the same level of imagination as those used in the Lord of the Rings, especially when comparing the ""patient demons"" to the snotty orc birthing grounds.<br/><br/>The sound effects are perhaps the most overlooked achievements of this film. The siren used to warn of danger fills the theater, even rattling the seats. The final seen is both a must see and must hear. The sound effects are as punishing and intense as the visuals that accompany them.<br/><br/>As for the acting, however, that leaves something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, it's a vast improvement over the acting in the games, and the performances by Alice Krige and Deborah Kara Unger are very convincing. The performance by Jodelle Ferland is astounding and very creepy, not to mention diverse (you'll understand when you see the movie).<br/><br/>My only real concerns are the weak performances (or just weakly developed characters) by Radha Mitchell, Laurie Holden, and Sean Bean (surprisingly). It is because these faults are so obvious that my rating is weighed as it is. However, those who go looking for subtle gems will find them in abundance. Silent Hill takes a hold and will not let go."

","We all know that most games turned into movies just plain fail. I mean all we have to do is look back upon the Mario Brothers Movie as a perfect example, or street fighter. But with Silent Hill i believe that they almost completely got it right. Granted in the movie there will be times when you wonder about the choice of actors or even wishing for it to end but still the creators managed to get the same feelings across as when i played the game.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be macho but i do not not get scared at movies or most things in life but let me say that some of the scenes in this movie made me think that wow people won't be able to sleep tonight. Silent Hill also manages to stay mostly true to the video game. Keeping enough of the series with it to remind you of why you liked the game but with a new story line that makes you want to stay instead of getting the refill on soda. <br/><br/>I Highly recommend any video gamer to check this out and if you are a silent hill fan then you must go now to watch it."
"valfarablaze","8","0","1","23 April 2006"," Everything that I expected.
","Now, I had been following the creation of the movie from the beginning. Gans made it clear that he was making the movie for the mere reason that he adored the game series. He also was working with Konami, Team Silent, and Akira Yamaoka and they all put the movie together. Also, Gans, from the start, made it clear that the movie will be an adaptation of the game series, not an exact replica of the game, which is highly reasonable and to be honest the right choice, since the movie would have ended up being a 9 hour gameplay, which I had already went through myself, I wouldn't need to watch someone else play it. Gans also mentioned that the movie will be made for the fans of the game series, which should explain most of the negative feedback from critics. Now, the movie got very mixed reviews and over 90% of the negative feedbacks being from critics. The critics argue about the same things, either the ending was confusing, the story was not explained enough thus being vague, the story was explained too much, or they seemed to ignore everything else about the movie and seemed to be so bothered with the 'acting' in the movie that they gave the movie a horrid bad review. Overall, the movie was very true to the game and is a very well done and successful movie to be able to make a true fan like me, the true tough critic of the movie, more than adore the movie. As my final words I say these; if you are a Silent Hill fan you will love this movie. If you are a reasonable horror fan, you will enjoy this movie. If you want to just check it out, you will at the least find something unique on the big screen for once. But then again, if you don't know what Silent Hill is, and you aren't even a horror fan, why in the hell would you see this movie?"
"adam-1068","10","0","1","23 April 2006"," Silent Hill movie remains faithful to its psychological underpinnings.......
","Very impressive. If you had asked me 1-2 years ago whether the movie stood a chance, I would have replied no. Gans has delivered to the game fan base, and has stamped his visual credentials firmly over the top of Team Silent's years of toil. I wonder what Keiichiro Toyama and Konami think of the result? That is not to say, sadly, that the film will be a success. I fear the average movie-goer and horror enthusiast may hit a brick wall here. My feeling is that Silent Hill's creeping dread, alternate realities, highly stylised monsters and complex character histories may confuse. That aside, the positives are there for all to see. A perfect capture of how the first game made you 'feel'. The isolation, twisted normality, creature manifestation, the little girl, perverted innocence, terror and malice. Pyramid head was as delightfully dominating as ever. The town well depicted with the fog. Good to hear the siren again. The visual warping from one reality to another worked perfectly. Characters were generally strong (Cybil and Rose). The Cult exposition was a bit weak though. The ending seems to be getting a bashing on the forums, but it is consistent with how the Silent Hill game endings play out. They are never what they appear. In fact, with Rose and daughter possibly trapped in the 'middle-universe' of Silent Hill - a sequel is an option available. No-one ever really leaves Silent Hill anyway. Overall, a genuine surprise, powerfully envisioned, a little long and some weak dialogue. Thanks Christophe."
"dschnur1","8","0","1","23 April 2006"," A pinch of fog, a sprinkling of darkness, and dash of blood equals the start of a new age for video game films
","As a fan of the Silent Hill video games, I have been waiting for a movie adaptation of the game Silent Hill for about 5 years. Mind you this was before the movies Resident Evil/Alone in the Dark and the absolutely hysterically bad House of the Dead came out. As more and more video game adaptations slipped their way into theaters over the last few years, some how they became progressively worse. Then by some random site, I heard news of a Silent Hill game being produced by one, Christophe Gans who made a movie I thoroughly enjoyed, ""Le Pacte De Loupes"". So I thought to myself, this has to be the one movie that will prove that video games can be translated to the big screen and Mr. Gans would have the perfect vision to guide his team of skilled professionals which included ""Pulp Fiction"" writer Rogar Avary and creature creator Patrick Tatopoulos. So I went yesterday to the theater with some friends of mine and this is what I came out with.<br/><br/>Silent Hill kept me on the edge of my seat, kept me interested, and blew me away in some instances. Let's start with the thing the Gans team did right. Gans nailed the atmosphere of Silent Hill. Everything was perfectly placed, and looked like it was straight out of the game. From the multiple stores, to the odd enemies, to the eerie and sometimes beautiful score by game composer Akira Yamaoka. I was immersed in the atmosphere of the movie, from every time Rose took a step into a new area, to when the nightmare world came to fruition. Also, the Gans team made the right move and made Silent Hill and R rated affair. I was extremely happy to see plenty of blood and disturbing imagery throughout the film. The most impressive thing about the violence in Silent Hill is that its not too cheesy but more on the side of squeamish. The blood isn't firetruck red but albeit a pale red, almost sad if you will. A final thing that I was impressed with is the story. Yes, it can be confusing to the casual movie-goer, but the story pretty much takes the first game's plot and twists it just enough.<br/><br/>*********SPOILER***********<br/><br/>In the first Silent Hill game, Dhalia was the main evil antagonist to the main protagonist (Harry, which in the movie is played by Rose). In the game, Dhalia was the leader of a cult who was trying to bring a demon god named Samael back to life using Alessa and Cheryl(Sharon in the movie). In the movie, the ""fanatics"" are just stuck in the 1600's and try to rid witches by burning them at the stake. This fanatic group was headed by Chritobella, not Dhalia. Dhalia is such a neutral character in the film which really surprised me because I had so much disdain for the character through the first Silent Hill game. Also the final battle in the first game is against Samael (the merging of Alessa and Cheryl). In the movie, the final extreme death scene is just the burnt Alessa from hell getting her revenge. Quite Different you see.<br/><br/>*******SPOILER END***********<br/><br/>Some things were definitely wrong with the film as well. For example,the sequence of events leading up to discovering Silent Hill was poorly done. It seemed like Gans just wanted to throw together a bunch of random scenes involving no reason for the audience to care about the characters. Another thing that was done poorly in Silent Hill was the pacing in the film. Don't get me wrong, I didn't feel the movie was long, I just felt that having Sean Bean's story in there was pretty pointless and frustrating. His story intertwine's with Rose's, taking the audience out of the adrenaline pumped atmosphere of Silent Hill to Mr. Bean's frantic search for his wife. <br/><br/>Silent Hill was a success in the end. It provided me with a reason to have faith in video game adaptations. It's about time too because a whole new slew of bound to be horrible video game films are about to be released on ""quick fix"" America. Directors and producers should take a cue from Silent Hill and the Gans team. There is hope in the future for this genre of movies and Silent Hill just took the first step in that direction."
"vcalio","5","0","3","23 April 2006"," Good horror, but the story makes no sense...
","Let's get one thing clear right from the get-go: This film's plot makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Even the ""explanation"" given at the end of the film as to why the demons/ghosts (or whatever you want to call them) are so ticked off really doesn't explain the story, the origins of Sharon, nor does it add to the story in any way whatsoever. Also, if the film's main character, Rose, were an actual person, she'd be the dumbest person who has ever walked the face of the earth. There is absolutely no rational explanation for half of the things she does in this movie, including speeding away from a cop at 100 miles per hour with her daughter in the car.<br/><br/>That being said, however, I will say that this film does deliver the goods in terms of horror and gore. The visual style of the film is downright creepy, and there is enough blood-splattering to rival any of the great horror movies (including a woman getting the skin ripped off her body; and the barbed wire massacre at the conclusion). The only criticism I would have is that the film's greatest monster -- a dude with a giant, metal triangle for a head wielding a machete that is so freakishly big it's almost comical -- is not shown enough.<br/><br/>All in all, the story makes no sense, but the horror and special effects are great."
"leeandfong","10","0","1","23 April 2006"," The game was a puzzle and so is the film - Deliberately.
","It's rare to see a film so equally loved and misunderstood by so many people and it reminds me of a few other great puzzle movies that take time to decipher and accept. Two big similar puzzle movies are 2001 A Space Odyssey and Mullholland Drive - both completely indecipherable at first, then slowly (often with help or by reading the book) it all begins to make sense until they begin to feel like masterpieces.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is one of these movies but its the first to be a Saturday-night pop-culture crowd pleaser and this is what makes it unique.<br/><br/>The video-game original was essentially a big puzzle made up of smaller puzzles; you wander around a town collecting clues and solving riddles to be rewarded with a fragment of story. Clearly and very cleverly, the film does the same thing and has skillfully managed to involve the viewer in a puzzle solving mystery. The plot is all there, it's logical and it makes sense, but the exposition is totally illogical and scatter-shot.<br/><br/>This story would have been so easy to tell with a normal five act narrative, with answers to all of its questions and coming from Gans (who's previous films have been solidly executed) it seems strange he would lose plot-logic on a story so mundane.... The truth is, he didn't lose the plot... he's warped it. The story exposition is deliberately given out like random jigsaw pieces with just enough thread of narrative to keep a basic idea of what's happening. Clues are hidden in the background, in the sets (take a close look at the paintings) and in the dialogue. Everything you need to know to understand this movie is right there... but it doesn't make sense because you've been presented with a twisted enigma, a nightmarish puzzler that keeps you awake long after the vicious visuals have lost their impact.<br/><br/>This puzzle wasn't the random aberration of a lunatic scriptwriter and a backwards film editor. At some point the creative team sat down and asked the question ""how can we bring the game experience into a movie?"" They made a conscious decision to trick our minds by messing with the standard film narrative and challenge us to something more interesting; they've forced us to think about it and work-out the story from the clues. This is a video-game conversion unlike any other in that they've captured the very core and essence of the game playing experience.<br/><br/>To judge this film as a movie, and to give it a 'movie review' based on 'what we expect from a film' then the score would be pretty low. Silent Hill does not follow convention or help us by making a pleasant story to sit back and enjoy. It hurls us into a twisted nightmare world of shifting environments and parallel dimensions without explaining why. It does away with exposition and character development in any ordinary sense. If you are the kind of person who needs the answers given to them then Silent Hill may not be for you. But if you're a thinker, a solver, a gamer or someone with a curiosity of intellect then Silent Hill is the movie you've waited for.<br/><br/>This film isn't about running down corridors and shooting monsters. It's about you, being smart enough, to break its code.<br/><br/>The film makers have thrown down the challenge.<br/><br/>Dare you. Dare you. Double dare you."

","Silent Hill, i mean what can i say about the games. The games have been one of my favourites of all time and still till today will be. Silent Hill the movie on the other hand did an amazing job, like everyone else had said, yes the visuals, the looks, the feeling, everything bout it feels the same as the game, even the storyline was silent hillish and amazing. 9 out of 10 is what i gave it. i would love to give it a 10 out of 10, but there were some little things that i thought could have been better. *spoiler : It could have been better if they did not spend a lot of time trying to explain 3/4 of the movie, another thing is the real world with Chris her husband, i mean it was a cool idea but every time the movie went there, the mood of silent hill dies, and then have to get used to when it goes back to silent hill, which is unlike the game. Another would be if they made her actually be alone most of the movie, fight the monsters, and have MORE searching around the school/hotel/church and have a map or something, finding more clues and all. It might seem a lot of things i didn't like, but i really loved the movie in total. The ending was perfect, the story is a bit confusing but i understood it of course, which is why i loved the bit of complexity of it the way the games are. Ending was just amazing i tell you, knowing that there HAS to be a Second one, which i cannot wait for.<br/><br/>This is what i think the sequel might be. I think there were things we did not like much about this because it was just getting us ready for the sequel which will be the husband trying to find his wife in silent hill (just like SH2 game) and he will be using a Pistol and fighting the monsters :D, and no need to explain Silent Hill and just be in its HELL World :D. I think it's perfect, and that the sequel WILL BE AMAZING. This first SH movie i think is just a sneak preview of how amazing the sequel is going to be.<br/><br/>I hope this comment helped and i know it is a bit long, but i just can't stop talking about it. I watched it twice already :P."

Fortunately, I needn't have worried. <br/><br/>Silent Hill is fantastic. True to the games, but entertaining and explanatory enough for those unfamiliar to enjoy; genuinely disturbing imagery and concepts with a convincing cast.

"zychowski2","5","0","4","23 April 2006"," Overall unimpressed
","Overall, Silent Hill could have been improved by a LOT. I felt the whole movie failed at cramming in important storyline from the games and many of the events fit together extremely poorly. To someone who had not played the games (I had only heard about them from friends), the viewer is left wondering about almost the entirety of the movie. Pyramid Head's appearance seemed random at best, and the cult by the end didn't seem as evil and terrible as they should be.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I didn't actually play first hand any of the games, but from what I understood they were mainly strategy/shooter games, sometimes paralleling a Resident Evil atmosphere. The movie lacked excitement that could have been brought forth by many more creatures and ferocious beasts, and maybe more weapons for the protagonists than a police issue pistol. Many of the parts that were frightening were just weird or disturbing, not scary, and could have been demonstrated much better.<br/><br/>The ending I didn't understand at all. It seemed that the roles were reversed, and I got the feeling that the mother had succumbed to the devil and became evil instead of remaining the good, caring mother she was. It seemed that the cult did have just cause at the end (with the exception of killing the cop) because with everything that went on, who wouldn't believe that they were evil? From what I understand from what friends have told me, the cult was associated with the anti-Christ, which was completely left absent from the storyline. That seemed to be ridiculous to me, and I couldn't understand why they left such important aspects absent.<br/><br/>The whole movie was held together by no more than weak thread and many of the scenes didn't make sense or fit into logical chronology. I feel that if the movie was instead elaborated on and put into multiple movies, it could have had much more potential to be a great hit. I might get flamed for not playing the games, but in reality, if a movie can't be understood without playing the games, it shouldn't be made into a movie.<br/><br/>The only reason that this movie didn't get a lower 2 or 3 out of 10 was the terrific use of effects. The monsters were very well made and I got a real sense of evil throughout the time of the dark dimension. I have seen much worse movies, and the realistic characters and events developed through CGI amazed me. The gruesome bare-handed skinning and barbed wire shredding seemed incredibly realistic, and disturbed me more than any movie has ever before. That gets my respect, despite how disturbed I truly was.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 5/10. The movie was poorly written, but was developed fantastically, counterbalancing it from a lower rating."

"Sandy-99","6","0","2","23 April 2006"," You can't make a film out of a video game
","Silent Hill attempts to overcome a simple, but almost insurmountable challenge: films and computer games are incompatible. They may draw on some of the same reference material and use similar techniques, but the single fundamental element of a game that makes the player persist to the point of addiction is that the player is personally involved: in films, it isn't. My own direct experience of games, and my observation of my sons' ""growth"" from Sonic to Zelda to Silent Hill confirms this. It's me as Sonic/Link/Rose Da Silva; I must collect the rings/masks/clues; I am threatened by Robotnik/witches/the undead. My pulse rate rises, my palms sweat and I feel my chest tightening as my health meter runs down and I am failing to defeat the enemy.<br/><br/>For this to be achieved in a movie, the writer/director must transfer your allegiance to someone else and since this instantly puts you out of danger, that transference is critical. When Ripley says ""Get away from her you bitch!"" in ""Aliens"", you want to cheer because you have been drawn not just into her world, but into her mind - her emotions, her fears, her maternal need to protect Newt. James Cameron and the writers fulfilled the first law of mainstream storytelling - make your audience identify with the protagonists. For Silent Hill to succeed, the writer and director have to solve this dilemma and also to resolve the other incompatibility which is that story is of secondary importance to a computer game. In a movie, story (and I don't just mean plot) is everything. Other gamers may disagree, but I don't believe that it is plot and character imperatives that drive you from level to level: it is the need to solve the next puzzle or meet the next ""boss"" that is the prime motivator. Provided that you are happy with the overall playability, and the genre appeals, you'll keep playing. In fact, the cut scenes used to tell more story are a distraction and irritation, rather than a compulsion. Some of the best movies are very simple in plot terms (Jaws is a supreme example) but whether simple or complex, all succeed when storyline and characters are coherent and involving. <br/><br/>In Silent Hill, the plot outline is simple enough. Rose must find out why her sleep-walking daughter cries out ""Silent Hill,"" and, in going to the deserted town, puts both herself and Sharon in peril from an assortment of evil creatures, some infernal, some merely human: will she find Sharon and escape to safety? Had this been the single plot line, Silent Hill may well have worked. But in the opening scenes it fails in almost every respect to engage us with Rose or Sharon or Christopher. or to enlist our sympathy with the family's predicament. That leaves us with the secondary pleasure of enjoying the photography, sound and visual effects; checking the obvious connections with the game origins (running from room to room picking up useful objects and clues and meeting the occasional horror) or spotting the odd film reference - the Midwich School (for Cuckoos, presumably) and The Omega Man showing at the local multiplex.<br/><br/>Horror fans will not be disappointed by the quantity of gore, and the appearances of Pyramid Head and the overtaking of the town by Darkness are very effective, but the plot-turn (you couldn't call it a twist) away from the infernal creatures towards the tediously conventional witch-hunting scenario is clumsy and all those who thought that Christophe Gans' promise that this would be something different might actually be realised are likely to be disappointed. Only the downbeat ending, which confirmed what some viewers failed to grasp earlier as the typical fantasy plot device of people searching in vain for each other in separate but parallel worlds, appeared to offer something out-of-the-ordinary. The trouble is that by then, I actually wanted the satisfyingly conventional: a reunion. Instead, I got a set-up for a sequel, one that, if it is to be any more successful, must either abandon the PC game roots or embrace them whole-heartedly and find a way to emulate the first-person visceral thrills. Might Peter Jackson et al achieve this with Halo? I can wait to find out!"
"JAMESK2000","5","0","3","23 April 2006"," It makes up to the games, is visually stunning, but lacking in some respects
","Silent Hill is a popular video game series which made its debut on the original Playstation over 6 years ago. It was based on the imaginary town of the same name, where the player had to solve puzzles and fight through hordes of hideous monsters, throughout a landscape constantly morphing between an eerie foggy realm to a terrifying nightmare like domain after the sounding of an air raid siren. The games are widely considered as being packed full of suspense and artistic imagery, with a suspenseful soundtrack and highly imaginative and intricate plots.<br/><br/>Those of you who are interested enough to make it this far may begin to comprehend how an ambitious adaptation to film this video game franchise would likely be. A fast paced pop-corn movie seen with such adaptations as Doom and Resident Evil would not do. And to accurately convey the horror experienced by Silent Hill game players something with more realism than an entirely CGI movie (as seen with Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within) is requisite. Herein Silent Hill exceeds all its predecessors.<br/><br/>The film opens with Rose (Radha Mitchell) shortly followed by Christopher (Sean Bean) chasing after their sleep walking daughter Shannon (Jodelle Ferland )as she nearly plunges to her doom at a nearby waterfall, who once rescued is persistently repeating the name ""Silent Hill"", a town now evacuated due to an underground coal fire still burning 30 years on. It seems that Shannon's episodes are worsening despite her medication. Rose decides to drive Shannon to this town so that she may remember some sort of dark past. On the way we are introduced to a wiry female cop Cybil (Laurie Holden), who seems to think Rose is mistreating her daughter enough to pursue her, leading to a car crash which leaves Rose stranded in the middle of Silent Hill, with Shannon no where to be seen.<br/><br/>After seeing the spooky and deserted town we are quickly introduced to the nightmare realm and first set of monsters. Whilst searching for Shannon, Rose makes her way through hellish surroundings, fleeing from a terrifying demon ""Pyramid Head"" (a character from one of the video games), and is eventually led to a group of cultists, led by sinister Christobel (Alice Krige), who are some how responsible for the towns predicament.<br/><br/>The film certainly contains both the spooky look of the foggy and snowy peaceful side of the town, and the dark, oily and bloody look of the hellish equivalent from the game. The monsters look pale, cold and evil and are perfect recreations of the game characters, especially Pyramid Head, despite minimal CGI modification. Camera angles are used well (sometimes copying the angles used by the game) as is the sound track (often exactly the same as in the games, one for the fans) , which both put the viewer on edge. The audio and the visuals make the film as close to the audio and visuals of the game as can possibly be, and will strike non game fans as the most intriguing area of the film.<br/><br/>But regardless, is Silent Hill a good horror film? The beginning of the film looks very promising, containing a spooky sounding piano piece natural to films of the genre. The looks and sounds of the remainder of the film are stunning make an excellent nightmarish atmosphere, and are possibly the most memorable part of the film. However the character interaction and dialogue are underwhelming, it feels as if much of the film simply doesn't work. Once in the town, the screenplay gives the impression that Rose is being controlled by a game pad as she fumbles about a school and a hotel looking for clues, it is as if we are watching a demo of the game. The dialogue is just as monotonous and primitive as in the first game on the now dated Playstation 1, Rose and Cybils dialogue seems almost laughable at times and Alice Krige's character is essentially the Borg Queen as seen in Star Trek: First Contact, minus the synthetics. English Sean Bean's American accent is as poor as it is pointless. And what of the shock value, where you are made to jump out of your seat, as expected in horror films? Despite many potential chances, only a couple are made, and feeble ones at that. Apart from the hellish looks of the scenery and monsters, it seems the only attempt to satiate a horror audiences appetites was to fill scenes with gratuitous and unnecessary gore.<br/><br/>And the plot. The original plot consisted of some cultists trying to use a magical girl named Alessa (also the key character in the film) to summon their god. The plot in the film is more about a maltreated manifesting spirit taking revenge on those who did it harm, similar to what we have already seen in The Ring and the even the more recent horror movie An American Haunting, released shortly prior to Silent Hill. Silent Hill originally may have been a game but had an intricate storyline. Although the film closely follows the first game in the series in terms of scenes and characters, the plot has been completely altered. Is this to be expected with the release of The Da Vinci code, in principle another adaptation of some source material to film? I think not. However the storyline is told vaguely enough, with an interesting open ending, to indulge viewers to deep contemplation of what happened and why in the film.<br/><br/>To summarise: visually stunning and intriguing artistically, but with atrocious dialogue, ham acting, little shock value and too much gratuitous violence, but then again an interesting open ending. Perhaps this like many other adaptations is one you will either love or hate."
"alexhornbye3","7","0","1","23 April 2006"," Silent Hill should have been a silent movie
","As a player of the games on which this film is based I firstly have to say that the director and design team nailed it completely. The wide streets, the darkly lit alleyways, the backtsreet garages; ALL were there. I was in Silent Hill. Unfortunately, I was also surrounded by 2D characters, pointless plot developments and flat dialogue delivered straight out of the dubbing booth.<br/><br/>The film is crammed with so many of the game's references, that it's difficult not to be impressed by the visual achievement; but a film the game is not, and while it provides a 'cinematic' experience whilst playing it, to directly transfer (it seemed to me) everything, every tiny element from the game's history, opportunities for originality and dramatic tension were lost. I did find odd little touches funny - Rose wandering into dustbins and school desks; elements that players have experienced many a time, by over-running down corridors, or through deceptive spatial awareness. I admire the way the writers used elements of the game play to further the story: Sharons drawings led Rose to SHs most well known areas, the 'glint' of the special item in the janitor's throat, and Rose's memorising of the hospital map (not the right one, by the way) leading to the final denouement.<br/><br/>Set pieces in the film will stay with me for a long time for pure visual audacity. Much has been made of the Pyramid Head character, and the creation does not disappoint, providing two of the most memorable scenes. In fact the film is fairly unflinching in it's violence, and much like playing SH it's anyone's guess who is next to meet their maker in blood-drenched 'game-over' style. Having said that, it wasn't nearly as disturbing as I thought it was going to be, or as the games can be and sometimes I wanted it to take me a bit further into the nightmare, to really leave me with no way out.<br/><br/>Music from the games seemed to have been used throughout and not always successfully. One of my favourite moments is from SH3; Heather being driven home by the mysterious detective. All of a sudden this Portishead-esquire dub starts up, and we are treated to the fantastic 'Letter - from the lost days'. When the intro cranked up early into the film, I got excited, but after about 5 seconds the song was reduced to in-car radio audio and was barely heard. Oh, well.<br/><br/>A very interesting effort and a not entirely unsuccessful go at the genre. I think Christophe Gans should be allowed to be freed of the fans expectations, next time, and maybe create his own myths surrounding SH, whilst treating us to his unique visual style and interpretation."
"tylerschell","5","0","2","23 April 2006"," Silent Thrill
","Silent Hill was a disappointment. Now granted, I have never played the game and wonder if familiar players take more away from the film? The premise is a good one, the execution is simply terrible. The acting was atrocious, and I am a Resident Evil fan so this is saying a lot. The young child did a fine job but the mother was laughable, though she did not exactly have the best dialogue to work with. The cop was something out of a 80's B horror film.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film attempts to throw you directly into Silent Hill without any character development, especially on the part of the father, in a hasty attempt to get to the CGI. This is the first clue that there is not much depth to the movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are the only part of the movie where it excels. The combination of the town's sirens and the appearance and movement of the town's spirits, especially the armless cocoon ones, are impressive. The nurses are strangely comedic. I expected a dance beat and a Gothic disco ball during their movements.<br/><br/>I think that this film could have been a great horror movie. It was not. It rode the line between Horror B Comedy and straight modern horror. I am sure it did not intend on the audience laughing at any point in this film, a sure sign that the desired effect was missed.<br/><br/>Overall, first 30 minutes of the film are beyond horrible, but if you do not walk out at that point, the movie does improve. I gave it a 5 because I did not like it, nor hate it. I did not want my money back but I don't ever desire to see it again. There are no thrills in this film, just a bit of gore and plot.<br/><br/>I do have to say though that part of the desired effect did take hold on me, much to my dismay, as I very hurriedly made my way up my apartment stairs after the movie, looking behind me as I climbed."
"adamsweetman10","9","0","1","23 April 2006"," Stunning and faithful video game conversion
","First of all, if you are a fan of the games, you are in for a treat. Silent Hill is very faithful to the games, from the music, the town itself, ""other"" silent Hill and the monsters. Unlike doom which was ""loosely"" based on the games, SH feels as though it has been created by fans and players of the game itself.<br/><br/>Whilst this isn't a 100% faithful conversion, with elements from all the games being thrown in, the story loosely follows that of the first game, with a woman (slightly unnecessary gender change from the first game) crashing her car on the way into Silent Hill, once revived, she finds the passenger, her daughter who has problems with sleepwalking and always talking about the town, has disappeared.<br/><br/>From there things get spooky, then nasty, then spooky, then nastier, then spooky, then downright disturbing. It's such a welcome relief from the current flood of ""little dark haired girl wondering around spooking people"" films that started with the Ring, and have now been drawn out to total boredom. For those who aren't familiar with the genius of the games, imagine the best parts of Clive Barker mixed in with the best bits from ""the ring"" creators and you are quite close to the money. The film deserves Oscars for it's use of sound and set designs, possibly the most impressive I have ever seen.<br/><br/>the are some issues however, Sean Bean's role as the worried father is somewhat defunct and does ruin the pace of the film entirely. some of the acting can be somewhat lame, from Sharon and Anna in particular.<br/><br/>But all in all this film made me, as a die hard fan of the games and someone who likes horror movies themselves, extremely happy and the fact that I have seen it twice in one weekend is testament to that fact.<br/><br/>go see it now!!! P.S. Pyramid Head is the absolute mutts nuts, one of the most disturbing creatures ever to appear in game or celluloid."

"soulst0p","7","0","1","23 April 2006"," A Horror/Suspense Video Game Made as an Action Movie
","As far as films adapted from video games go, Silent Hill is probably the best there is. And while that doesn't say much for movies of this type, Silent Hill the film does a good job of hiding it's video game origins and staying true to them at the same time. It's apparently a more difficult process in game-to-film adaptations than it seems, and Silent Hill gets it mostly right.<br/><br/>That being said, if you are a fan of the game, you will almost certainly enjoy this movie. The look, the sounds, and the themes are all here, are done an immense justice. In fact, the visual elements of the film are absolutely superb, and all credit is due to the people responsible for getting the look just right. Not only was this movie beautifully shot, but the designs, locations, costumes, and special effects all look great, and blend together perfectly. Unfortunately, the other elements of the film didn't quite match up.<br/><br/>The primary fault of the film is that it fails to build tension. While the game was great at creating a sense of paranoia and general unease, the film doesn't quite give you the same feeling. It may be perhaps the main characters appear too strong-willed, and that the director does not allow them to feel the same fear as we should. It may also be that because of the director's very love of the source material, his desire to show us everything he threw in the film takes away the viewer's fear of the unknown. It's that fear of the unknown that the Silent Hill video game perfected, and what the movie Silent Hill seems to get wrong. As much as fans love to see the monsters, they're in your face way too often on screen, and all the scares become more gore in nature than suspense. In fact, the towards the end of the film, the gore becomes excessive, another thing that detracts from the suspense, and leads us into more action/horror territory.<br/><br/>Overall, for fans of the game who want to see it brought to life as a film, it comes recommended. But those who are unfamiliar and are expecting a decent horror film will be minimally satisfied by a movie that, ironically, tries to be too much like a game."
"jeff-coatney","4","0","4","23 April 2006"," Doesn't live up to the trailer
","I did not know that Silent Hill was first a video game until a couple of days before I saw it. However, the trailer alone was enough of an incentive to plunk down $20 for two tickets. I would pay the filmmakers $40 more dollars to get back the two hours of my life they took from me. It seems that for all the ""edgy"" and extreme imagery that the filmmakers had at their disposal, not one frame of this film was the least bit scary. I sat in a theater in Burbank, CA, on day two of the release in an auditorium that was half full and at least half the audience howled in fits of (unintentional) laughter. Some of the situations in the film are so ham-handed that they elicited giggles from the audience because they were so ridiculous. I'm waiting two weeks for this thing to open, thinking I'm going to see some scary stuff and this movie is remarkable for the utter lack of any scenes or imagery that is dread-inducing. There were at least five walk-outs in the first thirty minutes and I hardly ever see that when I go to the movies. I will give the movie this kudo; the concept artists they hired to design their creatures was money well spent. But instead of seeing this movie, I think I would have rather browsed the artist's portfolios looking at their concept designs for two hours. Better luck next time..."

","This is one of the few films that I have trouble saying it is either definitively awesome or totally crappy. Though for writing sake Ill say it leans towards crappy.<br/><br/>Silent Hill follows the desperate search of a mother for her sleep walking daughter, whom she has (they give a fairly lame excuse for it) taken to the ghost town of silent hill.<br/><br/>Of course girl goes missing after a minor car accident and we watch desperate Momma try and figure out where she is and what exactly happened in this town to make it so freakishly twisted.<br/><br/>And let me tell you thats where the movie shines is the twisted. Visually this movie is very scary, the varied denizens of the town and all its twisting realities are the stuff of true nightmares. Unfortunately so are parts of the script.<br/><br/>My real problem with Silent Hill is that it has a lot of potential story wise but some major plot holes really screw it over. The reason for the towns burning is eventually given but not a very clear way. The origins of the evil are again mentioned but not really expounded on. And the origins of Momma's little girl are fairly hard to believe (as is the whole who is the her real father question, something that is never answered). Some of the dialogue is a tad cheesy and a fair amount of the directing could use work (The female cop wearing stereotypical shades at night is minor but really annoying when I think about it...I mean c'mon who wears sunglasses at midnight?) The final scenes of the film are a pretty big let down. I came away wondering if the mother (and symbolically the forces of good) really did win, and what exactly was going on.<br/><br/>Silent Hill definitely is better than most video game to movie adaptations but it still has a long ways to go before it equals far better films in this genre.

","Went into this film for one reason only -- it was directed by the same man who directed Brotherhood of the Wolf. Stayed in the theatre, despite my husband's restless grumpiness at being forced to watch the subsequent splatter and gore, for one reason only -- Gan's directing. The man truly, truly understands the power of light and shadow, and has a delicate touch with not only camera angle, but also the composition of his shots. LOVED the creepiness and dreamy quality of the ash-covered, shadowless town, drowning in the constant silent fall of fluffy, beautiful, deadly ash. LOVED the way he frames faces (even those which we do not particularly want to see) in complex angles; doorways, set components, and juxtapositions of anatomy. LOVED his color control -- monochrome greys, sparked with crimson, hot orange, and purple; warm breaths of yellows and tender ochre acting as a heartbreaking contrast. He's not afraid to fade to black, or blank out the screen with a scream of white, either. Though this film had plot and characterization inadequacies, and though I feel that it was a subject unworthy of this director, the images in it and the psychological enigmas reinforced by that imagery are very compelling. Gans is a master, though this is not his masterwork. Can't wait for the next one. The man is a cinematic artist."

","For the first hour or hour and a half of this movie, you'll be mesmerized. This part of the film is completely fantastic. The mood and atmosphere are perfectly laid out, and are very close, if not the exact same as the games. The set up for the climax and end are great. The scene in the school with Red Pyramid will leave you completely nerve-racked.<br/><br/>Then something strange happens. Rose enters the room in the hospital with her daughter. The history of her daughter is then fully revealed. And the movie turns to total crap. From here on out there is really no suspense going into the climax and end at all.<br/><br/>I have a tolerance for gore, but the level of gratuitous gore in the death of Cybil and final confrontation scene is ridiculous. There is no point in it. It doesn't even really recognize the sheer bloodbath as something wrong, just the revenge of the girl. Dhalia does say ""What have you become?"", but the line seems very much carelessly thrown in. Even if this scene were actually fun or thrilling, it would be excusable. But its not, its just gratuitous gore. The final end of the film is also completely underwhelming and its obvious attempts to regain its psychological interest from the first part simply fall flat.<br/><br/>Its really disappointing to see such a great first part and set up fall so low in the end. It could have been so much more. But the first part is so great, it can carry six stars on its own and is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>If you want a mature handling of gore, like this movie should have done, see Se7en. If you want gore that's actually fun, see Slither or any George Romero or Evil Dead movie."

","I saw Silent Hill last night with high expectations. I was looking forward to seeing this movie for many weeks. Unfortunately I was sadly disappointed. The movie is rather good with minor acting problems throughout, but the ending makes you wish you hadn't spent the $9.35 to get in. If you like a horror. This may disappoint you too. The movie consists of only a few shocking scenes, but the rest the director simply tries to scare you with gore and blood. The kid actor pulls off the role quite well, although her behavior doesn't match her appearance. Though 10 years old in real life, and 9 in the movie, she behaves like a 4 year old. It gets annoying fast. I would have to recommend you rent this one."

","Silent Hill is based on a popular video game and now it has been made into a full length film. The story is about a mother named Rose whose daughter Sharon often walks in her sleep and talks about a place called Silent Hill. When Rose confronts Sharon about it she tells her that she does not remember. Soon Rose finds out that there is a place called Silent Hill and decides to take Sharon there to see if it brings back some memories and to see why she always mentions it while sleep walking. On the way into Silent Hill they have an accident and soon Sharon is missing. Silent Hill is a deserted town with nobody around. Rose looks around the mysterious town for Sharon and discovers many horrors and evil as she goes along. At the end of this film I had mixed feelings for it. Some things I liked about the film was the way it looked with it's cinematography, great visual and special effects and a stylish and creepy look that I just loved. I also liked how the film looked and felt like a nightmare come to life because there were creepy things going on and it didn't always make sense and it felt like the characters were almost in a dream world. I liked the whole aspect of that. Now onto the things I didn't like so much about the film. I thought it started out interesting enough, but as the film went on I found it kind of slow moving and with a running time of over two hours I found the film a bit too long. Near the end of the film I also found it to be a bit too silly and some of the acting was too over the top for me and some of the dialog wasn't very well written either which made the film look awkward near the end. I still liked the look of the film a lot and I liked the concept up to the end, so there were some strong points in this film, but I just didn't thing it tied it too well together at the end and I think the film could have been a bit shorter. I've never played the video game that the film is based on, so I wouldn't be able to say whether fans of the game will like the movie or not, but I'm sure there is an audience for this movie and they will probably like it. I didn't think this was a terrible movie, but rather a flawed movie that could have been a lot better than it was."
"andrew_dayton","8","0","1","22 April 2006"," Great movie for fans and non-fans of the games
","First off, let me just say that there were definitely some problems with the dialog in this movie at points, but the story and the creepiness of this movie made it all worth while. The games themselves were odd and hard to understand to a lot of us(probably because I didn't finish any), but this movie does an excellent job of using the good parts of the game, and incorporating them beautifully. In fact, there were several parts of the movie that are meant to creep you out, yet I found myself thinking ""wow!"" and ""that's so accurate to the games!"" that I didn't really take advantage of them.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see a creepy, fairly gory movie. And remember, don't judge the script/acting too quickly like I did, because then you will be in for one heck of a shock."

","I've been a fan of the Silent Hill video games since the first game. When it was announced that a film was to be made, I was disappointed, as movie conversions always leave out important things, make a mess of the story, change stuff, etc. It didn't help when it was revealed to be based on the first game but with the main character being changed from a single dad to a married woman with a husband appearing in the film, as well as the town being abandoned for decades instead of seemingly inhabited but mostly deserted.<br/><br/>By some stroke of genius, this movie managed to alter the story significantly but stay true to so much of the series.<br/><br/>Specific locations were faithfully reproduced down to minor architectural details (the gas station, the bowling alley) and many sequences were identical to the game (crying in the bathroom), right down to the camera angles (the nightmarish sequence right before Harry/Rose wakes up in the diner/bowling alley). Most of the monsters from the game are recreated in frightful detail (especially the nurses, a Silent Hill staple, and ""Pyramid Head,"" a fan-favorite from Silent Hill 2).<br/><br/>Something that I've always DREAMED of seeing in a movie made from a video game was done: almost all of the music was from the video games. In a lot of games, the music isn't all that important but Akira Yamaoka's soundtracks for the Silent Hill series has always been incredibly eerie, moody, and unsettling.<br/><br/>Much of the climax felt too over-the-top and excessive to me and was the culmination of how much the movie had veered from the original story. I should have seen it and its truckloads of gore coming but I find it easy to let slide considering the filmmakers' faithfulness to so much else.<br/><br/>In short, the filmmakers did a fantastic job of paying close attention the Silent Hill games and comics and recreated it wonderfully but also in a way that can still be enjoyed by the average horror film-goer (this is useful since the games have multiple endings, most of which are a little cerebral and confusing).<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing in the theaters."

","I have to say that this movie really disappointed me. And I have yet to play the game. There were some good things. The filming was grand. Nice twists, turns and angles. The special effects were nice, and added a lot to the gore. The soundtrack was spectacular. However, the plot was pretty blah. The dialoge was awful. Long, drawn out...no real emotion. The movie was also too long for the plot and dialoge that went with it. If you're looking for horror...don't see this. Nothing scary happens...and I consider myself a wimp. See it to see the nurses toward the end (my favorite part) and to hear the music; but don't expect anything fabulous."

The sets were amazingly true to the game, as if lifted from its software, and Pyramid Head was friggin' awesome. So I recommend it for fans of it.<br/><br/>As for others, I recommend it as well if you can look past the bad stuff, instead of the usual jump scares, there are some true horror moments in this film and a lot of cool things as well that could easily elevate this into a cult movie.

"hylian82","6","0","2","22 April 2006"," Great ideas, bad script
","I don't know what that other guy was talking about. The film was bad. Bad acting (well maybe not all the time), useless characters (the red-head), and some of the worst dialog i've ever had to sit through (um, the red-head). In all fairness it's starts off great. Close enough to the game but different enough to be interesting. The creatures and the art direction (the game had some great ideas that transitioned well into film.) the pacing was great and things were going well. That is, until they tried to explain what was going on. One reason that George Romero's zombie trilogy worked is because they never tell you why dead people are returning to life to eat people. They never should have tried to explain this movie. Should have been a Mother and Daughter drive through Silent Hill and all hell breaks loose. But the more they got away from the plot of the game the worse the movie got. And the ending was just ridiculous. I hate spoilers so I wont say anything other than this: Gore is gore. It's gross and scary. But there is such a thing as stupidity. You can cross the line and people will just start laughing. Except when they burned people alive, that made me want to puke. How do you get away with burning a little girl alive while shes screaming? You release you're movie after HOSTEL, that's how. If you love gore, genius creature design, and one of the coolest interpretations of hell ever put on screen, but also don't mind sitting through endless explanations of why is this happening (most of which is retarded) then you'll probably like this movie. I just hope they can make a decent sequel. I want to see the darkness make a return."

Also, contrary to the Trivia page, there is a LOT of CGI, so don't let that fool you. The visuals were good though, and it was on its own better than a lot of other movies produced these days, hence the 6. But seriously, not very good. I'd suggest playing the games; it'll be more satisfying. It's really only worth seeing if you're a fan of the games, because you'll be willing to put up with more just because you love the whole series. Kind of like if you really like a TV show you're willing to put up with a few crappy episodes. <br/><br/>If you're going to see the gore and the visuals, well, you'll get some anyway.

","I first went into this not wanting to like it but in the end I didn't really find that much wrong with it. In the beginning I was a little turned off by all that blood and gore and gruesome stuff and maybe the story did move a little slow but it was at least true to most of the elements in the first Silent Hill video game series. The ending was a little sketchy and the buildup to the action wasn't all that great but I do think that for the person who is a fan of the series and like a bloody flick that this is definitely suitable to that particular taste. All in all Silent Hill delivers what it promises and tends to get a little extreme with the nasty stuff but its all in the name of entertainment. Nice acting with the exception of the child actress who played Sharon. 6/10"

","I have never seen such fine gore and frightening visions as in this film. All fans of the games as well as the genre should enjoy this movie. The actors blend in with their parts and the flow of the fright is not interrupted even when the action moves between the real and the ""other"" world. The creatures seem to be ripped from the game's world, and should be a connection to the gamers in the audience, while being a shock to the senses of the rest of the watchers. The misty world of Silent Hill is a proper backdrop to the horror within, and the ""end of the world"" views at the proper points in the film only increase the isolation of that realm. Filled with beings, fanatics, and ""regular"" folk give the movie all the variation of a finely cooked dinner - if that dinner were served on a morgue slab in the pits of Hell. To truly enjoy this movie, just sit back, open your mind as well as your eyes and take the ride of your nightmares come to hideous un-life. Remember one thing, not everything you see is what it seems, especially in the town of Silent Hill"
"kels-errific","7","0","2","22 April 2006"," Welcome to Silent Hill...
","Silent Hill in all it's violent glory, has done something video game movies have been attempting to do for years. It somewhat successfully merges cinema with gaming, in an almost digestible fashion.... almost. But perceptive readers will re-read the above sentence and feel the underlying emphasis on possibilities, and sadly, the movie is not the epic I was hoping for. First off, for a horror movie, there were seldom scares, if any. Sure when the siren in the town of Silent Hill went off, your blood ran cold as you knew Hell was about to carve the town a new hole, but there were no moments of sheer fright. However, what the movie lacked in the scare department, it more than compensated with striking imagery and gore. Good god, this movie has images that will haunt you long after your viewing. When the town's walls begin to bleed and peel, it's imagery that is worth noting. But we all know pretty images ( or in this case, a bloody table of carnage delights) does not a good film make. Oddly enough, my biggest gripe with the movie wasn't the movie itself but the idiots who decided to see the movie on the opening night with me. But, this is a review, read my blog for further pissiness on the issue. This movie is... in a word... LONG! And not just a little, it's huge, and I am of the mind had some bits been cut, it would have sat more favorably with me. I loved the actors in this movie though, especially some hefty fright-work compliments of Rhada Mitchell, who not only strikes a compelling mix of the fright of her character in Silent Hill, but the overpowering strength of mother hood that imbues her character to move on even with Hell itself at her heels. Woot for credibility for a game film! This is not a film for everybody though. It charges at you with electric scenes of thrills, than comes to an almost screeching halt with story exposition. If it sounds like the architecture of a roller coaster, it's because it is. Sure the slow climb of a roller-coaster cart is needed to get to the top of a drop for the right speed to send you careening in loops that provide the real thrills, but in Silent Hill, the moments outside of the town just aren't that interesting. When the darkness invades the town, it throws so much at you, and then it's over. < blinks> Kinda anti-climatic. But that's the nature of this movie. If you want to be scared, this movie is not for you. This is more of a thriller as opposed to the straight advertised horror moniker. I, however, thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Because for once, I felt the director and people involved truly brought something legitimate to the table. This is definitely a good step in the right direction. Sadly though, Silent Hill evades greatness and sits above average, but below spectacular..."

","The closeness to the feel of the game is incredible. I admit when I went to the movie I expected another Doom, but no. This was a stunningly great movie, even though it was a video game adaptation. The monsters, zombies, whatever you want to call them were all very well designed, etc, and the costumes looked great. The acting was FAR better than in the video games, but it may not have been the best. Now onto what people really hate the movie for. The story.<br/><br/>Many people on this site are complaining about how horrible the story was, but it wasn't. Although it may have been confusing at times, if you thought about it, and you weren't some retard born in a cave, you might have actually known what they were talking about. It may have been an open ending, but from what I saw, and believed, after the crash, they died. In death, they were brought to Silent Hill, along with all the others that were lost, hence the reason why her husband can't see her in the scenes where he is looking for her.<br/><br/>It may be shocking to you, but there was plenty of resolution, just not a happy one. They made it back to their house, but they were both dead. It was a great movie, and the reason, at least I believe, they ended the movie that way, is to lead it into the story of 2. As many of you know, in 2, the man goes looking for what happened to his wife in Silent Hill. Just make sure you don't go knocking this movie if you don't understand it, because if you don't, you're an idiot. It's fairly straight-forward, unless you're the kind of person who believes that you should watch a movie and not have to think at all to discern the plot."

","Finally a video game adaptation which doesn't completely leave me covered in the movie executives feces. This movie is easily one of the most atmospheric movies made in recent years. The sets all prepare the mood excellently and the tension builds even though nothing in the way of plot ever really happens.<br/><br/>That brings me to my main complaint, the movie is essentially about nothing. Which, unlike Seinfeld, doesn't work. The plot is nothing more than an attachment to give reasons behind the various monsters which appear (which are actually done quite well). But in terms of plot and character development, it feels like I am looking at amateur work that someone could make a Lego movie out of.<br/><br/>I would not suggest this movie for anyone except fans of the game and genre buffs."
"Justin Harris","7","0","2","22 April 2006"," Best video game adaptation yet, but still has its flaws...
","Following a viewing of ""Silent Hill"" with some friends, many of them were quite perplexed at the film. Needless to say, the film was a tad bit confusing to those who were not familiar and had not played the video game franchise. Being a person who had played the games, I was very satisfied with the film. Not only did the film provide an interesting way to bring the game into the movie-world, but also stayed extremely close to many elements of the game and included various things from the first three video games. ""Silent Hill"" is by far the best video game adaptation yet, but it still has its share of flaws. For one thing, based on discussions with friends and reading reviews online, it seems quite clear who will surely enjoy this film: fans of the video game. Those who aren't familiar with the game will be left in the dark, confused by an incomplete cinematic explanation that will isolate them from the rest. My friends who hated the film had every reason not to like it. The story is confusing, the character development lacks, and the ending seems almost incomplete (to those not familiar with the game). To me, the film was excellent, following parts of the game's storyline. However, I don't think Christophe Gans or the screenwriters did a good job at making this film for the unfamiliar viewer. Another problem with the film is that it's really not scary at all. The film is visually stunning and gross, perfect to the atmosphere, but lacks the general creepiness that the game brought to its players. Not once did I jump or get concerned about what was going to happen, as it didn't set-up like a horror film. Regardless, I do believe that on its own, ""Silent Hill"" is a good movie that deserves multiple viewings to fully understand its complexities. In summation, ""Silent Hill"" is a good movie that will surely attract the curious and satisfy its fans. However, it didn't come to its full potential due to the fact that it seems to have been made for such a small, fan-based audience."

","First off I'm going to say I never really played the game silent hill. I went into this movie only to view a horror film and had nothing to compare it with or any information that would have helped me better understand the movie. Besides from some very bad acting, the movie starts off quick and clean. Although some parts i wasn't to sold on: Why does the mother drive like a maniac when the cop tries to pull them over. Seriously the little girl is asleep in the passenger seat and the mom is peacefully driving down a dark nights road. Cop siren sounds from behind and suddenly the mom hits 80 and starts crashing through fences. Also how old is the little girl supposed to be? She looks like shes 12 or 13, i think they say shes 9 ( i might be wrong), and she talks like she were 4. Anyway....aside from my little rants the first 45 minutes were pretty creepy and i felt it could have really been a good movie. They just don't explain the story well enough to the viewer, I mean for silent hill fans I'm sure it all made sense. The plot was established-when the sirens sound the town turns into hell, but there were so many random monsters and little clues being revealed it all kinda was confusing because they didn't explain any of it... or at least very well. I'm confused why every reviewer is saying that barely any CGI was used because to me it seemed like the majority of the monsters and blood and hell stuff were all done in CGI. The Graphics, sets, and characters were very good and original, i enjoyed these aspects of the film greatly. But the acting sucked, i will say that. Also the end was little confusing.....but good and bloody."

","OK it's truly scary. And there are spots where the dialogue and acting will leave you wondering if the screenwriter's mind was too much on the ambiance of the film instead of the story. This did little to detract from the film's more frightening aspects, and the feeling of mystery that pervaded even the most horrific scenery. If you've read Dante's Inferno or have seen Constantine, you will be well impressed by the vision of hell (or just a hellish environment?) that the makers have created. In many ways, this movie could be the progeny of films like The Ring, The Grudge, or mysteries with ""teeth""--that is, a true or true-seeming story behind the horror. I was impressed. However, unlike Ebert, I found the plot easily understandable and worth the $7 it took to see this. Artfully experimental in many ways, but, if you're not younger than 14 and don't mind graphically-intense films, you should see go see and enjoy this film.

The gore was plenty enjoyable and this was probably the first movie where I've seen someone get their flesh ripped off.

","I was hoping that this would break the mold - and be a successful game to movie transition.<br/><br/>However - I was soon disappointed. The start of the movie was extremely slow - with the story of Sharon sleep walking and saying 'Silent Hill' in her sleep being a weak story line to get them to go to the town in question - especially since deep underground coal fires are still burning and the town is closed off.<br/><br/>once there - Sharon goes missing - and while this may work in the Game - it doesn't really work in the film. Then the build up to the scary monsters was painfully cheesy - and the monsters themselves weren't all that scary. The demonic character 'Pyramid Head' from the game was gloriously presented - but like Darth Maul in Episode I - was underused and may as well have not been there.<br/><br/>The fact that there are a number of people in this supposedly deserted town- many more than in the games - left me feeling a little cheated - and the religious fanaticism that was portrayed and the lost in time witch hunting was just silly.<br/><br/>As a separate part of the film - there was a sequence where Sean Bean badly acted searching for his wife in Silent Hill. while it was supposed to show that Rose had gone into an alternate reality - it was a weak and unnecessary part of the film.<br/><br/>As an avid silent hill fan I was left disappointed.

","SILENT HILL'S STORY started out decent, sort of got better as the main character discovered Silent Hill and its secrets, but went downhill (storywise) in the last half of the movie, lame, unoriginal, laughable twists. The story reminded me of a game (not a good game-to-movie adaptation). The main character in the movie spent time memorizing a map, much like a game, and had mini-goals to get to and solve small puzzles (even her evil-sidekick lookalike daughter said that).<br/><br/>The story had subplots which were interesting. There's the burned girl who sought revenge for the last 30 years, the witch who had to keep ""evil"" at bay, but ultimately failed her goal, and the father who failed to find his family. All of these subplots were driven by the mother who made the choice to bring her daughter to Silent Hill, but switched to the little girl who drove the movie, as the mother took a backseat, trying to find her daughter while discovering Silent Hill's past. So the mother initiated the whole story, but the daughter was the catalyst (unwillingly). The story changes when the mother realizes that she'll never find her daughter unless she confronts the dark evil. She makes the decision to find her daughter from another approach, side with evil. (But who is really the enemy then?) It all comes down to witches burning innocent people to purify their religion, but their mistake cost the town of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>THE DIALOGUE: It was laughable at times. It suggests that the characters aren't very bright with lines like, ""There must have been a big fire,"" minutes after they're walking through a scorched building. It pulls you out of the movie at those times. None of the characters felt rounded.<br/><br/>MISE EN SCENE: It was amazing. It's better than Doom. It's the kind of experience that I expected from Doom, but never got. The choice of lighting, make-up, costume, sets, camera angles, all combined to create some unforgettable scenes. Some of the gory parts reminded me of Hellraiser. This was the highlight of the film. Lots of gore! A burning body, past mutilations left and right, a girl is skinned alive with one pull of the skin! A handful of dismemberment, plus there must have been a thousand different kinds of blood sprays! But...<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: This is a woman's horror movie! All of the main characters are women. The movie cuts to scenes of the husband, searching for his wife and daughter, but most of this is filler, he has no significant purpose. His actions have no great consequence. The protagonist, her sidekick, the antagonist, all the troubled characters who seek revenge, THEY'RE ALL WOMEN! The husband comes off as a bumbling, not very gutsy, stuck in the dark character, with no change by the end of the film. The mother, sidekick, daughter, the evil witch, all were controlling figures. They were the driving force of the movie. Go women, you rock!<br/><br/>So, hopefully you've found why you should watch Silent Hill or why you should avoid seeing it."

","Superb presentation of a video game as a movie. From the original song played, its abrupt cutoff and to the point where rose enters the church the movie is almost flawless. I use the word ""superb"" because it couldn't have been better if done any other way. The acting pulls the movie through all the tricky spots that seem to be dying fast because nothing is going on. What many wont understand is that those moments, where everything is quieting down is what Silent Hill is really all about. If you're looking for a horde of Marilyn Manson songs to be filling the soundtrack look elsewhere this is not some rock concert on film like Resident Evil was. If you've played the games you will get this movie and should enjoy it for the most part. It was worth two screenings until the last scene in the church. ""Give me the strength to stay pure."" Wow what the hell was that about. Silent hill is about what you Don't see or what you can almost see and try to move in you seat to get a glimpse of. However I must say Pyramid head is worth the ticket...."
"nocturnalgaming","5","0","3","21 April 2006"," Eerie setting, brutal and gruesome, lackluster delivery
","I have been solemnly been awaiting the arrival of Silent Hill for quite sometime, and stupidly I had my expectations set to a certain level because I really wanted this movie to be a well made, scary film and I feel that it came up pretty short.<br/><br/>Be warned I may speak about certain scenes in the movie, but I won't write any spoilers although i'm convinced this movie kind of spoiled itself. To start I would like to say that this movie kind of gave me the ""oOOoo..freaky cult"" and ""the gates of hell have been opened..."" from amityville horror vibe. The cinematography was one of my biggest gripes about this movie. It was at some brief moments dis-orienting, and at other times just annoying, and even predictable and poorly framed. I am not completely sure as to whether or not predictability is a sign of poor camera work but I thought it was comical when I could guess to myself what the next shot would be, consistently. The camera was tilted a lot, with overhead panning shots, a lot of times the same camera movement/shot would be made scene after scene and I do not mean the part when the camera is spinning around Rose, that made sense even though I dis-like how it was edited. I am talking about just pointless movement that really added no effect and just distracted me from the even less vital moments in the movie. There was a scene where they framed Rose walking away from the camera through a torn up baby carriage, and I just felt that the camera work was trying, or perhaps there was just some lame symbolism with the broken carriage and her losing her child, so benefit of the doubt. Not all of the camera work was bad and sometimes it did involve me in the movie but it was nothing I would ever go wow, that was an amazing shot, as a for instance, in raging bull when robert de niro's character is fighting sugar ray for the final time, that was an un-believably good scene and beautifully shot with the lights and the way he looks, o it was magnificent. Visually, not camera work but special fx, the movie was attractive. The creeps and the ghoulies were pretty creepy and original; I enjoyed them and there amazing, not to mention graphic, ways of killing people. The music was good, when Rose stands up in front of the ""cult"" the accompanying music made me giggle, a manly giggle of course. Next big gripe about the movie, the dialogue and some of the acting. The dialogue pretty much sucked; people said stupid things, and asked stupid questions. Silent Hill is known for the terrible fires that occurred there, and this is a well-known fact to our characters and yet when they walk into a factory after already exploring and seeing some of the extensive fire damage to the city, they still find the need to say things such as ""it looks like there was a fire here"", or things along the lines of ""something bad happened here"". Then there was the cheesy lines between characters, and there were other times when I rolled my eyes at the dialogue but I don't feel its necessary to list anymore. The acting was good at parts, and unrealistic in others. I always have a thing about reasonable, possible reactions people might have in situations such as this one, and a lot of times its just neither of the two. A third thing was plot development and significance of characters. It all made a good story and the connections were there, but I felt like i was left wanting. More specifically near the end when the freaky little girl is revealing the ""truth"" to Rose, they never said anything about a woman convincing everyone in the town that there was an apocalypse. She was not very manipulative, although thats how I thought of her, because I figured she must'voe been. Rose I found to still make usual stupid horror movie decisions. The cop was a character I liked even though I thought the idea of making people thing she was beaten to death by lead pipes and then turning up to still be alive later in the movie, only to asphyxiate on smoke as she is being lowered to a fire and then her skin melts and she burns to death only minutes after we found out she was still alive. The daughter was pretty good, although at some points I was wondering whether she was mentally retarded with some of the dialogue. The movie was extremely gory, and i mean that as they pushed the bar on bloody with some scenes I won't spoil. The last thing is that the movie was not that scary, it was dramatic and had a creepy setting, and the potential to be an awesome scary movie but it just didn't deliver. Perhaps I should'voe looked more into the film before seeing it but I really wanted to be surprised with everything, and just see how it turned out. Overall, the movie wasn't the worst thing i have ever seen (i.e. Ultraviolet), and even though it had a lot of bad elements I still enjoyed it because I am a fan of the game and the gruesomeness and creativity behind it, along with good make up and creepy settings I don't feel like I wasted my money, and although I was disappointed with the lack of scary, I still enjoyed a night at the movies.<br/><br/>-Andrew"
"whitakeroh","6","0","3","22 April 2006"," I liked the whole movie except for the end...
","I'll admit, I am 25 years old, and the I only played Silent Hill years ago on playstation. The game was really cool, though I would get frustrated trying to figure out puzzles. (just like resident evil). With that being said, I must say that the movie plot was vaguely familiar, and I knew it would be a creepy, cool, wicked sort of movie. I will now list my pros and cons of the movie: PROS: 1) Gore that is cool: First, I didn't think there was that much gore in this movie. Really, there isn't a lot except for a pyramid head skin ripping scene and the climax. But, the way the gore was done was very classy. I absolutely though the part where pyramid head rips the clothes and then the skin off a woman and throws it at the door was superb. That was pure evil and rage.Well Done. too often horror movies ""gore"" is over the top, but it doesn't quite wrench you, w/ some scenes in ""Hill"" it certainly does wrench at you 2) Beginning Story Line: I love movies that are creepy and dark, Silen Hill was a perfect video game to go movie b/c of the fact that the world changes into a sort of hell at certain points. The loud tornado sirens that warn of the darkness is very cool 3) Characters: Someone said here on IMDb that they don't like Sean bean, I think he's great, and Rahda Mitchell was good, though a bit over-the-top at the end.<br/><br/>CONS: 1) Be different. The movie could have ended superbly, but it didn't. Video games have the luxury of being far stretched because the real point of video games, is to play them. Some loyalists may hate me for this, but who says its wrong to take a video game plot and change some parts to suit the big screen? My point: The ending which involved a girl, and another demon girl, and the Sharron girl, didn't really make sense. The movie could have drawn up an ending without explaining it all away. For example, at the end we get the whole truth of whats going on, but it is lackluster, it concerns the stereotypical backwoods Christians that are so Christian they become evil, or something like that. B/C they burn people who don't follow the commandments. But, this could have been done better. I mean, don't try to explain the evil as coming from a girls imagination, make it an evil that is all-encompassing, and is part of a larger picture about the world, make the girl some sort of catalyst for hell. I got the sense that the evil church woman was really the cause of all of this, and once shes gone, the evil is gone. I like movies that make their plots something bigger.<br/><br/>2) The Ending #2 complaint: Why is main character sitting in her house in a fog? Is she still in the ""darkness""? I know this probably follows the game, but seeing in how much of the audience doesn't have the luxury of playing video games all day, how are we to know what the heck is going on? Explain please.<br/><br/>3) Pyramid Head: I loved this character, the movie should've have spent more time doing some action sequences where pyramid head and other creatures kill some folks. But i understand that this movie is ""tension"" based. But, it still would have been cool.<br/><br/>Thx!"
"lonely_mage","8","0","3","22 April 2006"," Half way there...
","Like many other people, you really have to split this film into different bits: First third The first 1/3 of the film the director has got almost everything perfect, the plot, the visuals, the acting was not perfect but definitely believable. Perhaps the best example was the chase scene where Rose follows a Sharon look-alike only to be attacked by many deformed baby-like creatures. The fact that the fog horns led to complete darkness, gave us a clue as to what to expect and be terrified of it, e.g. the bass just sent shivers down my spine. The high pitched tone after Rose collapsed on the floor added to the feel, similar to the effect used in Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Many people up to this point believed there were plot holes in the film, i.e. why did Rose go to Silent Hill? Well from what I understand Sharon has been going ""Crazy lately"", they've consulted the psychiatrist and as Rose said, ""the meds aren't working"", and as the character of Rose reveals, she's a person of motherly instinct and followed her daughters sayings to go to Silent Hill. I've read reviews about cancer, but nothing of the sort was mentioned in the film.<br/><br/>The second time the fog horn sounded the audience were prepared for more horror, and it did deliver. The cockroaches eating the miners alive were very disturbing. The appearance of Pyramid head was met without fright rather: ""Wow! Awesome knife!"" Friends would later mention it in a situation similar to the one met in Crocodile Dundee, ""you call that a knife?"" Very entertaining.<br/><br/>Second Third It began to feel a bit corny in many places, for example, how the characters found clues along the way like at the hotel.<br/><br/>Cybil finds the picture, the mother asks ""which box did you pick that from"", in which Cybil replies ""room 111"". We don't need a further line to say ""we have to go to room 111"" from Rose! You really are tempted to say....""No $*** Sherlock!"". All she needed to do was walk away in which Cybil would say ""Where are you going..."" and follows. Some of the new character acting was a bit rubbish as well, like the woman throwing the stones at Alessa's mother at the hotel talking about the first burning.<br/><br/>I really did not like how the piano score, Promise (reprise) song was used. It came on all of a sudden every time she finds picture clue. A different score or perfects one that doesn't have as much a sudden onset would be better. I can understand what Gans has tried to do but it just didn't work well. However, you still get the terrible feeling something was going to happen. You do learn more about the story as it develops. Sean's appearances throughout didn't entirely break the atmosphere, but I would prefer if they left some bits out or merge some of them together. I guess a thing about timing was the main focus of Gans, trying to make sure each character has enough time to travel from one place to another.<br/><br/>Last Third Going to meet the demon was very clichÃ©, but then again it did seem like the next logical thing to do by Rose. I think that the scene with the map was a bit video game like, but the beating up part was very realistic. It gave a sense of insecurity because these cult people were not messing when it comes to killing people for their faith. I felt that this part was good.<br/><br/>The nurse scene was OK, but does not have the same feel as the other sections. Here we then enter the film strip scene with the narrative from the girl. I think the dialogue, the girl directly talking to rose, was okay and you did feel sorry for the girl especially when they showed you her scarred and toasted body. But the atmosphere was not completely there. There was something missing which I can't seem to understand and explain. Perhaps the second third build up to this scene put me off a bit.<br/><br/>The main actors were probably tired towards the end and lost their accent. You can tell that Rose was Australian since her accent died completely when preaching at the church. Maybe they were running out of time to film the thing and so just didn't redo the scene again.<br/><br/>The ending parts scenes were great as an ending, but exactly what the girl wanted before hand was not exactly clear until perhaps right at the very end, but some explanation could have been added. Being stuck in the grey world perhaps gave clues as to exactly what Alessa wanted but again the meaning of it is not clear. Perhaps Gans wanted to create a cliff-hanger feeling. He did mention that he took on the film but realised that in order to explain everything, this would require a sequel at least. Perhaps this was in his mind all the time and therefore tried to not explain everything to its entirety. In any case because of this, the film ending was not the greatest and leads to major problems with understanding from the audience but I personally interpret this as part of the feel to the film.<br/><br/>Conclusion I would rate the parts of the film separately: 9.5/5.0/5.5 respectively, which is why I the combined score I gave of 6 was appropriate. I've only ever played 5 minutes of a demo of the game so I was not clued up about this beforehand but I still understood the film. The jist of the plot was there; in areas there was too much explanation, whilst others had too little. It wasn't meant to be 100% scare, just highly disturbing and it was. Overall as many have said this film was half way there but didn't quite make it. We could only wish it had."
"sephiroth-12","6","0","4","22 April 2006"," Odds are if you played the game, you will be entertained
","It's hard to look at this movie and judge it. Do you look at it as an actual movie? A horror movie? An adaptation of a video game? Or a combination of those choices? I went to this with the anticipation that it would be phenomenal, amazing, etc. It fell well short of my expectation. There were a myriad of things wrong with this, mainly, Sean Bean's role...if his role was cut out, I feel the movie would have lost 20-30 minutes of time that made the movie seem just a little too long.<br/><br/>One of the parts where I was letdown, though this is probably my own fault, it was not scary. There were barely even any tense moments. I believe this is where the director failed. While some monsters creep-ed around the corner, I believe the tone was ""I am so scared, I do NOT want to see what comes around the corner!"" Although, I was just hoping it came around quicker. I had watched the trailer like a little fan boy over a dozen times, just hoping that this movie somehow freaked me out to where I wouldn't want to turn off the lights when I went to sleep. It failed in that area completely. Do not get me wrong, the whole movie was creepy, and during some of the very gory death scenes it was very eerie. Although it was nothing that honestly ""scared"" me. Once again, this could be my own fault for having such great expectations.<br/><br/>The monsters in the movie, while INCREDIBLY well done, were not in the movie NEAR enough. Each monster got a scene, and then onto the next one, just when you hope there would be more of your ""favorite"" one...too bad, you lost it; except for Red Pyramid. His on-screen time is still somewhere around...4 minutes...maximum.<br/><br/>It sounds as if I didn't like the movie, this is false. I did enjoy the movie, but mainly due to the fact, I played the games, I got their plot. So, I know what the director was going for. In a game, you, the character, run around and just try to find stuff, you get random clues and go there with little to no explanation. The problem is, this doesn't work in movies that well. Especially if you've never played the games, you will be wondering ""Ok, now why did that picture just appear next to the Jeep? How did they really know to go to the school? Isn't that just a BIT to coincidental? Although if you have played the games (mainly the first) you will probably be thinking ""Oh man! They are following the game almost perfectly!"" The sets, the soundtrack, the ambiance, and once again the monsters were incredible. I'm not a fan of computer graphics permeating a movie. Although this is where you really needed it, mainly when the town is transformed by the darkness. It is amazing how it is done.<br/><br/>I believe that is the main difference between people who do and don't like it. If you haven't played the games, and don't know what the director was going for, don't see this movie. Odds are you won't like it.<br/><br/>The way I looked at this is from a horror/video game adaptation point. The plot was changed to something that reminded me of The Grudge a bit, and don't worry, I wouldn't call that a spoiler. It felt a little long, but during the movie, through most of this review has been pointing out its flaws...I WAS entertained by it. I might even see it again. I give it a 6 because a 5 is average, and this was a bit better than the average horror movie. If a sequel is to be made, hopefully they will throw in more recurring monsters, and take out needless side plots."

","***ABSOLUTE SPOILERAGE HERE MAN!*** To get things started, I just want to say, I love the Silent Hill series to death. I first started getting excited about this movie about 2 years ago when I read someone had picked up the rights to it. For 2 years, I waited in painful anticipation for this movie, reading every possible bit of news about it, joining in the fan-frothed message boards, and even playing the games again, just for the hell of it.<br/><br/>Then I saw the trailer. I've never felt more disappointed.<br/><br/>Still, this isn't about the trailer. I saw the movie last night in a decently full theater, consisting of mostly college students. The movie started out cringingly and laughably awkward. The lines felt so...used before. The acting was embarrassing. Seeing a 7 year old scream ""SILENT HILL"" isn't scary, unnerving, or odd. I laughed.<br/><br/>I also laughed at several other moments in this movie, even though I tried so hard not to. The movie is filled with these kinds of moments.<br/><br/>Still, If I had to say anything good about this film (which I most definitely will), its that I absolutely loved the first half. If they had just taken the whole second half of the movie out (the burn the witch part), I would have been in heaven. Everything is done right. The transformation from fog to hell Silent Hill, the downright disturbing monsters (except the nurses. The nurses looked like ""Bring it On"" rejects), and the decision to use the game's score (none of the music, unfortunately, is new) all make the the movie a true sight to behold. And come on. Freaking pyramid head, man. He doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>In all two scenes he's in...<br/><br/>*sigh* Still, the movie has its moments. And they absolutely rock. Sadly, though, there's just too much bad acting and laughably awkward lines to give the better half a fighting chance. When I get this on DVD, I'm going to break it in half so I can only see the first hour. The good hour."

For all the bad things in the movie there are hundreds of nods to the games that make it worthwhile. From the obvious ones like the street and building names, to the more 'Die-hard-fan' ones like the camera angle that moves exactly like game does, or the bit where rose takes the girls knife and delivers one of James' lines from 2.

I liked this movie a lot because I found it to be pretty scary (which can hardly be found in ""horror"" movies today). The music was awesome, the acting was decent, and most importantly, the VISUAL EFFECTS!!! It's guaranteed that your jaw will drop more than once throughout the film. An example of this is when the Pyramid Head first comes on. He was pretty cool. Keep in mind that this movie is pretty intense so those who are weak in the stomach may want to take that into account. It's kind of hard talking about the movie without giving anything away but, just go see it if you're looking for something to really creep you out (and also if you're hungry for some good storytelling).

","The movie takes us through the terrifying town of Silent Hill. The story is, generally, faithful to the video game and that is a wonderful change from video game and book adaptations. While there were some changes to the plot, and additional characters placed in, the underlying theme of the game was intact and the movie excels for it.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is a scary place and the special effects and pacing (generally) kept the tension and sense of bafflement high. My shoulders and neck are still tight from being so tense.<br/><br/>Were we just to follow the character of Rose as she searched for her daughter in this strange and terrible town, the movie would have been better than almost every other horror movie I've ever seen. Easily 8/10 stars.<br/><br/>However, we are ripped from our tension, horror, and wonderment repeatedly to track the events that befall Rose's husband, played by Sean Bean. Storywise, even though this part was tacked on after the fact, it works quite well. Cinematically, however, it is a total failure for the simple reason that it breaks the tension and destroys the pacing. The acting is quite fine, the story itself is quite fine, but the disruption to the main thread is unforgivable. I am extremely disappointed that this thread was added on. What it added to the story was insignificant when compared to what it took from the overall feel of the film.<br/><br/>Excellent work by the writer, director, special effects crew, composer, and all of the actors.

Great characters, monsters were actually the SAME as in the games, which was so cool, and the soundtrack was taken directly from the games. Everything was amazing apart from 2 things: 1) I know Cybil dies in the first game, and i know there is an alternate way to save her, but Cybil, the coolest character in the movie shouldn't have died, or if she had, not died in such a crap way. i mean, cmon being burnt alive is a boring way for such a cool person to die =p even though thats how they always kill people :P 2) This sounds stupid, but there wasn't enough Darkside silent hill.

","I think the problem with this film, for starters, is that Silent Hill fans, like myself, expected a little too much from it. Though, that isn't essentially a bad thing.<br/><br/>I had been looking forward to this film ever since I saw the teaser trailer for it online. I was excited, actually I was more than excited. I planned to see this film a week after it came out, with my girlfriend, but I actually couldn't wait that long. So I hunted around for someone to see it with on the night of it's release here in England, and after being told 'I'm too busy to go see a film' I decided to go with my old man, who is also a horror fan, though not specifically a Silent Hill fan.<br/><br/>We arrived at the cinema, anxiously watched the trailers for films-to-come, and then we were hit with the opening theme tune, and I was creaming my pants with excitement.<br/><br/>After the initial joy, though, I spent the first 10 minutes filled with disappointment.<br/><br/>I don't know why exactly. It could've been a mixture of reasons. It was like, OK, so this kid sleep walks and screams 'Silent Hill'. Fair enough. OK, so the mother wants to take the kid there, why? What mother in their right mind would take their little daughter to a place she has nightmares about?! I eventually got over it, because after the first 10-20 minutes, the film really started to fall into its stride.<br/><br/>I'm not slating this film, because I actually left the cinema a very happy man.<br/><br/>Christopher Gans and team Silent really did the games justice here. In all fairness, I haven't actually played Silent Hill 1. I came into the series at number 3 (a Christmas present from my brother), and then picked up Silent Hill 2 soon after, and have been searching for a copy of 1 for a while now, but I am familiar with the storyline for SH1. I seriously think they did a good job with the storyline, it seemed to transcend to the big screen quite well.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue seemed a little uncomfortable for the actors though, especially the actress playing Cybil, though it could have just been me.<br/><br/>All in all, I think it was a successful film, which could have been a lot better without Sean Bean, he didn't seem to fit into the film very well, and you could tell he was simply an after-thought.<br/><br/>The graphics were stunning. The way you go from misty-Silent-Hill and then to Hellish-Silent-Hill couldn't have been done any better.<br/><br/>7/10 And, contrary to what my old-man thinks, it's way better than 'End of Days'."

While there are some definite changes form the games, primarily the Cult who have switched sides and are trying to stop evil as opposed to bringing about its birth, the story is very true to the games, and to the critics its at least truer than say ""resident Evil 1-2"" so it could have been a lot worse!!!!<br/><br/>The story plays at a fairly consistent speed and the change from talking to small snippets of action/attack from overwhelming odds, and back to talking for ages I think was handles superbly,(Gans has a nice way of doing this).<br/><br/>And the story in all only lags in a few places, mainly I am referring to the explanation of Alessa's past and the subsequent old style film that brings the audience up to date, but this might be due tot he fact I have played the games and know most of this already so...I cant really fault the story as a whole, while the board has borough up some interesting questions about characters ages.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS<br/><br/>Other than the change of male to female for the lead role and taking Dalliah from the head of the Cult the cast hasn't changed much from the games, and for the most part they work, there is a little bit of the horror movie character stating the obvious but besides that they are generally rock solid. The character that are additional I found only added, either taking on the role of someone else (Cristabella for example) or giving some insight that would have otherwise been missed/plus giving us named characters to watch get killed off :D. As a general rule all the acting was spot on or half decent, but surprisingly I found the male roles in the film lagging behind the female, As a supporting fan of Sean Bean i'm surprised to say he was only OK...nothing more.<br/><br/>VISUALS<br/><br/>Besides the odd bit of bad makeup/cgi the visuals were wonderful and had me cringing from time to time, in general the use of CGI was superb as the simpler effects and makeup.<br/><br/>The only two points I could pick up on were the CGI bugs, they were fine swarming but a few were alone in-front/around the pack looked as if their legs didn't even move...and what I thought was a bad bit of make up on Alessa's burnt skin when she butchers the church congregation (A few clear edges were visible), but nothing that REALLY distracted much, just me being picky.<br/><br/>HIGH'S<br/><br/>Watching Pyramid head rip the skin of poor Anna (I believe it was her), And the appearance of just about every monster/character/game reference throughout the film.<br/><br/>LOW'S<br/><br/>Other than the numb feeling that the film ended and I have to either watch it again,of wait for the DVD release....<br/><br/>The lack of the classic Cult symbol, but I guess that changed when the role of the cult did so..<br/><br/>CONCLUSION....<br/><br/>Overall a great film just not perfect...worth at least watching once even if you don't play the games...just remember its a thinking man's film not a brainless gore-fest.<br/><br/>More than deserving of a sequel..<br/><br/>Null."
"missami72","5","0","4","22 April 2006"," excellent beginning, but serious problems
","First the good: The atmosphere of this movie completely captured Silent Hill. The locations are easily recognizable to anyone who has played the game. The monsters in this movie are pretty terrifying, although oddly, not as much as they were in the game. The sound effects and music in this movie were superb, and overall, Silent Hill was effectively portrayed on the big screen. Now, for the bad: the major problem in this movie, for me, is that they changed the mythology of Silent Hill by making the cult into a fanatical Christian cult who likes to purify by fire. In the game, the cult was a wacked out pseudo-satanic cult who tries to bring their demi-god/demon to life by engaging in a horrific form of child abuse. This was the biggest issue for me when I watched this movie, because it drastically changed the plot. The second major problem for me was that the monsters were not on screen enough. We see the black-shadow babies - who freaked me out - but we only see them in one scene. We should have had more scares like that. Finally, at 127 minutes, the movie was just too long for what it was."

","Silent Hill. The groundbreaking survival horror game, known for a unique atmosphere, high level of gore and an ability to scare the player in a way never before done in a video game. An original plot with beautiful music. Spawned two successful sequels whilst managing staying out of the mainstream until in 2003, Sony green lit the production of Silent Hill Â– the movie. I saw it last night, here is my review.<br/><br/>The screenplay was one of the film's few let downs. It begins with the familiar Silent Hill opening, of the parent looking for the lost child in Silent Hill. The mother (Rose DaSilva) then follows a number of clues about the town, whilst avoiding a number of monster attacks. Very reminiscent of the game. This is all rather clumsily done and the middle becomes slightly boring. The basis of the confrontation is nothing we haven't seen before and we are left with the familiar open ending.<br/><br/>There are no standout performances throughout the film with many actors struggling with the weak script. Radha Mitchell is decisively average and disappoints when playing the resolute mother in the film's final half. Sean Bean to overacts the point of annoyance as does Laurie Holden. The little girl also fails to make the cut. Aside from this, the film has an array of saving graces.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film is consistently beautiful. The familiar Silent Hill fog and snow are present with some recognisable camera angles. The sets are perfect. The 'other world' is also fantastically done. Overall, the film is good on the eye. The visual effects are another boost, although the first monster wave appeared lacklustre, the remainder are horrifyingly realistic and the level of gore makes me question how this received a 15 rating in the UK. Akira Yamaoka's eerie soundtrack is whispered throughout to good effect, although the original Silent Hill title theme is only heard for about 5 seconds.<br/><br/>A better-than-average video game adaptation, partly boosted by the original material. Should satisfy fans of the game and those who can see themselves enjoying it."

","I'm not a fan of horror films...but it's okay, i didn't get one with Silent Hill. The graphics let it down and it dragged, I'm very interested in playing the game though! The story was good, it's just the first 2/3rds of the film that was a let down, i liked the ending, dramatic, unexpected, and well that the film actually ended. The cop looked plastic, and the women in high heels looked like tripping clubbers. Between this film and Saw, i now hate barbed wire. But there is a silver lining, if you're like me, with friends who make you watch horror's and you don't particularly enjoy hiding behind your fingers for 90 mins, suggest silent hill, you'll look brave before the film actually starts. just beware the ridiculous gore! Oh and it's one of those films where you shout out ""What the hell are you doing that for you blonde idiot?!"" a lot. One more thing, the ending (as in the end scene) what the hell is that?! it confused me and undermined any understanding of the film! Now i am so SICK of the name SHAROn, how many times did Rose yell ""SHAAAAROOOON"" it was like ""shut up woman, we know the kid's name!"", i actually turned to my mate when the dad arrived and said ""at least some other dialogue is used now, he's yelling 'Sharon!! Rose!!' """
"CollectiveFODD3R","3","0","4","22 April 2006"," Disappointed
","I've been a Silent Hill fan since 01 after playing the first game. It was pure love, man. Love. And ever since I've been hooked. The mood, psychology, atmosphere blah blah, the reasons why we're on this board to begin with. And I always thought the game would make a fantastic movie if done properly. <br/><br/>*wipes tear <br/><br/>But sadly this movie was a big letdown. And it's not that I have bad taste or that I'm some whiny 12 year-old. I really wanted to enjoy this film and I just found it hard to swallow. I was really hoping this film would have a similar feel to Irreversible or Mullholland Drive, two films that I adore, but it just didn't. Not even Jacob's Ladder-esquire. I remember Sean Bean mentioning that it had a European feel to it, which gave me some hope. But sadly this statement just was not true for me. <br/><br/>I was fine with the new plot, it wasn't very hard to follow, mostly because they explain the whole thing to you at one point. And I was content with the ending because it definitely had a Silent Hill quality to it and I understood it. But this movie could have been so much better. I'm not saying that this movie is a total piece of crap but it was definitely not worth $9. As for the gore. It wasn't bad at all really. The ending had it's share of blood but it just looked cheesy to me. A lot of the sfx just didn't cut it in this flick. <br/><br/>I was also expecting the audience in my theater to react at the Pyramid Head skin-ripping scene. Not a flinch. Nobody seemed the least bit scared the whole time. But I guess that's irrelevant. <br/><br/>Overall: 5/10 <br/><br/>Gans did what he could. He did his homework, but he forgot to carry the one quite a bit. Maybe next time."
"senorfro","7","0","2","22 April 2006"," good depending how deep you look into it.
","To start, whether you have played the game or not will have a decent impact on how the film is looked at. If you haven't played the game, the movie will do well in horror, with some possible confusion on the story. For those that have played the series, it shouldn't be too hard to follow.<br/><br/>Like many others that have stated before, this movie is the best at being closest to the game. Many scenes, elements, and the such were directly from the game itself (whether SH1, 2, 3, or possibly 4). There are some things that weren't related to the games, Some things seemed kind of off base or silly, but it was kind of expected. If you look for the movie to be 100% accurate, then you will be disappointed. Otherwise, the movie does justice. <br/><br/>Compared to Street Fighter, Double Dragon, Blood Rayne, Doom, Resident Evil, and the such; this movie does an excellent job at transferring to the big screen. Games made into movies are not expected to be the best movies of all time, but that doesn't mean it can't be good. Many games made movies of the past have stunk due to having nothing to do with the original. This movie has done the best so far in following the original script no question.<br/><br/>Was the movie good? yes. Was it the best movie ever? no. Did it do it's job well? of course.<br/><br/>Some people may hate it, due to add ins and the ending, but when you think about, this movie does kick the crap out of the other game movies. If you just give slack to some of the differences, then the movie is enjoyable.<br/><br/>This movie isn't meant for everyone obviously, and no doubt it will be attacked because of either not completely following story, or because of people not getting it since they haven't played the game. Ebert gave it a bad rating, but he hasn't played the game so he doesn't understand it and that is completely acceptable. The dirsctor tried to stay close to the game, and he did just that. And for that, I respect him for it. <br/><br/>The movie is no perfect 10, but it was still good enough to be worth what I paid for to see it."

"verybadbunnie","7","0","1","22 April 2006"," Have faith, and all will be revealed
","This is a great movie for easily-scared movie goers looking for a graphic, almost mindless, thrill. I promise you, the only reason I'm still awake right now (4:30 am) is because the gripping visuals and eerie soundtrack are playing in my head once again. While not a plot-driven movie at all, this film achieves a skin-crawling involuntary scream fest, or for those weak stomached like myself, a sense of regret when it's over because I have once again memorized the palm of my hand during the goriest scenes.<br/><br/>Gore? Yes.<br/><br/>This is a somewhat shallow story of a mother frantically searching for her sleep-walking daughter in a mindlessly evil ""world"". It progresses to seem like it is faith-based, with symbols, prayers and an ominous church playing significant roles. After being chased for about an hour by previously unimaginable, monstrous remnants of reality, all is revealed to be the sick, twisted workings of a fearful, sexually-molested, persecuted 9-year-old girl who somehow grows up to exact a gory revenge on the town that shunned and executed her. And what a revenge she exacted. Every one she ever came into contact with suffers in her 30-year-long (so far) hellish nightmare, as was promised to her by the Reaper during the last moments of her semi-toasted suffering. In the words of the diminutive Yoda: Fear leads to Anger. Anger leads to Hate. Hatred becomes Suffering. Deep.<br/><br/>There are a lot of unanswered questions once the fade to black actually becomes black. Like, why did the writer have the mother end up in someone else's hellish world after she seemingly died? Why not just a dream or a subconscious lapse? Who is Cybil? And, why didn't we hear about what the father discovered? Most importantly, why is this girl's nightmare so important? Maybe that's something the video game fans would know, but I'm not one of them.<br/><br/>The last few ""Sixth Sense""-reminiscent minutes of this movie had many interpretations for my fellow movie-goers, but I walked out of the theatre, pale-skinned and biting my nails, believing that misguided faith is the root of all evil."
"subculturedisciple","5","0","4","22 April 2006"," Game adaptation=bad film
","after eagerly waiting for the movie to come out, i find it to be disappointing. I have played all four games and have the lack of sleep and wet bed sheets to prove it, and after watching the movie i realize this: you cannot compress hours of information that you would discover in a game into a two hour film. It stayed true to the game as far as how the pacing was and that was good... however you are left with the feeling of just how it could have been done better, how the writer/editor/director could have edited out some stuff to give it a better ending. An okay example of a game-adaptation gone okay is Resident Evil. Resident evil did a pretty decent job with the story (after realizing that two more adaptations are expected to be released within the next two years for this quadrilogy) as well as making up some characters and such; as far as Silent Hill goes...the creepy factor of it all just dies once they add in an entire crowd of townspeople to go along with Rose on her journey. What makes silent hill so creepy, as far as the games go, is that you are all alone, not having a whole plague of people behind you or against you. Hearing the uncomfortable ambiance of a dead town as well as what might be behind you or around the next corner or door. Some sequences in this film were great i will give it that; however as mentioned before, a game adaptation cannot be compressed without having it crash and burn."

","I have been waiting for this film ever since I was hanging with my friend and he was playing SH2 and I was like""this would rock as a horror film"". And after what I saw I think I was right. Now unlike the RESIDENT EVIL film that changes some locations and the feel of the game, SILENT HILL keeps what made the game so great and that is MYSTERY. The trailer did not show much and that helped the whole not knowing what the hell is going on thing that this film keeps to its very end. Now a lot of people have complained about the lack of explanation, but I for one love staying on my feet and wondering. This film kicked my ass hardcore. The violence is extreme and thats the way I love it. The creatures are amazing(makes Hellraiser look funny)stuff.<br/><br/>Now on the down side the film could have been shorter and some acting could have been way better. But overall I cannot wait to see this town again."
"ladyofmoonlight","8","0","1","22 April 2006"," Pretty good, actually.
","I'm not a huge fan of gore or suspense, so I generally don't like to see any movies in the ""horror"" genre. That being said, I am a huge fan of the Silent Hill games. Something about the atmosphere in these games just draws me to them. One thing the movie definitely had was the same atmosphere. It did a great job with that and I and my friend were highly impressed. <br/><br/>Essentially, this review is a gamer's take on the film, for others like me who couldn't wait to see one of their favorite games on the big screen.<br/><br/>-Spoilers Ahead!- The movie is based on the plot of the the first Silent Hill, only it's been changed quite a bit. The main character isn't Harry Townsend, single father to Cheryl, but Rose Da Silva, married and mom to Sharon. The mode of getting to Silent Hill is the same, although the introduction of Sybil is a bit different; she's more of an adversary at first. One thing I thought was interesting was the inclusion of the Silent Hill 2 monsters in the Silent Hill 1 scenario. They also changed the reason behind how the town became ""cursed,"" and, the big change to me, they made Dahlia a good, innocent person. There was no mention of raising an evil god, no ""White Claudia,"" and no inclusion of medical staff in the plot. The worst exclusion? No amusement park. That was a disappointment. Oh, and Rose never got a gun, a stick with a nail in it, or an iron rod, just a puny knife.<br/><br/>It also lost a little of the sense of isolation by showing Rose's husband, Chris, on the outside world trying to find them. While finding out the background of the town and revealing the Silent Hill conspiracy a little was informative, it distracted from the story of Rose and Sharon. One of the things about the games is that those who go to Silent Hill don't have anyone outside of town looking for them or caring for them. They're all alone in this and that's what makes it so very frightening. <br/><br/>What they did have: The fog and its ""normal"" monsters. The dark, nightmare Silent Hill and it's ""tough"" monsters. A church cult. Alessa going' all crazy (yeah!). Pyramid Head! The hospital, with a group of nurses. The school, complete with a freaky bathroom. The static on the radio. And did I mention the atmosphere? I really feel that they got that right. I also liked the ending, though a few people in the theater were outright mad at it. The one thing about the town of Silent Hill: Once you go there, you never really leave. Even if you physically get out it's always with you, until the day you die. <br/><br/>This is a very jumbled review and I'm sorry for that. As a fan of the genre, I like this movie but I was disappointed at a few of the changes and exclusions. Seeing crazy Alessa and Pyramid Head, though, kind of made up for all that was lacking. I recommend this movie to other fans of the series. <br/><br/>In closing, I give you my only real complaint: Why did they have to change her name to Sharon? It was Cheryl! It's not that big a difference! Why couldn't they just keep it the same? Oh, that bugged me for the whole movie..."
"josh_t_","8","0","1","22 April 2006"," Effective adaptation of a great video game series
","All of the Silent Hill games have done an excellent job of pulling me into the game through the use of superb story writing, ambient sound effects/music and creepy environments. The movie achieves all of these things almost as well as the games.<br/><br/>As I had predicted before even seeing the movie, I didn't feel quite as drawn into the ""World"" of Silent Hill on the big screen as I was with the games. I think this was due mainly to the fact that they're cramming 10+ hours of story/action into 2 hours worth of footage- not to mention the fact that the passive nature of sitting and watching the events unfold instead of actively taking part and interacting with the story/environment are two very different ways to experience something. The movie went by too quick for the amount of plot they were trying to convey, which could cause viewers not already initiated with the games to become confused with everything that is happening (and those who are to not be able to follow along with and process the information as well).<br/><br/>This does not, however, mean that people who are not familiar with the games won't enjoy this movie- it still has all the elements of a great horror/thriller and ties together (sort of) the plots of a few of the games well enough to stand on it's own. I'm really not a big fan of CGI in horror films so I was relieved to hear that a good deal of the monsters were just actors in latex/makeup which really added to the eerie feel and look of the creatures which was a wise decision, as most of the monsters in the games were either based around human forms or had human-like qualities to them. The scenes that did use heavy CGI, notably the outside of the town with the thick layer of fog and during the ""Nightmare World"" transition phases were portrayed in just the right way so as to capture the essence of the town that those who have played the games before have come to know and love from the series.<br/><br/>The acting/dialogue isn't the greatest, but the characters really don't make or break the film. It's the strange goings-on in the town and all of the chaos that ensues that drive the story of the movie, whereas in the games the story is mainly driven by the characters' gradual and differing involvement in the town and how they relate to what is going on in the town- where across the 4 games, Silent Hill can be and mean different things to the different characters.<br/><br/>Another drawback to not having played the games before seeing the films is the lack of understanding for the different monsters and the symbolism they represent, which you can really only fully grasp from playing through the games and understanding what they have to do with the rest of the story instead of just being shown as a ""weird creatures that want to kill"", as in the film.<br/><br/>The film did an excellent job of unfolding the story (changing some elements of the game stories just enough to make it seem fresh) and had enough plot twists and surprises to keep me interested and guessing what would happen up until the very end. And of course, leaving a good chunk of the plot open-ended to make room for individual interpretation that the games are known for (though unfortunately you can't re-watch the movie to see the different paths the characters take to lead them to different endings) which could leave some, as my friend Tyler had said after seeing it, ""W.T.F?!"".<br/><br/>I told him to play the games, which ironically he says go too slow for his liking, whereas I feel the movie went too fast for mine. Ah well, whether you've played the games to death or not at all the movie won't disappoint for fans of the genre."

","I got tired of the video game due to the lack of vision in the game, and the movie kept that lack of vision in, but because I wasn't playing it, it was fine. It took away from the game, but added to the movie. a lot of people complain about the pacing, the length, and how there is no twist. Well, does every movie need a twist now? This isn't an M. Night film. It's just a straight through horror film that doesn't use a lot of LOUD NOISES to make you ""Scared"" which is really just false horror, since you get scared at the noise so you assume it's a good scary movie. Roger Avery is a great screenwriter and has proved this time and time again, and has not let us down with SILENT HILL. It will definitely confuse a few people, which when people get confused, they get mad, and when they get mad they give things bad reviews...but even if you don't get the ending, pretend it doesn't have one and focus on the earlier stuff. I think because it is such a well done horror film in the midst of such GARBAGE horror films (slither, stay alive, etc) it will be over looked, which is a shame."
"alecrein","8","0","2","22 April 2006"," A Phenomenal Adaptation!
","I have played all four of the games and came into the Movie preparing to judge it harshly. First off I want to try and establish the things I believe many other Critics (Roger Ebert included) failed to do. I will break the movie down as follows: Sets, Shots, Gore (Horror Genre), Plot, Acting, and finally the most heated debate about the movie Pacing.<br/><br/>Sets: First off I think everyone needs to step back and look at the sets, although some are digital the sets are amazingly crafted. It seems as though Gans worked very hard to make sure this was as exact as possible.<br/><br/>Shots: I love the style of the shots, Gans made sure that he mimic'ed (to the best of his ability) the game's camera angles. There is one scene specifically that Gans has completely recreated the movements and camera angles from the game.<br/><br/>Gore: Alright, this movie was drop dead (Heh!) crazy on Gore, the first forty-five minutes is not so much, but after I found myself cringing and wishing to hide my eyes, the Gore is something that I haven't seen in years, they present scenes which normally (to today's horror standards) would cut away, however they do not.<br/><br/>Plot: I loved this plot, yes a little abstract, but overall it is an amazing epic piece that in most cases will leave a normal Horror fan going ""huh?"" Now don't take that as a bad thing, it is good that you are confused it mimic's perfectly the game. Enjoy the movie try to catch all the metaphors and symbols and you might understand it.<br/><br/>Acting: Radha Mitchell is amazing first off, you can tell she researched for this role, she does a phenomenal job. Jodelle Ferland however I felt like taping her mouth shut sometimes, I love her at certain points of the movie, but otherwise she could have done much better.<br/><br/>Pacing: Alright here is the biggie. I will flat out tell you this is a King Kong (New) paced movie. The plot is lay-ed on thick for the first hour then sprinkled throughout, the action however is so quick and disturbing that you wish it would never end. Overall the pacing was moderate, if you aren't a big plot person (which apparently Roger Ebert isn't) then the pace may seem fairly slow.<br/><br/>Overall: Amazing Movie, Gans has recreated Silent Hill how I wanted it, he did the one thing I wish all directors and screenplay writers would do...Follow the Original idea. Resident Evil, Mario Brothers, Street Fighter and numerous Uwe Boll movies didn't do this they would have easily been better if they had."

","So i went to see Silent Hill last night. I really wasn't getting my hopes up cause most horror or suspenseful movies i go see really are just plain bad. But i have to say Silent Hill did a really good job. Not a great movie but a good horror movie. It did all the things a horror movie should do. It kept me interested and for the most part i guess it ""kept me on the edge of my seat"" for the suspenseful parts. I had read a lot of people criticizing that the movie was too boring and it needed non stop action but that would have really made the movie boring. The way the movie goes along may seem slow but it builds things up. I thought the way the movie was show was excellent, 10 out of 10 for that. I really think this was a great movie and i hope anyone reading this will go see it. It was definitely not another resident evil movie hahaha.

On the way, she is stopped by a cop, and runs, knowing that the officer won't allow her to go to the city. In her attempt to flee, she swerves to miss hitting a child in the road and crashes, causing her to blackout. She awakes to find her daughter missing and when she travels into the abandoned town to find her, is puzzled by a sudden blackout and is attacked by disfigured children. She returns to her car and is joined by the cop, who at first seems like she won't be swayed, but when they are trapped in the city together, the join to try and solve the mystery of the city. The eventually stumble upon the remaining people of the city, who take refuge in a church, and learn that the demon that is causing the trouble hides itself in a hospital. When taken to the hospital, the citizens accuse them of being witches, and the cop begins fighting them, allowing the mother to escape into the elevator and travel down into the bowels of the hospital to find the demon. She eventually finds it, and it goes on to explain how the ruin of the town was brought upon the people by the people, through their burning of an innocent girl as a witch, just because she didn't have a legitimate father. Her rage caused the curse, along with a pact with the demon (Satan, even though he isn't referred to as such), which takes the form of an innocent (a child). The demon possesses the mother in order to enter the church, where she unleashes the demon, and it uses its hellacious barbed-wire to rip all of the people apart. At this point the movie becomes pure gore and all scare factor is lost. I'm a bit confused about the ending, as the reunited mother and daughter drive home, and everything seems OK, but is still foggy as it was in the city, and they are in the house with her husband, who periodically throughout the whole movie is shown trying to track them down and solve the mystery himself, but he knows nothing of the evil in the town, but he can't see them in the house, and vice versa."

","Honestly, I never played the video game Silent Hill so all of the images on screen were pretty new to me. But it does not matter - many of the people inside the theather never played the gfame either, but just like me, were intrigued with the film.<br/><br/>Silent Hill's images are remarkable and the sound - where here is a film where the ""sound"" is as equally important as the storyline. There are creepy chills and many are are connected to sounds that you hear.<br/><br/>Silent Hill is about an adoptive child (Alissa) that has reoccuing nightmares that are so intense that she also sleepwalks out into dangerous places in the night that may ultimately caause her death. In her waking state she is asked about her actions, and she cannot remember. The parents seemed to have taken her to seek help for this but, nothing has helped. In these nightmares she mentions a place, ""Silent Hill"" - so when all else fails to help, her mother - against her father's wishes - decides to find the place and take her to it. Upon finding the elusive Silent Hill, she looses her daughter - and sets out to find her all the while discovering the secrets behind ""Silent Hill"". There are secrets that involve her daughter and they aren't very pretty.<br/><br/>The biggest occurrence is with ""the darkness"" and in watching this - it will provide the most horror and chills of the film. There are people at Silent Hill - religious people in fact - that have created their own horrific world that has hurt those in their group and those around their group and they have eluded their punishment for these deeds for about 30 years. Now it seems, is time for everyone to pay for their actions.<br/><br/>What I got from Silent Hill was about a tale of revenge that took over 30 years to accomplish from the hands of folks who used their beliefs to keep their group in check. There are a few things about Silent Hill that may seem off - such as - what is going on with the mother and the police woman? The father and the police head? Is the mother dead or alive? What's with the sirens? But as you watch, and you may have to watch it again (and I will tell you - I saw this in the theater and now on DVD. This is the second review I am writing), those questions are pretty much answered.<br/><br/>A few thoughts about the actors and characters: The father, played by Sean Bean, didn't seem to have much to do and I wish they would have flushed his character out a bit. The Mother, The Policewoman (who reminded me of a real,live rendition of many female video characters) were fine to watch as was the supporting female characters - but again, I would have appreciated more character development. The daughter too, was fine. In writing this, all I want to point out is that these characters were there, some more minimally than they should be on film, but I could see where the video game images were more important to develop than the time for the characters.<br/><br/>Silent Hill the film, may be like playing Silent Hill, the video game. You will have to watch it again to appreciate how decent a film based on a video game this is. It has good scenes, scary images, chills, horror, and one of the better laid out 'town revenge' plots in film. Plus you have the history of Silent Hill (a real place that is a mining town with fires that are still buring today) as a faint, but interesting backdrop."
"GWing_02","7","0","2","21 April 2006"," A solid movie which could have used some more work
","Now let me first state: I know a few things about the Silent Hill series, but I've never actually played the game. In fact, my status as a gamer is disputable. Let's call me a non-gamer just for the purposes of this discussion, as that's what I essentially was going into the movie.<br/><br/>There are several things the movie certainly did extremely well. The atmosphere was set perfectly starting right from minute one. The art and graphical direction were supremely amazing, and the entire style of the film leaves you feeling exactly the proper type of suspense. There are multiple segments which use a remarkable film grain technique, remarkable in the way it is combined with focusing effects and general cinematography to create a very stylistically different and yet natural feel. In fact, in general the cinematography is rather well done, though there are just one or two instances where I was left feeling like a shot was off balance during action sequences. The sound was also very well made and atmospheric, though there was one point during which the action suddenly loosened off and the music changed instantaneously, as often happens in video games. This was the one point during which I thought I was watching a video game movie.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly solid in its premise - there are always inescapable potential problems with a plot like this, so it's not a big deal. However, the presentation of the plot left something to be desired at times. The beginning of the movie especially left a great deal to be desired - the movie opens with a rather tense scene which slackens off; this is normally the point in which some character development occurs in a natural environment so that you feel like you know the people - however, this movie instead moves the plot along like a bulldozer, and the forward-moving but none-too-suspenseful section to follow could have used a great deal more life; it's as if normal life is something to be lived in silence and apathy, and that the characters don't express any warmth or real life. The plot also suffers from the presentation of the child character, which is never distinctly defined as well as it should have been. I felt like I didn't know the girl at the beginning, and knew her less by the end. Another phenomenon which occurs over a span from beginning to end is that the creepiness/scariness factor seems to decrease as the movie progresses - after the first few action scenes, the plot seemed pretty secure in where it was going through multiple delayed climaxes.<br/><br/>The acting was solid, but left something to be desired at times. Perhaps part of the reason the opening to the movie was so bland and lifeless was due to the acting, but this could only be in part. Emotion in general was a little on the weak side from these actors.<br/><br/>Thus, I believe this movie was rather solid. It's an interesting experience, and worth a trial. It was just missing a few human factors which made the already cold material lifeless at times."

","Silent Hill was an excellent movie. Do not believe the critics, and go to see it during the time when your average movie goer (the jerk, the date couple, the I'm gunna check my cellphone guy or girl) isn't going to be seeing it.<br/><br/>This movie was not as scary as it was very tense. I enjoyed it, and enjoyed the tension and how it was employed.<br/><br/>There is a large amount of blood, and It was used in good fashion (some might say ridiculous) and the characters reacted well to it.<br/><br/>There are twists that make you rethink the movie and how it worked, and they will either leave you feeling cheated (which should not be the case) or smiling at how you were tricked.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, go see it if you played the video game also."
"schemingeyebrows","4","0","4","21 April 2006"," Not horrible, but not good, either
","Silent Hill is a little above average when it comes to video game crossovers, but that's not saying much.<br/><br/>First the good: Silent Hill has some very good effects. The atmosphere is sufficiently spooky, and there are quite a few scenes that are very much in the vein of the games. The pacing is alright, though a little slow at times. The music during some scenes feels very out of place, as to be expected from Akira Yamaoka, however, for the most part it sets the very uneasy mood. There are a few good startles.<br/><br/>Now the not-so-good. Sean Bean's accent seems to be wavering a bit, and his story-line seems there only to help bring the scattered plot together; however, it's so underdeveloped that it might as well have been left out.<br/><br/>There's also a lot of silly one-liners that really bring you out of the movie and force you to remember where you are, despite the attempts at developing atmosphere. Ditto for some of the effects as well. And then the overacting to top it off, really helps drop the feeling of immersion that is absolutely necessary for any horror movie. The acting, for the most part, was not terrible. However, the source material that the two female leads have is poor, and the secondary main plot characters really needed some work.<br/><br/>The plot is, as usual, spelled out too clearly. Indeed, much of what seems to be building to a more brain-twisting and interesting concept is wasted in favor of a long, unnecessary, explanation.<br/><br/>A few of these things here and there, provided the rest of the movie were strong, wouldn't be such a problem. But this stuff is too pervasive, and really brings the movie down. At times it seems like the actors are having a hard time believing their own story, at times the effects seem out of place, at times the plot seems irrelevant to what is happening. The movie is also way too long for the shallow message it delivers.<br/><br/>Some have said that it sticks to the source material too well, but I disagree. Silent Hill forced the player to come to his or her own conclusions. The Silent Hill movie's twists don't even warrant second thought. It may stick very closely to the atmosphere, the world of Silent Hill, some of the plot elements, and the 'video-gameyness' of running around opening doors and such, but its similarities don't reach below the skin. And it's this lack of depth that dooms the movie."

","I give this movie an eight only due to the somewhat stupid actions of the main character, Rose, at some points (notably the whole let's-outrun-a-cop-for-no-real-reason part) but it wasn't nearly as bad as SOME horror movies...Also some noticeably poor transitions.<br/><br/>The cinematography and design was superb, the characters were well-cast, and the story was quite thought-provoking, though I had to take awhile after seeing it to digest what I'd just seen.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the game series (I own the second and fourth and have played the first) and this movie was a treat for me. The camera angles, the mood, the atmosphere, even the music was completely true to the games and I was completely satisfied.<br/><br/>This movie, however, is not for the faint of heart. Then again, it's Silent Hill (and those who've played know what I mean). There's blood, there's guts, there's super freak-out times where it's not jumpy, it's just really really freaky. But that's what did it in for me. I loved the game for it and I love the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I give it a rating of super-freakin-awesome, but if you're even a little familiar with the game, it enhances the experience 10 fold.<br/><br/>I don't think that the movie will do so well with a general audience, however, because the general audience isn't familiar with the game and subsequently will think that it's too much, or too weird/confusing and it won't go over so well. Ah well...better for me when the DVD comes out: cheaper prices!"
"gngreffman","9","0","2","21 April 2006"," To all the negative posters...
","I just returned from watching Silent Hill to find many negative comments on this review board. I have to say I'm quite shocked at the attention spans of some of the users on here. To all the people who ""didn't understand"" the ending or thought it was there to ""just set up a sequel"", here's the rundown (it's CLEARLY explained in the plot if you were paying attention).<br/><br/>----SPOILERS---- 1. In the ending, Rose and her daughter (Alessa) can't see the father because even though they've returned home, they are still in Alessa's nightmare. You don't escape from Silent Hill. Hence why there's still fog, even when they're in the house.<br/><br/>2. If memory serves me, this predates the ""Creepy little girl"" phenomena and the little girl has ALWAYS been an important aspect of the story arc. The whole thing is based around the nightmares of this little girl who is the mother of God.<br/><br/>3. Please don't review this if your idea of horror is Freddy vs Jason and you've never played the games. This movie isn't for you.<br/><br/>---END SPOILERS--- Now for my review. It'll be truncated, I promise.<br/><br/>I thought the acting WAS a little off, but then again, it's no worse than the first SH game. ""Radio? What's going on with that radio?"" popped into my head at one point during the movie. Everything else was true to the game in every aspect I could imagine. The atmosphere was PERFECT, as were the monsters and the CG ""Dark world"" transformation scenes. This movie is FOR THE FANS only. I can't stress that enough. The whole time walking out of the theatre I kept saying to myself, ""Man, if you've never played the games you'll HATE this movie"".<br/><br/>My only major gripe with this movie (and hence the 9) was the plot. I'm still scratching my head and my mind is racing trying to connect the various monsters with their reasoning for appearing. As any fan knows, some of the monsters are based off of the main character's inner demons and sins. I just couldn't place the existence of the numb bodies and roaches in the game, and seeing out of place monsters from both the first and second games kind of ruined it for me, plus the lack of the ""Alessa is the mother of god"" left me a little bit puzzled and kind of justifies the argument that it's a rig rip off if one were to not know the plot.<br/><br/>But all in all an amazing addition to the franchise and will definitely hold a spot on my silent hill shelf when it's released on DVD/"

One of the major things that really bothered me was the Christianity bashing. I'm not exactly the ""churchy"" type but I couldn't get over how the second half of the movie really seem to draw upon the darker side of the history of American Christianity. It also dragged through this part of the movie and lacked direction. Seemed as though they ran out of ideas for what to motivate Rose to keep looking for her daughter.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first half of the movie and suggest seeing it, but not the second half.

"Midianad_com","10","0","1","21 April 2006"," SILENT HILL... A Deeper Impression.
","I Loved the movie so much that I went and saw it twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything. Sure enough I found plenty of things I missed the first time around. It was very much like playing the Silent Hill games where you have to play them 2-4 times just to get the story and then the message.<br/><br/>Unlike horror movies of modern day & the past, Silent Hill is not something our society will enjoy or even understand by the masses. There is no sex scenes, no slasher movie elements, not even young REALLY unknown actors like the movie DEATH TUNNEL. Silent Hill requires too much thought (where American society wants every thing just handed to or done for them) and secondly a lot of cultural beliefs of the Japanese angels, demons, hell, heaven, purgatory, the soul, etc... that American society has had limited, to no access too. Basically this is caused by our society being very closed minded due to our religious beliefs in the past having a huge impact on society today.<br/><br/>This movie has a deeper message which we all need to figure out for ourselves. the concept for silent seems to be how the player see it at the time he/she plays the game. Same goes for this adaptation to film version of Silent Hill. So ya I basically see this move as a simple test to show modern society how closed minded, self centered, and fake we really are as human beings in this plane of existence. We really don't know what happens to us after we die do we? Will we create our own heaven/hell or be reborn? The list goes on & on!<br/><br/>Special Effects = 10 (Top notch!) Plot/Story = 8 (The ""Cult"" & the ""Demon"" was changed for the US) Acting = 8 (Few moments of shame but over all very pleasant) Music = 8 (Seemed a bit out of place sometimes.)<br/><br/>Midian's over all score = 8.5 of 10 (Definatly NOT a waste of time or money! Go see SILENT HILL now!)<br/><br/>SCORE KEY: 10=PERFECT to 1=WASTE OF TIME<br/><br/>In closing, this version of Silent Hill is what Team Silent Hill wanted it to be. TEAM SILENT HILL & SONY approved it and enjoyed it according to an interviews and filmmaker's blog. Not to mentioned the fact that the movie has been set up to continue on to a SH 2 like story. The world will grow just like the games. I didn't understand parts in the first Silent Hill until I played Silent Hill 2 & 3. All I can say is if I could change 1 thing about the movie I would have kept the original cult concept. But maybe in the future with a Gans/Avery/Team Silent Hill sequel you will see me eat those words.<br/><br/>Midian Midianad.com"
"onlybygrace2000","7","0","1","21 April 2006"," Silent Hill - Deranged but somehow Thoughtful
","""Silent Hill"" is truly like someone's worst nightmare crammed into a two-hour movie. I just left a screening, and I can't get rid of the bizarre, grotesque images and distinctly sad and haunting feeling that often come with my bad dreams. For horror film fans, ""Silent Hill"" provides some nasty thrills, buckets of graphic gore, and extremely disturbing images (the burning corpses, the nurses, and Pyramid Head... Yikes!).<br/><br/>For the person looking deeper, there are some very fascinating meditations on denial, guilt, the nature of judgment, and the bond between parent and child (especially mother and daughter). The film also provides a vivid depiction of the devastating truth that evil (especially under the guise of goodness and ""righteousness"") breeds more and even greater evil, and that such wickedness can only be faced with denial (which leads to even greater suffering) or the truth (which leads to its own difficult consequences).<br/><br/>For the person who likes both (horror and depth, that is), ""Silent Hill"" is quite a treat, such as it is. On a technical note, the creation of atmosphere using cinematography, visual effects, make-up, costumes, set design, and music is simply amazing. Very few films cast as gripping a spell as this one. As many reviewers have said, watching this film is something akin to taking an excursion to hell.<br/><br/>The acting and scripting are serviceable. The direction, while not perfect, largely succeeds in building up tension and suspense, with the only weakness coming with an overly explained and somewhat familiar finale (that still retains some power due to the truth of its message).<br/><br/>All in all, a worthy effort. As an aside, anyone who would allow a child to see this film is suffering from a serious lapse in judgment. This is one graphic, disturbing movie. Discerning adults and older teenagers only!"
"SenshiKid","9","0","1","21 April 2006"," My Take on the film
","I saw this movie in a chilly theater, at midnight, at a time when the streets are practically empty in my town, and the people come in droves to the movies. Well, first gripe, the people who were there were just totally awful. I had to separate myself at once from a posse of gamers on my left talking about Harry Mason and some dude and his girlfriend on my right laughing and laughing because ""this white woman just got bitch-smacked."" I couldn't concentrate, so I moved.<br/><br/>But as the movie went on, that familiar feeling creeped in. That feeling that I was alone and that I couldn't rid myself of this enormous wrong creepiness. Atmosphere as horror is definitely back in action in the Silent Hill motion picture. I felt as if I was playing the game again, because, suddenly, I needed someone to sit next to me or some distraction so that I wouldn't get drawn in to the atmosphere. Well, needless to say, I wanted to go back to my other seat. But I held my ground and finished it alone, something I've never done with the game series.<br/><br/>Now, the movie. Script is the only bad element in this flick. It's not horribly out of context or anything, it's just got that Resident Evil thing about it. ""Don't worry, everything is going to be all right,"" was the audience's favorite line. We all just cracked up so hard after seeing this woman nearly get fileted by a giant buster sword, only to turn to her companion and offer words of numb optimism. The thing is, it wasn't on purpose. There are other points in the movie like this, but you must see to believe.<br/><br/>Plot. This movie really had Saw fans in mind. The plot just made my stomach turn. I think I obliterated a urinal cake once I got out of this movie as well, because I didn't want to miss a beat. Truly, this is one of the sicker films I've seen. Visuals were too good to be true, considering what could have happened in the hands of an American producer. <br/><br/>Finally, to put to rest all the rumors and wondering, there is no incredible twist at the end, because frankly, it's clichÃ©. This film is graceful enough to let the story do its storytelling and not try so hard as to entertain your inner sleuth. Many were disappointed with the ending. I was not."

(Exept the girl of course) the only major complaint I have on the movie is the appearance of Pyramid Head. His role in the movie was not enough.

Based on the video game of the same name where a mother gets into a car accident in the city of Silent Hill and awakens to find that her daughter is missing. As she sets out to find her she quickly realizes there is nothing normal about Silent Hill, and she will need to find her daughter as quickly as possible if they are to get out alive. In the film a combination of horror, mystery/detective, and special effects themes make for a horror movie that will keep you thinking as well as scared; though the scares are more disturbing and creepy than outright frightening. Overall, this is a horror flick that is full of disturbing imagery but definitely not your typical slasher fest. I played the video game as a child and there are some remarkably good adaptations from the video game that are pretty satisfying if you played the game, though not at all necessary to enjoy the film.

","This movie is, as well known by everyone, based on the popular video game series, Silent Hill. I have only played the 4th one, so I did not know too much about the plot before I saw the movie. According to my friend, the movie is based on the second game of the series. And the music used in the movie is indeed from the second one; I know because I have the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is one of the better horror movies. While it is certainly not a masterpiece, it still has some good elements to it. The special effects were great, the story line was suspending and interesting, and the music fitted the scenes. However, they really should have worked on the dialogue. A lot of times it seemed so cheesy that people bursted into laughter....a no-no for horror movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows the game (again, I know because someone told me). But from time to time it seemed to be following the game too much. They would give clues to the main character to follow, and even give her ""items"" when she needed them.....just like in a video game.<br/><br/>I would say this is a good attempt to crossover from game to movie, but they could have done better."
"ReizendeBlumen","9","0","1","21 April 2006"," One of the Best Game-Film Adaptations. (thats a period)
","Just got back from the theater and should say I am about 93% satisfied with the film. Lets start with the only negative thing I can say about this film since its very short.<br/><br/>If you were a fan of the games you will know full well the atmosphere of the realm of Silent Hill. One of the most terrifying things of the game, in my opinion, is the sense of isolation that the game gives you. The silence of running through the streets for five minutes to a half hour and then your radio howling at you. Unfortunately that element of the game could never possibly be adapted to film. Why? Well main-streamers will not sit through a movie with the character running around the streets for that amount of time without drama, comedy, or action of some sort. Also it would eat up a lot of the running time and if you wanted to get the whole story in there the film would easily run from four-and-a-half to six hours. But that doesn't mean that its not completely there, its just not as intense. And that is the only thing that keeps this from being a ten in my book.<br/><br/>The good: Acting is top notch. Dialogue is good. The rendering of the town is superb, right out of the game and than some. Costumes amazing. Everything is good. The adaptation works well for this franchise as all the Silent Hills are different stories set in the same place so any discrepancies in plot between the game/film are, and were in my opinion, forgivable. For those of you have not played the game or who aren't fans for one reason or another, you will enjoy this film. The story will catch you and is very deep. It isn't the scariest film of all time I warn you, but will creep you out for sure. For those who love gory thrillers, your gore hunger will be satisfied as there are demented monsters, burning human bodies, blood aplenty oh and many barbed-wire-wrapped monsters. This is a very visceral flick. The setting of the story isn't drawn out and long as it foreshadows the plot that will unfold and throws you into the story quick. The body of the movie hardly if never slow, and the end of the movie is ... well go find out.<br/><br/>To sum it up, this is a multi-genre multi-media classic film. Hardcore fans to casual movie goers will appreciate this movie. Definitely make your way out to see this one folks."
"MopManMoped","6","0","2","21 April 2006"," Mediocre.
","Before I get into this review, let me state I'm a huge fan of the game series. I've played them all several times, and have always thought of them as some of the most artistic games ever made.<br/><br/>However, the film adaption of Silent Hill was overall a letdown for me, despite the fact that there was a lot to admire. Gans stayed true to many of the signature elements, and did a wonderful job with the visuals. The fog, the rusty fans, the bleeding walls, the sirens, all of that was presented beautifully. The designs on the creatures was done very well, and Pyramid Head especially looked fantastic. The sound was also top notch. Even though all of the music was taken directly from the games, I won't complain because Akira Yamoka's work is always pleasing to listen to.<br/><br/>The film had some major weak points though. The storyline, or more importantly, way of presenting it, was what really damaged it. On the whole, the movie stayed somewhat true to the plot of the first game, but it was told in a much different manner. One of the things I loved about the game was how the plot was not spoon fed to the viewer, which really made you think to understand what's really going on. The movie told every detail the game kept subliminal, but it also told it in an inconsistent way that I found confusing and just, well, not ""Silent Hill"". The segment toward the movies climax in particular just didn't work for me, and the dialog too could have been improved.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes the games such a unique experience is the feeling of isolation, and knowing you're alone. There's rarely encounters with other characters, the storyline you have to think about to understand, and it has such a powerful atmosphere you can only get by taking control of the character. That's a beauty that a movie simply cannot capture. Because of that, I feel that this film could have never truly worked out the way the games do.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought Silent Hill was a mediocre film, but wasn't the memorable experience that the games were.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I am a major movie critic. I love the Silent Hill games very much, especially the soundtrack. When I heard there was a Silent Hill movie I had nothing but doubt and dread in the back of my mind remembering the curse of game-to-movie adaptations. Every single one I have ever seen has not only done injustices to their games, but were just plain HORRIBLE movies. Except Advent Children was pretty good.<br/><br/>This movie not only does the game justice, the attention to detail is astounding. It is a near perfect representation of the games. It is loosely a combination of all the games. The movie is R, and for a reason. There is only one brief nude scene, and a few cuss words, but the movie is Incredibly violent, as it should be.<br/><br/>I am most happy to hear that the soundtrack from the game has been directly applied into the movie. There are only 2 songs that are not by Akira Yamaoka.<br/><br/>There were only two things I did not like about this movie. I found the girl slightly annoying at the beginning of the movie, but maybe thats because I hate children. I also wish they showed a few more monsters from the game.<br/><br/>If you are not a moron, and are looking for an intellectually stimulating unique horror movie then you should enjoy this. You also don't necessarily have to have played the games in order to understand the movie. As long as you have some sort of attention span and are in the mood to see a movie you should be able to follow the story.

There is something about the grain filter, and off center shots, mixed with the creatures that walk in a demented fashion that make this movie, a horror film to remember. When Rose Da Silva finds that her adopted daughter, Cybil Bennet, talks about a place named Silent Hill in her sleep, she attempts to cure her daughter of the disorder she suffers from, Rose takes Cybil to that place to help her daughter remember of what she has been dreaming of for all this time.<br/><br/>This Movie was well made, although as I said, you will be laughing at parts from the awful acting and horrible dialog. The amazing visuals and horrifying effects will have you looking behind you days after you leave the theater. I enjoyed my experience while watching Silent Hill, but i wish that they would have put more time in the plot, because with the right tweaks, this movie could easily be in the top 10 horror films of all time. So, if you enjoy movies that leave you crying for mommy, then I highly recommend a visit to ""Silent Hill""."
"joestank15","5","0","2","21 April 2006"," A mixed bag, but a damn good scare
","Silent Hill - Rose DeSilva (Radha Mitchell) looks for her daughter Sharon in a malevolent ghost town known as Silent Hill.<br/><br/>Being a fan of the beloved game franchise for years, I awaited this movie with bated breath. I come off with mixed feelings about it though they lean more towards the positive. I really feel that Christopher Gans captured the town's essence and the feelings of sheer terror found in the gameplay.<br/><br/>Parts of the movie are gross, disturbing, and the film overall is depressing. The monsters are horrifically real and truly inhuman creations. Truly, the movie is in its stride in the middle of the movie when Rose, sometimes accompainied by cop Cybil Bennet (Laurie Holden), is exposed to the various ghoulish creations and environments of the town's rotten core. Never has a film made me feel so terrified and very ill-at-ease. (I heard people laughing at points that seemed to be caused by excess tension that from actual mirth.) Though Johny Cash's ""Ring of Fire"" is amusingly used, there is very little to laugh about in the film. The rest of the music is taken directly from the games and is well used to create a depressing atmosphere. Either you like it or you don't.<br/><br/>I should say ""nothing intentionally written for you to laugh about"" because a few bits of dialogue are kind of clumsy or unnecessary and caused me to grin slightly. I would've expected better of Roger Avary, writer of Pulp Fiction, but he probably gets tired of everyone comparing his stuff to that film.<br/><br/>The acting is mostly strong, and when it isn't, it sticks out like a big ol' sore thumb. Mitchell does well as Rose. Always showing concern for her daughter, never screaming too much or overacting. Holden plays good support. Sean Bean is completely wasted on the sidelines as Christopher, Rose's anxious husband desperately looking for her while the real story goes on. Why couldn't they have saved him for the sequel? I could almost see him almost yearning to do have some big part in the story. Instead, as it happened in North Country and Equilibrium, he is thrown away. Alice Krige is suitably creepy as Christabella, and Tanya Allen just sucks as Anna. Why did they include her? She brings down the quality of whatever scene she's in. Thankfully, she gets killed off. Unthankfully, it's one of the most gruesome things in the movie.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie doesn't hold up to the first half, and I really dislike that so many people are around the ""ghost town"". In the games, there were at most 6 people total in the town. Here, there's maybe 30. It really brings down the quality.<br/><br/>The movie ending (and hell, the entirety of the movie) is likely to be confusing for most and depressing for all if they figure it out. In any case it's a bloody good scare and a must see for horror afficionados. For Silent Hill fans, a mixed bag. I'm still unsure where I stand on Gans interpretation. There was a lot he did I like and some that I really didn't like. I might appreciate it more with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>This gets a B/B-"

","I enjoyed Silent Hill a lot. I'm one who has played some of the games, so it was kind of like a geeks dream come true watching this.<br/><br/>I think the visuals and the music really helped to make this a great movie. The use of the CGI and the sounds and music drew you in and was almost uncomfortable to watch at times. I sometimes felt myself looking around at others to see if they squirmed at some of the screams as I did.<br/><br/>I wasn't terribly satisfied with the end however; I think it went down hill. The writing seemed to drift and it almost felt rushed at the very end. I won't hold that against it though :) All in all, it was a interesting story with great visuals and an amazing director. 9 out of 10 here...."

","Apart from being a film-buff, I've been a fan of the silent hill series of video games from its inception, and it must first be said that the film stays true to the style, feel, and tenor of the games. But if you're not an avid fan, or if you cringe at the sight of your favorite intellectual properties being even the slightest bit played with, then you may not like this movie. The dialogue, as in the games, is all but canned, but unlike the games, the themes here have been simplified and lain out for the viewer, removing one of the deepest draws of the series. It's not enough to say that movie producers expect more from a 2 hour long movie in terms of quick and succinct plot development than a game publisher expects from a game, in fact many of the themes from the game were butchered by this simplification. In the games Silent hill 1 and 3, a story plays out which is paralleled by the movie in which a little girl and her father (mother in the film) are draw into silent hill by a woman seeking to resurrect a demon-god, in silent hill 2 and 4 a deeper theme of the town as an outer limbo, a place for wanderers with sordid pasts. These themes are mashed together in the film, and hardly come out intact. I would rather suggest this film for gore-fans simply for the extreme depictions of the aftermath of violence and deformed monsters that the main character rose faces, than say to a fan of classic horror, or a fan of the intensity of survival video games that they should see it. It's no masterpiece of game-to-film, but it's not the worst movie this year by far."

","I absolutely loved this film from the start to the beginning. I couldn't find really anything that was completely wrong with it. If you can tolerate most horror films or if you want to go to get scared because you usually can't handle most horrors or if you want to see a good movie I would highly suggest this film. The acting was really good by Radha Mitchell who played the mother, Sean Bean who played the father and some of the other supporting actors. Before this film my favorite horror was either Dawn of the Dead (the remake) or the Exorcist, but I think I have changed completely. The story line was ingenious, even though I haven't ever really had the chance to play the games, I felt like the excellence of the games transcribed onto the movie to produce and excellent production"
"jatie001","8","0","2","21 April 2006"," The best adaptation yet
","Video game movies tend to suck. So far, the only redeemable one is Mortal Kombat (in a cheesy kinda way). Then comes Silent Hill. I remember reading Roger Avary's blog on his website when he was writing the script, describing how he played the game a trillion times to get things write. My hopes seemed to soar now that a screenwriter who plays and understands the game is actually writing something worthy of the original source. Then I found out that Christophe Gans would be directing. My hopes sank a bit. I like Brotherhood of the Wolf, but that's a different movie and I wasn't sure how he'd handle this.<br/><br/>My fears are unfounded. Gans did a remarkable job translating the mood and atmosphere of the game onto the screen. Avary's script, although suffering from some occasionally bad dialogue, does a good job of explaining the story. If you played the first game, then you may have been just as confused as I was when I tried figuring out what the crap was going on. The movie actually did a better job, even though the backstory is a little different here. Visually, it was dead on. The 'dark' world of Silent Hill is as sadistic and violent as in the game, and the 'light' world is has this spooky/eerie atmosphere.<br/><br/>Acting wise, the film suffers a tad. Laurie Holden, who plays Cybil Bennet, has some really bad dialogue and there was this odd moment between her and Radha Mitchell's Rose that seemed almost like the two were about the make out. Sean Bean does an OK job as Charles, the husband of Rose, although I don't think he's given enough to do here to flex his acting muscles. Kim Coates, the detective, is a little too over dramatic. And the little girl was OK. I liked her better when she was the 'demon child' and not as Sharon, Rose's daughter.<br/><br/>Overall, the best adaptation yet. I think filmmakers are still figuring out what works and what doesn't when adapting games (it took them a few decades to get comic books right). Gans and Avary, however, are on the right track. If you're a fan of the game YOU NEED TO SEE THIS, but if not, check it out anyway. People in the theatre, when I saw it, who didn't know about the game still enjoyed it."

","Fantastic on every level bar one. The graphics were astounding to the point of reality becoming a blur against the evil that is thrust in your face. The sound, by far one of the loudest films i have been too, was enough to bring it all to life and the sheer graphicness of the horror is enough to wonder in disbelief as you contemplate how on earth they got this stuff past the BBFC at a 15 rating. The only thing that let it down was the acting which was equally horrific, so much so your kind of rooting for everyone to get killed just so they might shut up for a brief moment. But lets face it, if your going to see this film your not going for the plot or the acting skills of the cast...your going to see the mind-numbing terror that chills your blood and has you leaving wondering what your mind has just experienced and whether it will leave a lasting effect on you and believe me...it REALLY WILL! If you liked the games GO SEE THIS FILM!"
"jononarf","6","0","2","21 April 2006"," I could not have asked for something better
","First of all, being a horror/gore hound, and someone who enjoyed the first Silent Hill when it made its PS1 debut, this movie was a bitch slap to the other video game movie adaptions. If you are going to watch this movie, you have to understand that the game was not about balls to the wall violence, with guns blazing, and people dying left and right,.... it was a mystery-nightmare drama. I will admit it though, I totally loved the Pyramid Head...thing.... and I wished he had more parts in it, but it was a good idea not to overdo an idea. The music was a dream! I love the soundtracks of the game and I recognized every song that was played.<br/><br/>For the fans of Silent Hill, I will say that this movie was extremely good. For horror fans or just plain movie loves, just check out the visual powerhouse of it. I'm so glad they had a good film crew to work on this one and not make it completely stupid for American and other audiences around the world who viewed this.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to own this DVD, and it better be the Uber edition!"
"zen39699","8","0","2","21 April 2006"," Not a horror film, like some people here would have you believe...
","However, this is one of the most intense psycho thrillers I have EVER seen. Actually... it's more like an intense psycho ""gore"" thriller, which kinda makes it something new and in a genre of its own. Here-in lies the main downside to the film; it wont appeal to everyone! Let me make one thing clear first off, this is not a review of a great game>film adaptation (I never really played the games); this is a review of a motion picture, something new and fresh, something exhilarating and downright unnerving. New and fresh is where 'Silent Hill' succeeds and in which it maintains a steady radioactive pace from start to finish (well steady-ish), with scenes that will invoke so much mental anguish and fear into your psyche that it will be as though you were placed strait into the film making you believe it's YOU running from ol' Pyramid head and not the poor Radha Mitchell (stunning acting btw).<br/><br/>I do have minor quibbles with the pace and the dialogue, however I think they're so minor, so irrelevant and inconsequential, that to mention them would seem rather unfair to the hard work Avary and Gans have put into this project. Unfortunately, the major pyramid steak to the heart of Gans is the critical backlash the film has received. Ebert is someone that needs some mental help (and a new job), especially if he didn't understand the ending... How simple can an ending be? Gans manages to explain the conclusion with suave images, fx and camera techniques -- not one single word is uttered as to the explanation-- but its obviously there and not too subtle in my honest opinion.<br/><br/>So... apart from the two instances where the film falters, like the rather computer game like, find this, go there, see crazy women about a dog and to rescue my daughter from evil last act , this is, without a doubt one of the best MOVIES of the year! And when I say BEST, I don't use the word lightly and I don't mean one of the best game>film adaptations... actually come to mention it, WOW came to mind a few times throughout the film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars. I've taken two points away due to the fact that some people just wont grasp what's on display here and that my friends is a real shame:( Christophe Gans, please make Metal Gear Solid!"

","Finally, after waiting for a sequel to Jacob's ladder we get this spiritual follow-up instead! I saw this film today on opening and I was thrilled to find that the time spent was worth it, not wasted on these same genre flops: Mario Bros, Resident Evil Alone in the Dark, House of the Dead, Doom, Mortal Kombat...the list goes on. Konami should be proud that their franchise was done correctly. Now they just need to make a film version of Hideo Kojima's SNATCHER please. HINT HINT!!<br/><br/>BASIC PREMISE <br/><br/>The story is about a mother Rose, who's adopted child Sharon goes missing when they drive to Silent Hill. The reason for this is that Sharon is having trouble with nightmares and sleepwalking and one night cries out the name 'Silent Hill' in her sleep. Her mother decides to investigate her daughter's origins to see if she can uncover the truth behind Sharon's troubles.<br/><br/>When they arrive is when the fun begins as Rose wakes up in her car and Sharon has vanished! She looks out beyond to see a thick mist and ash falling from the sky like snow. Rose must now find Sharon and seek the answers to the mysteries of Silent Hill.<br/><br/>REVIEW <br/><br/>The pace feels deliberately slow which works as it builds the tension and is the exact opposite of Paul Anderson's Resident Evil films which were MTV paced where you could leave your brain in autopilot.<br/><br/>This film actually has a deep story which requires the viewer to concentrate, watch and listen. Christophe Gans previous film I watched was Brotherhood of the Wolf. This film also had a similar pace to it where I felt it fed you the answers slowly and required you to participate your brain for full enjoyment. It's a thinking person's movie.<br/><br/>Acting, directing, writing and all crew related tasks (don't forget the little guys!) were of very good, professional quality, I didn't feel I was watching amateurs or that the quality of production was poor.<br/><br/>Compared to the video game upon which it was based, Silent Hill follows the game series rather well, borrowing most of it from the games SH1 (story) and SH2 (monsters). I do hope they make a sequel, either by borrowing from SH3 storyline or what happens straight after the movie ending.<br/><br/>IS THIS FOR ME? <br/><br/>Honestly, this is the best video game to film adaption yet, if you go and see this film expecting it to be like Final Destination or The Grudge you will be disappointed, this film is more for people who appreciate to take the time to sit down and be sucked in by the film not just waiting for the 'good bits'.<br/><br/>RATING (out of 10) = 6.9/10<br/><br/>******SLIGHT SPOILERS FROM NOW:********* <br/><br/>FAVOURITE SCENES<br/><br/>PYRAMID HEAD scenes were good, his weapon reminded me of Wolf Creek and Mad Max, I wanted PH to speak and say 'that's not a knife. This is a knife!!' <br/><br/>When Rose first enters Dark SH and uses her Zippo to light her run down the alleyways towards the burning children that attack her, the camera angles are extremely similar to the ones used in the game. This made a fan of the game (me) quite happy.<br/><br/>When Rose is in Dark SH and at the school and parallel to them in our reality, her husband and a policeman are investigating the school and they are all in the same room but can't see each other made me appreciate the frustration of the characters and the desperation.<br/><br/>CRITICISMS <br/><br/>They should have followed the original story completely and used the parasite side story with the policewoman becoming controlled by the enemy rather than her being burnt alive.<br/><br/>Could have been more gore as always with films and also more characters for Rose to have interacted with in Silent Hill that were from our reality with their own little side stories and death scenes. <br/><br/>Did not like the Hellraiser style massacre of the cult by Burnt Alessa, thought this was needless and they could have used PH to slice/dice them for example."

","If you're a fan of the games then you'll love this movie. That's not to say it's perfect. Some parts of the movie will probably get some people lost, but it's enjoyable. I can't say it's a scary movie, mainly because the scary ones are much like the game, so I knew it was coming. This movie did have it gross moments. I was happy that the most memorable creatures from the first two games where in the movie and AWESOME!!! Hopefully the sequel will have more creatures and scare then story telling. The story resembles much of the first two games combined. As a fan I did get lost a little when they constantly switched from one parallel world of Silent Hill to the other, but in the end, it came together. That doesn't mean non-fans will understand. So non-fans keep an open mind when watching this movie. This is a true to the game adaptation. It's none of the games but it has all the love of them. Great work Gans."

","I'll keep this short.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the video game that this film was adapted from, so that was part of the reason why the film held some interest in me. The film's cinematography, story, and style is very much a substance carried over from the games. It shouldn't allow for stale acting though and poor dialogue. The acting in the film is comparable to that of the voice acting in the games. It's is more preferable, but the acting needs more ""omph"".<br/><br/>The effects and gore are great, very stylistic and gross.<br/><br/>Sometimes the music gets in the way of a dramatic scene, even though the style of the music is close to that of the games. It just doesn't fit at all... They can try to keep those that were necessary to the scenes, but sometimes a more quiet suspenseful scene can work more effectively.<br/><br/>True to the game, the ending is very eluding. Many will be fustrated by it, but for the fan in me it's very satisfactory."
"Digital_Thought_Machine","8","0","1","21 April 2006"," Surpassed the skepticism by far!
","As a fan of the game series, my interest was piqued when I first heard there was going to be a Silent Hill movie. However, as so many promising film ideas are made into disappointments, this one was far better than I feared it might be.<br/><br/>Fans of the game will recognize much of the music and elements of the plot. At first I was concerned that including music we already heard from the games would take away from the film, but it began to fall into place nicely. As the games' desired effect comes from their atmosphere, the music, sound effects, and set design serve to construct a lonely, horrifying sense to the film.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch. As a jaded usually-anti-CGI type of person, there wasn't any CGI I found to be lame. It all looked pretty realistic. The climax, which does utilize some CGI, was done excellently - it's one of my favorite scenes in the whole film. Also, what is so cool is that almost all of the monsters are live actors in costumes. Only one type of critter appeared to be wholly CGI and it was done well. The other instance(s) that appeared to utilize CGI appeared to do so only because a large number of monsters was required.<br/><br/>Those of us who've been involved in filmwriting know that exposition is generally discouraged since it can be a cheap way to cut corners around the storytelling - and some people have complained about the exposition scene in the film - but for people not familiar with the games especially, I feel it was quite necessary and was neither out of place nor cheaply done, not to mention the fact that the plot of the film is not a carbon copy of the plot of the game so it was even useful to the fans.<br/><br/>The closing writer/producer/cast credits were done well and will probably keep you in your seat for an extra couple minutes before the full cast and crew credits roll. You'll see what I mean....<br/><br/>All in all, I gave it an 8. One point docked for a little bit of less-than-stellar acting that occasionally pops up. And another point dropped just for slant factor - I don't feel that the film had a strong first act. In any case, you can tell that Gans and company were really into the film, as it has the creepy, visceral feel of the games and the proper atmosphere to do it justice. I think all of the fans of the games, except the impossible-to-please fanatic fanboys out there, will enjoy the film and if there is a sequel, I have every intention of seeing it. For those of you not familiar with the games, prepare to still have questions by the end, but I think you might enjoy it nonetheless. If nothing else, it might motivate you to check out at least one of the games in the Silent Hill series and experience the phenomenon of truly wonderful interactive survival horror!"
"knodd1","6","0","2","21 April 2006"," The game is scary because it has that psychological terror, this movie doesn't have that and that's why it's not scary.
","It's missing that *psychological* horror. Silent Hill is a town that is dark even when there is daylight because the fog is so thick. This fog or smog is so thick that the only time you're able to see anything is when you're close to it. Imagine being lost walking around looking for your daughter in Silent Hill, a place with thick fog where you could only see as far as your hand can go. That's the psychological horror, and the movie didn't have that.<br/><br/>In the game, unpredictable and unexplainable things happen. These things are not suppose to be scary but you might get scared anyways. In the game, for example, doors that were once locked are now mysteriously open. Classroooms that were once filled with tables become empty. After returning to an elevator, another button suddenly appears leading you to another room. It's not that scary but the more these events happen, the more that psychological confusion builds up until it becomes horrifying. And then, the ""darkeness"" comes and then your state of mind loses control. This movie didn't have that process and that feeling. It doesn't have that originality.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of this movie was very good. Then after a while you'll start to yawn at the nonsense they give you afterwards. In my opinion, there's too many characters. The only Silent Hill game I ever played was the first Silent Hill and to me, back then, it was the scariest game I ever played. That game had just a few characters, but it was enough to set that mood of loneliness and fear. When a movie like this has a lot of people in it, it makes you feel like you're in crowded area away from fear.<br/><br/>Also, I wanna point out the camera angles. In the game, you feel alone because it feels like there is only one camera following your character. That's what makes the game so interesting, the game doesn't always switch scenes or switch camera. And in the game, you don't ALWAYS here music. That's what makes it scary, the second you hear something you're going to panic. I think the only strong thing in this movie is the computer graphics. Amazing graphics and description of how the ""other world"" should be.<br/><br/>And finally, the plot, the plot really had it's weak points. The beginning was easy for everyone to understand and follow. But towards the middle and last part you become more lost than the characters in the movie. Trust me, you'll get confused. But I was expecting this already so I'm not surprised by the people complaining about the plot. The games plot is supposed to be confusing anyway, but when it comes to movies, I don't think anybody likes being confused.<br/><br/>If you wanna make a movie based on a game, it should feel like the game. That way, everyone watching will understand why so many Silent Hill fans enjoy the game. They did a pretty good job making the film, but they could have done better. They should have given it some originality, something the audience never seen or felt before in a movie. That's how I felt when I played the game for the first time, it was so original and interesting. And yes, the game will always be better than the movie.<br/><br/>Scary? No. Funny? hmm it depends, even though there was no comedy at all but I'm not complaining. Entertaining? Sometimes. Confusing? Yeah, the last half hour of the movie. Worth Watching? If you played the game, if not, good luck.<br/><br/>6/10"
"philgeorge","7","0","2","21 April 2006"," A balanced review - some good, some bad elements.
","PLUS POINTS: 1) The film looked excellent - art direction was top notch. 2) An unusually atmospheric & stylish film considering the Hollywood input. 3) The ""monsters"" were great - some of the best gore and a welcome minimal use of CGI (the physical effects looked ace) all created a real sense of dread, disgust and horror. 4) Laurie Holden was excellent as Cybil. 5) Without a doubt the most exciting and faithful translation of a video game to date - no question whatsoever there - If you've ever played one of these games, you WILL get some deja vu. 6) A definitely above average horror film, with some real chills.<br/><br/>DOWNSIDES: 1)Radha Mitchell ran around ""by the numbers"" and fumbled with her torch in all the right places. Certainly no original stand-out heroine. 2)The ending - a bit too formulaic, and certainly way too much narration to explain what just happened in the last 2 hours. (Although having said that, certainly not an ""all loose ends tied up"" finish). 3) Could've been a tad MORE use of the monsters - esp ""pyramid head"". They definitely left you wanting more there, (and no, less is NOT more where these were concerned) 3) It DID drag a little in places. My lasting memory is a little TOO much running around in the fog and ash, and not enough ""otherworldly"" post-siren action. 4) Sean Bean was incredibly average (when ISN'T he!!?), but I suppose a necessary dour and balancing element to all the freakiness. 5) Spooky kids are SO last year, and therefore not spooky."
"wingchild","10","0","2","21 April 2006"," Good game adaptation
","I rate this as a pretty good adaptation of the creepiness of the game, with lots of blood and gore and similar to keep the kiddies entertained. More than they've bargained for in some respects; I am sure there will be complaints. I wouldn't advise taking young children along for this one. <br/><br/>Even given the level of horror presented, I feel that the games were stronger in terms of psychological impact. They carry a weight that the film cannot. The games are actually worse in terms of their actual horrific content than the film is (though viewers who've not compared will find this hard to believe).<br/><br/>There are parts of this film that I wish they had been handled differently; At one point the film goes into soliloquy mode to explain things people who played the games already knew about the town of Silent Hill. I feel it interrupted the flow of the film; audiences should have been given a chance to figure it out on their own. One of the best parts of the game series was that so much of it was up to personal interpretation; ""What just happened?"" generates a different answer depending on who you asked.<br/><br/>The soundtrack to the film was good though it could have been lifted right out of any of the SH games. I'd have preferred something redone with an orchestral score, but that's just one viewer's gripe - your mileage will certainly vary, particularly if you haven't played the series itself.<br/><br/>Still, despite these minor failings, this is easily the best video game adaptation to date. It has some trouble standing on its own as a horror flick, though it certainly captures a large measure of the creepiness that Silent Hill is famous for. 7/10 (should be 6, but I'm a fan of the games)."
"joaquinortiz2004","7","0","3","21 April 2006"," There are some flaws, but in the end it is a good movie with a cool message!
","Last night I went to a preview screening of ""Silent Hill"" in San Diego. I was anticipating this movie for a couple of months now. Even though I never played the video games I am very familiar with their story lines. I definitely wanted to see how Christophe Gans interpreted all of the material from the games into a cohesive movie that would be scary, disturbing, and thoughtful.<br/><br/>After seeing it I have to say that the movie is no masterpiece. Some of the CGI looks a little weird, some of the ideas in the movie feel stolen from other movies (the game takes a lot from other horror movies), the plot line with Sean Bean's character is a little thin and feels thrown in (which it was because the studio did not like a script with only females), some of the acting and dialogue are mediocre (not bad, just not great), and the plot has some issues.<br/><br/>However, the movie is creepy, and at times disturbing. Not in the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" way that leaves you disgusted, but more in the way of haunting images and setting. The biggest strength of the movie lies in its art design; the town, the creatures, and the costumes pull you into a very unnerving world.<br/><br/>If you are familiar with the games the plot will keep you guessing. I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but the ending is not like the games. That is the film's other big strength. The third-act really shows an interesting social and political message that some might overlook. As much as the horror elements carry this film, it is really the message that elevates the film from gory atmospherics into something that is more thoughtful than your average fright-fest."

","I really liked SH from a gamer's point of view. They captured everything that made the games great. However, there are a few nit-picking comments about the story. Won't get into that here. So if you've played the games (you can get the references by just playing the first one), you'll love this movie. On the flip side.....<br/><br/>If you haven't played the games, you won't like it as much. As a horror movie on it's own, it's decent. The monster are cool, Pyramid Head looks awesome, and the atmosphere is incredible. But as far as generating scares, it falls a little flat. I can't tell what it is, but it's missing something. I felt the tension, but it lead nowhere. Where it does work as a horror movie is the gore and the tension. It has a lot of both, and more gore towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a toss-up. SH is without a doubt the best movie made from a game ever. But it's just good enough to be worth it to a horror fan. Recommended, but non SH fans should take caution."

","Well kiddies, just got back from a matinÃ©e showing of ""Silent Hill"" and all I got to say is........wait for the DVD. ""Silent Hill"" is stylish, good cinematography,(although video game-ish in spots) slightly creepy, not scary, ambiguous in some areas & at times banal. The film is almost an amalgamation of the following films (most notably) ""In THe Mouth Of Madness"", small elements of ""Gothica"", ""Hellraiser"", and Michael Soavi's ""The Church."" Although SH isn't as good or entertaining as 4 out of 5 of those aforementioned films. All I can figure is, that the video game must be more captivating & fun than it's cinematic counterpart otherwise they wouldn't have produced 4 of them. Warning: Those of you who detest lots of CGI in your horror films you will NOT be happy. Also, can't understand why Silent Hill was rated ""R"" there really isn't that much gore except at the end. Is the MPAA that overly sensitive to a little blood letting? BloodStone's Recommendation: See Silent Hill only IF you feel you MUST or are a HUGE fan of the game (I have never played SH so....); otherwise you ain't missing much imo. BloodStone's Rating: 5.5/10 for good acting, cinematography, stylish in some parts, slightly creepy atmosphere, and unfortunately little else."
"deg200","7","0","2","21 April 2006"," A visually stunning, impressively faithful adaptation
","Just 10 minutes into Christophe Gans' big-screen adaptation of the video game chiller Silent Hill, it becomes obvious that he and writer Roger Avary are fans of the game which is one of the best parts about the movie. Their desire to translate it faithfully, and hence pleasing the SH fans amongst us, is obvious in every shot. From the unsettlingly crooked & elevated camera angles to all the little gaming references, the translation is sublime. It really is the best game-to-film adaptation yet, not only because of the design but also because it doesn't pander to modern audiences. There are things left unexplained; you have to *shock horror* work stuff out for yourself! Props to Gans & Avary for that.<br/><br/>It's by no means perfect though. For starters Sean Bean's accent is atrocious. I have nothing against the guy - he's a fellow Brit after all - but man... it's not good. Not good at all. In fact his entire sub-plot could be stripped away and we wouldn't be any the wiser.<br/><br/>The ending too seems a little forced and wildly grotesque - elements of Hellraiser no less, but then if they had gone with (one of the many) game endings that would really confuse audiences, so I guess they did a good job.<br/><br/>Thankfully the positives far outweigh the negatives. From our first creature encounter to the awesome introduction of Pyramid Head, the puss-filled, squirming denizens of Silent Hill really deliver - incredibly faithful to the game and a joy to see on a big screen.<br/><br/>Carol Spiers' style of production design works really well here too. She previously worked with Cronenberg on eXistenZ amongst other things, and does a great job of capturing both 'normal' Silent Hill and 'possessed' Silent Hill. The transition sequences from one to the other are astounding - the digital effects work is breathtaking. Gruesome as hell but still breathtaking.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, possibly with the exception of Sean Bean, are great particularly Laurie Holden as Cybil.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the game franchise, you'll get a real kick out of the film. If you're not familiar with the games, you'll still enjoy it, but prepare to be slightly baffled..."
"nickholbert79","7","0","2","21 April 2006"," Good movie, but not for everyone
","I saw this movie the first possible chance I could, and I enjoyed it. I would not suggest it to anyone, though. The acting is a little bad here and there; the story can be ambiguous (until the slightly tacky part where all is explained); and the gore is probably enough to send some people packing (I saw several people leave during the film, but they could have been surfing).<br/><br/>I gave it a 6.5 because I was torn between the pleasure I got from seeing one of my favorite games come to the big screen as a movie, and the slight disappointment I felt with its distance from the average viewer and its patchy story telling.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good movie for a fan of the game or horror movies, but an OK movie from the perspective of the average Joe, a view I had a hard time dropping."

","I apologise to my brother Roy for hi-jacking his login details but i need to share my thoughts after seeing this. Had high hopes due to the fella off Brotherhood of the wolf doing it but a bit of a let down.<br/><br/>The effects when the sirens go off esp in the school at the start are amazing and worth the ticket price alone. The Kristabella lady is ace and the one playing Anna is a scene stealer but for the love of god why the accent Sean Bean?<br/><br/>All the monsters were kind of explained as the film went on in the sense that we knew why they ended up that way but can't work out pyramid head at all. Was he a butcher or something? Also seeing as the man cop was in silent hill in the fires and got burned but then left silent hill how come he hadn't aged properly?<br/><br/>The ending is a bit of a cliff hanger but if there is going to be a sequel its fine.<br/><br/>Those of a squeamish disposition be warned there are 2 bits that will make your tummy go all funny here but i won't mention them, its pushing the 15 rating and my brother agrees with me on that.<br/><br/>He gives it an 8 as do my sister and husband and they have played the games. I didn't find it scary just a bit hammer horror only with better effects."

","The first time I played Silent Hill, I was 13. My playstation was to my 13 year old self what my laptop is to my 19 year old self. I was a fan of several adventure horror games, but when Silent Hill came out and dropped the adventure part altogether, I knew I was home. Silent Hill is a true horror series, and since it's US release, it has maintained a steady cult following. Three sequels on PS2, X-Box, and PC have been relatively well received (Silent Hill 2 will always be my favorite) and fans have been anticipating a movie adaptation for a while.<br/><br/>And here it is.<br/><br/>The film is obviously catering to fans. At times, it can feel like the director is sitting next to you, nudging and winking every few seconds.<br/><br/>As the lights came up in the theater, I instantly noticed the looks of confusion on nearly every other patron's face. Three people stopped me on my way out to ask what had just happened. (I was wearing a PH t-shirt, so I was an easy mark, I suppose.) If you're a fan of the games, I genuinely think you'll enjoy it. If you're not... you might want to reconsider your movie choice."

","Just seen Silent Hill and can say I was 'hardly' disappointed in it. Just a few 'niggles' that followers of the games (like myself) may gripe at. Like, why not show more of 'Lisa's' scene and I was disappointed they changed Cybils storyline to what we knew in the game. There was no Lakeside Amusement Park at all and no mention of the mark of Samael at all. Basically if you LOVE the games GO SEE IT!! If you don't know what a 'game' is FORGET IT, Seriously you'll think it 'bizarre' if you haven't played the games. I'm not quite sure how it managed to pass as a '15' in the UK as some scenes would be a little disturbing for the faint hearted and the gore is GRRRREEEEEAAAT! A very enthusiastic thumbs up !"
"sd2522","9","0","3","21 April 2006"," For a movie based off a video game, it was good.
","First off when you enter the movie theater remember that everything has a double meaning or a completely different meaning to it. Now most movies based on video games just plain blow, Super Mario Bros(Nuff said.) But this was a nice surprise, it was good. However if you aren't a Silent Hill fan, or if you never played at least one of the games then you may be slightly confused. My one and only gripe is that the movie is loosely based off of the first game, don't get me wrong the plot was good, but it made the movie feel like it was in an alternate dimension, as in a completely different one, not Silent Hill's actual alternate dimension. Anyway, I heard somewhere that the only CGI used was the fog and when Rose, the main character, enters the dark world. I was lied too, and if you heard the same thing you were lied to too.<br/><br/>*Warning Spoiler* Okay now if you're a fan of Silent Hill then you know that the monsters/demons are usually reflective on the main character, but unfortunately this isn't true here. They used the Paitent Demon from SH2, Nurses (which actually can be forgiven, to a point.), and the infamous Pyramid Head from SH2. Now the Nurses I can see since Rose went to the hospital, but the Paient Demon I was disappointed in seeing since it really didn't belong. But Pyramid Head jeez he actually was a bit of a surprise, and I was actually glad he was in the movie. Now the Nurse can be forgiven, but when you see them think of Micheal Jackson Thriller, don't ask me someone else said they reminded them of Michels Thriller video. Not sure why? Oh, and at the end during the credits they played the opening song from SH3, and oddly enough it fit in well to the credits.<br/><br/>All in all it was a great movie and even if you're not a fan of the Silent Hill series it's still worth seeing."
"makiotwist","8","0","3","21 April 2006"," Best Video game Movie Thus Far
","Finally, the whole video game-to-movie conversion has succeeded! The movie nearly imitated the feeling of accomplishment of finishing - or rather, ""surviving"" the abominations featured in the game. Uwe Boll and the rest of Hollywood: take notes & notice, video game movies can be done right after all! KONAMI first introduced the series to video gamers on Sony PlayStation back in the late 90s. ""Silent Hill"" pulled its fans in using skin crawling suspense, twisted small town lore & monster macabre, as well as the ever chilling paranoia of being put into situations beyond normal control or interpretation of the human mind... reminiscent of movies like ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""the Exorcism of Emily Rose"".<br/><br/>So how did SH film director Christopher Gans succeed where most other video game movies failed? For most of the movie, he didn't neglect most of the factors that made the game such a classic. Treacherously poised camera angles, malevolence on both human and creature mentality, and a revealed history of twisted faith & cognizance. All which were put into this film and artistically interpreted by Gans to just enough of a degree that it didn't completely tear away from the gaming series.<br/><br/>However, this film isn't without faults. With the artistic liberties taken, there were nit-picky details such as the town's drug problem and certain character changes that were different from the game. The acting, in terms of some of the lines delivered, were either oddly delivered or lacking a slight degree of compassion... which wasn't too different from the game in that aspect; but luckily the script didn't draw too much on vocals as it did visuals. Indeed, it's trivial to mention a shred of flawed acting in a HORROR film since most films of the genre are pretty corny in acting style; but Casting Director Deirdre Bowen did a great job amassing this crew. The addition of Sean Bean as Christopher DeSilva easily gave viewers a different view on the situation as well as a possibility of a sequel through his character as a protagonist.<br/><br/>There's obviously going to be a huge debate on what was computer generated(other than the Fog), which probably won't be truly confirmed until DVD commentary or similar answers from the cast & crew. Not that the CG was bad in the least, but Gans' approach to use backward filmed action of contortionists did give it that unworldly creature feel. Speaking of vile creatures from SH; Gans' didn't skip out on putting in one of its most famous villains. Pyramid Head, a tall and vicious brute bearing a gigantically gruesome blade that'd make both Freddy & Jason jealous, was icing on the cake. It easily getting the crowd riled up terrified delight and best yet - he didn't engage in boxing the heroine like another certain survival horror movie...<br/><br/>Overall, the movie definitely earns a visit to the theater to catch it. It's not in-your-face scary ""gore-gasm"" in majority but it does get the skin crawling in wondering just what horrors lie in this unorthodox small town. Be wary of the sirens & radio static weary travelers!"
"nick-467","8","0","3","21 April 2006"," It was good. Not as good as the games but I don't think any film could be.
","It was an intelligent interpretation of the games and it fleshed out a lot of the ideas without losing too much mystery.<br/><br/>Cast: Very good. People have complained about Tanya Allen's performance but I thought she was great. Her character seemed very child-like as if she stopped developing after the fire, cocooned in the cult's embrace. Laurie and Radha were good together, bringing an interesting emotionality to the world. Sean Bean's accent wobbled occasionally but he was otherwise okay. I really liked that the lighting and make-up were not used to hide all of the wrinkles and flaws in the actor's faces. The characters in the games don't have perfect faces and this makes them more real (and more interesting to look at). I'm glad they carried this across to the movie.<br/><br/>Setting/atmos: The foggy world didn't feel quite like the games. I'm not sure why but for me it just didn't conjure quite the same feelings. The darkness, however, was spot on! It felt 100% Silent Hill and perhaps even had a bit of an edge that is lacking in the games.<br/><br/>Monsters: Great! Nice combination of live-action, CG and speed changes. The sequence with the grey children at the start is superb! PH is terrifying.<br/><br/>Story: More stuff is brought to the front and the mystery suffers. It is quite clear what is going on a bit too early. There are many things left unanswered and ambiguous which is good. On the positive side they have taken and made excellent use of the religious ideas of the games. The blind (and deaf) faith of the cult is terrifying and believable. There is a moral ambiguity that is very unsettling.<br/><br/>Climax/ending: The climax of the film is gruesome and wonderful. It feels very Silent Hill. The ending is very interesting and will spawn many discussions and interpretations. I really liked it. I felt it captured the feel of some of the scenes in SH2.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I enjoyed this film a lot. It didn't completely capture the world of SH but it was still bloody good. I'm really glad Christophe and pals were in charge of this film and I would be thrilled if they made a sequel.<br/><br/>Not all fans will like it. Some people will be so excited about seeing it that they could only be disappointed. Some people will miss Harry and grumble about every difference. Some will have exposed themselves to so many spoilers that there are no surprises left. Some will worry too much about what other people think of the films (I think that many non-fans will be left a bit confused). But I think most will be really glad that the film comes as close as it does to being silent hill."
"G-Faust","5","0","4","21 April 2006"," Somewhat disappointing...
","Having just watched this movie, I think a lot of people (myself included) wont really 'get' parts of this film without playing the game prior to watching it.<br/><br/>I personally didn't feel that the film met my expectations, not just because I didn't understand parts of it, but because I just didn't feel it created the necessary suspense and therefore didn't really invoke any fear from me or the people I was watching it with. Some of the creatures in fact looked slightly comical which didn't particularly help me get in the mood for a horror film. In addition, some of the acting was questionable and Sean Bean's accent sounded a little silly too. Don't get me wrong though, this was definitely at the better end of the scale compared to some of the other video game adaptations out there but just isn't all that great when placed up against some of the great horror movies out there.<br/><br/>My friend said it stayed pretty true to the game so if you were a fan of the games then I would probably recommend it. However, if you just want to see a good horror film I think you may find this a little disappointing and compared to films like The Descent, this just seemed a little dull.<br/><br/>Of course people will disagree with me but I don't particularly care if they do, as for me Silent Hill just didn't deliver what a good horror movie should."
"galahad58","7","0","2","21 April 2006"," Interesting Version
","As a big fan, of the Silent Hill Playstation games, I was eagerly awaiting the release of the Silent Hill movie. I was enthusiastic about the release of this movie, but was a bit skeptical since the last great horror PS game (Resident Evil) spawned two horrible made films. My hopes were that someone embraced the Silent Hill experience and would not over bastardize the story and destroy it as Resident Evil had been destroyed. While the movie is highly influenced by the game, it does not completely hold to the storyline behind the Silent Hill games. While some fans may not enjoy this aspect, it had to experience some changes in the plot to make a feature film out of the Silent Hill story. The game was mostly an action/horror that took you to different places to fight different creatures. The plot, of the game, was a simplistic plot to advance you onward in your adventures. The screenwriters embellished the plot line and added some elements to make more of a feature film story. Overall, the film was a nice suspense/horror story. I would have liked to experience more of the evil dimension and had seen more of the creatures from the game introduced into the story. The overdoing of the religious zealots I understand were key to the story, but in a world were religious zealots have caused most of the horrors and trouble of a civilized world, I could have used a touch less of the zealot movements. For a very interesting and suspenseful movie, the ending was a bit weak and anti-climatic. I would still recommend Silent Hill and rate it a 7."
"spimpulse2003","7","0","2","21 April 2006"," Decent
","First off the movie starts off fairly good with like the whole Sharon sleeping which was pretty damn cool. But the thing i liked most about the movie was that most of the trailer occurs within like the first 10-15 minutes of the movie. The four legged thing was not in the movie because i guess the filmmakers didn't feel it necessary to put it in. Also the origin of pyramid head is so brief you can barely catch it. In one of the parts you see a poster that is up, and well you can see the large sword that he has in the poster of when they are burning a witch at the stake. But basically some things from the game that are in the movie to me had no purpose of being in the movie. Like the nurses in the second game were supposed to represent James' sexual frustration or something but in the movie it felt as if it was just placed there for no purpose and no point of being in the movie. But the movie was decent and the part from the commercial where the girl says i am the reaper in a demonic voice. But the movie had a lot of unanswered questions in the end, and being a person that never played one of the games i was informed for most of the movie or the game by my beautiful gorgeous girlfriend who is a silent hill buff as i am a movie but hey don't read all of this and think oh my god i am not going to go see it just see it and make up your own mind about it."
