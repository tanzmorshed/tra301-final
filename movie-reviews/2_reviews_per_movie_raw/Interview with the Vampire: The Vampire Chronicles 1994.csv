"Aquillyne","10","241","259","31 January 2005"," Deep-thinking vampire searches for meaning in eternal life
","'Interview with the Vampire' is an atmospheric, highly gripping ""film involving vampires"" - not a ""vampire movie"". Whilst the latter would describe a film that focuses on its vampirism and might be judged on the sharpness of its fangs, this ""film involving vampires"" has all the merits of the very best cinema, and at its core is nothing but a fantastic story carried by compelling, believable characters.<br/><br/>For those who may not be able to overlook the vampiric content, look again. The vampirism herein is a plot device, a way of presenting characters who cannot die or age or be harmed, so that the philosophical questions of life itself can be explored. But equally, for those who will be interested in the vampiric content, this film presents a rich mythology backed by a trilogy of books, which fleshes out the concept of the vampire in a much deeper way than any other production.<br/><br/>Every person has their own world view, their own way of living and thinking. People can be brooding, contemplative, cautious, reasonable, carefree, hedonistic, optimistic, emotional - and every shade in between. But these are all world-views based on the knowledge that life is short. What would happen if told their lives would never end? Who would be happiest? What would they do? How would eternal life affect each person? And most importantly, if a way of living was bringing meaning to a person's life, would that still work once life was infinite? All of these questions help us explore philosophical ideas as old as time, and that exploration is the focus of this film.<br/><br/>The story is propelled by vampires Louis (Pitt) and Lestat (Cruise), each representing a different take on life. Whilst Louis, who began as a depressive wanting to die, thinks of eternity as an extended curse; Lestat, who seems to live every second as it comes, barely even considers the future three minutes hence. Told from Louis' viewpoint as he struggles to find some meaning in a life he knows will never end, we are taken on a ride across the centuries, as Louis' outlook and happiness undulate whilst characters and relationships come and go.<br/><br/>Alongside Louis' turmoil in coming to terms with his (now eternal) life, a secondary theme is explored, which is the notion of survival. Even though Louis is clearly dissatisfied with life, he never attempts to end it, despite this option being open to him. In other words, surviving, in and of itself, was a motivation that outdid any other. Most importantly, survival outdoes Louis' trouble over the fact that his only source of nourishment is now the blood of living animals, preferably humans. Despite attempting abstinence, and then attempting to drink only the blood of rodents, this basic feeding instinct proves too much for Louis. And yet, as Lestat points out, what is the problem? The fittest always survives, and whoever is lower down the food-chain will be eaten. Humans eat animals, and vampires eat humans - it's all natural. But nonetheless, are there moral limits? Even if you have to kill a human, is there a more moral way to do it? ""Monstrous,"" Louis exclaims, as he watches a group of vampires murder a defenceless girl. Yet might survival require the forgetting of moral consciousness, like Lestat?<br/><br/>'Interview with the Vampire' explores all of these deep, important issues whilst delivering an incredibly powerful story populated by charismatic characters, haunting and diverse settings and immortal dialogue. Gripping from start to finish, you will be enamoured at the vampire-world opened up to you; and by the end, you are left wondering what choice you would have made, given the one that Lestat never had..."
"smatysia","8","259","303","26 December 1999"," Tom Cruise IS Lestat
","I, like Anne Rice, was initially dismayed that Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat. But when I saw the film, I had to admit that he absolutely nailed the role. I had always thought of Cruise as a pretty boy, and not really a serious actor, especially since he failed in his attempt at a Streepian accent in ""Far and Away"". However, he perfectly portrayed Lestat for what he is, a monster with a monstrous ego.  I think that this was the first film I had seen with Brad Pitt, followed shortly by ""Legends of the Fall"" so to me his acting credentials were impeccable, in spite of my female friends swooning over him. The rest of the cast was excellent as well, with the only minor quibble that Antonio Banderas was too old for the part of Armand. Kirsten Dunst was adorably evil. The cinematography was beautiful, considering that almost all of the film (of course) takes place at night.  One note on the supposed ""homo-eroticism"" in the film. I have the advantage, having read Rice's books, so here is the deal on that. In Rice's world, the vampires are absolutely sexless. Therefore, gender has no meaning to them. When a vampire loves another, or a mortal, it is truly from the heart, as no sexuality of any kind ever enters into it. The only thing to them that is close, is the kill. Killing is highly ""erotic"" to vampires. However, this too is really asexual, and so again, gender has no bearing on the eroticism of the kill. I think that some elements of this, which apparently came across as homo-eroticism, were included in the screenplay just to emphasize how different, how non-human, that vampires are."

","Someone said that this movie was too cerebral for horror fans who live for drivel like ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"", and too much of a horror movie for people who look (or at least pretend to look) for meaning in movies -- pseudo-intellectuals. That person couldn't have been more correct. I'm not a horror fan, I'm not an Anne Rice fan...I'm not even fond of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, and Antonio Banderas. But Interview With a Vampire was a movie that excelled my expectations.<br/><br/>I refused to see this film for 3 years because I believed it would be what I perceived it to be: glitzy Hollywood garbage geared toward adolescent girls with posters of the 3 main actors all over their walls. I finally broke down and rented it, and I was astonished by the incredible performances delivered, the thrilling dialogue and the way it was delivered by the actors, the scenery, the plot, the score...everything. I never thought that Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise could act, but their performances made their unbelievable characters a reality. However, the true star of the film was Kirsten Dunst. At 12 years old, this girl was able to hold her own against her co-stars, and often stole the scene (particularly the incident in which Claudia tries to cut her hair and subsequently Lestat discovers the corpse in her bed.)<br/><br/>You don't want to look for the meaning of life in this movie. It's a story. The plot is basically the history of a vampire's life, and I don't understand why people are compelled to trash a movie because of its simplicity. Look at the title. That's all it is, and if you expect more you're setting yourself up for disappointment. It's not the deepest of movies, that's why it should be enjoyed for the intense dialogue and the great production that went into it. Others trash the movie because of its homoerotic undertones. This aspect is so fleeting that it's ridiculous to dwell on it, and if you dwell on such an insignificant aspect of the movie then you were obviously looking for something to bother you. One additional thing: to even suggest that the violence in this film could be responsible for incidents such as the Columbine High School killings is beyond moronic.<br/><br/>This isn't the greatest movie that has ever been made, it's certainly not a complex analysis of life, or a parable with a moral dictating the enjoyment of life. It's a brilliantly produced gothic tale of a vampire, nothing more and nothing less. In respect to the book, I've never read it and I don't particularly care to read it. But for all of you who have been complaining about the movie not living up to the novel, here's a clue that might prove useful in the future: the book is ALWAYS better than the film. Don't waste your time complaining about something that is understood."

","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE: THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / SDDS<br/><br/>17th century New Orleans: The relationship between an ancient vampire (Tom Cruise) and his bloodsucking proteg√© (Brad Pitt) is tested to destruction by a young girl (Kirsten Dunst) who challenges their established dynamic, leading to betrayal and murder.<br/><br/>A doom-laden meditation on life and death and the nature of grief, based on Anne Rice's bestselling novel (written as a response to the death of her beloved daughter), and featuring two of contemporary Hollywood's most recognizable stars (both astonishingly beautiful here) as vampire and willing victim, remaining eternally young as the world evolves around them. Cruise plays a seasoned killer who revels in bloodthirsty excess, while Pitt is a conscientious objector who balks at the prospect of drinking human blood, until Cruise creates a 'companion' for Pitt in the shape of a little girl (Dunst) who refuses to grow old gracefully, with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>Scored with melancholy grace by composer Elliot Goldenthal, and beautifully designed and photographed (by Dante Ferretti and Philippe Rousselot, respectively), the film is epic in concept and execution, spanning the social upheavals of 17th and 18th century America and the horrors of 19th century Europe, where a nest of ancient vampires (led by scene-stealer Antonio Banderas and a miscast Stephen Rea) wreak terrible revenge on those who transgress against vampire lore. But, for all its spectacle, director Neil Jordan (THE COMPANY OF WOLVES) - working from a script credited to Rice herself - maintains a leisurely pace and never loses sight of the characters. The movie contains some beautiful, transcendent passages, including a breathtaking transition from 19th century Europe to modern day America via the introduction of motion pictures (everything from SUNRISE: A SONG OF TWO HUMANS to GONE WITH THE WIND and SUPERMAN!), and an incredibly moving sequence in which a once-proud vampire is discovered in exile, laid low by his own vanity.<br/><br/>The film's delicate tone is upset by a trick ending which comes completely out of left-field, though Jordan has denied any suggestion of studio interference. And, as with the novel, the homoerotic undercurrent is mere window-dressing, an unconsummated tease which the filmmakers (and Rice herself) refuse to explore in any detail, lest it frighten the mainstream crowd. Sadly, the movie is dedicated to the memory of River Phoenix - originally cast as the interviewer who provides one half of the film's title - who died of a drugs overdose during pre-production; his role was taken by Christian Slater. Followed by QUEEN OF THE DAMNED (2002)."
"Dark0","10","110","136","9 October 2003"," Vampire essence
","I have a passion for films with dark settings. What's even better is when the film is not only dark and dismal but also deep and engrossing. With a combination of Anne Rice's script and Neil Jordan's direction, the overlooked Interview with the Vampire not only looks great but contains good material. Most of the time when a film is based on a novel it will try to capture the themes of the novel by choosing areas to work from. Luckily Anne Rice also writes the screenplay and understands more than anyone else what areas need addressing, providing the backbone to the dialogue and plot.<br/><br/>
Set in 1791 Orleans and progressing through different periods of time, IWTV is technically excellent and aware of its surroundings. From the first moment your eyes are fixed on the screen. This is the sign of great art direction coupled with costume design and set pieces that are more than pleasing on the eye. Far from in your face the film allows a taste of each period with a mixture of light and colourful scenes to the more prominent dreary settings it encompasses. Moonlit streets, abandoned plague ridden residential and underground gothic architectures all add to the great detail that has been taken in creating a believable and picturesque look to the films periods it contains. Helped also by a musical score that really lurks in the background, depicts the time and in some areas the feeling aptly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The story, told with a mixture of narration from the protagonist (Brad Pitt in this case) and a screenplay with enough room for all the stars makes a tight little package. At just over 2 hours long though, this may put off the viewer looking for an all out action vampire piece or those with little patience. Interview after all is a drama at heart with horror elements but what sets it apart from others is the humane way in which it's dealt with. A point in the film that leans on stereotypical vampire views sets the tone of the film perfectly, fiction aside Vampires aren't so unlike humans which is portrayed through the emotions (or rejection of them) throughout. One of the key players in such a task is surprisingly Tom Cruise as the bad influence Lestat. In one of his more challenging roles, Cruise conveys a charm that fits the theatricals of his character perfectly. Through excellent makeup and clothes from a period he refuses to break free from, Cruise is less distinguishable but all the more better for losing the usual side of him that may have been too familiar. Left only with a look of ferocity and impertinence Cruise works his role to a brilliant combination that really brings out the character of Lestat making him extremely fun to watch. Lestat's mood swings and cruel insinuations really spark the film up, stealing every scene he's in.<br/><br/>
What makes the film interesting is how every character has a background and each character has different things that make them tick. Along for the ride with Cruise and Pitt is a very young Kirsten Dunst as the disillusioned vampire child Claudia. It seems that Jordan is a good director for getting performances as Dunst gives a fine performance at such a young age, definitely showing more promise than the usual teenage focal points she has set herself on since. While Lestat is the most enjoyable character and practically the teacher, Louis and Claudia are the key elements to a story of self-discovery concerning the dark world they have joined. Other than this Christian Slater and Antonio Banderas share little screen time but enough to make their characters wholesome enough.<br/><br/>
One area that I applaud but others may disclude is the vivid scenes of a gory nature used profusely throughout. Jordan, going for realism and with blood being an important part of vampire life includes graphic details.. and with no holds barred. Jordans realistic touches add only to the plausibility of the vampire way of life, emphasising the grotesque way of living they are lumbered with for eternity. Such a eternal damnation is one of the main themes of the film exploring the depreciation of Louis and Claudia and how they come to terms with their new life. It would seem that such a serious tone to a fictional tale would make it hard to enjoy but with a mixture of dark humour throughout the film knows not to take itself 'too' seriously. The end clearly establishes this fact nicely.<br/><br/>
Minor quibbles aside like some hokey dialogue from time to time and despite Pitt underplaying his performance a little, among the Vampire genre and even as a drama this is a classy piece of work from a intelligent director with a flair for dark style (in most of his other films too), and more importantly produces a epic tale with sturdy direction. If you have the interest for a drama, specifically based around vampires there is little other choice than this. Through its fine performances and stunning look one things for sure, you wont forget this one easily.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"fraggerrock","8","99","123","23 September 2006"," highly underrated, often over-looked
","When you ask someone to name the best movies to come out of the early-mid 90's, not many people would mention this movie. That's too bad.<br/><br/>It isn't American Beauty deep, but the film presents real human emotions through the surreal notion of vampires. Cinematography, set design, and score are top notch. It doesn't look dated at all, particularly in this day in age of CG, blue screen galore.<br/><br/>The acting....i hate to admit, because i'm not by any means a brad pitt or tom cruise fan....is pretty darn good. This was the first film I saw tom cruise in and thought (gee...the pretty boy can act), the other coming to mind being Magnolia. Brad Pitt isn't as great, but holds his own and it's a quiet, somber Brad Pitt, which is a good change to the normally twitchy, over-the- top characters he portrays (fight club, 12 monkeys, ocean's 11....even se7en to a certain extent). and of course.....kirsten dunst....who's best role in her career is this film.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, so i am writing purely on the film. Apparent by the other reviews here, there are people who really like this movie. It's a shame that more people haven't given this movie a chance."
"Falconeer","7","21","26","22 January 2007"," Ornate, lushly filmed horror, with erotic overtones
","Now that some time has passed, Neil Jordon's beautiful work can be watched without obsessing so much over the stars who were involved. 'Interview' is an extravagant assault on the senses, filled with beauty, erotic and graphic violence, and wonderful, at times poetic dialog. To be sure, this is a Hollywood production, but with director Neil Jordon in charge, the film possesses that special ""arthouse"" film look, with many scenes being too strange and dark to come across as typical Hollywood. Pitt is fine as Louis, the centuries-old vampire who recounts his sad and fascinating history to a nameless ""interviewer"", played a bit too light by Christian Slater. If you dislike Tom Cruise and his films, as i do, you should not let his participation in the film dissuade you from seeing this; As the sinister Lestat, Cruise is barely recognizable, and gives here, what might be his finest performance. Obviously due to the subject matter, 'Interview' is a relentlessly dark film. There are a few short scenes of daylight in the beginning, until Louis is transformed. Then begins his life of eternal darkness. When I saw this in the theater, the effect of sitting in a darkened room watching a film that takes place entirely at night, really felt strange. Coming out of the theater I felt as though I had been away from the real world for a long time. Jordon's aesthetic vision, supported for once by the huge Hollywood budget, insured that ""Interview"" looks gorgeous. The plantation that is Louis' first home, and then the Paris apartment are filled with exquisite antiques, ornate furnishings, gold framed mirrors, lace and velvet four-poster beds, etc, transporting the viewer into the 18th and 19th centuries, and lends an extra level of decadence to the lifestyle of these vampires. The costumes as well are breath-taking, and accurate to the time. The finest thing about this production though, is the beautiful, doll-like Claudia, the child-vampire, played by Kirsten Dunst. It is always terrifying and strange when a child is cast in such an evil role. Claudia's thirst for blood exceeds that of Lestat himself, and her total lack of remorse for the people she kills is the most haunting and disturbing thing about this. The approach to her character was very un-Hollywood, thankfully. Anne Rice's book evokes feelings of loneliness and a profound sadness, and those feelings translate well into Jordans film. ""Interview With the Vampire"" is a very special, and at times superb cinematic delight, that was not ruined by it's over-exposed stars and commercialism. And those that love Gothic horror and period films should see this, and ignore it's Hollywood origins."
"tfrizzell","Null","52","76","1 January 2006"," Swooping In.
","A man (Brad Pitt) who turned into a vampire way back in 18th century New Orleans tells his life (and afterlife) story to a skeptical modern-day journalist (Christian Slater) in novelist Anne Rice's unique take on the famed supernatural creatures of the night. Pitt goes into major details on how he became a vampire (thanks to vampire loon Tom Cruise in a wickedly wild over-the-top turn) and his run-ins with others like him (a very young Kirsten Dunst and a then-unknown Antonio Banderas). Opulently realized schizophrenic exercise that has a little bit of something for most audiences. Pitt is focused, Cruise is unbound and Dunst arguably does the work of her life. Director Neil Jordan (who is best known for films of similar style like ""The Crying Game"") knows exactly which buttons to push and when to push them. While flawed in many areas, ""Interview With the Vampire"" is still nevertheless a fun and entertaining venture that definitely has blood, teeth and wings. 4 stars out of 5."
"filipemanuelneto","8","5","5","1 August 2016"," One of the best vampire movies I've ever seen
","Based on the Anne Rice's novel and with a screenplay adapted by herself, this film tells the story of Lestat and Louis, two vampires with over three hundred years. Directed by Neil Jordan, has the participation of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst (as a child). It received two nominations for the Oscar (Best Art Direction, Best Original Score).<br/><br/>This is the film adaptation of one of the greatest horror novels of this American author, and is even more appealing when we realize that she actively collaborated with the production, signing the adaptation of the script. Indeed, it's a great script, faithful to the novel and original story. And for me, this movie has another good note: fully escaping the recent ""sex symbol vampire"" clich√©, fueled by movies like ""Twilight"", this film depicts vampires as they really should be: monsters with some psychological depth.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent in their roles. The highlight goes obviously to Pitt and Cruise, who were not only perfectly able to give charisma to the characters but also not ignore the importance of the psychological characteristics. Pitt took it to the extreme in his character, torn between the love of his own humanity and the overwhelming desire for blood he feels. The way both actors share the scene is irresistible, such as how Cruise transforms his character in ""evil genius"" of his friend.<br/><br/>The film contains several very intense scenes with moments that can hurt some sensibilities. Nevertheless, its not a very bloody movie. The atmosphere is dark, sinister, something largely enhanced by the cinematography, dark and misty, and the soundtrack, worthy of a good horror movie (something that this film is definitely not). The special, visual and sound effects are good, such as the characterization and makeup. The costumes are exceptional, portraying accurately the clothes of the several historical periods portrayed throughout the film."

Everything about this film is amazing: the costuming, the sets, the story, cinematography, and the casting! Lestat (Cruise) is one of the vilest Vampires I have ever seen but towards the end of the film I found I understood him and somewhat sympathized with the character.<br/><br/>Claudia (Dunst) I felt really bad for her... she is a young girl turned and she will never have a chance to grow up.<br/><br/>Louis (Pitt) I felt pity for. He never wanted to ""feast on a human"". He remained strong in that area for a long time - feasting of small animals most of the time.

Well, that was plain wrong to me...the brunette Cruise, playing the blonde Lestat? Then I heard the blonde Brad Pitt was going to play the dark haired Louis...again....wrong!!! I decided that I was going to see it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised when Tom Cruise brought Lestat to life just the way I pictured him. And Brad Pitt makes you care about Louis and what he has become.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was well done, too, with stand out performances from Kirsten Dunst as Claudia, and Antonio Banderas as Armand.<br/><br/>This, plus the extraordinary cinematography and musical score make this movie a 9 for me."

It is almost impossible to make a good movie with so many famous actors but in this movie, mission accomplished. Brad Pitt was at good performance as always, Antonio Banderas was good and Tom Cruise was great. He certainly made a very good Lestat.<br/><br/>And to the ones who didn't read the book - the film is perfect for them too because it is a very decent vampire film without the constant silly fighting. It describes how vampires feel and think about life and existence. They question life, afterlife and everything.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to everyone."

","Interview with The Vampire is a spectacular movie full of complex emotions that are fabulously portrayed by the actors. Brad Pitt does a wonderful job of playing the vampire Louis, who is meant to be ""an immortal with a mortal's passion"". While Pitt carries the main role well, the movie is all the more accentuated by Tom Cruise as the dark-humored vampire Lestat and Kirsten Dunst as the forever-young vampire Claudia. The movie is not intended to be a horror, however. It is more of a documentary of emotions. With the loss of Lestat's character about halfway through the story, the film seems to slow down a bit, but the connection to the characters is still quite alive. This movie gives a vivid portrayal of Louis's story, whether its in the eyes of a faithful Anne Rice reader or just an eager movie-goer."

I must admit at first I thought Tom Cruise was a touch too 'apple pie' for this role, but he ultimately knocked my socks off! In fact, he is my second favourite vampire ever, second only to the incredible Gary Oldman in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"". And Brad Pitt - oooh Brad Pitt - is hands down the most gorgeous vampire ever. And he played the role of Louis convincingly... but in my eyes would've suited the role of Lestat as well.

","Great sets and equally impressive costumes fill this lurid and dark vampire tale. Anne Rice adapts her best selling 1976 novel for the big screen. The story of depraved love, lust and hunger is told to a reporter(Christian Slater)by Louis(Brad Pitt)the conscience-stricken protege of the unremorseful and lascivious Lestat(Tom Cruise). Lestat tries hard to convince Louis that the blood of New Orleans aristocrats is the most pleasing of all. Louis would rather suck the blood of rats and chickens than to take human life.

Armand(Antonio Banderas)the oldest living vampire in the world lashes out his judgment of the three blood suckers.<br/><br/>It is fun watching Cruise and Pitt living as a couple in hopes of hiding their vampirish way of life. Miss Dunst is absolutely great as a character that ages thirty some odd years while staying in the body of a child.

"DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine","7","4","4","8 September 2018"," Not your typical Vampire genre film.
","Neil Jordan (''The Crying Game'', ''Mona Lisa'', ''The End of an Affair'') is a director who dares to experiment with new ideas and the result is more than often successful as any cinephile is able to recognize the visual beauty and overall aesthetic prowess of his movies. ''The Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles'' begins with a journalist (C. Slater) meeting a mysterious young man, Louis (B. Pitt), in a hotel room in order to conduct an interview for his newspaper. The interviewee claims that he is a vampire, a statement met with incredulity and an awry smile from the reporter who will soon discover that the man in front of him may be made of flesh and bones but he is not human. Louis needs to tell his story, how he became a vampire, who made him, the relationship between him and little Claudia (Kirsten Dunst in a very young age) as well as other vampires. The movie aspires to be a treatise on the nature of evil and the first half is overloaded by conversations made between Louis and Lestat (T. Cruise) who ponder on the fundamental questions of ethics. There is no doubt that the movie's dialogue is well-crafted but sometimes it seems contrived and serves no real purpose and that is the reason why my actual rating is closer to 3,5/5. Apart from that, ''Interview with the Vampire'' is a massive production characterized by high-quality standards and wonderful performances by an all-star cast. I generally detest vampire/zombie genre films and I'm constantly avoiding them. That movie though is an exception as it has a deeper, philosophical dimension questioning the notions of the good and the bad. I can only zealously recommend it to any true cinephile, especially to Neil Jordan's fans."
"Tweekums","8","4","4","2 August 2016"," A vampire tragedy
","This film opens in modern day San Francisco as Louis, a man claiming to be a vampire, starts to tell his story to a journalist. His story begins in New Orleans in 1791; Louis is a wealthy plantation owner but he can't get over the loss of his wife and child a year previously. He deliberately puts himself in dangerous situations but rather than getting himself killed he meets the vampire Lestat. Lestat turns Louis into a vampire but he seems no happier and can't bring himself to feed on people; instead he survives by drinking the blood of rodents; something that disgusts Lestat. Eventually he feeds on the housemaid before heading to a plague infected area of New Orleans. Here he bites the young Claudia, Lestat then turns her into a vampire. Louis treats her like a daughter but as the years pass she has difficulties accepting the fact that she will always be a child and eventually takes her revenge on Lestat for turning her into a vampire. Louis and Claudia then travel to the Old World looking for other vampires; what they find isn't what they hoped for.<br/><br/>Vampire films usually centre on those seeking to destroy them of their potential victims so it is interesting to see the story told from the point of view of a vampire. Brad Pitt does a fine job as the emotionally tormented Louis and Tom Cruise is impressive as he plays against type as Lestat. Young Kirsten Dunst is great as Claudia; beautifully portraying the girl who is doomed to never grow up. The story is told in an interesting way and the old New Orleans setting provided plenty of atmosphere. As one would expect from a vampire film there is some bloody violence although less than one might expect. The action is important but not as important as the characters and looking at the question of what it means to be a vampire. Overall this is an impressive film that fans of the vampire genre are likely to enjoy."

"suburbannightmare","10","8","10","4 November 2006"," gorgeous stuff....
","One of the best and most beautiful vampire films ever.<br/><br/>This film is amazingly beautiful, from the sets, locations, even right down to its main characters (apparently this film prided itself on the casting ¬ñ it used four of cinema's most gorgeous actors). The casting for this movie is pure inspired genius, although Cruise did cause absolute uproar when he got the part of Lestat. Let's face it, he's not portrayed as the most likable of people, (not to mention being a tad unhinged) or even as a decent actor (remember 'Legend'?) but he does an amazing turn as Lestat. He's vicious, villainous, camp and demonically gleeful in this role. Even Anne Rice sent him a letter of apology after she saw his performance. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Louis is a fair show too; he manages to maintain constant melancholy without crossing the line into whiny annoyance, although his constant pouting detracts from his character somewhat (you're a vampire, not Zoolander!). Kirsten Dunst's Claudia is pure childlike evil. Hard to believe she was only 12 when she made this film.<br/><br/>Having read Anne Rice's infamous 'Vampire Chronicles' a hundred times, it wasn't until I saw this movie that I'd even heard of them (shameful, no?). Even after reading the book, it was one of those rare moments when you think, ""well the film was just as good"". And to say that a LOT of the narrative was cut, it retains everything about the original story that it should; the atmosphere, the gloom, the characters, it's all there. Even the gore factor is stylishly done; for one, the blood looks real, which, let's face it is one of the most important, yet overlooked elements in most vampire films ¬ñ in Blade, they used what looks like ribena, in Dracula, they used red jelly, and in The Lost Boys they used something resembling passata. The vampires themselves also look absolutely amazing. (To quote Louis ""Do you find us beautiful, magical? Our white skin, our fierce eyes¬Ö"") The makeup and contact lenses, for once, do more than just make the actors look like they've got flu.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Queen Of The Damned"" this movie sticks to its content, and gives the audience the story, remaining true to it at every stage. There's no story jig, no idiotic and pointless changes to plots and the whole thing is as stylish and sinister as you can get. It does justice to the book and remains a brilliant film in its own right. One to add to any film-junkie's collection."
"instigate_insanity","9","8","10","27 May 2006"," A Gothic tale of love, hate, sorrow and blood
","As with Queen of the Damned, so it was with this movie that I made what I thought was a rather hideous mistake in watching the movie prior to reading the book. Those fears were well based with queen of the Damned- the book is utterly fantastic, whereas even without having read the book the only part of the movie I liked was the soundtrack. <br/><br/>My fears were groundless with ""Interview"". Granted, there were parts missing and parts changed, but not in such a way that it detracted from the story in general. Where the book is a horror novel which almost parallels Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" in its ability to terrify, the movie is a drama which alternates between inducing laughter, sorrow and, in some parts, nearly reducing the viewer to tears. Pitt's performance in this regard is particularly fine.<br/><br/>However, the one thing that everyone who has seen this movie cannot fail to agree on is the fact that, whilst there is indeed an all-star cast (notable characters are Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and Kirsten Dunst), it is the twelve year-old Kirsten Dunst (playing Claudia) who steals the show. In the book she was a truly terrifying child, whose alternate flashes of rage, love and complete and utter lack of emotion serve to unsettle the reader to the point of wanting to close the book and calm down for a few minutes. In the movie she is a little less cold-hearted, and the relationship between her and Louis (Pitt) is bizarre, seeming at times like the relationship between father and daughter, and at other times like the relationship between lovers.<br/><br/>Many viewers who have not had the pleasure of reading the book (in particular the jocks) criticize the movie for the homoerotic undertones which define the relationship that begins to build between Louis and Armand, at times like that between a teacher and their student, and at other times (again) like lovers. This relationship is underdeveloped in the movie, and is not given the chance to blossom into the full- fledged bond that Louis and Armand share for a brief period in the book.<br/><br/>A strong performance is put in by Banderas as Armand, albeit slightly different in temperament than the Armand of Rice's books. Unfortunately the role was too brief a one, and Banderas did not get nearly long enough a role.<br/><br/>Louis' progression through the years is another example of the areas in which this movie excels. Whilst he physically does not change, his surroundings do, and his dress sense changes with the years. <br/><br/>This was a strong adaptation of a brilliant book, which fans of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles should all enjoy. The main plot of the movie stays true to the book, and in some places the dialogue is perfect, straight from the book, line for line. It has the power to disturb, induce laughter, sorrow, and excitement, and is a visual feast for the eyes. The vampires look exactly like Rice describes them, except (dissapointingly) in the case of Armand. And even with the screw-ups in Armand's appearance, Antonio Banderas plays him extremely well. <br/><br/>The fact that I happen to despise Tom Cruise can only serve to add to just how good this movie must be."
"vamp_lestat","10","11","15","9 November 2002"," One of the best movies of all time!
","You can tell I really love this movie. I named two of my e-mail addresses not to mention my IMDb ID after either Lestat or Louis.Where shall I start? The plot is exceptional, I have to give credit for that, and the cast is so STAR STUDDED! They were not only pretty faces but also great talent! This movie featured the likes of Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise & Christian Slater, which are 3 of my favorite Hollywood men, who bought life into their characters, making us feel that they were not actors portraying a role but the actual characters themselves, which is important in an actor to get into every movie's individual character(Do you know what I'm saying? It's kind of like the Keanu Reeves issue, in which he acts the same for every different role he's playing.), distinguish it from the other roles he's played.<br/><br/>
Kirsten Dunst was fantastic, this being her best movie in my opinion. She definitely deserved that Golden Globe nomination. For a girl going on 12 at that time, she acted magnificently! She really portrayed a young, confused vampire, filled with fury & anger, yet still has love for certain people. Louis de Point du Lac's role was mighty complex, being caught in the midst of his mortal self, & the cruel, non-forgiving monster he's become. Brad Pitt did well to accomplish this, as so did Tom Cruise formulated a certain something to Lestat de Lioncourt's character, making it so special, something that wasn't in other Tom Cruise movies.<br/><br/>There were many things special about this movie, but I'm not quite sure what exactly made it so special to me. But I hope when you watch this movie, you'll find something special in it as well."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","7","9","3 March 2008"," A visually stimulating tale of darkness and mortality
","I'm trying to get over the fact that the ending of the film makes absolutely no sense to me (unless i'm looking hard for something that's not there). When I do get past that, however, I find that ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a very beautifully told tale that looks deep into the heart of what evil truly is.<br/><br/>Based on Anne Rice's novel (and also her screenplay) ""Interview"" is the retelling of Louis's (a vampire) story of how he became a vampire. The story starts in 18th century Louisiana where Louis (Brad Pitt) encounters an opportunity for eternal life when he is seeking death. A vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) gives him this opportunity with the expectation of companionship. When Louis has trouble disconnecting his human moral compass from his blood-lusting monster of a self, Lestat tries to test him and eventually brings him another companion when he makes Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) a vampire as well. The story is Louis's search for an understanding of this immortal life that he can come to terms with, which results in a film that explores deep into the notion of immortality with a price.<br/><br/>The film's beauty comes from the very lavish sets and the strong mystical element that is worked into every set. Though the setting is all real world, because the film explores the fantastical world of vampires, everything seems surreal and magical. Dante Ferretti has created another beautiful movie world and Neil Jordan makes it shine through his camera-work. Jordan really brings Rice's screenplay to life, or else you'd be looking at a particularly boring film.<br/><br/>Cruise as Lestat was a good choice. He is downright creepy and conveys the sense of moral ambiguity that Lestat represents. Pitt also shows both the strong and the weak sides of Louis, though he is not as skilled with handling some of the film's melodrama. Dunst is probably the most praiseworthy. Having to portray a child who technically has wisdom beyond her appearance is a challenge and Dunst is behind some of the film's best scenes and most suspenseful moments. Her fits of rage are probably the most interesting as is her character's predicament with never growing up, which really starts the conversation about mortality and the film's themes.<br/><br/>Though some plot clarity would have been nice and a little less melodrama would have helped make the themes really significant to the rest of the film, ""Interview"" is a successful film from a visual standpoint. The craftsmen of this film, everyone from production design to costumes and make-up, truly made this film take off from okay to good and very interesting. There is no doubt that you are deeply interested in what happens to these characters and that is thanks to the actors and the incredible world that was envisioned for them to act in. ~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","15","23","13 August 2001"," 5 hotties + awesome vampire book= #1 Vampire movie of all time!!!
","Interview with the Vampire is hands down probably the number one vampire movie. We got to see a story so unique and original, the eyes through a vampire and his world. Normally, we see Dracula getting chased around by Van Helsing, all we know is vampires are usually bad and must be destroyed, yatta, yatta, yatta. But this time, we not only experience how Louis became a vampire, but what his life became of it. Anne Rice would truly be proud of how much a great movie her most famous book turned out to be.<br/><br/>We have some great and very attractive actors who star in this film like: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Bandares, Christian Slater, and Stephen Rea, not to mention a very young and new Kirsten Dunst. The story starts off with Christian Slater interviewing Brad Pitt, who plays Louis, he makes the most interesting statement to Christian that he's a vampire. Obviously, Christian doesn't take this seriously, but Louis offers him one thing: his story.<br/><br/>Louis was born and grew up during the time when America was just being discovered in the late 1700's, he just lost his wife and child in labor, a little different than the book, but anyways, but his misery brings him to wanting death, and Lestat, played by the brilliant Tom Cruise, brings him that with becoming a vampire. Of course Louis doesn't realize what he gets himself into, but Lestat does what he can to show Louis the perks of being a vampire, even if it means bringing in a child, Claudia, played by Dunst, and turning her into a vampire to keep Louis with him. But Claudia and Louis look at Lestat as a warden and won't let them go, so they attempt to kill him and flee the city of New Orleans to France.<br/><br/>In Paris, they meet a group of thespian vampires, they kill people on stage as if they were in a play. ""Vampires pretending to be humans pretending to be vampires"". Louis meets Armond, played by Bandares, and Santiago, played by Rea. Armond is obsessed with Louis and tells him that Claudia shouldn't be a vampire since she is so young and ends up destroying the thing that means most to Louis, I won't spoil it. Which leads Louis back to the interviewer where Christian is starting to question his doubts of Louis being a vampire.<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire is a terrific film that is just beautifully directed and the actors are just so brilliantly charismatic, it's just impossible in some ways for someone not to enjoy this movie. I know my friends who are not into horror films ended up loving this one because of it's interesting story. It's just a great film that I think everyone should get the chance to see.<br/><br/>10/10"

The story telling itself is one of the film's major strengths, it's a captivating watch, splitting vampire lust and cravings against a very human element.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are both fantastic, I'd argue it's one of Cruise's best performances, the whole supporting cast are great.<br/><br/>I've watched it many times, I've never once lost interest in it.

","This is my favorite vampire movie ever, and I already watched it more than 7 times! Much better and interesting than Dracula's story, Interview with the vampire is a great movie,showing a vampire called Louis telling the story of his life during the centuries, with their two companions Lestat (the vampire who made him) and Claudia,who he considers his daughter. I am a big Anne Rice's books fan, so I totally recommend to people who have enjoyed or was fascinated with this movie, to buy her books and read to know more about the character's life and sequence. This movie contains some errors and not everything is exactly like the book who it was based on, but even on this way, he totally deserves to be watched!"
"MovieAddict2016","8","12","20","14 October 2005"," Seductive, erotic and sensual - exactly as any vampire movie should be.
","""Interview with the Vampire"" is a film based upon the ""Vampire Chronicles"" series by author Anne Rice, whose other novel of the series - ""Queen of the Damned"" - was also made into a film in 2002 (originally titled ""Interview with the Vampire II"" in production phase).<br/><br/>Although ""Interview"" is far from a flawless picture, it does boast some remarkable visuals from director Neil Jordan, who seamlessly integrates the modern day America with that of a few centuries ago. The story begins with an avid reporter named Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) being granted an interview with an enigmatic young man named Louis (Brad Pitt), who eventually claims to be nothing other than a living, breathing vampire.<br/><br/>He recalls his story to the reporter in dismay and disillusionment, telling how his dreams turned to ruin and he was deceived by the seductive Lestat (Tom Cruise), who promised him eternal life...but never divulged into the misery it would provide him.<br/><br/>The story traces back hundreds of years to the revolution and Louis and Lestat's tale drastically alters through the years as the eras change and new faces come and go. For Louis, this is the most disheartening aspect of being a vampire - having to see the ones you care about disappear forever.<br/><br/>Louis forms a friendship with an orphaned vampire named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and their friendship completes the tension between Louis and Lestat, which escalates as the film progresses.<br/><br/>""Thelma and Louise"" might have made Brad Pitt semi-famous as a pin-up boy for a while but it was ""Interview with the Vampire"" that gave him his career as we know it today. In fact, after making the film, Tom Cruise reportedly never wished to speak to Pitt again because he considered him to be a fierce rival in showbiz - a younger talent trying to steal the veteran's Hollywood presence. And Pitt has succeeded quite well at not only equaling Cruise's star power, but arguably surpassing it.<br/><br/>His performance is the key to ""Interview with the Vampire."" He's far better than Cruise, who demanded praise for his ""camp"" performance - it's alright, but it's basically just Tom Cruise acting out his personal life...after the whole thing with him jumping on Oprah's sofa, it's really not so hard to see him acting this over-the-top in reality.<br/><br/>Pitt conveys emotional conflict behind his cold stare, and that is the vital element of the film. Another powerful aspect is Neil Jordan's direction - the cinematography is beautiful and perfectly captures the essence of the modern day Gothic vampire film, picking up where Coppola left off with ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" In fact, they form nice companion pieces, although ""Interview"" boasts far superior acting.<br/><br/>All vampire movies are based upon a heavy amount of eroticism - the seduction of the vampire as a metaphor for sexuality. Jordan really captures that here. Cruise's flamboyant performance portrays Lestat as a metro-sexual, and there are certainly intentional scenes of sexual tension between Lestat and Louis, particularly when Lestat first seduces Louis and drinks from his neck. It almost becomes uncomfortable to watch to a certain degree.<br/><br/>""Interview with the Vampire"" is not a flawless film - it's too long and a bit too ""heavy"" for its own good - but overall it is an entertaining and effective vampire drama.<br/><br/>As a trivia note, the soundtrack for this film contains the last official recording of the original Guns N' Roses lineup - a cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil."""
"slightlymad22","8","4","5","29 September 2017"," Dunst Shines, But Cruise Steals The Show
","Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Interview With The Vampire (1994)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Louis (Brad Pitt) a vampire tells his epic life story: love, betrayal, loneliness, and hunger.<br/><br/>At the time of release, this was not like any other vampire movie I had seen. In movies like Lost Boys and various others, being a vampire is portrayed as almost fun. This movie goes into what a curse immortality is, in a similar way Highlander did, admits all the decapitations. <br/><br/>Cruise does not play the main role in this one, but he does something all great actors can do. Play the best part in the movie and steal every scene. The best role in a movie, does not need to be the lead role. It just needs to be the most memorable, and Cruise dominates proceedings and truthfully the movie is duller when he is not on screen. Which sadly is almost all the last half of the movie. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is not an actor I really care for. There are exceptions, but generally he bores me. This is one such example. I must point out Kirsten Dunst,who was rightly nominated for an Oscar. Her performance is superb. If it was not for Cruise she would have stole the movie. Antonio Banderas is OK, whilst Cristian Slater doesn't really have much to do. I never realised Cruises future MI2 co star Thandie Newton was in this. I enjoy the use of Guns N Roses cover of Sympathy For The Devil over the end credits too. I actually let the credits run. <br/><br/>I wonder why there was never a sequel, it's certainly open for one, and the potential is there. Maybe it wasn't a big enough hit. Finishing outside the Top 10 highest grossers of the year. As Interview With The Vampire grossed $105 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 11th highest grossing movie of 1994."

"estebangonzalez10","7","4","5","17 March 2014"," I watched it a tad too late...
","""Who will take care of me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?""<br/><br/>I just recently got around to watching Interview with the Vampire, twenty years after Neil Jordan directed this successful film, and I have to admit the recent overload of vampire films and novels over the past decade did affect my viewing since most of the innovative elements that Anne Rice introduced here I have seen in later films and TV series (like True Blood). I'm sure many of these films were inspired by some of Rice's original ideas which made this movie stand out above prior vampire films. Unfortunately I'm giving this a lower rating because I am a bit tired of these films and in my opinion the best vampire film continues to be Let the Right One In (which managed to stay low key unlike this epic story). Rice's story is imaginative and Jordan's direction visionary, thus creating a unique and dark vampire drama with some strong performances. The film did drag at times and it is a bit too long but several scenes were intense and skillfully delivered. If you are a fan of vampire films or of Anne Rice's work then you will probably enjoy this much more than I did because it is dark and Gothic, but it does have its weaknesses and the ending is a bit off note.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, the story is told in the form of an interview as a journalist named Daniel (Christian Slater) encounters a 200 year old vampire named Louis (Brad Pitt). His story begins in 18th century New Orleans after having lost his wife when he was 24. Deciding he didn't want to live any longer, Louis set out to destroy his life picking fights at local bars. One night while doing this he catches the attention of a vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the opportunity to become like him. Louis accepts and becomes Lestat's apprentice, however he isn't satisfied with his new life as a vampire and refuses to kill humans. Louis hates who he has become, but his life changes when Lestat turns a little girl named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire and together they form a family. Louis continues to narrate his story through two centuries as they encounter troubles and betrayals along the way.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a huge action star and at times it's difficult to separate him from his characters, but surprisingly he lost himself in the role of Lestat and gives a convincing performance as a blood lusting vampire. Brad Pitt despite not losing himself in the role as well as Cruise does still delivers a believable lead performance. The real surprise for me however was the young Kirsten Dunst who gives the best performance of the film. Once her character is introduced the story really picks up and it becomes engaging. In my opinion the interview scenes didn't work too well; I would have preferred if Louis simply narrated his story directly to us considering Slater's character doesn't really do much as an interviewer. Despite some flaws in the story, the film does look good and the effects are also done well. Jordan and Rice were able to create a unique vampire film that stood out from the rest and that is the reason why 20 years later it is still talked about and referred too."

","Interview with the Vampire is the epitome of modern vampire films (modern included to exclude Dracula, Nosferatu etc which would create a controversial debate!).<br/><br/>Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles are the most important supernatural works of the last thirty years and must have inspired many of the new vampire/supernatural films that focus on character/action/drama rather than portraying them as fear objects in horrors.<br/><br/>This film is a drama, not a horror, and anyone expecting a horror with chases or human victims to feel sorry for will be sadly disappointed. Yes, there is blood and feeding but it is the vampires you feel for.<br/><br/>The three leads are incredible, Kirsten Dunst deserves special praise due to her age and anyone who says Tom Cruise can't act should see this film. Brad Pitt's Louis is just as whiney and annoying as he should be, but you understand this given the circumstances of his turning.<br/><br/>It thoroughly involves you in the vampire world and displays how lonely and isolating it can be (yes, I know it's not real but you get the point).<br/><br/>Here's hoping they film some more of Rice's novels (hopefully more in this vein than the slightly OTT Queen of the Damned) - I want to see Blood and Gold!

","There must always be a bite. It is always the bite that (from my observations) is what gives the audience that ""frisson"" of chill, even makes them squirm in their seats. There is no ""class"" to the bite; it must be done efficiently and expeditiously.<br/><br/>Often one has to ask, ""Would I have any qualms about doing that?"" Lestat would answer something like (this is not a quote from the movie or a novel), ""There is no question. You have no choice. The thirst will lead you into it.""<br/><br/>What is the best way for a vampire to move in to bite? Evidently, anything goes: To the arm from the wrist up to the elbow, to the throat from the front or over the shoulder, or into the chest or breast seem to be preferred.<br/><br/>Should be victim/prey be taken lying down or held upright?<br/><br/>In many films. the victim struggles and cries aloud before falling unconscious. In ""Interview"", sometimes this happens. Sometimes, though, the preliminaries to the bite may have the victim being put into a swoon; look at Louis's expression, completely disconnected, as Lestat chomps away. <br/><br/>How should the dentition look? ""Interview"" has a highly original approach to ""the tools of the trade"". Instead of the traditional, paired, elongated upper jaw eye teeth, the look is what I would call ""piranha"", totally.<br/><br/>As for the outcome of the bite itself, without a doubt the rule is ""neatness counts"". My favorite line relative to this is Lestat's comment to Claudia, ""And you didn't spill a single drop.""<br/><br/>Google the various images collections from ""Interview"", and there should be a couple of pictures of an actual dental cast and what appears to be a sculpted, porcelain veneer on top of it."

","*** SPOILERS *** I am reviewing this movie given you have seen it, or don't care to know all of what happens in it.<br/><br/>Tera-gallons of blood = nothing. Brad Pitt's Louis shows up at Christian Slater's apartment to tell him all about his life as a vampire. But, after all of it is over, neither Slater nor we know why we have sat through the interview or the movie, for that matter.<br/><br/>I am guessing that Anne Rice's novels are mostly circle-jerks like this one. A full story of vampires, killings, grousing about being vampires, etc., with no reason for it.<br/><br/>After the initial gory proceedings calm down a little, you begin to think that this could end up being an entertaining story about a family, even though a very macabre one. But, about three-quarters of the way through, that is stopped, and it becomes just a lot of revenge and killing. You end up feeling more tortured about going through it than Louis does.<br/><br/>Then, the final scene is just a standard ""shock"" ending, like in a ""Friday the 13th"" movie.<br/><br/>I really only sat through it because it seems fairly well regarded, and I have kind of run out of movies to watch. This one I could have passed on.<br/><br/>**** (4 out of 10 Stars)"

","Interview with the Vampire opens with a great helicopter shot of the San Francisco Ferry Building and zooms up Market St. After that, everything is wrong. Christian Slater as a journalist? You're supposed to believe him in that role because he wears glasses and chain smokes. Brad Pitt was so-so as a disillusioned vampire, but looked so gorgeous in his fake teeth, who cares? But Tom Cruise was simply ludicrous as Lestat, delivering lines like, ""I give you everlasting life and you fritter it away on the blood of poodles."" Probably the book, which I found impossible to read, was every bit as bad as the film, but there must have been a way to film this garbage. After all, the sets and costumes were quite good, and the homoeroticism strongly emphasized, probably to Tom's intense annoyance. Seeing him with his mouth full of incisors pretending to be a bored with eternal life fop was more than anyone should be expected to bear. There may be some roles he can perform (Jerry McGuire), but god knows why anyone would believe him as a vampire. I tried to watch this twice, but the whole catastrophe was too embarrassing, not to mention dull."

Brad Pitt truly does justice to the melancholy character of Louis and Tom Cruise gives the character of Lestat the right amount of elegance and icy-rage. i think the most fabulous scenes in the movie are between Pitt and Cruise and just there conversations on a vampire's true mortal nature and also when they are out ""hunting"" together. there star appeal is definitely there, but also they both have the ability to fill up the movie screen with there personas, while also having the acting skills to totally transform into these immensely intriguing supernatural beings.<br/><br/>this movie defines the vampire film genre and will appeal to other people who don't particularly like horror films because of the lush eye candy (provided by the actors and the costumes) and philosophical questions the movie brings about.<br/><br/>a great addition to any DVD collection ;)"

","To call Tom Cruise and ""actor"" is generous at best.  He appears in movies, and because he is pretty, people watch. He doesn't have enough talent to occupy minor character roles, and if he weren't so pretty, we would never have heard his name.  But he is, and here he is, without enough horsepower to drive Ann Rice's seminal character, Lestat.<br/><br/>But, as bad as Cruise is, he is Olivier compared to Pitt, the other megastar pretty boy non-actor.  Pitt can't act his way out of a paper bag, and frankly, if you watch the plastic bag scene in American Beauty, you'll see a bag doing a better job at acting than Pitt will ever do.<br/><br/>Neil Jordan decided to downplay the homosexual aspect of Rice's decadent vampires.  Given the meager talent of the two leads, there isn't much left. Cruise and Pitt preen and pose through endless costume scenes and the obligatory vampire touchstones like fangs and blood, and it is mediocre beyond belief.<br/><br/>Thank god for Kirsten Dunst.  She is spectacular as Claudia, the young vampire denied the chance to grow up physically, but who becomes more wise and mature than any human adult.  Without her, there would be nothing but air.  Even Stephen Rea and Antonio Banderas are cardboard cutouts propped up in the scenery compared to her.<br/><br/>Ann Rice has publicly said she approved of this presentation of her immensely popular book, but one can't help but wonder if she wasn't a bit disappointed, if the truth were told.

","Very good movie. I would have given this a 7 if Tom Cruise hadn't nailed the part of Lestat. The book was much better but still this was a pretty good movie. Basically, this movie is about the life of the vampire Louis( Brad Pitt). This is not a hacker slasher movie, but more of struggle within movie. It strays away from the normal scary movies into a more chilling legacy. I personally enjoyed this movie a lot and would recommend it to anyone who wants something more out of a vampire movie then blood and vampire hunting. The only downside was Antonio banderas, who i thought was totally wrong for the part.

","I grew up on the macho vampire tradition of Hammer horror films, which featured powerful and highly sexualized vampires who spent entire movies chasing women and wasting villagers without sparing a thought about the true nature of their cursed existence.  It was therefore a shock to me when I first encountered Ann Rice's bisexual, whiny bloodsuckers who seem to get no joy whatsoever out of being immortal, irresistible creatures of the night. In place of fun Hammer action, ""Interview with the Vampire"" serves up a constant nasal whine from Louis.  This is a vampire movie for a depressed crowd; it oozes ennui and stagnancy.  The only characters with life are Lestat and Claudia, but most of the screen time goes to boring Brad Pitt and his problems.  There are really no human characters, nobody you can relate to...unless you think your life is like being a bored vampire.  Weird, sadistic, slow.  And the production style is already dated."

","This is a vampire movie with a unique twist - realism! I am not inferring that creatures like this really exist - this is fiction - but if they did, this probably would be the most accurate account of them because vampires are not glamorized here. In fact, the film pictures the vampire existence as a lonely, depressing one. At least we see that in the case of Brad Pitt's character here, a vampire who needs the blood but knows it's morally wrong to kill human beings for it.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is excellent, which includes the star of it, Tom Cruise, and young Kristin Dunst. The latter was a surprise hit to me as the young vampiress (is there such a word?) who is trapped in a little girl's body. (Dunst was about 11 or 12 years old and not that well-known at the time of this release.)<br/><br/>What I was a little uncomfortable with were a few of the bloody scenes, particularly in the first third of the movie. They were too graphic and just plain disgusting at times. Also, there also were definite homosexual overtones between a few of the vampires. Was this film another attempt to push that agenda? Probably, but it seemed out of place in a vampire movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the final song of the movies sums up its contents best: ""Sympathy For The Devil,"" by the Rolling Stones. Hmmm.....an interesting choice for a closing song."

","***POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Lavish adaptation of Anne Rice's novel, scripted by the author herself. Film begins with a modern-day prologue as a reporter played by Christian Slater interviews Brad Pitt who claims to be an ageless vampire. Narrative then moves back to the end of the 18th Century in New Orleans. Here Pitt is infected by the vampire Lestat, played by Tom Cruise, and the film follows the progress of their relationship and later Pitt's journey to Europe where he encounters another vampire, played by Banderas.<br/><br/>This is a film of set pieces, with lavish scenes and masses of extras playing out against a hollow narrative and a particularly poor ( and miscast ) performance from Cruise. Rice was supposedly mortified at the casting of Cruise as Lestat, but after seeing his initial scenes retracted this and endorsed him fully. I don't know what she saw because he is totally unsuitable in the part despite making a gallant effort. Considering the importance of his character, this deals the film a mortal blow from which it never looks like recovering.<br/><br/>As in other Neil Jordan films, this is all gloss and no substance with the basics of storytelling and film-making given a backseat. Like 'Mary Shelley's Frankenstein' (1994), 'Interview with the Vampire' shows how the modern age still hasn't figured out a satisfactory approach to the horror film. Be it an historical vampire story as we have here, or a modern update as in 'Near Dark' (1987), recent attempts at serious horror concerning vampires have been dull, contrived and not very scary. It seems that only a comic-book approach can provide decent, albeit shallow, entertainment for fans of the undead - 'Blade' (1998) and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) are limited but, by default, are the most commendable recent offerings.<br/><br/>Overall the film is a big disappointment. Only Brad Pitt manages to extricate himself from the mediocrity and puts in a good performance despite the material. People who rave over this mustn't have seen the multitude of top-notch vampire films over the years, the majority of which provide pints of thick, deep, red blood, as opposed to the dribble of anaemic, watered down rubbish we have here. Star names, a big budget and glossy production values don't automatically make a quality film and in this case can't even provide an average one."

","I read the book about six years before the movie came out. It is to this day the best book I have ever read. The movie adaptation wasn't bad. Brad Pitt was to die for (no pun intended) and made a fabulous Louis, and Antonio Banderas did a great job. But I'm sorry, Tom Cruise was a pathetic Lestat. His American-boy hot-rod attitude just didn't fit the role and the end with the Christian Slater thing just didn't click. The book was more descriptive and provided a better view of the vampire transformation.  My advice, read the book, see the movie, then make your judgement."
"Tresix","3","12","28","17 February 2002"," Is this supposed to be taken seriously?
","I remember reading of Ann Rice's initial disappointment with the pending film version of her novel INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE.  She was upset at Tom Cruise being cast as the flamboyant Lestat (Rice always envisioned Rutger Hauer in the part).  She felt that Cruise would have been a better Louis and Brad Pitt, who played Louis, would have been better as Lestat.  Upon seeing a preview screening, Rice changed her opinion, publicly apologized and gave the film her seal of approval.  Not having read the novels in their entirety, I can only go by the excerpts that give the description of Lestat: Tall, slender, blond, face like an angel.  Sounds like Brad Pitt to me.  An early comic book adaptation had Louis drawn to resemble Tom Cruise (this was five years before the movie!).  After seeing the movie, all I can say is that I agree more with Rice's first opinions and that Pitt should have been Lestat and Cruise should have been Louis.<br/><br/>     As it is, Neil Jordan's take on INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE:  THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES plays like a bad take on Roman Polanski's FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS.  Cruise, as Lestat, acts as if he should be chewing on the scenery rather than his victims' necks as he goes horribly over the top. Pitt, as Louis, seems to be of the opinion that since Cruise is in acting overdrive, he should be in very low key and is almost comatose.  However, the big sin of the movie is that it isn't scary in the least.  Cruise comes across more like the little kid in one of those really cheap Halloween costumes who jumps out of the closet and tries to scare you.  Everything ends up looking so lifeless that it's as if real vampires may have invaded the production.<br/><br/>     I did like the scene where Louis goes to a movie theatre to catch up on all of the sunrises that he has missed in his life via film clips from the silent classic SUNRISE to SUPERMAN:  THE MOVIE.  Christian Slater does an admirable job as the Interviewer, filling in for the late River Phoenix. While the movie as a whole disappointed me, I will say this:  I said to myself that if what happened at the end of the movie would happen, it would end on a good note.  Fortunately, Jordan got that part right . . . if nothing else."

"rch427","Null","4","8","2 October 2004"," An astonishingly bad film treatment
","I read Anne Rice's ""Interview With the Vampire"" well before I saw this film, so my expectations were that Hollywood would ruin the treatment of her first vampire novel. Surprisingly, the film did not even reach the low expectations I had for it. Indeed, this movie is a textbook case of Hollywood bastardizing a good book. As usual, it was ruined a combination of by being obliged to use ""big name stars"", trying to squeeze an epic story into a 2-hour time-frame, and adapting the story for the audience of the lowest common denominator. When it was announced that Tom Cruise would play Lestat and Brad Pitt would portray Louis, Anne Rice publicly stated that she considered the film to be an inevitable disaster. Inexplicably (and I suspect it had to do with money and publisher's contracts), she later embraced the film, and declared it ""perfect"". Pardon me if I'm skeptical of her change of heart. <br/><br/>There are principally three problems with this film. First, any adaptation of a book like that by Rice--with the inner lives of the characters being of paramount importance--is very difficult to translate into film without heavily relying upon voice-overs. But although the film utilizes much expository narration, that effect falls flat with Brad Pitt's monotonous delivery. Instead of sounding ancient and world-weary, he merely sounds bored and uninspired.<br/><br/>Second (and perhaps this is nit-picking) the fake teeth--especially those fitted to Cruise--are just abominable. They make every line he speaks sound, well, like a guy talking through fake fangs. They also distort his lips so that every expression is a grimace. In fact, Cruise's false teeth are no more realistic than those worn by the vastly more charismatic Christopher Lee in the classic Hammer Dracula flicks of the '60s.<br/><br/>Third (and most serious), the film's two leads (Pitt and Cruise) are simply inept as serious actors. They're really not ""actors"" at all, they're two-dimensional character actors, being asked here to play against type. Well, Daniel Auteuil is an actor. Michael Gambon is an actor. Gary Oldman is an actor. Tom Cruise? Brad Pitt? Neither of them have the skill, the subtlety, the expressive ability to actually ""act"" in roles such as these. Cruise's usual acting range has two modes: ""determined"", and ""rogueishly charming"" (as in every other movie he's done). Here, he fluctuates between pomposity and tantrums; mundanity and over-the-top scenery-chewing, as if a switch in his back were being flicked one way, and then the other. Every line he delivers sounds unbelievably pretentious. Pitt is little better, although he does avoid Cruise's intolerable stridency. Antonio Banderas' characterization of ""Armand"" is uncannily similar to Ricardo Montalban in one of his smarmier roles. Far better choices would have perhaps been someone like Ralph Feinnes for Lestat and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers or Jude Law for Louis. Feinnes could've humanized Lestat, and either Rhys-Meyers or Law could've brought some life to Louis. Yes, Kirsten Dunst does a decent job with her role, but most of the other actors belong doing daytime dramas.<br/><br/>Indeed, that is essentially what director Neil Jordan has done: he's remade the old vampire soap opera ""Dark Shadows"" for the Fabio fans of the '90s. As can be seen from the majority of reviews here, ""Interview With the Vampire"" was a big hit with teenage girls raised on TV. For those with higher expectations of vampire films, this one will just embarrass. Instead, watch ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"", ""Nosferatu"" (either one), ""Near Dark"" (if you have the stomach for it) or even ""Nadja"", if you want a truly unusual vampire film. For those who have read Anne Rice's book and have an expectation of quality from a film adaptation of it, I can only caution you go avoid this slab of Hollywood tripe at any cost. <br/><br/>And--it's not exactly a spoiler, but the ending of the film is totally different than the ending of the novel, and it sells out the novel's much better-crafted closure."
"tedg","Null","4","8","16 May 2002"," The Real Play
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Putting together a project like this requires attention to four elements:<br/><br/>Situation (aka: story and mythology), Characters (usually focused on acting), Atmosphere,  and Self-reference.<br/><br/>150 comments here deal with the first two; whether the story had drive and power (probably okay), whether the situation was readable and compelling (probably okay), and whether the actors connected (probably yes for Dunst and Pitt). So let's focus on the other two which are by far the more important, harder to deliver and incidentally overlooked in nearly all comments so far.<br/><br/>The `atmosphere' is partly a matter of style, but more a matter of how consistent is that style and how effectively communicated. It is more than creating lush sets, instead encompasses the whole ability of the artist to transport us to another world. I'm particularly sensitive to being hypnotized by competent transporters. Didn't work here -- a matter of failure to understand the space. Everything in the environment was a thing, not an element of the environment.<br/><br/>The other element, `selfreference' is much more interesting here, and that is because the books handle it so well. In fact it is the only thing that discriminates Anne Rice from thousands of other hacks, her cleverness with narrative. As an ordinary matter of craft, the writer often uses framing devices to establish the character of the narration. In an ordinary movie, the surrogate narrator will appear at the beginning, to settle the tone. Some clever relationship is expected between the character as narrator and as a participant in the story. And that's apparently how this starts.<br/><br/>Another framing device, also very common, is to place a play (or equivalent) within the play. Again, some clever relationship between the small play, the larger play and often the even larger `real world' is expected. And this is done too, seemingly according to formula. (Later Lestat becomes a professional performer.)<br/><br/>But see what has been done as a sly trick. Rice's stance is to play with the non-humanity versus humanity of the characters. These framing devices almost always expose the `within' as richer than what what we see, and what she has done is turn them on their head: the `within' in each of these cases is less, not more. This sort of narrative trick is to be expected from someone exposed to the Berkeley/San Francisco writer's club. It's not great art, but it is clever and it allows her -- in the books -- to manipulate the atmosphere. It turns irony on its head. The `story' in each case is real where we expect it to be fake. For instance, the Paris drama is presumed by the audience to be fake, but so real a trick it seems real. But the trick is that it IS real.<br/><br/>Rice gets this right in the books. But the hapless director here has no clue at all. Cruise neither. And this is why they couldn't get the atmosphere or humor right. They are using the formulas the regular way instead of upside down. The comedy is not supposed to be in laughing at Cruise dancing with a corpse, but laughing at ourselves for not laughing at Cruise.<br/><br/>Pitt has made a career working with just this effect, so he tunes into a channel on a radio no one else in the movie knows is there, and delivers. No one except perhaps Miss Dunst. She has little intelligence, but she seems to be a very, very good listener and it must have been Pitt talking. My gold standard right now for child performances is the few seconds of a six year old Alicia Witt in Lynch's `Dune.' That is barbed into my outer mind. Dunst here comes close in some moments: `I want some more.' But at other times seems driven by the director to be just melodramatic."

","I saw this movie when it first hit the screen and it completely blew me away at the time. The drama, horror, soundtrack, dizzying sights, twists & turns. The opening score is among the most chilling and moving I have ever heard.<br/><br/>I hadn't read any of Anne Rice's books at the time, but very soon I had caught up with most of what she'd written up to 1994. At first I liked all that too, but after a couple of years something began to gnaw. Eventually most of my appreciation for her books and this movie vanished. Why? Simply because there isn't anything beneath it all. The faces may be pretty, the story lines gripping, the injustice of it all indeed crying to heaven, but none of it means *anything*! It's just pomp and flash, rapid twists and turns, ""a lot of sound and fury, in the end signifying nothing!"" Really not all that different from the ""videoclips with story lines"" from the 1980's and 1990's.<br/><br/>But it's all very clever from a marketing point of view, of course. After all, there is so much pain and misery in the average person's life. And here's a movie with a main character (Louis de Pointe du Luc) who is forever lamenting the loss of his wife and child (or brother, for the book version) and Claudia, while (eventually) murdering blindly because all his grief means that no one else's suffering matters. And there's Lestat cheerfully advocating murder & mayhem. Or Armand and all the many stories he could tell, if only Louis helps him connect with the spirit of the time (whatever that means). And there are villains like Santiago and all the other decadent vampires. Oh, and there's the sensuality behind a vampire's killing by slowly drinking a person to death, of course. The viewer/reader can pick and mix as few or as many of these ingredients as they please. Wallow in self-pity and misery, even over your own choices (what, Louis had no idea what being a vampire might entail? Or that immortality would mean eternal melancholy for him?). Or dream of escaping all the pain and risk of life by becoming Lestat's type of vivacious immortal. Or simply chase after all the wild story lines that people the movie/book. Or enjoy the sensuality of this particular breed of vampires. Really, it's truly an Every(wo)man's story! Louis admits it at the end of course: you've been had, it doesn't mean anything. ""Do with it what you will."" Daniel's anger and disappointment are only natural, but he soon finds out that he is in no position to criticize Louis, getting forcefully pushed against the ceiling (movie) or almost drained to death (book). But even at the end there's no time to reflect for Daniel (or the viewer), because another rapid twist occurs: Lestat jumps the (inter)viewer and gives him ""the choice that I never had""... And then it's roll credits to Lestat's laughter and Guns 'n Roses' cover of ""Sympathy for the Devil"".<br/><br/>No, 10 years later the kindest words I can say about this movie are that it's a very good approximation of the book. In spirit if not totally in plot. But a good conversion of something bad still isn't much to write home about. I can only give it a 5/10."

A costumed charade with vampires and a little bit of philosophy about life and death and things. Having said that, it's still better than what 2000s and + gave vampire genre. 7.5/10 You won't make a very big mistake watching this :)"

","Neither the literary nor the cinematic world has been in lack of the presence of those pale, blood-sucking creatures. We cannot say it for certain that this one will be the greatest among numerous other films of the same theme. However, one will be inevitably tempted to give it a higher score due to the three super movie stars that featured in it, namely Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kristen Dunst.<br/><br/>The whole film is revolving around the heart-wrenching remorse of Luis, who made the irrevocable decision of turning himself immortal. The same regret was felt by the little girl converted by him and Leatat. Throwing of tantrums seem a bit repetitive in the film, as all spectators may easily spot and get tired of during the total length of 120 minutes of the flick. The overall narration is carried out with a brilliant style, though. This, coupled with remarkable acting of our three superstars-to-be, made it a work that is worth being memorized by the film history."

","A wonderful movie and one of the best vampire films in history.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the sexiest, attractive and talented, ever seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, younger and beautiful than ever plays Louis De Pointe, a young man from Spanish Louisiana, Brad gives his character innocence and humanity, a spirit that does not stop struggling between good and evil, and whose nexus between both parts will be a sweet girl who will take almost for a daughter.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, immeasurable, great, terrifyingly beautiful and magnetic, his character Lestat, produces several sensations, attraction, repulsion, terror, pity especially at the end ... Tom Cruise clearly showed that it was not a pretty face anymore within the Hollywood establishment , making his character speak only with his blue and hypnotic gaze.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst, being still small when she made the film, her character was not easy, but she showed an admirable maturity, managing to create a character as innocent as in turn dark and perverse, because while she loves Louis, she does not hesitate to kill Lestat, although he was willing to reconcile with her. Showing with it a tender attitude with Louis but also selfish, possessive and capricious.<br/><br/>Antonio Banderas, the old vampire Armand, a character of the darkest and gothic, the performance of the Spanish can only be described as sublime, every gesture, every word, conveys a sense of respect and at the same time fear, loves and wishes Louis, although that it can mean its own destruction. A short, but memorable character.<br/><br/>Christian Slater, like the journalist Daniel Molloy however is not very used, although certainly his character did not give much more, since it is about telling a past story, so that his character does not have too many options to develop. Anyway, it is not bad, this actor at that time was still popular, before falling into the abyss of self-destruction.<br/><br/>And the rest? Neil Jordan once again created a dreamy atmosphere, dark, Gothic and Baroque at the same time, streets lost in dense fogs, the whole movie is like a sweet nightmare from which he wakes up suddenly at the end. This director already showed his ability to create dark and gothic atmospheres, always wrapped in a halo of magic and mystery, as in his famous film In the company of wolves.<br/><br/>A story of love, of revenge, betrayal and blood, but above all of passion, of souls tortured and condemned in search of their own redemption and salvation. All with an atmosphere that amazes all the senses.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but I can not stop praising this cinematic delicacy, it's one of my favorites of all times and it will continue to be so.

","Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles: 10 out of 10: Adaptation of the Anne Rice novel that has aged like a fine red wine. Not that the vampires would know they never drink the stuff.<br/><br/>The Good: This movie is better now than it was when it came out. The actors are more established. You don't have that silly controversy about Tom Cruise as Lestat. (He is incredible by the way). The theme of being forever young really hits home as you see these guys (and gal) from twenty-five years ago. In a way, actors are a lot like vampires forever young on the screen.<br/><br/>The Bad: This really isn't a bad per se. I know that Christian Slater was a thing back when this movie was made. He doesn't ruin the film or anything but he is definitely the weakest link.<br/><br/>The Ugly: When one lists child actors that went on to adult stardom (Jodie Foster, Ron Howard, Christian Bale, Natalie Portman) you know who never seems to be mentioned? Kirsten Dunst. I am not saying she is the best actor in this movie... okay, I am. She is fantastic, I always wondered why she never seemed to get the credit for it as other actors and actresses have.<br/><br/>In conclusion: It is actually hard to review a film like this. If you haven't seen it go see it. If it has been a while since you saw it see it again. You will be surprised at how young everyone looks.

"brictomm","8","2","3","21 December 2017"," Amazing -- until you read the books
","""Interview with the Vampire"" is a classic for those who enjoy vampire movies. In this new era of film-making, we have a vampire movie from the early nineties that is so much more than blood and gore, empty fights and the new glam with which they seem to be portraying vampires in films. We have actual living beings (even though they're dead, but you get the point) asking questions about their existence, about God and the Devil, about death.
The movie tells us the story of Louis, who is lost in the abyss of depression and, as his final scream asking for help, accepts the bite of a vampire, who promises him to be young and immortal. It's the story of how Louis gets to deal with his new immortal, nocturnal life. But it is also so much more than that. It's how they show Lestat's persuasive side, making a little girl a vampire just so Louis could stay with him; It's how the directors portrayed the era the movie was set in, the costumes, the acting. Everything is put together to create an aesthetically-pleasing movie.<br/><br/>However, I first watched ""Interview with the Vampire"" when I was barely a teenager. At that time, I loved every aspect of it. This movie is very dear to my heart because it introduced me to Anne Rice's books and, after that, I started reading almost all of her Vampire Chronicle's novels. The problem is that I watched it again some time ago, after years of not watching it, and the holes in the plotline and the choice in cast made me cringe so bad that I had to pause the film to think if I should keep watching it.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to point out that I'm extremely heartbroken that the directors took away one big part of the plotline: the homoerotic aspect of the series. And by this, I'm not saying that the characters are homosexual, because I know that Anne Rice's vampires are pretty much asexual and without any real carnal desire aside from the desire to actually bite and take blood from their kills. However, throughout all of Anne Rice's books she states clearly that the relationship between Lestat and Louis is one of lovers. Yes, they fight a lot, they don't agree in many topics, but they love each other like nobody else and I feel like this is lost in the movie. This was done to have more acceptability in the media from more closed-minded viewers. Maybe that was the price they had to pay for the movie to be made. Still, I believe that this takes away most of the movie's essence.<br/><br/>Another point worth of mentioning is the choice of actors to play the roles of the characters. On the bright side, I cannot leave this review without mentioning how astonishing Tom Cruise's performance is while playing Lestat. Even if they had to put him on boxes, so he could look taller in some scenes, I couldn't ask for a better actor to play this role. He is exactly how I imagine Lestat to be. He plays Lestat's egocentric, mischievous, elegant essence too well for his own good and leaves us wanting more of his appearance in the movie every time he isn't on the screen. That being said, though, I still need to mention something that really bothers me. Armand. If you haven't read the books, you probably don't know what I'm talking about. In the books, Armand is a Russian boy, raised in Italy, who has a fair complexion, red locks and a cherub-like face. He was turned into a vampire when he was about 17 years-old. Now, knowing that, the producers decided it was a good idea to cast Antonio Banderas into Armand's role. It took away absolutely ALL the magic when Louis met Armand, because, while watching the movie, you don't see the cherub-like boy we have in the books, we see and old-looking vampire, with long, straight black hair, saying he is the oldest vampire he knows that is alive. It was hard to accept that. Again, they probably did this to make things easier when selling the movie, because, let's be real, when you think about a super old vampire, full of skills and powers, you certainly don't think about a teen-age-looking redheaded boy.<br/><br/>Overall, aside from my fan-minded -rant, ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a very underrated but magic movie that can open doors to some amazing novels by an amazing author. If you are looking for a movie full of very talented people, with glorious costumes and quotes to live by, I totally suggest you to give ""Interview with the Vampire"" a try."

","I watched this film with no preconception of what this film will be about (except for the obvious) or how good it is and I still somehow felt quite disappointed. As expected, it was a predictable Hollywood popcorn flick. It has its big stars and its pretty effects and that's about it. <br/><br/>Though it was interesting how the gay subtext was tackled, other than that the film's script is beyond mediocre. I mean Pitt's role is not really salvageable. That character is beyond insufferable. On the other hand, Kirsten Dunst and Tom Cruise, in substantial roles, did their best to impress.<br/><br/>Dunst left me with mixed feelings. She was impressive when she was playing as a youngster version of her role but as her character 'age', I did not see a change that I believe the character should have.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tom Cruise was more impressive in his role. I mean he have the showiest role after all. It has the right amount of pizazz and motherly touch that his character imbued but it was nothing special. <br/><br/>Overall, the film was just painfully OK and everything about leaves you wanting for more as nothing really leaves a big impression.

","In San Francisco, a journalist follows a man through the streets and they end up in an anonymous room. <br/><br/>When the journalist starts to interview the man, the stranger tells him that he is a vampire, being over 200 years old. The journalist doesn't believe him, but after the man proves it's true, he tells his story. <br/><br/>His name is Louis and in 18th century New Orleans he was 24, by this time owner of an estate and a widower already. One night, when he once again was destroying himself, he was found by Lestat, a vampire, who bit him. <br/><br/>But even after becoming a vampire, life wasn't fun for Louis until one night he met a little girl, Claudia, who would change his existence forever........<br/><br/>Jordan once again shows he can do the macabre, and even though this must arguably be his biggest project, his notable touch is all over this wonderful epic.<br/><br/>From the sinister, unnerving soundtrack, to the epic, sprawling cinematography,Mathis has so much in common with his wonderful 'Company Of Wolves' it's almost a necessity to watch them together.<br/><br/>Notorious when first announced that Cruise was to play Lestat, it's easily the best thing he's ever done, he's scary, alluring, and most of all hilariously funny. And that's a major plus point for this movie, its laugh out loud funny sometimes, and the lighter parts, even though they are rare, seamlessly meld with the more horrific parts of the film.<br/><br/>Pitt and Cruise compliment each other well, and at times,they do come across as an old married couple, but they have spent a lot of time together, but its obvious there are connotations toward sexuality during the film.<br/><br/>Once Dunstable comes into the picture, it's as if the nuclear family is complete for a time, but bitterness soon comes into the fray.<br/><br/>If anything, it's an anti vampire movie. Lots of vampire movies glamorise the fact that they live forever, and have other fantastical traits, but novelty soon wears off, and when we reach present day, Pitt is as lonely as he was before he was 'turned'.<br/><br/>But all in all, its a groundbreaking film, the cast are great, even though twenty years on,money look like a soft rock tribute act.<br/><br/>Scary, funny, sexy, essential."

","The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film.<br/><br/>So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand.<br/><br/>I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in ""...Vampire"", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of ""La Jetee"" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones).<br/><br/>The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time.<br/><br/>A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood..."

","I have only recently seen this film. Going into it I was expecting to see a moderately good story about vampires. However, I was pleasantly surprised. For me it was an amazing story of emotion. <br/><br/>Louis (Brad Pitt) is a man who mourns for his wife and baby. He seeks for a way to end his sorrow and Lestat (Tome Cruise) offers Louis a cure, but is it the right one?<br/><br/>This was the first film I saw directed by Neil Jordan and I'm certain it won't be the last. Neil Jordan has given us something that enraptures the emotions. He has adapted the book into a film that couldn't have been made better.<br/><br/>The duo of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise as Louis and Lestat is nothing short of memorizing. The performances from each of them glue your eyes to the screen. These two great actors continue their filmography with roles you won't forget. <br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst gave an impeccable performance for one so young. She was perfect for the role of Claudia. And let's not forget Antonio Benderas as Armand and Christian Slater as Daniel Malloy. Even though they had little screen time, they made their effect.<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire is a film that will stay with you. The emotions that come from the characters will make this movie last. The existential whitens that drive the movie are even more interesting given the immortality of the characters. It is an amazing film and should be on any avid movie lovers list."
"gcd70","7","2","3","31 January 2008"," Will stay with you and haunt you
","Visual splendour and strong acting dominate this meandering, self indulgent epic of the life of one very miserable vampire.<br/><br/>Neil Jordan (""The Crying Game"") has filmed Ann Rice's epic novel with distinctly dark overtones both visually and comically in order to enhance the evil mood, yet the homosexuality of some characters, clearly prevalent in the book, is barely hinted at here. Word is Tom Cruise was unhappy with such connotations, but no-one really knows why the references were omitted. This leaves us with something less than Rice's fascinating tale which many have called a literary classic of its genre, yet Jordan and Rice (who adapted her original story for the screen) still deliver a disturbing and tragic film about one man's shattered dream of immortality and his struggle to come to terms with what he is.<br/><br/>Cruise justifies the rave reviews he's been receiving (who better than Ann Rice to blow his trumpet after publicly canning him when he was cast) for his portrayal of the malevolently evil LeStat, a vampire who has no qualms about his disposition and eccentric taste. In fact he rather enjoys the sport of luring his next victim for a feed, aristocratic or Creole preferably. His chosen companion is Louis, a broken man after the loss of his wife and child, he desperately yearns for a way out, and so recklessly takes LeStat up on his offer of a new life with no pain or suffering. Brad Pitt manages to outshine Mr. Cruise in a superb showing as a vampire so guilt ridden about his blood lust that he cannot bear to face another night of horror. So downcast is he that LeStat believes they may benefit from adopting a new companion and so young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst in a wickedly excellent performance) becomes a sort of surrogate daughter with a ""hunger"" to match that of her ""maker"".<br/><br/>Adding to the devilish goings on are European vampires Armand (Antonio Banderas), a lonely but heartless leader, and Santiago (Stephen Rea), a ruthless henchman. Christian Slater also drops by as the interviewer, a role originally slated for River Phoenix who sadly passed away before filming could be completed. His untimely death (at only 23) shocked legions of fans who had toted him as the next James Dean, perhaps an all too accurate assessment of a very talented young actor. Slater assumes the part admirably, and he donated his salary to some of River's favourite charities in honour of his memory.<br/><br/>A warning then for the faint hearted or those of you who are easily spooked. Although ""The Vampire Chronicles"" is not a thriller that will have you hitting the roof every three minutes, it is most definitely unnerving, so those prone to nightmares are well advised to stay away. Stan Winston's make-up and special f/x are all convincing enough to give you the shivers, and there's little left to the imagination.<br/><br/>Jordan successfully stops things from becoming gratuitous however, and though ""Vampire"" is at times self-interested and perhaps overlong, he has once again triumphed with a picture that won't surprise you quite as much as ""The Crying Game"", but it certainly will haunt you with images and characters that will stay with you long after you've left the theatre.<br/><br/>Monday, January 2, 1995 - Village Centre Melbourne"
"Allen-31","9","2","3","1 June 2007"," An excellent adaptation
","Overall one of the best vampire movies out there.<br/><br/>I just have two complaints:<br/><br/>First, Antonio Banderas is horribly miscast as Armand. The character in the novel was a red-haired teenager (~17 years old) of Russian origin with the face of a ""Botecelli angel"" who had spent hundreds of years in Rome prior to taking leadership of the Paris coven and the subsequent transformation of it into the Theatre de les Vampires. Maybe Neil Jordan just wanted a well-known playing the part? Making Armand into a tall, black-haired, menacing, Spaniard type with almost indecipherable speech at times due to a thick accent is beyond me. Maybe he wanted to make Armand more frightening in appearance, but that completely goes against one of Armand's chief weapons -- his disarming beauty that conveys a false sense of innocence that allows him to lie so effectively.<br/><br/>Second, reading a previous comment I was stunned to learn that there's an hour more to this movie that has never been released.

","If you have read Ann Rice's Chronicles, you would see that this is the most accurate movie based on her Chronicles . Actually, I have read the book after I have seen the movie and I was amazed by how accurate the film was. The only objection is that Armand should have looked younger, that is the way he is described throughout the Chronicles, but Banderas does a great job nevertheless impersonating the character (he is a great actor). Lestat is identical to what I imagined when I read the book, and he is pictured in the movie just as Louis described him : the shallow handsome blond blood sucking monster with no respect for anything that he worshiped and loved and feared. About Louis, he is perfect.Brad Pitt really outdone himself playing this role - the tormented, forever clenched onto his mortal soul,always unhappy vampire. But ""la piece de resistance"" is of course, Claudia - the beautiful vampire woman entrapped in a little girl's body for eternity.Louis's and Lestat's monster-daughter is a living (undead actually) work of art the way Kirsten Dunst plays her."
"rvos-1","10","2","3","27 January 2006"," Not the meaning of life, but a gentle reminder to appreciate it
","This movie did not have the meaning of necessarily. There is something in there. See, Louis was so grief stricken and bitter after the death of his wife and child that he hated life sought death. When he got what he asked for he was suffering because he wanted back all of those things that he took for granted while he was alive. When Armand said he could take away his last lingering regrets and suffering, Louis said that's all he had left and he would rather have that. And another scene that tells that Louis learned to appreciate all of those things is after they disposed of Lestat, he said while they were on the ship that he desperately wanted those. He wanted to see blue again. Then when he said he came back to New Orleans in 1988 he said that motion pictures helped him see the daylight and the colors that he took for granted, purples, oranges and ""my long lost blue"". He went from longing for death two hundred years before to just taking pleasure in being able to see the color blue. Think of all of those things we take for granted. People want to vacation on a beautiful tropic island, but look around and there are things of a different, but equal, beauty near where you live-no matter where you live. It's sad because Louis seemed like he would have been a nice man before the death of his wife and it's a shame it took immortal life and 200 years of killing and numbness for him to appreciate the life he had left after his wife died."

The plot goes generally like this. A Vampire named Louis is interviewed by a young reporter and he tells his life story a two hundred year long life story. His story starts in the late Seventeen Houndreds in Saint Louis Missouri. He is a depressed man who just lost his wife and child. Than he is bitten by Lestat a Vampire from Paris. Louis refuses to feed on humans and lives off rats and such. Lestat finds this hilarious and taunts him constantly. After moving to Louisiana, Louis can't help himself and attacks a young girl, but Lestat finds him and laughs. Louis runs in self loathing but Lestat finds him and brings him to the dying child. Lestat than makes the child a Vampire and their daughter named Claudia. She is even more bloodthirsty than Lestat and teaches Louis to love again as well to eat human blood.

This movie is my exception. Everything about it is good, almost. It definitely doesn't get as much credit as it deserves. Of course, it is considered a cult movie a lot of the time, so many people are missing out on it.<br/><br/>The story is about Louis, who is changed into a vampire after Lestat offers him immortality. To Louis, it sounds good at first, but after the years go by, he realizes that this is a life of hell. On their adventures, they meet up with Claudia, a little girl who Lestat, with the help of Louis, changes into a vampire. As the years go by, Claudia becomes wise beyond her years, and together with Louis, she plots to rid herself of Lestat. From there they continue on to Paris, where they meet the legendary vampire Armand, and his troupe of evil vampires. <br/><br/>This is certainly one of the best performances of both Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise, as well as Kirsten Dunst. As for Antonio Banderes, his character is one of the gayest men I've ever seen, and there's time when you're watching it when you can't understand what he's saying. That would be my one complaint. The majority of the accents in this movie are terrible.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is extremely well-done, and adds to the mood. The acting is good in most parts, and the characters are well-developed. <br/><br/>The downside of this movie is that there are parts that are extremely disturbing and bloody, but if you can manage to survive that, you will see how great of a movie this really is. <br/><br/>9.5/10"

This movie is much different from those other horror vampire movies because of this. These beings are not mindless monsters, but creatures, striving to be human, living with the terrible realization that they are evil.<br/><br/>As far as the effects, excellent.

In each new scene I feel that I myself am actually pulled into the world created by the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a great movie, though I didn't very well like the blood in some scenes. It seems that the vampires in the book were a little more careful with their feeding. Yes, the blood may have been too much in some parts. And<br/><br/>Lestat. I would have loved to see more of the vampire Lestat. For example, in the Theatre of the Vampires, where was he? <br/><br/>I really wish they had made a film of The Vampire Lestat.

However some people I had met claimed that this film wasn't really a horror story. I didn't really take their recommendations into account until shortly after I'd seen 'Underworld' which to me was a good action film as well as a dark and Gothic film. So I decided that it was about time I watched 'Interview With The Vampire'.  <br/><br/>When I saw this film was fascinated and intrigued right from the start. I felt like I would have done the same things Louis ( Brad Pitt) had done in his long destiny into ""darkness"". I also felt very sorry for Louis he lost the little girl vampire           ( played by Kirsten Dunst) whom he was very close to. This film displays<br/><br/>vampires more like fascinating creatures rather than terrifying monsters, so I think the film can really cast a spell on some people. I also liked the two main vampires being played by two great American actors Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>
I believe Ann Rice has invented an entirely new way of looking at vampires and perhaps I'll some of her novels one day. Overall I film I once rejected is now a film I certainly recommend."

","Not being a fan of vampire movies, I didn't love tihs but I actually liked it a bit more then I expected to. I would imagine to really love this movie one has to be a sort of vampire movie fan to begin with and though I am not NOT against these types of movies I'm not into them either-if that makes ANY sense at all. <br/><br/>Basically, this is a movie to see for these reasons: the costumes and atmosphere, special effects and very importantly the great acting-and I do mean great. Pitt and Cruise are both fabulous and unrecgnizable-both give their careeres a very large range with these performances.<br/><br/>I also think this is a movie best seen in a group-when I saw it it was with a large group of people and we were almost kicked out of the theatre for talking so much-it's that type of movie.

"KingOfTheDamned","10","2","3","16 April 2003"," A flawed masterpiece; one of the most intriguing horror films in history
","First of all, I want to say that before seeing the film, you should read the novel.  I can almost guarantee that those of you who have not read Anne Rice's brilliant novel ""Interview with the Vampire"" will have a much lesser opinion of the film.<br/><br/>Second, if you are an Anne Rice fan (such as I) or have simply read the novel (and liked it), you shall love this film.  Read on, for I shall tell you why.<br/><br/>For the most part, the film stays quite faithful to the novel from which it was based; however, some of the key elements (including a suspenseful encounter with a mindless vampire) have been edited out.  Elliot Goldenthal has made an excellent score that fits the film perfectly.  One of the most impressive points of the film is it's production design (by Dante Ferretti), an addition which beautifully captures the three centuries the film travels through and creates the dark, eerie mood of the film. Then, there's the matter of the cast.  Tom Cruise gives a surprisingly good Lestat (the only downside to his performance is his failed accent), Brad Pitt gives a great Louis, and Kirsten Dunst is the ultimate Claudia.  Antonio Banderas is also an excellent Armand and Stephen Rea and unforgettable Santiago.<br/><br/>The cinematography (by Philippe Rousselot) is another great addition, from the dark opening scenes in present day San Francisco to the final scenes in Daniel Malloy's car.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a great adaption of Rice's novel; a flawed masterpiece and one of the most intriguing horror films in history - it's a lot of fun seeing the horror from the vampire's point of view.  Highly recommended."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","2","3","3 February 2001"," Interview With The Vampire is able to take the ancient subject of vampires and tell it from a completely unique perspective, allowing for an entirely new experience in the genre.
","Failed movie titles: Two Vampires and A Bloodsucking Little Lady.<br/><br/>Interview With the Vampire is a classic example of casting against type, and with great success. Both Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise take on very uncharacteristic roles in this film, in which they both prove their versatility as actors. Christian Slater plays a small role (as Daniel Malloy), in which he interviews Brad Pitt, from a skeptical point of view at first, but his opinion slowly but drastically changes as the film progresses. <br/><br/>(spoilers) The majority of the film is told in a series of flashbacks, as the tale told by Louis (Pitt) is unfolded. We are taken back to the year 1791, which is stunningly brought back to life with outstandingly built sets ¬ñ the buildings, the costumes, the interiors of buildings, everything was as perfect as possible. This is the point where we are introduced to Lestat (Cruise), who is a character in the film who undergoes a tremendous transformation by the end of the film. Louis runs into Lestat having just lost his wife and daughter, and looking desperately for a release from the pain. It seemed to him that Lestat was the answer. After becoming a vampire, Louis does not want to take lives (his newfound need for blood causes him to feed on the blood of rats and other small rodents). He is sort of a `good' vampire, but Lestat soon tricks him into overcoming his fears and morals. It is these fears and morals that lead to the two vampires' ¬ëadoption' of Claudia (played brilliantly by Kirsten Dunst), a small girl who they changed into a vampire and Louis did not want to leave on her own.<br/><br/>
Oddly enough, even starring in a major film with at least two established and respected actors, Dunst steals the show. When we first meet her, she is a typical young girl, mischievous and slightly unkempt, but after she has been turned (in a breathtaking scene that briefly resembles moments with Regan from The Exorcist), she takes on a strikingly different appearance. Her hair is carefully done, she is made up, and she even takes on a much more mature, even wise, look. In fact, one of the reasons that her performance is so impressive is that she was able to portray maturity so effectively and accurately. She was much more mature here than she was years later in the childish film Bring It On. Dunst delivers an awesome performance, and is able to capture the audience with just three words, `I want more.' A morbidly amusing part of the film is when Claudia is receiving lessons on how to `feed,' learning to `stop when the heart stops.'<br/><br/>
One of my favorite things in this film is really a trivial point, but I really liked it when Claudia is congratulated ¬ñ `You've done very well. Not a drop spilled.' Clearly, this is a skill that nearly every vampire in film history has badly screwed up. In all of the Subspecies films, for example, that goofy vampire gets more blood on his face and all over himself than he gets in his mouth, in feeding scenes that are so overacted that they're comical. Interview With The Vampire is a very welcome diversion from such childish nonsense.<br/><br/>The end of the film is also very well-done. We get a stunning revenge scene which takes place in a theatre, and which presents some of the relatively little but extremely realistic gore in the film. Also, I have to mention that the death of Lestat was incredibly realistic! That guy turned from a vampire into a rotting corpse in seconds and all within the same shot, which was a very impressive scene, I thought. The ending overall may have been a little vague for some tastes, but as a whole, this is just an excellent vampire film, and it should definitely be remembered for that. Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt are especially effective here, as are Kirsten Dunst in her early film appearance as well as Antonio Banderas who plays a relatively small but effective role. The film has such an engaging story that it almost qualifies as a drama, a very unusual characteristic of horror films. This one shouldn't be missed."
"flickjunkie-3","9","2","3","1 January 2001"," Something I Really Got My Teeth Into!
","*Warning: Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles made a great book. No one knew what to expect from the film. Well, this well-made, clever, intriguing story is far better than anyone had the right to expect.<br/><br/>The film kicks off in modern day San Francisco where the 200-year-old vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) begins to relate the story of his life to a young interviewer (Christian Slater). It is a tale that begins with the death of plantation owner Louis' wife and child back in New Orleans in the late 18th Century, an event that, for Louis, effectively marks the end of his human existence. The arrival, thereafter, of a vampire called Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers him an escape from his terminable grief with the outside chance of immortality. Yet, as Louis comes to learn, this grief ultimately pales into insignificance compared with the pain that comes as a consequence of having to slaughter humans in order to feed. Initially he resists, drawing sustenance from rats and other animals, before he succumbs to his condition and sinks his teeth into Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), a young orphan. Refusing to let her die, Lestat instead fashions her into Louis' companion, and thus Claudia becomes his surrogate daughter/lover, a child-woman who remains shackled within the body of a young girl while her brain and appetites grow.<br/><br/>Eventually Louis and Claudia plot to kill their maker, and having escaped Lestat, they travel to Europe in search of fellow blood-suckers and meet Armand (Antonio Banderas) and many more at the Theatre Des Vampires in Paris.<br/><br/>Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is a film I could really get my teeth (or should I say fangs?) into. The performances are excellent, particularly from the young Kirsten Dunst and the outstanding Brad Pitt in one of his best roles. Although Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas are underused slightly, they are still impressive in their juicy roles. The editing is very good and the story is well-adapted from the excellent book.<br/><br/>Simply fang-tastic!<br/><br/>I rate Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles 8 out of 10."
"bringing-sexy-back","9","2","3","22 September 2000"," Totally excellent.
","Interview With The Vampire has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was a vampire movie but the vampires had real feelings, as Louis (Brad Pitt) showed. The movie keeps you entertained all the way through, though I found the beginning the best. I thought Tom Cruise was really good as Lestat, the vampire who seems to enjoy the killing of innocent people. Kirsten Dunst was really good as child vampire Claudia, her performance was strangely spooky though. If you have not seen this film, see it NOW, it is really excellent, entertaining and it has it's gory moments. Certainly the best vampire movie I have ever seen. I give it 10 out of 10"
"Tyler-Durden","9","2","3","10 August 2000"," Maybe the best film about vampires ever.
","As we all know, almost all the movies about vampires are all very similar: A couple of ""slayers"" trying to kill some bad vampires. This movie is completely different, it's not a film full of gory scenes and lots of fighting between humans and vampires. It's all about a vampire who tells his life story (the whole two hundred years he has been a vampire), and is this fact the one who made me like this movie more than any other vampires movie.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, with a remarkable performance by Kirsten Dunst. It makes me sad to see the lack of recognition that Dunst got. Considering she was only 11 years old when she made this film, her acting is great. Her facial movements are at all time good, and the way she said her dialogs made it look almost real. Tom Cruise got everyone's attention with his performance, even though Brad Pitt did a great job.<br/><br/>The make-up was fantastic (nothing is fantastic actually, but this make-up was close to it). The only think that wasn't very good was Louis' (Pitt) hair in certain scenes, and Armand's (Banderas) hair also, which, in my opinion, looked awful. Lestat's (Cruise) outfit was excellent, and his golden hair looked better than Pitt's.<br/><br/>The color of the eyes that both Cruise and Pitt had made them look more real, and I really enjoyed the fact that the vampires in this movie looked just like normal people, there was no way of noticing any difference, and in this film the vampires kill their victims where nobody can see them. In other films the vampires just arrive to a place where they start killing people for fun and everybody can see that (that is how the ""slayers"" always get there and end up killing every vampire on the scene).<br/><br/>The film's script was great. The idea of putting some much images from the past, and so little from the present was good.<br/><br/>This film breaks some of the rules in vampire movies. How did Louis killed all the vampires in Paris? Using fire? Who would have thought that was possible. Then Claudia ""killed"" Lestat by cutting his throat after he drank dead blood? And then Lestat ""died"" again burned? In old vampire films this methods didn't work.<br/><br/>As Armand said, Louis was a vampire with a human soul. He felt guilty after killing a human, and for a long time he was surviving by eating rats and other animals. But with Lestat's influence Louis became just a bit more aggressive, I mean, he cared less to kill a person. Lestat tried to teach Louis all he knew, I believe, and he wasn't happy after watching Louis refusing to kill humans.<br/><br/>I don't like the fact that Louis ended up not liking Lestat. He had a chance to help him, in 1988, but he did nothing. Well, at least at the end Lestat became the 'old' Lestat again, and he would do to Christian Slater (person who taped Louis' story) the same thing he did to Louis about 200 years earlier.<br/><br/>I rated this movie with a 9 out of 10, it's pretty good, and as I said, a bit different from every vampire movie."
"Damien-8","Null","2","3","12 December 1998"," Great book Great movie
","Just as the summary above it says this was a great movie. The actors all did a great job but Kristin did a fantastic one. She probably should have been nominated. Imagine how hard it is to still be in your teens but playing a role of that of an maturing vampire stuck in a child's body. Once again she did a fantastic job. Tom and Brad also did a great job also but that was to be expected. One thing I have to disagree with the other critics is the Antonio factor.<br/><br/>I thought he did a good job in a limited part. And for people who haven't read the book Antonio gave a great adaptation of Armand. If they do make a sequel to this great movie I just hope they get the same actors. Unless they are planning for the sequel to flop as soon as it's released."

","What a seductive and wicked movie.  I am a fan of the Anne Rice movies, and I have to admit, this is one of the more faithful book adaptations to a movie I have ever seen.  I am also a fan of the acting talents of Brad Pitt.  It is a shame that Brad is type-casted as just a Hollywood hunk, when he is a far too talented actor to be given such a label.  His performance as Louis is done with poise and precision.  As well, I am disappointed that Stephen Rea was not at least nominated for an Oscar.  What a wonderful talent she is.  Don't get me wrong, I like Antonio Banderas, but I do not think he was the right actor to cast as the role of Armand.  But overall, this is a sensational movie!"

Unlike some people think, I believe that no one but Tom Cruise could have portrayed Lestat better.  He was everything that Rice made him out to be and more.  Brad Pitt was good, though he did tend to whine at times, but Kirsten Dunst was perfect for the role of Claudia.  I hope that the sequel ""The Vampire Lestat"" is turned into a movie with Cruise returning for the title role.  No one but him could possibly play it.  Truly a great vampire picture."

I agree that back in that time for a normal person to have the long hair it would have been absurd. These characters are not normal people. They do not walk about on the streets as other mortals. They hide in the shadows of buildings & etc. They try to keep there faces & paleness out of sight.

","Many people didn't like this film, because it is too dry and cerebral for most horror fans, and too much a horror film for most people who like thoughtful movies. I found the combination amazingly riveting and original.<br/><br/>As Anne Rice said in the introduction to the film, ""It is about US."" Her vampires are symbolic of humans in general, but seen from a different vantage point. It is a story of temptation, guilt, shame and remorse. Louis is a vampire (that is, a sinner), he is repentant, he hates the fact that he is one, but nonetheless continues to be one. Like us, Louis wants to know what it is all about, how did this happen, is there a God, is there a devil? And he is always left with doubts."

","The transition from the first of the Vampire Chronicles was at least a partial success.  Pitt is convincing as Louis and Dunst was an absolute surprise as Claudia!  Lesser marks for Cruise as the famous Lestat, but the overall performance wasn't bad.  Banderas is always good and was no disappointment here either, in the role of the mystical Armand.  Rhea rounds out the cast of ''bad'' vampires vs. ''good'', amid beautiful and at times stunning scenery, costumes, and fantastic music.  True to the novel (roughly speaking) minus a surprise ending.  Great theme song from Guns & Roses, to boot!  Nods from both Oscar and Golden Globe (especially for Dunst) were well deserved.  Buy the video, and don't count on a sequel.  (Rating 4 stars of 5.)"

","Interview with the vampire, is an exquisite, very stylish film, that at times is boring, and repellent. But the acting is so good, that you have to wonder why these people did not get Oscars for their work. The Story: A vampire who has lived for 200 years, tells Christian Slater his life story, first of how he became what he is, what he's done of what he is, and what he plans to do next. Tom Cruise plays the lead vampire, who turned Brad Pitt into a vampire. Brad Pitt plays the vampire who is telling the life story to Christian Slater. Kirsten Dunst (Jumangi, Small Soldiers) plays the young girl, who the both male vampires turns into a vampire. Therefore she is cursed and will stay a young girl the rest of her life, till someone kills her. The film itself is a fine one, and if you watch this, even though in parts it's boring, its also superstylish, and scary, and also quite gory.

This movie is definitely better for people who read the book and they will probably understand it better, however, as some people have pointed out here, it is probably about a vampire searching for meaning of eternal life.<br/><br/>The movie nicely portrays old times, the decorations, costumes, scenery are quite nice. 
Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt acting are nice. The main actor in the movie is Brad Pitt. <br/><br/>There were some confusing moments in the plot and I'm confused why the characters made certain decisions or certain things happened, so that's why I give it a 7, because even if you didn't read the book, you still should pretty much understand everything that happens.

"dvdmirandacos","8","1","1","29 March 2017"," The Actual Plot and Point of Interview With A Vampire that's about the entire movie
","I think the actual plot of interview with a vampire is that it is about Louis and Claudia's life of how miserable, terrible and sad their life was. Louis originally didn't want to become a vampire but lestat was there all along and tricked and forced louis into being a vampire. Lestat gave Louis a terrible life and life and body state where he would always be a vampire, be alive, be comdend to hell and never have the option to go to heaven just like claudia never was able to have. Louis in the movie would sometimes tell and show his anger and misery to lestat to show that he hated lestat for what he did to him and for making louis to have to get into a relationship with lestat. Lestat didn't care about louis and claudia. Even one time lestat told louis shut up and even grabbed claudia hard to show that he didn't like them or care about them. He also even wanted to kill claudia and louis when they made lestat mad because claudia slit his throat and made him bleed. Lestat even told claudia one time in the movie that she'll never be a woman because she's trapped in a child's body which was very rude because that is what claudia's life is like. The movie is also about how Louis always had the strength and bravery to stand up to lestat and he was never scared of him and made sure lestat knew that because he didn't want lestat to think he was weak. Also the most thing Louis hated about being a vampire and lestat was that being a vampire means you have to kill humans and animals to get blood for as food and water. To still live and be alive and for lestat louis hated him because he would kill more than was required. That was more than louis killed and that made him angry and upset at lestat for doing that to those poor humans and animals. See Louis and Claudia cared about people and animals and wanted them to live their lives and not be killed by their kind which are vampires. But Louis's life will never be the same and he will always be a vampire because that one night lestat forced him into being a vampire and ruined his life forever for louis. Poor Louis and Claudia they never got a chance to contiune having human lives the way they wanted it to be."
"generationofswine","8","1","1","4 December 2016"," An Honest Review
","On one hand, I always Hated the Anne Rice take on vampires...OK, sure, ""Queen of the Damned"" was an awesome and fun book that read like a comic book. It was really good but...but beautiful vampires...no.<br/><br/>I applaud the Gay thing. It was written in 1976 well before even don't ask don't tell. It took brass to do that and shame on Neil Jordan for leaving it out. The book, I feel could possibly have done a lot for civil rights, normalize it in the mind of Americans and the movie, with Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Antonio Banderas, well it could have been as hard hitting as Rage Against the Machine if they left it in.<br/><br/>It took pure brass to write in that way in 1976 and feet of clay to leave it out of the movie. And after ""The Crying Game?"" Shame on the producers. That's probably more their fault than Jordan's.<br/><br/>Still, beautiful sensitive vampires? No. They feed on blood, wouldn't they have every BBP on earth? Look when it was set? Louise and Lestate should have syphilis.<br/><br/>Besides, they are evil, right? Vampires are evil and that is why Blade and Buffy and Harker hunt them and kill them. They aren't beautiful creatures that you pity and love. They are evil creatures that you kill.<br/><br/>Anti-Vampire rant aside...the movie is beautiful. Neil Jordan knows how to make movies beautiful and he pulls out all the stops in ""Interview with the Vampire."" It is just a stunning movie to watch.<br/><br/>And, though I really do hate how Anne Rice writes vampires...I read her anyway. Her stories are always sublime...with the exception of ""Queen of the Damned"" which was the hard rock version of her otherwise cool jazz stories.<br/><br/>Her stories are set in New Orleans--mostly--sometimes Frisco, but they always seemed to remind me of the coldest Chicago winters. It reminds me of when I find myself tucking against the frigid wind as I walk down a street that would otherwise be booming with people and action.<br/><br/>Her stories are visceral and sublime at the same time and Jordan captured that well. Even people like me who hate how she writes vampires still read her because of how she writes.<br/><br/>The story is as jaw dropping as Jordan's direction.<br/><br/>My only lament is that it could have been a civil rights springboard and they passed on that chance to make the world a better place through cinema."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","1","9 August 2014"," The sad state of vampires.
","'Interview With the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles' is a movie helped by the visions of two very creative people. The first is Anne Rice whose vampire novels are full of dread and gloom and try to bring an absolute reality the subject of vampires. The other is Neil Jordan ('The Crying Game'), a filmmaker who is never makes a conventional movie. He always has a nice twist or turn up his sleeve.<br/><br/>The reality is what makes this film work. We sense the day to day boredom and the horror that comes with being a creature of the night that must kill to survive and can never grow old.<br/><br/>The story begins in the present as a 200 year-old vampire named Louis (Brad Pitt) grants an interview to a journalist (Christian Slater). His story begins sometime in the late 18th century. Why have all vampires been born in the Victorian era? Aren't there any that were born a caveman or at least during the renaissance.<br/><br/>Louis it bitten by a fearsome vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) and the movie follows his devastation as he tries to come to terms with what he must do in order to live. The two travel from city to city feeding off the living. At one point Lestat bites a little girl named Claudia and her story is one of the saddest and most potent element of the film.<br/><br/>The choice of Tom Cruise as Lestat was not met with much warmth. I, for one, liked his performance here. Cruise has always been an actor willing to let himself look like a jerk but in this one he puts his looks in check. He slips into the character rather well and it never feels like a character role.<br/><br/>But the performance that I was most struck by was that of Kirsten Dunst as Claudia a twelve-year-old who lives her life as a vampire and can never grow up. Her character is positively Shakespearean. Dunst plays a twelve-year-old but we sense that inside her is a woman much older and wiser. We sense that inside this young body the mind of an adult who is living the nightmare of not only being a Vampire but an endless childhood in which she can never experience life.<br/><br/>The reality of the world of these three characters is brought to life by a brilliant set design by Dante Feretti. I especially loved an underground stone nest with holes in the walls for sleeping quarters that resemble and insect hive. The gloomy cinematography by Phillipe Roussellot ('A River Runs Through It') gives us the smoky, dim existence of a life lived at night.<br/><br/>Many critics complained the 'Interview With the Vampire' was slow and dull. I found that its leisure paced worked in putting me into the reality with which these creatures are faced. Because of this the movie isn't heavy on plot. It is about a grim reality that goes on day after day, year after year, century after century living by a horrible code of survival."

I ask you not to decide if you are going to read it based on the film because they are very different.<br/><br/>However, this is about the film itself. It's a romantic, Gothic tale of love, passion and looking for life's meaning. Of course the ""life"" seen trough vampires's eyes. I liked it. It was a good adaptation of Anne Rice' 100 percent AMAZING novel. Still, if it's important to you to be as good as the book itself, you shouldn't watch it.

"KineticSeoul","8","1","1","23 April 2013"," Enthralling vampire/drama film
","This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the ""Twilight"" saga which should be forgotten.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

","I recall this film terrifying me as a child. As an adult, it is even more frightening. It's neither the vampires that necessarily scare you nor the scenes of gushing blood nor the darkness, but the sprawling narrative itself - a journey through an alternative history where monsters, magic and immorality intersect. A journey which begins in the small port city of New Orleans and traverses to Europe and ends back in the New World. Despite the epic nature of it all, Rice writes an intimate and personal story where the emotions of love, betrayal and uncertainty are at the forefront, especially evident in the tragic depictions of Louis and Claudia and the ruthless cunning of Lestat. You root for the protagonist, Louis, wanting him desperately to protect his daughter/friend/partner Claudia and at the same time find his own salvation. The emotions towards Lestat are more mixed; he certainly is the heel but moments exist where a deeply sympathetic and tortured person is sown. Then Rice keenly without compromising the integrity of the story introduces the underbelly of the vampire society ‚Äì a pleasant shift midway through the film.<br/><br/>This is a special story. When you add the highly competent acting, this becomes possibly the best horror flick ever made."

Dunst (Spider-Man) plays Claudia, a young orphan girl who becomes a spoiled vampire created by Lestat and Louis and Banderas (Desperado) plays vampire, Armand.

","With its photogenic cast and a story-line revolving around the emotional anguish that goes hand in hand with vampirism, Interview With The Vampire could be accused of being the 90s precursor to Twilight; its vamps might be sad, however, but they sure ain't sappy: the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) would happily tear Edward a new one; Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) would rip out Bella's throat without batting an eyelid; Louis (Brad Pitt) would find it hard to join in at first, but his hunger would prevail. That's because Interview With The Vampire is a proper vampire movie with proper vamps designed for a mature audience, not watered down PG-13 tripe aimed at the less discriminate teen demographic.<br/><br/>Interview's bloodsuckers might have emotional issues to deal with‚Äîimmortality and a constant craving for blood doesn't come without its baggage‚Äîbut when it comes down to it, these guys see mortals as food and having a relationship with dinner is only going to get messy (much better to slash their throat and be done with it); Interview's brutal bloodsuckers (and its R-rating) ensure that viewers get a healthy helping of gore to go with their Gothic romanticism, Stan Winston's incredible effects giving the film plenty of bite.

","i too was very upset when first hearing that Lestat was to be played by Tom Cruise - and even more upset that he played the part so well - thank you for that insight to his ego - which makes sense now why he fit the role so well... i also agree that Antonio Banderas was too old for the 17yoBoy|millenia_olde_vampyre out of touch with current trends, but also feel that (though Kristen Dunst did well) she too was too old for the part she was supposed to play - read the book again shes is a few years off the mark but then again there probably aren't that many kids that could have played a role that young. As for Brad Pitt, i have always felt he was a pretty boy who had some skill at acting - but little to no substance - now many years later i can really appreciate that some of the early roles he played were for notoriety and money - until he could pick and choose the films he wants to play w/o fear of being typecast."

This film makes you see things from the point-of-view of a character normally portrayed as the heartless villain. this film should have received more recognition by the Academy than just two nominations.

Fantastic acting, Gothic atmosphere, noble but evil-like vampires...you see them ALL in this one! <br/><br/>Beside, the most intriguing part is the loneliness and sadness of vampires. You can feel it in every word that Louis said. We live because we die, so how can one live without death? Just like Lestat said, that's not live, that's survive. <br/><br/>So Louis did. He was only surviving, in mourning for his lost love.<br/><br/>Compared with Dracula by Francis Ford Coppola, I think Interview With A Vampire is more like a fairy tale, dark and sad though."
"saxon-7","8","1","1","22 April 2006"," Perhaps the best adaptation ever!!!!
","Plot: The plot is based on the novel by Anne Rice (actually the first book in the Vampire Chronicles) and takes a different approach to illustrating Vampires; here we are told the story from a Vampire's point of view (although it's a disgruntled Vampire's point of view). The Vampire Louis is 'made' in 1791 by another Vampire; Lestat; who takes pity (for lack of better word) on the young man who is very disgruntled with his current life, not that the transition into Vampire does anything to that view. This adaptation is one of the best I have had the pleasure to see, it does have its alterations but since Anne Rice herself as had a hand in the adaptation they don't impact the adaptation that much. I can't find anything that I can say destroys my impression of the book, there are of cause minor points but they don't ruin the flow or experience of my mental picture of the scenes (in fact some of them I didn't even realize). Now I have to say that this isn't my favorite book in the series but indeed a great one.<br/><br/>Actors: The actors do a magnificent job at portraying their various characters and are mostly well cast. Tom Cruise does portray Lestat de Lioncourt with just the right amount of darkness and emotional lacking that is conveyed in the novel, but he still does not fit with my picture of Lestat, this however is not any failing of Tom, but rather on the casting (just to clarify, the casters would have been hard set to find anyone else that could have played the role of Lestat this good). Brad Pitt is almost perfectly cast as Louis de Pointe du Lac, he portrays the character with just the right amount of disgruntlement and unhappiness that is central to the character. I find this role more his breakthrough than the one he actually became known from. Antonio Banderas portrays Armand with the right kind of passion and joy at finding this 'new' Vampire to teach and spend time with. You also get the feeling that he's missing something in his unlife (now I won't spoil it if you haven't read the Vampire Chronicles, but that portray is right on Armand). Stephen Rea portrays Santiago just as perfectly as the rest of the actors do theirs. Santiago isn't one of the greatest roles in the novel but still an important one and Stephen nails it. Santiago is himself an actor and playwright and one who follows the rules of the Vampires to the letter, and this is conveyed perfectly by Stephen. Kirsten Dunst is adorably as Claudia, the Child Vampire. She truly acts with a great understanding of the character (remarkably considering her age at the time) and the emotions that anybody would have in a situation such as Claudia's. Christian Slater portrays Daniel Malloy with enough uneasiness that he doesn't fall flat on his face but his is the least of the performances, but given that this is probably the least explained (fleshed out) characters in the novel (he's gets his due later in the series) he does a good enough job.<br/><br/>Effects: Big applause to Stan Winston for the Vampire effects, they're just stunning, as is the burning of New Orleans (which is mostly computer generated since the city of New Orleans wouldn't let the filmmakers use any pyrotechnics, and who can blame them?). The sets and clothing also fits nicely with the Victorian age.<br/><br/>Overall: Well as I said this is one of the best adaptations I have seen (it even takes into account some of the later revelations in the series). I have a hard time finding anything bad to say about it; the only thing I can come up with is that I think that Stuart Townsend (Queen of the Damned) is a better Lestat than Tom Cruise. I give this movie 8 out of 10. The extra material on the DVD doesn't give much but a nice anyway, the commentary by the director is nice enough but I miss someone else that he could discuss the scenes with, the making of is also interesting but these two extras isn't enough to satisfy me."

There is always a wish for more, when you know the book behind a picture, and I must say I would'nt mind one or tree hours more of this tantalizing tale. I love the costumes, love the light, love the environments and the beautiful actors.

","Louis, portrayed by Brad Pitt, is a vampire made in the late 1700s. He is tormented by the desire of the Blood, and is accompanied by the dazzler, Lestat, played by Tom Cruise. Quickly following Louis' creation is the creation of Claudia, wonderfully captured by Kirsten Dunst. Claudia quickly is pained by the idea that she will forever be prisoner in a child's body. Her pain flows into Louis, which adds to the tone and mood of the film. Overall, this movie sticks to the book.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's performance in the role of Louis is spectacular; he captured the torrent of emotions that run through Louis' soul. Tom Cruise is very close to the Lestat that runs in my mind (I am an avid reader of Anne Rice, and I have read every one of the Vampire Chronicles... much of my bias of Tom Cruise comes from this.) Cruise is arrogant and lovely enough for the role, but hey, who am I to say that? Kirsten Dunst is the ideal Claudia, capturing her pain and torment, as well as her love of Louis and life. Her childish body is perfect, for her talent portrays the depth and intelligence of Claudia in the Chronicles.<br/><br/>My one and only complaint of the movie is Antonio Banderas in the shoes of Armand. In the Chronicles, Armand is an angelic-faced vampire, made as a young man (17-18). Do not get me wrong: Banderas is a fabulously talented actor, but he was just wrong for the role. The rest of the Theatre de Les Vampires is well cast, accurately capturing the chaos and the decay of old ideas found in the book.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend it to any fan of the books, as well as to any one interested in the Gothic/Horror genre. The film is beautifully set, and well directed."

","A movie that held with fair faithfulness to the book and the style of the author...and with the quality of the book, what more could one ask?<br/><br/>Tom Cruise as Lestat de Lioncourt and Brad Pitt as Louis de Point du Lac were as unlikely a pair of choices as I could imagine on first hearing of the movie, yet both carried off the roles with flair and with a level of faithfulness to the characters as written by Rice that was intensely surprising...especially, I understand, to Anne Rice, herself. (Christian Slater as Daniel...no surprise, and no reason for surprise: the role was not that demanding.) Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia was wonderful, and her portrayal of the growing anger of an immortal permanently trapped in a child's body was possibly the best performance in the movie, and heralded a career to come that has met that promise.<br/><br/>Given all the above, one can only wonder at what point the casting agency stopped reading the book. Antonio Banderas was utterly miscast as the Vampire Armand, who was (in Rice's books) a perpetual teenager with fair complexion, blue eyes and golden hair. The obvious choice was Leonardo diCaprio, and if he was unavailable or uninterested, there were twenty better choices than Banderas waiting in the wings...second choice would have been to cast Daniel differently and give the role to Christian Slater, but Ricky Schroeder, Mark-Paul Gosselaar...the list is too long to bother, and second-guessing the casting director is futile, but it did render the end a great disappointment to Anne Rice fans."

Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like.

The sumptuous photography is by far the best feature of the film, whilst the ending is a dreadful misjudgement."
"JamesHitchcock","4","3","6","20 November 2009"," Video Nasty with Pretensions
","Vampires don't give interviews. At least, vampires in their traditional Transylvanian form don't. Imagine Count Dracula in one of those old Hammer horrors going off to hold a press conference with someone from the Daily Mail or the BBC. The title of ""Interview with the Vampire"", therefore, suggests that it will be a vampire story with a modern setting, perhaps something like ""The Hunger"".<br/><br/>In fact, although the film opens in modern-day San Francisco, it is not as modern as its title might suggest. It starts with a man named Louis being interviewed by a reporter named Daniel Malloy. Louis claims to have been born in Louisiana in the late eighteenth century and to have been converted to vampirism by the vampire Lestat in 1791. The film then chronicles the adventures of Louis, Lestat and a young girl named Claudia, whom they also transform into a vampire, over the next two centuries, starting in the New Orleans of the 1790s, passing through the Paris of the 1870s and ending up in the America of the late twentieth century.<br/><br/>In the course of the film we learn several interesting facts about vampires. They are, apparently, ageless, and remain the age they were when the first became a vampire. Thus Claudia still has the outward appearance of an nine-year-old girl even when, by rights, she should be in her eighties, and Louis looks remarkably well preserved for a two-hundred-and-twentysomething. ""Ageless"", however, does not necessarily mean ""immortal"", and there are in fact various ways of killing them besides the traditional stake-though-the-heart method, notably exposing them to direct sunlight. We also learn that vampires need blood to survive; animal blood will do, but they far prefer human blood. Louis (much to Lestat's contempt) initially has a conscience about killing humans, but eventually gives in and kills his housemaid. As for Claudia, she is a bloodthirsty little monster from the start.<br/><br/>There is another difference between ""Interview with the Vampire"" and those old Hammer films, quite apart from its protagonist's willingness to speak to the press. Hammer films had their faults, but at least they had a strong sense of morality. The vampires were the bad guys and those humans like Van Helsing who were brave enough to stand up to them were the good guys. There is none of that in ""Interview"". Humans do not really play much part in the story, except as victims. Apart from Louis' brief struggle with his conscience, morals do not play much of a role either. Vampires kill humans, and that is that. It is this very amorality which is the reason why (or, more precisely, one of the reasons why) this film is so difficult to like. Certainly, the vampires suffer from enough emotional angst to keep a regiment of agony aunts busy on a full-time basis, but it is hard to sympathise with the emotional problems of creatures who regard the entire human race simply as a convenient source of tasty nourishment.<br/><br/>Rather surprisingly, the best acting comes from the then child star Kirsten Dunst, twelve at the time of filming, who gives a very mature and assured performance as Claudia. Indeed, it was a much more mature and adult performance than many of those which Kirsten has given since she became an adult- and certainly better than those given by her adult co-stars in this film.<br/><br/>For someone regarded as one of the biggest names in Hollywood, Brad Pitt has appeared in a depressingly large number of indifferent or downright bad films (""A River Runs Through It"", ""The Devil's Own"", ""Ocean's Twelve"", ""Mr and Mrs Smith"", etc). ""Interview with the Vampire"" is another to add to this catalogue, although I have to say that he was better here than Tom Cruise, an actor whose acting varies even more alarmingly between the sublime, the adequate and the ridiculous. Cruise's hilariously over-the-top performance as Lestat must count as one of his worst. The script is generally pretty cheesy, but it is normally Cruise who gets the purest specimens of over-ripe Gorgonzola. (""Whining coward of a vampire that prowls the night killing rats and poodles; you could have finished us both""). To describe this sort of dialogue as melodramatic would be to wrong the writers of melodramas.<br/><br/>Indeed, there is much about the whole film that could be described as hilariously over the top. Like a number of other reviewers I was struck by the obvious homo-erotic overtones to the relationship between Louis and Lestat, especially as Tom Cruise seemed to be doing his best to milk this aspect as much as he could. More disturbing were the overtones to the relationship between Louis and Claudia. Their feelings for one another seemed to verge on paedophilia, and the mutual dislike between Claudia and Lestat to be rooted in sexual jealousy.<br/><br/>The tone of the entire film is one of swooningly camp Grand Guignol, with blood being spilt by the bucketful. The worst, and silliest, part came during the scenes set in Paris, where Louis and Claudia come across a coven of theatrical vampires who specialise in dispatching their human victims under cover of a theatrical performance, without any of their audience realising what is going on. It was at this point that I realised that, for all Neil Jordan's arty direction, the film had abandoned any claim to be taken seriously and had turned into little more than a video nasty with pretensions. 4/10"

Erratic in pacing and plot development, heavy- handed delivery of dialogue, and over-the-top acting (by otherwise<br/><br/>fine actors!), cliched sound tracking (ending the movie with an<br/><br/>absolutely butchered rendition of The Rolling Stones', ""Sympathy<br/><br/>For The Devil"", performed by Guns 'N' Roses!!!), and a VERY<br/><br/>BORING story-line.<br/><br/>The only truly redemptive aspect in the film comes in the form of<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst's performance as the child vampire, Claudia.  She<br/><br/>alone gives a portrayal that is completely believable, and is<br/><br/>capable of eliciting an emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>There ARE good scenes and sequences in the film, particularly<br/><br/>the Paris vampires' non-theatre segments, but the film seems to<br/><br/>just throw each portion haphazardly into an alignment that seems<br/><br/>jarring to the over-all make-up of the picture as a whole.<br/><br/>I thought the one, true moment of ingenuity in Vampire mythos that<br/><br/>Rice provided, came in the way in which Louis finds he can once<br/><br/>again watch a sunrise.

Story goes well in first 1/3 of the film then falls apart and start circling around same thing again and again. I mean if the point and center of this script is mistake made when young girl turned in vampire, then you should skip this one. Maybe you should see it because of great acting first by Kirsten Dunst, young Kirsten Dunst. She is great, her best role till now. She can eat Brad Pitt for breakfast. I didn't know age difference between her an Cruise, Pitt - its so big. She is a proof that young movie star can have great adult acting career. And I think this is best performance by Tom Cruise till now (even better then Magnolia). While Pitt and Banderas were too cold and bad in this one (if they ever were good).

","Neither did I read Anne Rice's book, nor am I familiar with movies about vampires.<br/><br/>Anyway I'd like to comment on this movie which is still beautiful in all its ugliness and sort of disturbing in all its beauty. I hate vampires only supposed to look like horrifying monsters (like those from ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", which I haven't seen), that is trash! These vampires instead - whatever a vampire may be - are real creatures, they feel love and hate, they are powerful and dumb, they try to enjoy themselves and they are desperate. Desperately seeking for the meaning of it all - which isn't there. The movie doesn't make sense - but the way these vampires live and the way they fail to cope with their bizarre existence makes sense.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is appropriate in the lead, but the really good actors here are Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst and Stephen Rea.<br/><br/>Someone else already objected to Brad Pitt's and Antonio Banderas' hair. So do I. There are scenes when Brad Pitt looks like an ugly woman. But Tom Cruise's make-up is great, remember the scene when Claudia and Louis are leaving for Europe and Lestat returns and plays the piano. His make-up is emphasizing his voice in a fascinating way. Kirsten Dunst's make-up is great as well, but it's scary since it really makes her look like a doll. The scene when she freaks out and tries to cut her hair is unpleasantly eerie.<br/><br/>However, her performance is amazing. This 11-years-old girl is an even younger child and she is old, she is loving, she is evil, she is ""avant-garde"", her facial acting is terrific. I'm glad she was at least nominated for a Golden Globe.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's Lestat is not a villain as far as I can see. He is a vampire who enjoys being one. And in the movie he is even funny in a macabre way, especially when he ""makes"" Claudia and talks about ""one happy family"".<br/><br/>The relationship of Claudia and Louis is very sweet, isn't it? The only scene which actually disgusts me is when Louis takes revenge on Santiago and the other vampires, it's nothing but brutal and ugly. And I don't like the frightening music that suddenly comes up several times - it just doesn't fit to the movie's basic tone. I voted 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Check it out, but be prepared: It's a world apart - and any search for the meaning of this world will be desperate.<br/><br/>Oh... and if you mind, be prepared to the slight but not deniable homo-erotic tendencies of Lestat, Armand and even Louis. And still there is one thing I forgot: Great buildings!"

This movie is a homo-erotic, romantic chick-flick that happens to have fangs. It's definatley one for the girls- more hunky actors that my sister likes than you can shake a stick at, and not nearly enough bloodletting. Antonio Banderas is a bad-ass as always, unfortunatley he is criminally underused (his name is there on the box, I spent the first 2/3's of the movie thinking ""To blazes with this chick-flickery, when's Antonio going to arrive on the scene?"") and Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly good as a little kid vampire (h er performance was actually stonger than Cruise's and Pitt's).

While Cruise at least has some strong parts in the film, Pitt obviously just walks through it sighing. His sullen performance, along with the really useless comments from the off were simply and painfully boring. Banderas, while in other films a rather good actor, could be left out completely in Interview. The only thing he did was confuse me. Other parts, like Stephen Rea's and Slater's weren't developed enough to add anything to the movie, and Pitt's sudden disappearance for half of the movie didn't leave a good impression on me either.<br/><br/>Another thing that I felt was completely missing in this movie was the part of the victim. The only victims we were showed were either people that had no effect on the way the movie would take whatsoever, or villains, aristocrats that killed their former life partners and animals.<br/><br/>And lastly, who was responsible for Pitt's and Banderas' horrible hair-do??"

To make it clear- when you see Antonio, do you think ""he's a Botticelli angel"" (as everybody describes Armand) or ""he's a Macho Latino"" (as everybody describes Antonio)? And when you see Antonio, do you think he's 17 years old (seeming age of Armand)? Besides, Armand's the one whose reputation's most ruined here... we mean, in the novels, Armand does NOT act in the theatre, he's NOT, like, 'hysteric', he's NOT evil and he stays with Louis (for some time, because then he leaves him :( )Armand's the victim, not the 'victimary'!

Vampires are always exciting, and Rice's sensual killers...even more so. <br/><br/>The acting was almost engaging. Brad Pitt was surprisingly suited to play the role of the morally-ambiguous Louis, and managed to pull of an acting job that belied his pretty boy reputation. Of course, he might have only seemed impressive when put beside his costar Tom Cruise, whose performance served only to cement his role as a pretty face with a gaping lack of talent. Antonio Banderas was also stunningly ill-suited to play the role of the ancient vampire Armand. (Of course, I may have only been distracted by his ankle-length hair. If so, then I can hardly be blamed.) while Kirsten Dunst gave a remarkable performance as the child vampire Claudia. Her death almost brought a tear to my eye. Almost.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was a fascinating waste of time. Although the cast was certainly drool-worthy, the film walked the thin line between a welcome success and a dull failure, and all-too-often stumbled. It was ridiculously overdone--almost.

","In modern day America, a journalist is approached by a handsome young man to hear a story told.  He tells a tale that begins hundreds of years prior, where he was a landowner who had lost his wife and daughter.  He tells of being turned vampire by the suave killer Lestat.  However the blessing of eternal life as the undead becomes a curse.<br/><br/>The hunky cast is clearly a major part of the reason that this film was as successful as it was ¬ñ the imdb voting breakdown shows it ranking highly among female groups.  However this is maybe not a fair reflection of a film that is certainly glossy and professional, but not as rich in depth as it is visually.  The plot is reasonable, I have not read the book so I can't compare, but the plot was thin for the majority of the time.  As a journey with Louis, it fails to really grip and involve and ends up being a little dull as it feels like it's going through the motions.  A big problem is that much of the plot is character driven ¬ñ which would be fine if the film had strong characters, but it doesn't.<br/><br/>Instead the characters are pretty bland and lacking substance.  Louis is interesting at first when he struggles with the change, but after that he becomes all slick and starts speaking in a low, quiet voice!  Most of the vampires are the same and the relationship between them aren't well done ¬ñ it all feels very superficial without any meat on the bone.  The actors must carry some of the blame.  Pitt is way out of his depth and flounders with a character he is unable to bring the complexities and sorrows out of convincingly.  Cruise looks like a model and is more pretty boy than devilishly dashing ¬ñ his character is a fine example of what I mean by superficial.  Dunst is OK for a child but all she really does is play the role in one way.  Banderas is a poor choice for his role and he looks a little out of place ¬ñ although Rea is good in his role.<br/><br/>Overall this film looks good and Jordan has done a good job as director. The score is effective and the film has a good list of names in the lead and support roles.  However both the story and the characters lack a substance which was sorely needed to engage the audience.  While Louis battled to keep his regrets and his human heart, I battled without luck to find any heart within this slick, glossy movie."
"sddavis63","6","4","11","11 May 2002"," Strangely Compelling But Falters At The End
","Brad Pitt is Louis, in this story of Louis' life as a vampire who shares his story in an interview with a newspaper reporter (played by Christian Slater.) The story traces Louis from 1791 New Orleans to the present day. This is not your typical Hollywood vampire movie. It breaks - and even sneers at - many of the Hollywood-created vampire legends, focusing instead on the intricate relationship between Louis, the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise) and Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), the young girl the pair turn into a vampire and then ""adopt.""<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, I thought it was Dunst who really made this movie. Her performance as Claudia was magnificent, as she believably captured the pain and confusion of facing possibly eternal life as a child - learning and maturing but never actually growing up. Her performance captivated me. Pitt and Cruise were passable in their roles, but never - in my view - captured the essence of their characters. Antonio Banderas was a disaster as Armand, the Paris vampire that Louis and Claudia eventually discover during their search for their own kind.<br/><br/>This was an interesting enough movie - strangely compelling in fact. I was never tempted to turn away from it. It mixed humour and a mild eroticism into the vampire fare, and did so quite well. The movie fell apart, though, in the last third or so. The relationship between Louis and the Old World vampires just wasn't that intriguing to me. Frankly, the ""Vampire Theatre"" struck me as simply silly, and Banderas - as I mentioned - just didn't work in the role of Armand. But the first two-thirds were quite good. All things considered, I give this a 6/10."

","Personally I don't really like tom cruise because I wanna see something beyond good looks and a good smile in a movie I'm watching, like good acting. The first time I watched this movie it took me halfway through it to notice brad pitt was in it. To date, the picture that pops into my mind when I hear the word ""vampire"" is tom cruise.
Unlike any other movies of his he is lively, passionate, caught up in the role. He is not playing but actually living the character. Anne Rice apparently handpicked him for the role as Susan Batson stated to me once. That conversation revealed far more than that but I respect her privacy too much to disclose.
Brad Pitt here is just average. Louis is actually one of his worse performances but he beautifully is the beautiful vampire with a human soul writhing in the existential agony of being a parasite to all that he loved.
Kirsten Dunst is just beautiful here; disturbing, twisted, painful yet hungry for the love of one vampire that no one seems to be able to share.
The whole theatricality of the movie aside, Banderas' I think had another thing on his mind and the director indulged him so we have all the extra theatricality we couldn't appreciate more. I am not talking about the dialogues here, I am talking about the way he moved and talked and glanced.
All that said, I don't really like the homosexual undertone (I aint even sure I can call it an undertone since it is so damn obvious) in the movie, didn't read the books but afaik it is supposed to be even gayer in the books. There could have been a better implementation of the love dynamics between the characters aside from going just gay. Anne rice is to blame for that I think.
So its nine stars even with all the unnecessary homosexuality, largely thanks to Tom Cruise's brilliant acting. I just wish he could act the same in the tonload of other movies he played in."

It felt like it could've been very good if it had been more subtle with it's messages and spent more time on real character development. No one in this movie seemed like real people and behaved very unrealistically. They are so dramatic they aren't relatable anymore. I get this is a vampire movie, but still. I can't say exactly what my problem with this movie is, but it might be that it simply isn't my kind of film. Good movies are, in my opinion, supposed to have more to them than this.

Tom Cruise, typecast as a pretty boy, plays against type as the villainous, yet still likable, Lestat...and what an extraordinary performance. Brad Pitt, fresh off his debut in ""Thelma And Louise,"" is excellent as Louis. Stephen Rea was pure evil as Santiago. Antonio Banderas provides an excellent counter-part to Lestat and Louis' mentor as Armand, proprietor of Theatre De Vampires. Kirsten Dunst, in one of her first films, is truly angelic as Claudia. Christian Slater, brought in to replace the deceased River Phoenix (who had originally been cast, but died of a drug overdose before his part could be filmed), is credible as The Interviewer. Great film. Tom Cruise steals the movie, though he's on screen for less than half the film's running time. Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Stephen Rea, Antonio Banderas and Christian Slater also carry the film. Well-done period/vampire movie. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! If you don't mind watching vampires biting people's necks, necks being broken, throats slit, bodies cut in half, blood being sucked and brief, but necessary, nudity (when Claudia says, ""I want to be just like her"" and later in the Theatre De Vampires), this is the movie for you.

"fullonrobotchubby","7","2","4","15 August 2006"," Vampire Sociology
","Brokeback Mountain is said to be the ultimate exam of viewers' homophobia, but before everybody that's straight heads out to test their endurance with that film, I think Interview with the Vampire is keeping the throne warm for now. There technically isn't anything sexual in Interview, but author and screenplay adapter Anne Rice does a fine job establishing the ""bisexual in nature"" sociology of the vampires and how it compares with the mortals. Goes like this: the vampires cannot be sexual (all of one's body is dead, so... use your imagination), but when they quench their thirsts for blood on their victims, male or female, the thrills they achieve are so exhilarating that the act is comparable to sex. Once the viewer understands this, with some parts of the movie, it's hard to decide whether to be disgusted or not, not with the near homosexual relationship between Tom Cruise's Lestat and Brad Pitt's Louis (which is acceptable) but with Louis' little girl companion, in a pedophiliac sense. Kirsten Dunst, who was about 11, gives (still) the best performance of her career as Claudia, an aging vampire whose physical form stays childlike. However, since Claudia becomes adult and beyond and tries to do away with Lestat so Louis can be all hers, it's hard to watch what still seems to be a child to the naked eye grow so lovelorn for an adult. Their relationship raises tons of questions, some you may not want the answers to. My favorite scenes (tie) are toward the end when Louis seeks fiery revenge on some misled vampires in the name of Claudia and the edgy dialogue and body language exchanged between Louis and Armand (Antonio Banderas, fresh off playing Tom Hanks' lover in Philadelphia) in the scene after. My beef with the movie is not homophobic by any means. I just don't like getting beat over the head repeatedly for a point to be made, and casting all ""pretty boys"" like Cruise, Pitt, Banderas, and Christian Slater as the current-day interviewer is doing just that (though it's really the only case of it). Other than Pitt, I wish the casting director would have chosen the parts by acting ability and not by shock value."

I thought it was sick how Lestat (tom cruise)and Armand (antonio Banderas) came on to Louis (Brad Pit). Gay vampire love is not very appealing to me. though most of the movies Tom Cruise acts in are to say the least horrible especially having him in them, but Interview with a vampire is a wonderful movie that I would buy and see over and over and over again.

"jachimp","10","2","4","5 November 2005"," Another Review, to update it's glory
","This movie is possibly the best film I have ever seen. I mean, really, it is phenomenal and mainly because of the acting - even if you hate the actors in this film you will still be able to appreciate their amazing performances. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst and Antonio Banderas show off their full talent and for each actor this is probably their best film.<br/><br/>The film starts of in present day San Francisco, with 200 year old Louis (Pitt) telling his immortal life story to young interviewer Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater). We then get propelled into the story, first set in the late 1700's, Louis is in grave depression because of the loss of his young wife and daughter, and is almost wishing to die when one night, charismatic vampire Lestat (Cruise) comes to his rescue, and exchanges his life for an immortal brilliant life - or so it would seem...<br/><br/>Louis resents his new immortal life, even though living in luxury, he hates having to kill to survive and grows angry of Lestat. He captures Louis' torment from the book perfectly, and it's hard to see him come to terms with the people he's around. He mirrors his pain when he see's Lestat do wicked things, when Armand turns out to be cruel, when Claudia turns out to be cruel it's truly great. Anyway, Lestat realizes Louis is miserable, and makes young orphan Claudia (Dunst) into a vampire, so that Louis will stay with him and care for her. Kirsten Dunst is arguably the best actor in this film, her scenes are breath taking as she plays the beautiful, innocent looking yet lethal Claudia. Her best scene is probably when she fully realizes she will never grow up, and cuts her hair off in a fit of rage - only for it to grow back again in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>So Claudia blames Lestat - ""You made us what we are didn't you!?"" for making her a vampire and poisons him with laudanum from a dead body, and slits his throat and dumps his body in a swamp. Her and Louis plan to leave New Orleans for Europe, when Lestat shows up for revenge against Claudia and attempts to kill her. The house is burned down however, and Louis and Claudia flee New Orleans to Europe, where they arrive in Paris.<br/><br/>Once in Paris, they encounter Armand (Banderas) and his coven of vampires. Armand envies Claudia because of her relationship with Louis, and he finds out about her attempting murder on Lestat, so he orders her to be killed. The coven of vampires basically drag Louis away from Claudia as she is locked in an air shaft, and of course in the morning the sun will come up. When Louis discovers Claudia's ashes (he never actually cared for Madaleine) he knows Armand was behind it all and his pain that he has lost his only love is too hard for him to bear. He sets the Thearte Des Vampires on fire, killing the scary and cruel Estelle and vicious Santiago in the process. Louis returns to New Orleans to continue with his life without Claudia.<br/><br/>""Two ageless vampires relationship is put to the test when one of them makes a young girl immortal; thereby changing their lives forever."" Note: Interview with the Vampire (by Anne Rice) is completely recommended. Seriously, this film is simply breath taking. Any one can appreciate the brilliant score, the amazing sets and costumes, makeup - but above all performances, particularly Cruise, Pitt and Dunst. This film should have won Oscars and as for Dunst, she herself should have got an Oscar for her performance, an MTV Movie Award for best break though is taking the p***, she deserved a lot more.<br/><br/>Enjoy the move."

If you think you'd never be able to sympathise with brutal bloodsuckers, giant mosquitoes in human form you could say, think again. Emotion surrounds poor Louis and almost all the characters in one way or another, and it is impossible not to pity them. A great plot, brilliant script and stunning acting. An incredible movie.<br/><br/>First up: Tom Cruise. His performance as Lestat was stunning. Although I'm not usually a Tom Cruise fan, I can't deny I was SO impressed. He portrays Lestat in such a genuine way - he is a killer. He drinks people's blood. Yet he enjoys it while Louis is repulsed by it. Brad Pitt as Louis was a pleasant surprise. A Hollywood pretty boy as a vampire? Yeah right. I was proved wrong (gasp...)and pleasantly surprised that he played Louis so well, whichever state of mind and time of life (oh the irony, he's immortal) he happens to be in. Antonio Banderas does a fantastic job as usual and makes an evil, dark, theatrical vampire oh so sexy. Stephen Rea is the guy you just love to hate and Santiago would be top of my 'characters to torture' list if I had one.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS MOVIE! Go see. Go buy. Go enjoy."
"Nriks","Null","2","4","9 August 2003"," ""Fictions, my friend... The vulgar fictions of a demented Irishman""
","Interview with the Vampire is problematic, to say the least.  Problem one: the film is directed by Neil Jordan from a script by Anne Rice.  Remember the last time Jordan tried to make a film from someone else's script? The result was We're No Angels, an overcooked turkey in the eyes of all... so bad in fact, that Jordan was forced back to Ireland with his tail between his legs [until the success of The Crying Game made him hot property once again]. <br/><br/>Problem two is Rice herself.  It has always been my opinion that she lacks real depth as a writer, her style is simply too bland and superficial.  She does have a rudimentary skill with creating mild tension, and her central characters are always memorable, but in terms of literary or storytelling ability she pales... especially in comparison to the infinitely superior likes of Margaret Atwood or Angela Carter.  The book's episodic narrative and stream-of-conscious style fails to translate well into captivating cinema, which is a shame, considering the hard work done by the production designers and cinematographer in creating a wholly evocative world.<br/><br/>This brings us to problem three: Character and performances.  Now, with a cast made up almost entirely of super-hunks it comes as no surprise to see that the IMDB rating system lists the film's primary viewers as women, aged 18 to 45.  Now this may have resulted in a box-office hit, and I do respect Cruise and Pitt as 'serious' actors, however both men are way off form here. Cruise's effeminate pouting and constant swishing of hair gives him all the lure of a Loriel model as opposed to the suave, blood-sucking playboy he is supposed to be.  Pitt similarly has little to do, other than act as window dressing.  Even towards the films climax, when he essays the role of narrator he gives a performance as enthusiastic and spirited as Terry Kiser's in Weekend at Bernie's.    <br/><br/>Support is made up of Christian Slater, Antonia Banderas, Jordan regular Stephen Rea and the wildly over-praised Kirsten Dunst.  Slater is fair, although still trading off his Jack Nicholson impersonation, whist Banderas and Rea seriously struggle with accents... coming across as wildly over-the-top caricatures.  Dunst isn't THAT bad, although she's largely one note, and we've seen much better debuts from child actors before and since... the fact that she's gone on to star in some of the most offensive, vacuous teen-fluff imaginable doesn't do any favours for her reputation as a serious thesp.  Needless to say, this being Jordan, the film is absolutely stunning in terms of mood, atmosphere, production design and cinematography, whilst Eliot Goldenthall turns in yet another memorable score, in addition to his work the previous year on Alien 3.  <br/><br/>I've always wanted to like this film... I've watched it many times in the hope that it will somehow get better, but it's becoming pretty obvious now that it won't.  The overall problem is simply this; the film goes nowhere. It lacks bite [no pun!], offering us nothing new to the vampire cycle or the horror genre as a whole.  The climactic crane shot, set to the Rolling Stone's rollicking classic Sympathy for the Devil is gutsy and endlessly impressive.  Just a shame that this final display of balls-out, rock and roll angst fails to change the fact that Interview with the Vampire is a largely emasculated, and totally toothless affair.  2/3"
"TxMike","Null","2","4","26 February 2001"," Highly interesting film from the vampire's point of view, I rate it ""7"" of 10.
","This film is based on the novel by my good friend Anne Rice. And the book was actually based on a short story she wrote back in her college days. Anne, if you are reading this, I only give it ""7"" because it is not the kind of movie I want to see twice, however I admire the script you wrote. You did it in an overall ""comedy"" style and it works well that way.  Although I suppose we need to call it a ""dark comedy"" because of the subject matter and all the people who die such horrible deaths.<br/><br/>Big stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas are vampires. Pitt is a ""sensitive"" vampire and feels badly that he has to live his life killing people by draining their blood so that he can stay alive. Or rats and chickens when humans aren't convenient. Cruise is just the opposite, and eventually they clash. One of the victims is the mother of Kirsten Dunst's character, and the 12-yr-old is ""injected"" and she becomes a vampire also. The film covers approx. 200 years of Pitt's vampire life, as it is being told to Christian Slater, thus the ""interview"" in the film's title. Most of the ""flashback"" is in Rice's hometown, NewOrleans, from about 1790 to the 1990s. But some of it also is set in Paris as Pitt's character travels the world to find others like himself.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this film, and it held my interest. Still, it is not my favorite kind of film. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful as the mini-vampire, a role much better suited to her talents then the current ""Bring It On"" where she plays a teenage cheerleader."

","On my third try I finally saw this entire movie recently.  I did not read the novel so do not feel one way or another about the screen version.  I enjoyed the acting from the leads to the smaller parts, but the acting honors go to Kirsten Dunst.  As a beautiful young girl who is robbed of her youth by a vampire, she lashes back at her attackers with a passion that was beautiful to behold. Tom and Brad are sometimes very funny and seem like an actual male couple, especially when they are bickering or Tom is teasing him.  The movie has more to say about life today than I would have thought possible, and gives the viewer much to think about when its over.  The fantastic sets, costumes and soundtrack work together to make this a complete package.  You are even smiling when its over!"

","Interview With the Vampire is one of the most breathtaking films I've ever seen. The casting was extraordinary, and the plot was truly beautiful in every way. This movie so wonderfully depicts the most intimate emotions of a vampire; the wonder felt when seeing the last sunrise before your demise, the misery felt when a loved one passes away. The dark, grim music only added to the vampire theme, making it swell. The scene where Louis is so greedily feeding from Lestat's arm, and the look of total fulfillment in his eyes is lingering. When Lestat plays the piano, I could hear the music echoing through my mind, and pulsing through my veins. The haunting sound flows, rushing, almost striking me with fear. Ah, Claudia, the little vampire child, so beautiful. She was the very definition of a woman trapped forever in the body of an innocent child. Louis, the man that had forsaken his mortality because of his mourning over his deceased wife and child. This move was terrific!!"

","This is a much more sophisticated take on the vampire through-the-ages narrative; but it has certainly dated in the almost 30 tears since Neil Jordan put together a stellar, if not great, cast to regale us with the tale of ""Louis"" (Brad Pitt) & ""Lestat"" (Tom Cruise). Told in flashback to a very sceptical reporter ""Daniel"" (Christian Slater), Pitt tells of his near 200 year life that started with his meeting with Cruise and his conversion to his immortal existence based on blood. It's a hugely lavish affair, with loads of lust, trickery, duplicity and gore - tinged with genuine regret, loneliness and sadness - and, of course, loads of cruel violence. Whilst it does nod to the whole ""Hammer"" style of horror thrillers - there is plenty of ketchup - the writing and characterisations have much more depth to them. Neither of the principal characters are likeable, but you do build some sort of reverse empathy with - at least Pitt - as the film progresses. The attention to detail on the sets and costumes as we march through time never lessens and contributes magnificently to a stylish, sumptuous glamour-fest. Much as they were/are doubtless box-office A listers, however, Pitt was just too young looking to be convincing, Cruise just can't really act at the best of times, much less with extra dental props and Kirsten Dunst just annoyed me in the best traditions of Shirley Temple. A shame, because the rest of this is superb."

2) The film is more of a realistic character study than a ""vampire film"" with deep themes explored such as family and aging
3) I love the juxtaposition of Louis' two central relationships. One is his father figure and their relationship is aggressive whilst he is the father figure to the other and their relationship is loving
4) The dialogue is almost Shakespearean; being dramatic whilst also being realistic and relatable<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>1) Some of the special effects look goofy and dated
2) It's 15-20 minutes too long, the Antonio Banderas stuff in particular could've been cut down
3) Because the film is mainly a realistic character study more than a ""vampire film"", it felt odd that they chose to keep in the silly vampire cliches of sleeping on coffins, reading minds and having super speed
4) I always hate when films have characters playing an instrument but then shoot the scene in a way where it is obvious that the actor is not actually playing the instrument. This happens with both Cruise and Dunst when they are playing the piano"

","While Interview With The Vampire is cast with hunky Hollywood pretty boy actors like Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and Antonio Banderas . This is not the chick flick soap opera I thought it would be at the time of its release. Years later, I decided to give the film a chance and ended up really digging it. Based on a novel by Anne Rice, Interview With A Vampire is a very serious minded big budget vampire epic that was a refreshing take on the genre. The cast actually delivered solid performances in this very somber vampire movie. The epic and dramatic approach to the material was innovative with good storytelling and characters with strong visuals and excellent camerawork. While this brings a new approach to the genre, it still retains enough gloomy ambiance and thrills that are prevalent to Gothic horror. So, in as many ways as Interview With A Vampire is different, it still sticks to a lot of traditional Gothic horror conventions. Overall, this is a really good film and should appease both horror fans and more arthouse type of viewers that normally would stay away from this type of film."

","""Interview with the Vampire"" is a 1994 horror drama directed by Neil Jordan starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. I've always been fascinated by the myth of vampires, undead and soulless wanderers of the night and and all the small details that belonged to the lore. For now 122 years, mostly influenced by Bram Stoker's infamous novel ""Dracula"", the stories have been retold and adapted ever since. I've almost watched every film that's related to this legend. So it was about time I got to watch this classic as well. First of all it's strange to see such a top-class cast playing in this film. Next to the leading gentlemen we have Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and a young Kirsten Dunst. Especially the last one gave an excellent performance and managed to stay on an equal level with the others throughout the whole run time. It's just wonderful how said actors harmonise on screen and no one ever steals anyone's show. They all undeniably share a genuine chemistry. Nevertheless, the screenplay shows both, brilliance and slight flaws. The dialogue and how it's written is sheer impressive, just the way it's worded, but the plot also fails to fully give the viewer the chance to sink their teeth into the characters (pun intended). At times they're too distanced and I never managed to reach the level of sympathy for them I hoped to reach. It's not like I didn't care for them, but also the slow storytelling provided that the film suffered from its length at times. A shorter run time would have done better. It may not sound like it, but that's not actually a big deal, there are countless aspects that make this film great. The way this whole production is filmed is just eerie and the cinematography creates a saddening atmosphere. It's a melancholic tale, philosophical and poetic, about life and death, loneliness and love, morals and values. Mostly the character Louis caught my curiosity. He has a lot in common with BTVS' Angel and you know I like that a lot, although it sometimes appears that the film wants to show off how handsome Brad Pitt is with his fancy hair. But he's not the only charming aspect of it: The sets and sceneries are impressively authentic and the costumes are extremely noble and well crafted. Furthermore, the effects and makeup are surprisingly brutal in the first case and seductively modest in the latter case.
Also the ambiguity of the whole vampire theme is clearly noticeable, it has a lot of erotic undertones and sexual innuendos. All in all, this stylish and handsome drama knows how to impress with looks and overshadow its flaws. It's enough to make it an enjoyable entry to the sub-genre, it has the phenomenal cast and exceptional design. It's good, but could have been a true masterpiece instead."

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","8","0","0","4 October 2019"," Better than it should be
","Settling down for an interview, a vampire recounts to a reporter about his past when he was initially turned into a bloodthirsty creature by an equally vicious vampire and how they've lived among humanity throughout the years spanning the country's history and how he has dealt with it.<br/><br/>This was a rather pleasant surprise and was a lot better than expected. One of the better examples of this is that the film contains a lot of really nice action scenes that have so many good parts that it never manages to get boring or dull. There are some good scenes of him at the beginning after the transformation coming upon the different traits and encountering the people who don't know of him so they allow him to feast on them before turning into the fiery destruction of the mansion as the more flames spread across the estate the more the realization dawns that there's little escape, and it has a really rousing finale that works perfectly. Some of the other scenes, including the night-time hunting in the Louisiana town to the fire in the bedroom and the Paris finale that is a huge, epic fight where the torture method is intense and painful, the revenge is worthwhile and is one of the film's highlights. The last one here is the film has a huge assortment of kills with its big body-count that is worthwhile and makes the other moments all the better. These here are the film's good points as there isn't much wrong with this one, but there's a pretty big flaw to it. This highly detrimental flaw is the manner of portraying its vampires as incredibly whiny and constantly complaining about everything that happens. The reluctance to do anything that usual vampires engage in, from the neck-biting to the supernatural powers are touched over here and there and the same conclusion about the vampires being in that behavior-set is always brought up. That is hardly any way to be able to treat it's vampires since they're supposed to be very creepy and frightening, yet not so much in here. It takes a lot out of the film since that's mostly how the beginning of the film plays out for the majority of the time in those sections, and it rarely comes up from them. It also causes the pace to be so slow and dragged-out featuring all this bland and unexciting non-vampire action. Another small flaw here is that the kills are all done in the same way, and hardly anything else is used here. It really could've used some variety in here, and it's not detrimental but otherwise, these here are the film's flaws.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Full Nudity and violence against animals."

","This was a film that I remember watching when it first hit the movie channels back in the 90's. This one I actually think I've only watched it all the way through a couple of times, but used to jump into it whenever it was on quite a few times. If it was on I've actually read this novel that it is based off of, as well as others from the series as well. The synopsis is a vampire tells his epic life story: love, betrayal, loneliness and hunger.<br/><br/>We start here with Louis (Brad Pitt) in a room with Malloy (Christian Slater). He is a writer and this is an interview that Louis wanted to do. He reveals in the first minute or so that he is a vampire. This shocks Malloy who doesn't believe at first, but Louis shows his abilities immediately. He then starts to tell his story.<br/><br/>It takes us back to 1791 in Louisiana. We learn that Louis lost his wife and child during childbirth. He is a deep depression and is pretty much looking for a way to die. That brings him in contact with Lestat (Tom Cruise). He gives him what he wants, but makes him an offer of a dark gift. Louis doesn't full understand what that means, but accepts. He is made into a vampire.<br/><br/>We then see Louis seek into an even greater depression as he tries to cling to his humanity. This brings him to the decision to feed on Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). Lestat decides to turn her into a vampire, who will be forever a child. Both of them grow to see the monster that Lestat is and tried to rid themselves of him. They then flee to Europe to try to find others of their kind.<br/><br/>They finally do in Paris, where they find vampires who are much older. One of them mimics Louis, Santiago (Stephen Rea). This leads him to Armand (Antonio Banderas), a much older vampire than Lestat. The problem is there are some rules that these vampires from America have violated and the punishment can be quite severe.<br/><br/>Now I wanted to go a little bit vague in my review of this film, because there is a lot here. As I stated, I read the novel and this film runs 2 hours long. The interesting thing is having the writer of the novel, Anne Rice, be the one who penned the screenplay. Something that really struck me with this viewing as well, these vampires are really what Twilight was going for and failed. Rice really envisions them to be pansexual and just in love with beauty. It is interesting that they actually downplay it here as this is a theme she revisits a lot in the novel and others as well.<br/><br/>An aspect of this story that I really love is taking a timeless creature like the vampire and actually show them living through different eras. This film has Louis as a slave owner. His slaves believe there is an evil spirit around them and they're right. This causes them to lose the plantation. We see them dealing with the plague in New Orleans, which to be honest, I didn't know it struck there. We then see them moving through Paris as well. There is interesting as the vampires that Armand and Santiago are with are decadent and being of an old world. This will move into my next point, which is why Armand falls in love with Louis.<br/><br/>I think that having someone as depressed as Louis is great for this story. He is of a new world. He doesn't want to feed on the humans around him. He is clinging to his humanity, even though he's a vampire. He isn't of royalty like Lestat was before he was turned and he wasn't a boy lover to the rich like Armand or a child who doesn't understand like Claudia. He is from a world where he knows better and he is stuck in that mind-set. It would make sense he would seek out a human to tell his story to like he does.<br/><br/>From here, I think I should shift to the acting of the film which I think is excellent. Pitt brings enough pain his look to really bring this role to life. He does a lot with his eyes, even though they're altered as a vampire. I could still see so much pain in them. He did a great job and you can see how good of an actor he really is. I have to say that Cruise is amazing in bringing such arrogance to Lestat. Having read other novels in the line, you realize he isn't as bad a character as he is in this novel, which is interesting. I think from the point of view of this film, it is dead on and the performance is wonderful. Dunst is so young in this film, but her performance is great. I think after she's been turned for some time, she somehow channels an older feeling through her character. Seeing the rage is quite believable. I do want to commend Rea, Banderas and the rest of the performances as well as they definitely round out the acting as well.<br/><br/>The issue I kind of have with the film is with the pacing. I think with the amount of information that is told, the runtime is fine. I never really found myself bored. The problem I think is that the story isn't all that exciting. It is very interesting and holds your attention, but it isn't one that really is going to captivate you. It definitely isn't boring and I think the ending is solid overall.<br/><br/>To the effects of the film, I never realize that Stan Winston was behind them. I really like the look of the vampires here. When you turn, you become the most beautiful version of yourself. I like that when they're lacking blood do they look pallid and sickly. The eyes I think are contacts, which are quite gorgeous and creepy at the same time. There is some monstrous looking moments for the vampires that I was down with. I do know there are some CGI moments in this film, but they look quite amazing. They are there when they couldn't do practical and really just enhance the experience, which I'm good with. The film is shot beautifully as well.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this film is one that I found really good the first time that I saw it and it still holds up. I think there's a lot here with some deeper meanings with it as well. I like moving through the eras through the eyes of a vampire and seeing how they survive and it changes around them. It isn't an exciting story so keep that in mind. The acting is quite amazing though and that does carry it. The effects are really good as well, which you should expect from Winston. The soundtrack I do think fits the scenes to set the mood to the time period, but it didn't really stand out to me on its own. Overall I say this is a really good film and definitely should be viewed by horror fans and non-horror fans alike, it really is one that grounds the vampire genre in realism."

","After losing his wife and child, Louis(Pitt, a far too reactive(as opposed to one who takes charge, and causes things to happen... he just goes with what occurs), and thus uninteresting lead) risks everything, and is found and turned by old vampire(and the ways thereof are endowed with the eroticism seen in other takes on this mythical creature) Lestat(Cruise, looking somewhat less effeminate than he does in Legend with golden locks), who laughs at the formers attempts to maintain his humanity, refusing to kill to feed(going after rats and poodles instead). One night, they turn a pre-teen girl, Claudia(Dunst, in her best performance this side of Melancholia... stunning), who threatens their peaceful coexistence(they're actually not unlike an old married couple, with constant bickering) upside down, with her lack of discipline and eventual yearning to grow up, to develop into a woman. I've now tried to watch this a few times, and each time the same thing happens: around the middle, I stop caring. Is it that the latter half is less compelling than the first? I really don't believe so. That's actually when stuff goes down. It's just too Gothic and vague(I can barely describe the characters so that one can tell them apart) for my tastes, and that doesn't mean that it will be for everyone. And don't get me wrong, this is a brilliantly acted piece. I couldn't point you to anyone in this who does less than excellent(the one who comes closest might be Slater... don't worry, he's not in it much). It's filmed and edited gorgeously. There are some deep, inspired notions explored through the seemingly endless life(at least 200 years, as is revealed very early on), the eternal youth, and the flirtation between life and death, from both those who have been bitten and those who have not. I haven't read the novel(or any other Rice), and can draw no comparisons. There is a lot of bloody, disturbing, brutal and violent content, some strong sexuality and a little full female nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone who wants a mature look at the nocturnal dweller. 7/10"

","Interview with the vampire is easily one of the best vampire movies that have been in the whole history of modern cinema. It focuses on a 200 year old vampire who is being interviewed by a young journalist and is chronicling his whole life from before he became a vampire to the present day. This movie is different from the twilight movies. Unlike twilight, the vampires in this movie cannot survive in sunlight. It actually stays true to the mythology of vampires. Not that I did not like twilight which i did. I just think this movie is better. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are a very good team. The gore and blood is very graphic and very realistic. The scene I especially liked is when Louis goes to the theatre and burns the vampires out of revenge for Claudias murder. This is one movie not to be missed."

","Dreary and dark and still fun to watch. I think that's the key here when saying Tom Cruise was the wrong choice... it may have been to over dramatic in the boring way without him. With Cruise, it was over dramatic in a nice, fun way. For all it's faults, the film is entrancing because of the amazing atmosphere, detailed sets, and charisma of the leading actors. They do a little bit too much harping on the same subjects over and over again, or maybe its just the screen writing being too repetitive in how they explain Pitt's characters constant inner struggles. The ending also feels out of place and forced, however, it's not enough to ruin an otherwise interesting watch."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","0","30 January 2012"," An Underrated Masterpiece of Horror ...
","""Interview with the Vampire"", adapted from Anne Rice's novel, approaches horror like ""The Godfather"" for the gangster genre by plunging us in the most intimate depths of a scary underworld, to understand the complexity of three-dimensional characters beyond an apparent evilness. Neil Jordan's film, one of the best of the prolific 1994 year, is a harrowing journey into a perpetual darkness, whether it lies in the profound majesty of a night sky or in the heart of a creature that traded the admiration of a beautiful sunshine for the poisoned gift of immortality.<br/><br/>As the title indicates, the narrative consists on an interview between a journalist, Daniel (Christian Slater) and an affable and elegant vampire, Louis (Brad Pitt) who tells the story of his life which, like for every vampire, starts in human form. Louis grew up in New Orleans in the eighteenth century where he became a rich plantation owner and slave master at 25, which equals being 40 today. The premature death of his wife at childbirth made him lose the will for life, an easy prey for a vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise). Through Daniel's naive questions, the film intelligently introduces our POV allowing Louis to sweep off all the clich√©s about Transylvania and crosses ¬Öor to discuss them. We rapidly understand that ""Interview' is a mature and innovative film.<br/><br/>The process of vampire-conception is one of the film's many novelties. When Lestat bites Louis' neck, he gives him the 'choice he didn't have', a repeated line that echoes in my mind, the 'offer one couldn't refuse' from ""The Godfather"", a sort of cynical invitation to die or to become a vampire. Louis was already dead by human standards, so his soul could find relief only through non-existence or new-existence, and since survival is the strongest of all the instincts, Louis chooses to become a vampire by sucking the blood of Lestat, who therefore becomes a fatherly mentor, and being as 'young' as Louis, a friend and roommate.<br/><br/>Having a couple is another originality introduced by the film and quite necessary because it opens a gate for insightful discussions through Louis' initiation in the vampire world. His first learning is how to kill, something he's extremely reluctant to commit, having still an ounce of humanity in his heart. The life of vampires oscillates between two realities, the beauty of the world in night that seems even more lively and fascinating, an aspect transcended by a dazzling cinematography, and there is the ugliness of their instinct that can only depends its survival on killing lives. Vampires are necessarily evils, and this poisons Louis's conscience, he who shouts to Lestat that he sentenced him to hell.<br/><br/>The killing scenes create an unsettling mix of gruesomeness and sensuality sublimated by the beautiful period setting, reminding Hitchcock's motto: to shoot murders like love scenes and vice versa. There is indeed something strangely sensual going between the reserved Louis and the flamboyant Lestat culminating when Louis bites the neck of a little orphan who lost her mother during the plague, and Lestat saves her by giving his blood. Little Claudia is reborn through a symbolic process that involved the two vampires.<br/><br/>Claudia genuinely loves Louis while she's educated by Lestat, and unlike Louis, she didn't have time to be a human and plenty enough to become a ruthless killer. The film features a long sequence where Claudia's talent hidden behind a mask of cuteness is revealed with a nice touch of black comedy. Without giving away obvious sexual undertones, there is no way not to see them as a family, making the friendship between Louis and Lestat ambiguous and between Louis and Claudia sort of incestuous, especially since she had the maturity of a young woman trapped in a child's body. The plurality of characters provides more insightful questions about the vampire's conditions and their roots.<br/><br/>Indeed, while Louis' torments were more about what was wrong or right, about the necessity of killing, and being evil despite conscience, Claudia discovers in a pivotal scene set some decades after, that she will never be desired like a woman. Louis wanted to be good despite his nature, Claudia to be desired. Kirsten Dunst delivers one of the greatest child performances on an Oscar worthy level. The film takes a sort of mythological turn when they both plot against their own creator. Louis, in a sort of Oedipian movie, kills his own 'father' to become Claudia's only father, so she can live in an incestuous symbiosis with her. Claudia makes him more human and he makes her more desired.<br/><br/>The film's third act illustrates the impossibility for this relationship to be maintained when the two vampires go to discover their roots, in Paris. They are disappointed by the level of buffoonish decadence striking this underworld. Armand, the leader, played by Antonio Banderas feels in Louis, an innocence absent in the other vampires, and wants to keep him with, this confirms the initial sexual undertones of the Louis and Lestat duo, creating a dramatic love triangle, encouraging Claudia to find another kind of love, a mother, but the love will be shortcut, as she'll get lynched by the vampire posse, to pay for Lestat's death.<br/><br/>The film ends with a weight in Louis' heart which is less a failure than a relieving deception. Instead of looking at the roots, Louis, freed from Claudia's love and Lestat's tutorship, becomes the vampire his own way, finding catharsis through cinema. The deception in Louis' heart is nothing compared to the journalist who doesn't understand how Louis didn't measure the extent of his power. Louis' brutal reaction, grabbing him to the ceiling with his first monstrous shot is the noblest thing he ever did, sparing a life so it measures the true value of its mortality. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the journalist will probably have to learn the lesson the hard way, through Lestat and ... the infamous choice he never had ¬Ö."

","One of the better movies of the 90's, I remember really enjoying ""Interview with the Vampire"" in the theater,1994. It was extremely hyped at the time with a young Brad Pitt and Cruise in one of his better roles. Thankfully the movie holds on to a lot of what makes it entertaining and great over 17 years later now. Neil Jordan directed a stage-like performance and atmosphere complete with outstanding music, sets, and costuming backing up a devilishly good script apparent thanks to screenplay/author Anne Rice. It stands out imo as one of the best modern vampire movies made in the last 30 years. The leading actors are all enjoyable, and there's a satirical and witty look at the life and history of vampires - especially that of Louie - Brad Pitt's character, the narrator. While the ending might be a little bit hokey, the voyage of the movie easily makes up for it. Of note, Kirstin Dunst has several great scenes in her breakout role. Strongly Recommended"

Everyone who likes vampire movies and are not scared of horrifying scenes, that is the perfect movie. I could think of many movies that have just very fake vampires.

","Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is directed by Neil Jordan and written by Anne Rice (novel & screenplay). It stars Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Kirsten Dunst, Stephen Rea and Christian Slater. Music is by Elliot Goldenthal and cinematography by Philippe Rousselot.<br/><br/>Modern day San Francisco and reporter Daniel Malloy (Slater) is interviewing a man named Louis de Pointe du Lac, who claims to be a centuries old vampire¬Ö¬Ö..<br/><br/>Monstrous!<br/><br/>It's a completely different vampire movie! Certainly it's not conventional, this is told from the vampire's point of view, we the audience are observing the lifestyle of the undead, hey they have issues and angst too. It's a wonderfully dreamy, visually stunning, movie, the pace is, shall we say, sedate? And it's very rarely scary. However, it's a film that pays dividends on repeat viewings once there's an awareness of what type of film it is. This can be said of the casting as well, where two of Hollywood's then biggest stars, Cruise and Pitt, sprout fangs, wear make up, suck blood and ponce about like dandy fops. It's only really on repeat viewings that it proves to be astute casting, especially Cruise, who not only didn't have the trust of story creator Anne Rice, but many of his hardened fans were casting doubts on him playing such a role. Rice, upon viewing the finished film, and after wanting Julian Sands for the role of Lestat de Lioncourt, ate humble pie and wrote Cruise a letter of apology and praise of his performance.<br/><br/>I've drained you to the point of death. If I leave you here, you die. Or you can be young always, my friend, as we are now, but you must tell me: will you come or no?<br/><br/>Jordan was a great choice of director, his work on the fantasy/fairytale/nightmare that is The Company of Wolves made him the ideal choice. Here armed with about fifty five more million dollars! Jordan crafts a near homo-erotic tale and surrounds it with Gothic splendour. The money didn't just go on the cast, the set designs are sights for sore eyes, from period houses to underground catacombs, the production design is first rate and was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for Art Direction/Set Decoration (it lost out to The Madness of King George). As a story the film remains interesting because new characters are introduced into the undead world and that brings about in-fighting and shifts in tone. Thankfully the two most important characters in this factor get fine performances from the actors, firstly young Kirsten Dunst dominates her scenes like an old pro, no surprise that it would prove to be a career starter for her that shows no sign of coming to a close. And secondly is Antonio Banderas, who is utterly beguiling and elegant as the leader of a Paris vampire troupe. Elsewhere, Rea makes an effective top hatted vampire luvvy, and Slater (stepping in when River Phoenix sadly died) competently portrays the ""in awe"" reporter for the present day scenes.<br/><br/>The lavish visuals do tend to lend the film towards being style over substance, particularly as the film is 15/20 minutes too long. But it remains a fascinating flip-flop of a vampire movie, and one that's expertly acted as well. 8/10"

","As a fan of Anne Rice's novel I was worried that the movie was going to suck, especially when I heard that Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat and Brad Pitt as Louis. However, I was quite happily proved wrong. Tom Cruise had a brilliant portrayal of Lestat as a dark, reckless and even at times comedic character. Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas did well too, but I have special praise for Kirsten Dunst as Claudia. She was at once charmingly innocent, beautiful and spine-chillingly creepy. The two-hour run time was enough to tell the story in without it being rushed, and the costumes were quite good. My only complaint is that I didn't really like the makeup, it looked quite fake and like they had powder on their faces rather than being genuinely pale. However, all in all, Interview with the Vampire is well worth your time."

","Maybe the vampire life isn't all it's cracked up to be. The chance to live forever, that's a good deal right? But that deal comes, of course, with complications. Foremost among them being the need to kill. This is something Louis never really comes to grips with. Louis has been a vampire for 200 years. As we meet him, in modern-day San Francisco, he is about to tell his story to a reporter. And what a story it is. But it's a story tinged with melancholy and sadness. Some may embrace the vampire life. Louis though mourns the life he once had, the humanity he long ago lost.<br/><br/>It all began in Louisiana in 1791. Mourning the loss of his wife and newborn child Louis just wants to be put out of his misery, to die. Instead, when he crosses paths with the vampire Lestat, he is born to a new eternal life. And immediately regrets it. Lestat more or less embraces his vampire existence. Louis never does. He soon finds himself feeding on the blood of rats. Better that Louis thinks than taking human life. But eventually Louis will have to accept what it is that he has become. He may accept it but he doesn't have to like it. This is one morose vampire. Perhaps what he needs is a companion to shake him from his doldrums. So Lestat gives him one. A child, Claudia. A young girl turned vampire. Louis loves Claudia and protects her. Not that she initially seems to need much in the way of protection. This girl's a killer, she loves the taste of blood. But what happens when she realizes she will never grow old? Will she accept her eternal childhood? No, she will not. And the ramifications for the happy little vampire family of Lestat, Louis and Claudia will be severe.<br/><br/>This is a movie with a dark, gloomy feel to it. Necessarily the story unfolds entirely in the nighttime which only adds to the foreboding darkness. The vampire life we see here is anything but glamorous. As modern-day Louis tells his centuries-long story it is obvious he does not feel he really lives. He simply survives. When he had Claudia to love things were better but that story never seemed destined for a happy ending. Ultimately Louis is a lonely man, walking the Earth, feeding on those who cross his path and cursing the dark ""gift"" he was given. Brad Pitt does an excellent job in the role of Louis, capturing all the melancholy, the weight of 200 dark years. As Lestat, Tom Cruise gets a much more flamboyant part to play and he does very well with it, taking the opportunity to chew some scenery but also doing some notably fine acting. Antonio Banderas, who pops up as a mysterious figure late in the proceedings, and Christian Slater, playing the reporter to whom Louis unburdens himself, both turn in good performances. With all the gloominess the film could use a lighter touch here and there and Stephen Rea plays a character who provides a few fleeting moments of levity. But there's a darkness in that character too. The vampire life is not one of fun and games. Perhaps the best performance in the film comes from young Kirsten Dunst playing Claudia. She's a real scene-stealer. Claudia's a woman, with decades of life experiences, trapped in a child's body. She has a maturity which belies her appearance and the actress playing that part had to show that same quality of maturity beyond her years. Dunst does so wonderfully. There's a lot of life that has been lived behind Claudia's young eyes and Dunst captures the essence of the eternal child perfectly. But as good as Dunst and Cruise and all the rest may be it's really Pitt's movie to carry. This is Louis's story. And it will prove to be a rather fascinating story indeed. Louis may not embrace his vampire life but you can definitely embrace this very entertaining movie."

","I could never get on with Anne Rice's novels, but I quite enjoyed this film adaptation. It takes a leisurely approach towards relating the events of Louis (Brad Pitt)'s life (or, rather, un-life) from the time he is vampirised in 1800s Lousiana to the present day, as related to scribe Christian Bale.<br/><br/>Central to this is Lestat (Tom Cruise) the louche vampire who sets Louis on his path, and pops up from time to time over the years. Tom Cruise's casting, so far out of type, was a sensation at the time, but he is very good. However, he is not the only one - Antonio Banderas, Stephen Rea and, especially, 11 year old Kirsten Dunst in her breakthrough role are all excellent, too.<br/><br/>There is sufficient horror for horror fans, but this is essentially a character piece. The plot is a straightforward linear narrative, simply recounting the episodes in Louis' life. The film is handsomely mounted with some well-staged set pieces but comes perilously close to outstaying its welcome - perhaps it is slightly more leisurely than it needs to be."

Yet once I started watching I simply could not stop. <br/><br/>Interview With The Vampire is not the predigested teeniebopper Buffy The Vampire Slayer fare. Or even True Blood.

","Since 1976, Anne Rice has kept us wrapped in a world of vampires, and now in 1994 she brings her creations to life. From the director of 'The Crying Game', Neil Jordan, assists Rice as they spin the life story of Louis De Pointe Du Lac, a French-Louisiana aristocrat in the year 1791, his vampire maker and companion Lestat De Lioncourt and their ""daughter"", a child vampire by the name of Claudia.<br/><br/>The film starts in modern-day San Francisco, where a reporter is seated, talking to a shadowed figure that is standing by the window. The figure, we quickly learn, is Louis De Pointe Du Lac, a 200-year old vampire. Louis wishes to tell the story of his life to the reporter, Daniel Malloy. With Louis' introduction, he begins his tale. Pulling Daniel and us into the decadent world that is Louis' way of life.<br/><br/>Throughout the film we are arrested by an array of stunning sets, beautiful costumes, and ravishing actors. Tom Cruise is Lestat De Lioncourt, a French aristocrat, and an arrogant and ruthless vampire. Brad Pitt embodies the emotional and conflicted Louis, while Kirsten Dunst attacks us with her ability to play a child and then an adult trapped within a child's body as Claudia. Antonio Banderas jumps onto the scene as a vampire coven leader that threatens Claudia's very way of life, whose beauty and youth chill Claudia's already cold heart. And Christian Slater not only plays the role of young Daniel Malloy, but he is also our pathway into this underground world of terror, death and even love.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt brings the emotional Louis to life. Pitt expresses Louis' loves, hatred, and pains perfectly. Louis is a man of gestures more than words, instead of yelling at Lestat that he hates him, he glares at him or gives him a cold look. Pitt perfects all of Louis' traits.<br/><br/>Called the ""Brat Prince"" and for a good reason. Lestat is a vampire that pretends to be all knowing, when in fact looks more to his creation Louis for answers then explaining things himself. Tom Cruise brings Lestat's superiority to fruition without losing Lestat's inner loathing. Cruise never looses Lestat's arrogant air, even when he's torn between loving and hating Claudia. <br/><br/>The ""Demon Child from Hell"" is an excellent title for this pint-sized terror. Kirsten Dunst rocks the scene as the child that will never grow up physically, eternally imprisoned. Dunst balances the swirl of girlhood to womanhood, expressing beautifully how Claudia grows from loving Louis and Lestat blindly as her parents, to falling in love with the ever-brooding Louis. Arrogance, Claudia radiates with the same arrogant air that Lestat holds, both using it to pretend that they know more than they truly do. Dunst is not only acceptable, but, like Cruise is perfect as this blonde terror. The vampire ""family"" could not have been better cast.<br/><br/>Known to fans as the ""Botticelli Angel"". Armand is an age-old vampire that scares Claudia because even though he is young, he still is older then her. Antonio Banderas personifies the knowledgeable vampire coven leader. Bringing Armand's knowledge and beauty to the forefront of the stage. Armand makes Louis forget about Claudia for the sole reason of knowledge. Armand is the breaking point for Claudia, for even though she hates and fears Lestat, she wishes to have him back¬ótormenting her¬órather than to have Louis fall in love with Armand and leave her. But, he is no where near the actual age range, for me as a fan of the books,this is completely unacceptable. However, as a whole, I also love the movie.<br/><br/>Interview is essentially a tragic love story, with every character playing a domino-effect role. Not only playing their part, but becoming it; sweeping not only the audience away, but also themselves into the decadent and dangerous world of the vampire and Lestat's ""One happy family"". This movie is a must see for any Anne Rice fan, or any fan of the vampire occult."

","Whenever comes the time where a novel is made into a film, I would find it helpful to actually READ the novel before criticizing the movie. Personally, I think the film did an OK job. I do not expect many films to portray the essence of the novel it is based on, if that is the case. One must take into regard the fact that this IS based on a novel, and no one on this Earth can portray Monsieur de Lioncourt EXACTLY how he is in the novel. Cruise did well in getting Lestat's dark humor, his ferocity, and all the other things that make Lestat, Lestat. To those who thought this movie was boring, one must take into account that these vampires are not the mindless, bloodsucking, otherwise stereotypical ones we know of. Anne Rice has given her vampires a mind, a humanity AND an answer to all those questions our stereotypical vampire stories/movies fails to answer. What IS it like to possess immortality? To see everything change around you while you remain the same? To never feel pain, to never see or feel the warmth of the sun? To have to kill another just for you to live yourself? This is what the novel and the movie (to an extent) provides. I pity those who rate the movie badly because they find it boring, or dull, or they don't understand it. READ the novel, THINK about it. But anyway, I give this movie an 8. It is quite good, however, of course, it does not portray the intensity and complexity of the novel itself."

","OK..I am a Rice fan, and a huge fan of the novels. I have nearly all of them memorized. And you are also correct in saying Kirsten Dunst WAS Claudia..she crushed this role. The rest of the cast acted well, they just lacked any physical resemblance to the characters in the books, I can forgive that.<br/><br/>I do however have to take you to task for saying this movie lacked depth, and as such was just the story of a vampires life. Did you not pick up on the irony Louis endures? When faced with death, he's offered immortality, he accepts like 99% of people would, only to find his new immortal life is even more miserable than the one he was about to leave. He must kill to live yet with every killing he wants to die himself, only that is damn near impossible now. Granted the film didn't outwardly show this as a conflict, if you had read the book you'd know that was vitally important to the story of that book as well as subsequent books.<br/><br/>Also, the creation of Claudia is a sub-plot, that has more bearing on the entire Vampire Chronicle series than anything else in that story. Claudia and the defiant creation of Claudia bears importance all the way to the newest book of the series. Again you would have had to read the books for that to mean anything more than what the film portrays...<br/><br/>Had you read the book you would have also known exactly why Armand and his band lived as they did, where they did, and who was really behind their ""revenge"" and eventual death sentence to Claudia..all of this adds up to a film that was deep without appearing deep, because the depth comes later. Anne Rice wrote the books much like Quinton Tarrantino directs movies, not in chronological order..Interveiw, takes place in the 80's and tells a story 200 years in the making...Yet in later books she goes back over 6000 years and gives the complete synopsis of dozens of characters, leading up to Louis and his ""interveiw"" they also tie all that together allowing you to ""know"" why louis is the way he is, and why Claudia was significant..<br/><br/>By the way, I found interest in the series after seeing the movie first, and even having never read any of the books previous to the movie, I could tell there were reasons behind everything. That was what drew me to the books was because I wanted to know the ""why"" of it. In hindsight, I think the screenplay was written like that on purpose. Anne Rice helped write it after all.<br/><br/>You aren't a Rice fan or a fan of the chronicle series, so forgive me for my bluntness when I say you aren't the one who should review this movie. Instead of looking for a ""self contained summary on the meaning of life""..look at this movie as chapter one of nine.<br/><br/>This movie was light years ahead of the next movie Queen of the damned, which IS the Hollywood glitz-fest written by idiots for idiots..."

","Neil Jordan's movie-version of Anne Rice's celebrated novel, which she adapted for the screen, might have skirted disaster with boyish, all-American Tom Cruise cast as the cunning vampire Lestat de Lioncourt. But Cruise acquits himself admirably in the role: not a towering figure of evil, nor even a dark, imposing force, Cruise's Lestat is a devious trickster, a child-demon, and this sort of wicked decadence works well for Cruise. In 1790's New Orleans, a young widower (Brad Pitt) is picked by Lestat as a companion of sorts (it's never made clear, but apparently vampires feel the need to pass on to others what was initially done to them); bitten twice, Pitt's Louis is given the choice to die or to go on as part of the undead. Though the film is handsome and well-wrought, with mordant passages of dark humor and blood-soaked, cringe-worthy carnage, it does exist on mostly one note (which extends through to the tepid finale). The hunt for human victims can only stretch so far before the picture falls into a wryly bleak, downtrodden rut (these are not foppish or cackling vampires by any means). As Louis, Pitt doesn't fare quite as well as Cruise; playing a morally grounded man who chased death and got captured, Pitt's good ol' boy persona isn't completely overshadowed, and his shallow qualities as an actor in general don't quite mesh with this more-or-less complicated character. Cruise, however, is surprisingly nimble and skilled; his angular frame has seldom been this graceful, and he manages to make Lestat a lithe, sensuous prankster. **1/2 from ****"

"Movie-12","5","4","17","17 April 2001"," Good ideas, an interesting and effective point of view, and nice direction by Neil Jordan, but never really takes of with the material. We expect much more for such great filmmakers. ** (out of of four)
","INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE / (1994) ** (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>""Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice I never had"" Lestat de Lioncourt <br/><br/>	The dialogue, used several times throughout Neil Jordan's ""Interview with the Vampire,"" comes from the lips of a vampire hundreds of years old. His name is Lestat de Lioncourt, played with the right attitude and mood by Tom Cruise. He explains to a suicidal Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), that he can either spend the rest of eternity as a bloodsucker, or meet a dreadful demise. Louis chooses to become a vampire. That is the setup for this stylish, well acted, but lackluster drama from the popular novel by Anne Rice, who also provided the film with its screenplay.<br/><br/>	The movie is a personal narrative of Louis, but Anne Rice believes it to take a point of view from the audience's perspective. I disagree. Louis is the storyteller here, and I do not think it could be any clearer from whom the story is coming-it is the right angle for the material. The plot is told through the conducting of an interview by a simple-minded reporter (Christian Slater) interested in Louis's complex and intriguing background. ""I'm flesh and blood, but not human,"" explains Louis, ""I haven't been human for two hundred years.""<br/><br/>	He tells a story of passion, fear, love, death, desire, and need. His history begins in New Orleans during the late 1700's, where he lost his family and lives a life of grief and depression. Louis becomes a vampire after an encounter with Lestat, who wants a similar companion to spend his endless days with. ""That morning I was not yet a vampire, and I saw my last sunrise. I remember it completely, and yet I can't recall any sunrise before it. I watched its whole magnificence for the last time as if it were the first. And then I said farewell to sun light, and set out to become what I became,"" elucidates Louis in one of the movie's most revealing and understood scenes. <br/><br/>	 There are several key characters who play tribute to the long, continuing life of Louis. There is the child vampire, played uncomfortably by a 12-year old Kirsten Dunst, whom Louis grows to love like a sister-or lover. Dunst is unmistakably miscast in her role, giving her character an annoying, insecure mood. She is simply too young to realize the intensities and requirements of her character. The movie becomes even more unconvincing when several other vampires in Paris, including Armand (Antonio Banderas) and Santiago (Stephen Rea), explain to Louis that he is part of an international secret society.<br/><br/>
	Neither Jordan nor Rice make the life of a vampire look<br/><br/>particularly joyous. That is the point of the movie, to demonstrate that excepting a once in an eternity gift may turn out to be a never ending hell. Throughout the story, many characters beg for the gift of vampirism, but they do not understand the consequences of their desires. ""Interview with the Vampire"" captures the ceaseless sadness of being a vampire; we realize their gift is unintrusive, but the other characters covet it like nothing else. <br/><br/>	The movie's success is in its appearance by cinematographer Phillipe Rousselot and production designer Dante Ferretti. They create a moody, atmospheric world for the characters. Much can also be said about the scenes in which the vampires feast on the blood of their victims. Jordan focuses the camera on the eye of the attacking vampire. The film presents the moment of attack as suspecting, but at the same time, tantalizing because of the indulging satisfaction and the perfect timing. <br/><br/>	Several factors of the film are peculiarly vulnerable to logic. Due to the geographical location for the area, the sun can never be directly above Paris. But during one of he film's most important scenes, that takes place at the bottom of a well, the entire floor is directly illuminated. And what about the final confrontation between Louis and Lestat-it's meaningless and brief. Are we really supposed to believe the scene would be this short lived, lacking any kind of imagination or curiosity? It is made clear several times that vampires are immortal, but when one drinks ""dead blood"" it appears as if he meets a graphic decease. If they can die, wouldn't the massive consuming fire have finished him off? Either way, the plot requires the vampire to appear again later in the movie, so he does.<br/><br/>
	 The film's mood also gets in the way. We just get the same style repeated over and over. A lot of the dialogue is right on the money, but even more of it feels contrived and simulated. After a while-a short while-the movie becomes down right boring, to the extent where I simply stopped caring about the characters altogether. ""Interview with a Vampire"" also makes the often misunderstood blunder, which I never grow tired of explaining, in which the filmmakers attempt to blend surreal fantasy with reality. If a movie is intended to be fiction, stay with the fiction. Do not try to rationalize the concepts of the unreal with the real. It just does not blend well. ""Interview with the Vampire"" just doesn't know where to draw the line between realism and fable.<br/><br/>	 Neil Jordan is a very talented director, and has not made a bad movie with ""Interview with the Vampire,"" just a misunderstood one. He does no wrong here. Maybe it is Anne Rice's novel, in which I never read. Various things make the potentially intriguing material go awry, and ""Interview with the Vampire"" is a major disappointment. We expect so much more from such a prestigious cast and talented filmmakers, but the only real accomplishment they achieve is coming up with a creative point of view for an otherwise campy production."

Lestat's complex persona is all there: mercurial, expansive, narcissistic, often cruel and, for all his fledglings cared to see, also shallow, amoral and even unwise -except when, surprisingly, he chose not to be.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does a good job as the brooding, often distressed Louis, but on occasion he lets affectation creep into his performance -oddly, to make the rather unnecessary point of being otherworldly. Kirsten Dunst, all of 10, portrays the mind of a woman in her 70s even more realistically than the 5 years old child she starts as. As for Banderas, I don't care that he looked too old (Armand's origins aren't explored here, so there's no need to stick to that detail). What he's asked to do -a 400 years old vampire who's ultimately far needier than those who seek him-, he does it well. Stephen Rea was the only one I really didn't like -a pity, as I like the actor a lot, but his performance was so over the top, it came across as clownish and dumb; plus, no offense, but amidst a cast of almost uniformly gorgeous people, he stood out like a sore.<br/><br/>The production values are top-notch, from the cinematography to the decoration and effects, the music immediately establishing the eerie mood. The vampire makeup is excellent -one thing I noticed is that, despite the heavy use of contact lenses, hardly ever do you notice the awkward ""cross-eyed"" effect when these displace; they must've taken great care to avoid this."

","For better or worse Anne Rice has redefined what a vampire is in movies and literature. Before there was the Twilight saga there was Anne writing her novels and seeing Interview With A Vampire we see that vampire now means Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. No longer is it Bela Lugosi with his continental suaveness and Hungarian accent. <br/><br/>But Cruise and Pitt are just as deadly, maybe more so. The film is exactly what it says. Journalist Christian Slater has tracked down Brad Pitt whom he interviews. Pitt tells him about his afterlife as a vampire dating from colonial New Orleans with a few highlights in New Orleans and Paris where he settled in the Third Republic years. There's also young Kirsten Dunst who masters a most difficult role as a child vampire. She's matured, but rather strangely.<br/><br/>The homoeroticism sticks out all over this film especially with Cruise and Pitt when Cruise takes that bite and initiates him into the vampire existence.

This is probably one of, if not, my favoured roles that I have seen him in and I think that it was a great break from every other(action, action, action) role I have seen him in. I was very impressed by his acting and would definitely recommend that you watch it if you are a Tom Cruise fan. Now I did find it frustrating at times, mainly with Kirsten Dunst's character, actually it might be entirely her character but that's just me. I mean there is always at least one character that you aren't a fan of because there needs to be some sort of a bad guy even if the antagonist is likable. Oh and I'm not saying of she is or isn't a bad guy I'm just giving some perspective or whatever. I'm not really sure about what I have in terms of an opinion when it comes to Brad Pitt in this movie other than I never noticed how big his lips were until I saw him in this role or that he does look kinda feminine at a younger age, it may just be the haircut though. Again, this is only my opinion so you may not agree with it once you've seen the movie."

","Interview with the Vampire (1994)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>The vampire Louis (Brad Pitt) asks a reporter (Christian Slater) to meet him so that he can tell his life story. He traces back two centuries to when he was a suicidal man who was given another way of life by the vampire Lestat (Tom Cruise).<br/><br/>INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE was, believe it or not, quite controversial when it was first released due to how much graphic violence and blood there was but also because author and screenwriter Ann Rice objected to someone like Tom Cruise playing the lead role. By this time Cruise was already a movie star so I guess you can understand why she worried the film would be watered down or hurt with such a star being in it but it's funny to see that without him the movie would have been much less than what it is. Director Neil Jordan brings a European flavor to the movie but there are certainly several flaws here that keep it from being a great movie or even a really good vampire movie.<br/><br/>As for the pluses, there are quite a few including the before mentioned European feel of the picture. Jordan was coming off THE CRYING GAME so it was a good choice to bring him on to director as he managed to create a very dark atmosphere and he also manages to handle some of the black comedy quite well. He also managed to bring a certain style to the picture that set it apart from a lot of the Hollywood pictures out at the time. With that said, I think the film didn't quite go far enough in many aspects. I haven't read the story to know what is different here but I just felt that a lot of the sexuality and some of the darker moments had been tamed. If the darker elements weren't in the book then I think they would have helped this film.<br/><br/>It's funny that Rice didn't want Cruise in the picture but the weakest portion of the film comes towards the end when he's not in it. I thought Cruise did an exceptionally good job here and I really liked the way he played pure evil. The Lestat character is basically just a killing machine and I thought Cruise made you believe that he really was a member of the living dead and someone who has seen centuries of history. Pitt is also extremely good as he brings a sympathetic touch to the character that puts him at a complete opposite of Lestat. Then you've got Kirsten Dunst who is very good as the young girl who gets transformed into a vampire and also good are Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea. Slater is also good in his role but you can't help but feel River Phoenix would have been much better.<br/><br/>INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE isn't a flawless movie as it certainly drags in spots and the 123-minute running time probably could have been trimmed by fifteen minutes or so. I'd also say that the screenplay is pretty much long-winded and at times it seems like it should have been edited down and just had a tighter story to be told. Still, the film manages to have a lot of good things in it and is worth watching."

","The story nicely portrays what is it that makes a vampire story good, a desire to keep being human. Surely a story about vampires being vampires, feeding and killing every night, would be one dull and boring story. The movie makes it even better as it stayed true to the more common mythologies by keeping the most of the duration to the night, maintaining the sad and anxious mood, and providing great location settings. What noticeable is that this movie contains much of the mythological inspirations focused in other more recent vampire stories such as the Twilight saga and Let Me In, particularly about the child vampires. The acting overall is indeed great. Brad Pitt nicely depicted the lingering human emotion in a vampire. Tom Cruise succeeded in depicting the annoying vampire that keeps on pushing Louie to his emotional limit. Antonio Banderas and Kristen Dunst adds the movie with strong performances also."

He wants to die and Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) answers his wish. Yvette (Thandie Newton) is Louis' favorite slave whose killing is the final act before he sets the plantation on fire. Louis refuses human blood until he finds young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) living besides her dead mother. After Louis has a taste, Lestat converts her to a vampire.<br/><br/>Were we ever so easily swayed by the simple promise of sexy vampires? Apparently we were. Of course, there is more to this than the two sex symbols of the time; Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt. Director Neil Jordan is able to bring Anne Rice's Gothic sense to the big screen. It is beautifully shot and expertly crafted. However it doesn't drive. At least, the plot isn't very hard driving. This is a ponderous affair. The movie already shows that Louis exists at the end so he doesn't have the tension of danger. The story plods along but it does so beautifully. It's also quite a nice introduction to Kirsten Dunst.

","Unfortunately, the story, adapted by Anne Rice from her best-selling novel, sucks at the neck a little too long. A 23-minute snipping from this 123-minute movie would have done wonders. And there's at least one other problem. Fans of the book may be divided on Rice's screenplay, which dispenses with many minor characters, introduces ""The Addams Family""-style one-liners and significantly alters the ending. But they're bound to be uniformly upset about the casting of Tom Cruise. In the crucial role of the vampire Lestat, his performance pulsates with that hyper- motivated pep many find appealing, but he just ain't The One. Picture ""Blade Runner"" replicant Rutger Hauer, picture Nazi commandant Ralph Fiennes, picture really big guy John Goodman before you picture Cruise.<br/><br/>As the movie opens, Christian Slater, the interviewer of the title, is waiting for stranger Brad Pitt 'the vampire' to recount his life story. For the first time since they've met on this dark night, Slater sees Pitt's face in the light. His protruding veins, scary blue eyes and pale skin prove he's the real thing. Pitt then tells a long saga, which starts in 1791 in Louisiana and which involves dealings with his archenemy Cruise‚Äîthe one who initiated him into the undead family; a young vampire-girl (Kirsten Dunst), whom Pitt brought into vampirehood; and Euro-vamps Stephen Rea and Antonio Banderas, who introduced Pitt to a bigger world of the damned.<br/><br/>""Interview"" saves its better stuff for first, particularly as Pitt‚Äîafter Cruise turns him into a night creature undergoes on the job training.

She screams bloody murder. Director Jordan, who made ""The Crying Game,"" misses no opportunity to interlace eroticism and horror. When he's on the prowl, Cruise likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance. With alarming swiftness, the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror, as Cruise's murderous purpose becomes clear.<br/><br/>The humor, more subtly embedded in the book, has been brought to the surface as if this were a weekly sitcom called ""Pardon Me but Your Teeth Are in My Neck."" When Dunst becomes a vampire, she becomes precociously murderous, killing willy-nilly like a child with too much power. Cruise and Pitt follow her around like perpetually carping parents. At one point, she kills her piano teacher right in front of the piano.<br/><br/>""Claudia,"" says Cruise. ""What have we told you?""<br/><br/>""Never in the house,"" says Dunst.<br/><br/>Scenes like this will undoubtedly play well with audiences, but they also mark the beginning of the creative end. Does this comic material flow organically from the novel or is it being milked for cuteness? It is from this point approximately the middle of the picture that the movie's energy starts to drain like blood from a vampire's victim. You'll feel that ebb, sooner or later, as you begin to glance regularly at your watch."
"annc1","9","1","2","7 October 2010"," The ultimate vampire movie
","I first watched Interview with the Vampire some years ago and have seen it again recently. I find it a very gripping and atmospheric film with a haunting music score and an excellent script. All the actors give fine performances. I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, but think his betrayal of Lestat was brilliant, by far the best I have ever seen him. Brad Pitt as Louis, while good, did irritate occasionally, for example, in his final scene with Armand his continuous monotone became wearisome. Kirsten Dunst also put in an exceptional performance as Claudia the child vampire. <br/><br/>Although I have never read the book on which the film was based, I understand the portrayal of Armand by Antonio Banderas was contrary to his description in the book. I have read however, that the director Neil Jordan stated that this was because of the sexual undertones between Louis and Armand. With there already being undertones between Louis and Claudia, Jordan felt that an older Armand would be preferable. That having been said I think that Banderas turned in a captivating performance and truly conveyed a vampire that was ""powerful, beautiful and without regret"".<br/><br/>You can keep the Twilights and New Moons etc. ‚Äì this is THE vampire movie!"

","I think this movie is great and have been a great performance by all the actors, specially by tom cruise... He show us what he can do... Congratulations to him. The cast is great and combine all type of actors... I recommended to everyone to see this movie... you would love it. i have heard about Anne Rice (the writer of the novel), was concern about the performance of Tom Cruise as Lestat of Lioncourt, the villain... but i think that his doubt was clear and without effect after seen the excellent performance he had made of this character. All the actors has a merit in this movie, because all of them play them well their role and very important, they knew how to play it without intention of standing out. Great Movie, Excellent Casting"
"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","2","15 July 2006"," The most realistic vampire movie ever made.
","It of course sounds like a silly statement, calling this movie the most realistic vampire ever made, since its very safe to assume that vampires never really excited at all. But that's not what I mean by calling this movie realistic. I mean that it's detailed, it concentrates on the issues what it means to be a vampire, what will it do to you, what's the purpose, how to handle the immortality etcetera. It's far from your average every day vampire movie. It's stylish, detailed and full of deeper meanings and therefor provides us a realistic view at what it means to be a vampire.<br/><br/>The movie tells the epic tale of the vampire Louis (Brad Pitt). A vampire who still has a sense of decency and remorse, much to the annoyance of his 'maker' Lestat (Tom Cruise). Louis is full of questions by which he is torn- and that he wants answered. What follows is a realistic view in the world of vampires. It takes us to the sensual, almost erotic like, world of vampires but also shows us the dark and less pleasant side of the vampire world.<br/><br/>Above all ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" is a very stylish made movie. The movie looks beautiful with nice looking sets and period costumes. Despite being full of deeper meanings and long, poetic like conversations, it yet still always manages to be interesting, as well as at times exciting. <br/><br/>What makes the story definitely work are the fine actors that portray the characters. We see Tom Cruise in a role we don't see him often enough in; that of a villainous character. He plays his character with style and delivers an unforgettable performance. He makes the character Lestat one of the best and most memorable vampires, next to father of all vampire. Dracula himself. I'm quite surprised that he didn't even got an Oscar-nod at least for his role. Also impressive was Kirsten Dunst in an early role. Also she, plays one of her best roles out of her career, at the age of 12. Other fine well known actors in this movie are Brad Pitt, Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea, who is a very underrated and underused actor in my opinion.<br/><br/>The beautiful Oscar nominated music is from Elliot Goldenthal, who unfortunately doesn't that often compose more scores like this one.<br/><br/>A vampire movie that doesn't concentrate on the formulaic stereotypical vampire movie elements but instead chooses a realistic approach with deeper meanings. Stylish movie with great performances, that is a must-see for every vampire fan.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","This is an excellent adaption for the most part, that's very engrossing and well made, with incredible performances, only problem is the mid section is draggy. All the characters are brilliant, and the story is wonderful, plus Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Kirsten Dunst are all simply incredible in this!. I absolutely loved the ending as it put a big grin on my face, and I have to say Dunst stole some scenes from her co stars! plus Cruise and Pitt had excellent chemistry together. I Haven't read the book, but I really enjoyed this movie, and the set pieces were so incredible, plus all the costumes were so wonderful and lavish looking!. It's extremely well made and written, and everyone was perfectly casted in my opinion, plus it's also very bloody and violent at times too. It's often very suspenseful, and I loved Cruise's makeup as well, plus the scene where they abduct Luis, and Claudia is very disturbing and freaky. I loved the atmosphere it had as well, and I also loved the dialog as well, plus the music was great. This is an excellent adaption for the most part, that's very engrossing and well made, with incredible performances, only problem is the mid section is draggy, still I say it's a must see for everyone!. The Direction is wonderful! for the most part!. Neil Jordan does a wonderful! Job here for the most part, with brilliant camera work, excellent angles, adding some great atmosphere, using great set pieces, lavish costumes everything about it was just perfect, just the mid section was the only problem. The Acting is incredible!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, he truly is Lestat, I am huge Cruise fan, but even I myself questioned the casting of him, boy did he prove me wrong in a big way, he had the arrogance,cockiness down just perfect, I also loved his dialog, and he seemed to have have a blast playing the role, he gave another top notch performance(Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Brad Pitt is also incredible here, I'm not a huge fan but he really impressed m here, he just had this sadness about him, he was also vulnerable, lonely, and intense, him and Cruise had some very powerful scenes together, and considering bot there star power, I was impressed how well they worked together, Pitt was a big reason why this film was so successful!. Kirsten Dunst is also incredible here, she steals many scenes from her co stars, and was very intense, this is quite possibly the best performance I have seen her give, I loved her!. Antonio Banderas is charming as usual and did fine as Armand, I really liked him. Christian Slater is amazing as always and is amazing here, he didn't have a whole lot of screen time as the Interviewer but was brilliant when on, he brought his usual charisma, and I thought he rocked! (Slater Rules!!!!!!!). Thandie Newton has a small role here and did OK. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5"

","I love Anne Rice's vampire chronicles and the character I really love is Louis. I couldn't wait to see Brad as Louis and I new I wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't. Brad was beautiful, just as Louis is portrayed by Anne in her novel.<br/><br/>I'm not fond of Tom Cruise and personally don't believe he's a good actor but to give him his due, he was a natural Lestat and portrayed the character wonderfully. This is the only Cruise film I like and I don't watch it for Cruise but for Brad/Louis whom I adore.<br/><br/>Brad just gets better and better and when you know this is an earlier film for him you realize what a great actor he is.<br/><br/>Interview was/is a very good movie and considering how hard it is to bring a novel to film, especially in this genre, I think the cast and crew did a great job and deserve a 10.<br/><br/>I'll keep watching this over and over again!"
"HetzerA","10","1","2","30 December 2005"," Movie Well Done
","Considering the fact that this was a movie, and no audience has the time to sit through the film version of a novel the entire way through, the director followed the book very closely. The biggest problem I had with it however, which gets under my skin every time that I see the movie, is the portrayal of Armand. Rice describes him very carefully as a red haired, beautiful, young man with the face of a child. Antonio Banderis, regardless of his skillful acting in the movie, would not be my first choice. I believe that an actor should have been chosen whose face one could fall on love with at first sight. Otherwise, I agree with the liberation that the director has taken with the story. The poetic licensing taken with the end of the flick fits within the persona of the character and would be an expected event. The movie takes on the mood of the novel and portrays Rice's character's beautifully. The movie even goes in deeper than the surface of the storyline to go into the battle between the existential and the post-existential of the book's characters Lestat and Louis. One would nearly not have to even read the novel to be able to understand the undercurrents of the story and the characters oh so well, which of course however is not recommended."

","This one is one of my favorites , not only favorite vampire movie but also one on the best movie I 've ever seen. Mostly because of the acting. Brad Pitt Tom Cruise and Banderas come together, it ain't surprise that there would be some great character to character duels. I especially loved Tom Cruise who I thought not to be suitable for a role like this. He proved me wrong, he's the best one in this film, his speeches and scenes in this movie (like dancing with that corpse) I'll alway remember. I like to come back to see these movie every once in a while to see the greatness of the acting, the mood the film has, the way it makes you feel. Even for those who generally don't like vampire stories this is worth seeing."
"oskhen","8","1","2","4 December 2005"," A magnificent drama, but not much of a horror movie.
","The biggest problem i've got with this film is that it is obviously considered by many, for instance by the comments in the newspapers, as a horror movie. That's bullshit. It almost (if only almost) as much horror movie as, say, Lord of the Rings, where there also are some exciting part where people are killed by supernatural beings. Is that what is required to put a movie in that genre?<br/><br/>No, its not much horror in it, but as a drama, its wonderful. It's definitely one of my favourite movies with a content that I find unusually deep, at least for Hollywood, it's looking good and most of the actors are superb, save Antonio Banderas. I don't know if he's too old, since I've never read the book, but his acting is all too unrealistic.<br/><br/>Since so many dislike Cruise, I must only say that I think his doing a fantastic job. That man has just grown in my eyes during the years, and this is one of his greatest roles ever. By the way; the makeup on the guy is so good that I didn't recognize him the first time I saw the movie. In fact someone had to tell it to me, and I hardly believed it. Perhaps mainly because of the colour of his hair and eyebrows. That little lass is a children-actor (don't know if that's a word, but I hope you understand it) I have only seen the like of in the sixth sense. The rest of the actors are also good.<br/><br/>One the best things with this movie is that it feels so realistic; it makes you feel that this is how it must be to be a vampire; the problems, the feelings, etc.. <br/><br/>Somebody obviously thinks this movie is stupid and ridiculous. I only agree on that on one, and only one, single detail: the coffins. Why the heck are they sleeping in coffins for? Why don't they just have the bed in a basement without windows or something? Yeah, I know vampires, at least in Dracula, have to sleep on the earth of their homeland, but I don't remember that's a topic in the movie. And there are so many other traditions they are breaking, so...<br/><br/>Well, that's a detail. The movie is good, beautiful, in fact. It's one of the most beautiful movies I know, with a mood throughout the whole thing that is quite unique. OK, I admit that it might be a bit boring at times, a bit too slow, but that's is on the other hand necessary - to a certain degree. This movie couldn't handle much more speed.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend it, but don't expect very much horror. Maybe that's why some are disappointed; they expectations were not fulfilled."
"AZINDN","6","1","2","19 November 2005"," Best Looking Vampire Cast Ever
","Neil Jordan's interpretation of Anne Rice's initial novel, Interview With the Vampire, the first of the Vampire Chronicles stories is noted for having the most beautiful lineup of males with fangs. Casting Brad Pitt as Louis, Antonio Bandaras as Armand, and over the top as always, Tom Cruise as Lestat, this group of male beauties is the deadly trio who toy with the child-vampire, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) to her ultimate demise.<br/><br/>An uneasy novel when it was first released in the mid-70s, the translation to film was almost a generation in development before reaching the public. First choice for casting of Lestat as Anne Rice noted was Rutger Hauer and later, Sting, however, by the time the film hit the screen, both actors were too old and the part went to Cruise, much to Rice's initial disapproval. However, as Cruise grew into his fangs and no doubt, on Rice, she changed her mind about the actor. His Lestat is outrageous if only as a foil for Pitts bottled up Louis, the reluctant member of the trio. While Lestat and Claudia enjoy the human hunt for victims to sustain their lives, Louis is never comfortable nor as delighted with his fate as a hunter of blood. His torment after 2 hours is to shout, ""Enough, get over yourself, Louis."" <br/><br/>While a fan of vampire film and of male eye candy, Interview with the Vampire is never in the same league with the novel and can not be compared with the moody and sexually overt, Frank Langella performance as Dracula (1979). This is another kind of vampire story, an oral history of sorts with Pitt in a one-man monologue. Costumes and sets are appropriate, but, in total, the film is flat despite the attention to details, if fails to satisfy, perhaps because the overload of testosterone on screen never has sufficient acting chops to pull off the fantasy and romanticism of the lore of the undead."
"TC-Batsy","10","1","2","31 October 2005"," For Those Who Like Vampires
","Interview with the Vampire is an excellent horror movie that sheds light on the emotional and humane aspects of a vampire who is disdainful of his powerful nature to hunt down and kill mortals for their blood in order to survive. While living in New Orleans in the year 1791, Louis, the wealthy owner of a plantation encounters an attractive French vampire named Lestat who understands his desire to end his miserable life after the loss of his wife. In exchange, he must become a vampire so he can live for eternity. Lestat doesn't feel any kind of remorse when he kills people including ""evil doers"", unlike Louis who prefers to feed on rats and other animals instead of taking lives. Things take a different turn when he finds Claudia and accidentally feeds on her which causes his maker to turn this young girl into one of their kind and keep her as their loving daughter. The tormenting questions that Louis and Claudia have always been asking during these long years are: what is the cause of their nature? Why can't they change as the years progress? All these seem to bother and anger Lestat who withholds information from them, which prompts Claudia to plot his death so she and Louis can escape and find other vampires in Europe and other parts of the world. Neil Jordan and Anne Rice deserved so much credit for presenting this great novel to the big screen, as well as Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea for their outstanding performances which were set in San Francisco, New Orleans and Paris."
"philip_vanderveken","7","1","2","21 June 2005"," One of the better vampire movies
","Vampires have always been a welcome subject for Hollywood. It has inspired many producers, writers and directors, but not everyone of them has done a very good job with it. Some of these movies weren't exactly good or very believable, making it hard for the others to find an interested public. But if you are interested in the subject and you want to see a good movie about it, than I can definitely recommend this one.<br/><br/>The title of this movie: ""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles"" already reveals a lot about what you can expect from it. It tells the story of a young journalist in San Fransisco, at the present day, who follows a man through the streets and ends up in an anonymous room with him. When the journalist starts to interview the man, the stranger tells him that he is a vampire, being over 200 years old. The journalist doesn't believe him, but after the man proves it's true, he tells his story. He once was a plantation owner outside New Orleans in 1791. His wife died when giving birth to his child and he had lost all will to live, when a vampire named Lestat offered him the chance to become a vampire himself. He accepted, but soon realized that life as a vampire isn't all that great either. Then he met a little girl, Claudia, who influenced and changed the rest of his eternal life...<br/><br/>Next to a good story, you'll also get some nice performances from the top cast that played in this movie. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas... all did a very nice job, each portraying a vampire with an entirely different nature, but it was the young Kirsten Dunst who surprised me the most. Even though she was only 12 at the time, she already showed what a good actress she once would be.<br/><br/>All in all this is a movie that will be loved by all the fans of vampire movies, but even when you aren't too much a fan of this movie, I think this has plenty of good things to offer. Think for instance of the decors, the clothing, the story and the acting. It all works very well together and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10."

Many famous actors from today are in it, such as Antonio Banderas, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and Kristen Dunst. Everythings just right in the movie and it's not all that scary. I wouldn't recommend it for people below 13 for there is some inappropriate scenes. Please watch this movie! I promise you'll like it. If you like Anne Rice movies and books I suggest checking out some of Stephin Kings work. It's very good too. But before you do that, WATCH INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE!"

","This movie is one of the best out there. It has drama, a little bit of comedy, and horror, everything a great movie should. Brad Pitt, in my opinion was the best actor in this film. His portrayal of a life shattered by loss and heartbreak was phenomenal. Tom Cruise was also good in this movie, though didn't have the same quality as Brad. I never would have thought Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise would be good playing VAMPIRES in a movie, but they were breath-taking. I don't watch sci-fi movies like this, but once I heard the actors names that were in it and saw the first scene, I knew it was a great movie to be seen. Kirsten Dunst was great in this film too, and the famous line of ""I want some more"" is definitely the most memorable and best line in the film! Also, Brad Pitt is MUCH hotter than Tom Cruise is, as a vampire (and in real life, ha ha).:-D"
"malkane316","8","1","2","29 January 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","By far the best Vampire movie of the decade, and probably the best in the last fifty years. Until someone makes I Am Legend properly, it will probably remain that way. Neil Jordan, famous for dark films, tone-wise, and light-wise directs this, giving probably his best film, and bringing out several brilliant performances from both well known, and unknown actors.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt stars as Louis, a vampire who decides to tell his epic life and death story to a modern day journalist, played by Christian Slater. Louis tells of his conversion to Vampirism by Lestat, a maniacal vampire played by Tom Cruise. He tells of his struggle to truly convert as he does not want to take a human life, but when he finds a young girl alone on a street, he turns her, and the couple raise her as their daughter. As years and decades pass, the friction between Louis and Lestat grows, and he eventually fights Lestat, leaving him for dead, and fleeing with Claudia, with whom he has become extremely close. They find a group of Vampires who wish them to join, but in a twist Claudia is killed and Louis is left alone. As we get close to present day, Louis again meets Lestat, and decides to tell his story.<br/><br/>Much of the film's best points are when Dunst is on-screen, as she gives one of the best child performances ever. The family dynamic provides many laughs, but is in reality a ploy to build up for the emotion shock of her death. Natuarlly this is not a bad thing, as we are genuinely saddened by her death. Pitt is sympathetic, Cruise gives one of, if not the best performance of his career, and the rest of the cast are all good. The sets are both exquisite and horrifying, there is plenty of gore, and the story is extremely involving. This is how 'traditional' vampire films should be made in the 'modern' era. 8 out of 10."

","This is simply the best vampire movie I have ever seen. It's beautifully done and very true to the heart of the novel it's based on. No movie can compare and no one can compare to Tom Cruise's masterful and perfect portrayal of The Brat Prince, The Vampire Lestat. Tom Cruise thoroughly understood the nature of the character from the mischievous brattiness to the angst, the frenetic hand gestures, the laugh... He captured every last detail of Lestat's nature right down to a pleading gaze when he asks 'Do we forgive each other then?' to a character he wronged terribly. I love this movie totally and absolutely and to me the shining star of this production was Tom Cruise and his thorough and ideal portrayal of the literary super star- Lestat de Lioncourt."

","I enjoy this film although I'm a bigger fan of the book than the movie. This film follows the book in spirit, but misses many of the finer points of the book that made it fascinating. We never learn _why_ Lestat picks Louis as his first vampire ""child"". We never learn about Louis' relationship with the neighbors, etc. What the film misses in fine details from the book it makes up for in style. Tom Cruise is not the Lestat from the book, but his Lestat is perfect for the film. Brad Pitt's Louis is perfect, and Kirstin Dunst's Claudia is straight out of the book- creepy! Antonio Banderas' Armand is 20 years too old, so that's a wash. The subtitle of this movie is ""The Vampire Chronicles"". If only they really made more films!!! Three out of four stars."

Who doesn't know Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater, and young Kristen Dunst. This is a movie with a perfect story and actors/actress. Look little Kirsten Dunst. We can see her Hollywood talent when she just a child. She really has a big talent. No doubt that now she's one of the Hollywood star. In this movie, she can played a girl with an adult mind. And she can expressed her anger with a good acted.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise, Tom Cruise... Good news, he played a strong character. Bad news, no one million dollars smile on his face. Just cold, bad, and evil smile from powerful vampire (remember, Lestat was too strong to killed). But, hey! This is so great. This is the first time he played antagonist character. I was so amaze, he can acted like that. With wavy blond hair (hahaha... I think, he looked funny) and long canine teeth, very very evil. It was awesome when I watched him with big anger and wicked laugh.<br/><br/>Poor Louise. He hated Lestat but he knew that he couldn't free from his creator. Of course Lestat was an arrogant vampire and too much demand. But, all of his lessons which gave to Louis, was true. Although Louis wanted to free from Lestat bad, he can't denied that Lestat was right. Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise? Or Brad Pitt vs. Tom Cruise? WOW!!! Why not? Good duet. <br/><br/>New looking Antonio Banderas. Hahaha... with long black hair and white skin. It's OK. Those are made him like a true very old vampire Armand.<br/><br/>And the end of the movie?

","Juicy and flamboyant in every respect of the words. Neil Jordan's lush direction showed us what he's capable of in combining the importance of good narrative with a visual banquet in 'The crying game'. And 'Interview'... is no step-down in that matter. The setting design and make-up is delicious and Anne Rice's script (from her landmark novel in the genre... yes, I AM a die-hard fan!) is as tight as a movie adaptation can manage and do justice, unless elaborated into a 3-hour version, that is (which I think could work, too). The voice-over technique flows fine and handles the occasional awkward tongue-in-cheek elements quite well. Some genuine scares grab you firmly by the throat, not to forget.<br/><br/>The cast is surprisingly fitting. Pitt is quite an ideal choice as Louis, evoking not too much sympathy in his frustration. However, upon knowing Cruise was to do Lestat, I remember moaning in despair - he was SO physically wrong! But he IS very good, witty and carrying just that right sarcasm for the part. But it's a final highlight (also titillating, years later, knowing her work as an adult) to see a brilliant Dunst as young Claudia. She's just luminous in her devilishness!<br/><br/>The only thing here that I miss from the novel is the sequence from Eastern Europe where Louis encounters the sad, beastly branch developed out of the vampire species; which I found an interesting comparison and analogy to disabled humans.<br/><br/>8/10 from Ozjeppe."
"treeroot","8","1","2","31 March 2004"," Louis, the heart of the drama
","What has made this vampire-themed film stand out is that it shows a struggling, passionate immortal torn between his enduring respect for human life and his very nature as a vampire to kill. Were it not for this bit, the whole thing would become an empty, spiritless shell. And therefore, of all the roles in the drama, the most difficult one being played was that of Louis a vampire with a human soul, an immortal with a mortal's passion¬°¬±, striving to keep whatever humanity remained in him.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt, with his fine performance and his uniquely exquisite elegance, portrayed accurately a guilt-ridden, suffering Louis to a great extent. Tom Cruise, too, did well in his part as Lestat, whose relentless, playful attitude towards life formed a striking contrast to Louis's reluctance to slaughter the innocent. Kirsten Dunst pulled off being cast as Claudia, a fierce young killer who moved many hearts by her sheer love for Louis.<br/><br/>Indeed, the whole worthiness of the play came to an end when the last breath in Louis that was human had died, and when all his passion ¬°¬∞went with her golden hair                                                      .

"rma01","Null","1","2","28 March 2004"," EPIC INTERVIEW WITH A REALLY HOT VAMPIRE!!(possible spoilers)
","To tell the truth, I am a big vampire movie fan, and it is always great if there are some really hot actors/vampires to watch out for there. I admit I watched Interview with the Vampire only to see Brad Pitt as a vampire.<br/><br/>
Seriously, did no one notice how HOT he looked?<br/><br/>Although I think Tom Cruise had a better role as Lestat, the unapologetically evil epitome of vampiric nature. I haven't read Rice's Chronicles but I think this movie is pretty neat in itself. Brad is stunning to look at, really, pardon me for repeating it, but he is. Cruise did a good job, at least the role of an arrogant, manipulative and positively evil vampire suited him very well. Kirsten Dunst as the child vampire Claudia gave a fine performance too. The problem was with Pitt's role - he is in his own words 'a passive fool'. I did not understand one thing - Louis (Brad Pitt) is portrayed as someone who was so forlorn and sad with his life after the death of his wife and child, that he 'wished to put an end to it all'. He says that 'his invitation was open to anyone' i.e. anyone who could put an end to his life. Well, dear Louis, how about yourself? Why couldn't he just pick up a revolver or something and kill himself? Why did he wait for others to do that? In one scene he actually provokes a gambler to shoot him at a game of cards. But he too, like Louis, doesn't have guts to do that.In my opinion anyone who is that depressed with their life should have no problem in commiting suicide and ending their anguish. So what was Louis' idea? Strange. In steps Lestat, taking a fancy for Louis and only too happy to make him his immortal companion. What happens after that, well you better watch the movie for that, it cannot be explained better in words. I only wish to comment on a few things. I heard that Armand the Old World Vampire who takes a fancy for Louis later on in the movie was indeed in Rice's book a seventeen year old. Now Antonio Banderas, even if he plays his role well, definitely doesn't look like a seventeen year old.<br/><br/>The movie is great to watch though because of its fabulous costumes and cinematography (almost all of it is shot in the night/dark). And Pitt's ember contacts are just fab... so cool! To summarise, this movie is worth watching firstly because of the mere fact that it is very different from most of the other movies in the vampire horror genre. It isn't cliched ( there are no crosses, or holy water or stake-through-the-heart stuff involved, in fact Louis dismisses them off as 'nonsense'). Concentrating more on the emotional torture and sensitivity of a soulful vampire, instead of his bloodlust, it is a movie in a league of its own. And as the tagline of the movie states, it's a vampire's epic tale of love, betrayal, loneliness and hunger. And it's compelling enough to be watched once even if you're not a vampire movie fan. Myself, well its different for me. See I have an additional reason for watching it again and again - a certain Mr. Pitt as a brooding but really hot vampire!<br/><br/>*PITT RULES* - THE MOVIE GETS **** out of *****"

","What can i say, words can not do this movie justice. it is without a doubt my favorite movie. I am not a large fan of tom cruise, or brad pitt, but the performance that they give is undeniable. This is not a movie for everyone, if you do not like darker movies or horror movies, i would not recommend it, but for those who are looking for a good (if not scary) horror movie you will fall in love with this film. The camera work is fantastic, its visuals really bring the characters to life. The score is also a treat, a sinister tone that really sets the mood.

","After seeing the movie at a friends house I instantly went out and bought the novel ""Interview with a Vampire"" by Anne Rice.  Allow me to say that the movie, though missing some key elements, was true to the book in many ways. The characters were brilliantly cast (Brad Pitt as the melancholy immortal Louis de Pointe du Lac, Tom Cruise as the flamboyant Lestat de Lioncourt, and the admirable Kirsten Dunst as the hateful Claudia) and the scenery was created to perfection. An obvious 10 out of 10 that would make even the toughest man alive weep with passion."

","This is, visually, a stunningly beautiful film.  However, I must agree with Lestat that the whining of Louis (which goes on for centuries) is most annoying.  <br/><br/>Louis, a poor-me twenty something plantation owner in 1700s New Orleans, is a reckless drunk, devastated by the death of his wife and unborn son in the throes of childbirth.  He spends his time gambling in seedy taverns and whining about his miserable life.  So, instead of putting an end to his sorrow and committing suicide, he decides to become immortal and spend eternity whining some more.  This gets on the nerves of vampire Lestat, the one who made Louis a vampire in the first place.  Tom Cruise (who only ever seems to play Tom Cruise) is an unlikely vampire, though he doesn't do a completely awful job in his interpretation of the arrogant, sadistic Lestat. Dunst is the Vampire Claudia, the eternal child who plays her part flawlessly, enjoying her immortality, her bloodlust and the power of being an immortal.  She gives Lestat a run for his money in the sadism department, merciless as she cuts his throat and instructs Louis to dump the corpse in an alligator-infested swamp.  She is the fiercest and most frightening of the vampire trio.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie is where the true power lies, as Louis and Claudia arrive in France and are greeted by the ghoulish Theater des Vampires, led by Armand.  Antonio Banderas in no way resembles an angelic red-haired seventeen year old boy (which is, according to the Book Purists I've spoken to, how Armand was described in the books) but he plays his part with grace and elegance.  Stephen Rea as Santiago is wonderful, a cold, cruel killer who enjoys every second of his sadism.  The theater itself is a wonderful set, filled with catacombs and dusty skeletons.  The plot explodes as Claudia is found guilty and sentenced to death for her execution of Lestat, and the Theater burns to the ground as Louis finally gets a backbone and exacts a brutal revenge.  This scene alone is almost worth suffering through an hour of self-pitying slop from Louis.  The ending was also most welcome, virtually turning Louis, the thus-far established hero, into the butt of a very long joke.  <br/><br/>I didn't love this movie, but I liked it, my only large complaint being the whining of Louis.  But my personal preference has never been for incessantly complaining Pretty Boys anyway.  I never cared much for the books and have never been a Book Purist anyway, even with books I truly loved (i.e. The Lord of the Rings).  It was a decent vampire film with some truly stunning moments.  It was better than most."

Brad Pitt plays the lonely, morbid Louie in one of his best performances of his career. A young Kirsten Dunst does an amazing job of mimicking the character of Claudia, a child turned into a vampire as a gift from Lestat to Louie. If there were really vampires, this is how it would be. None of those cheesy myths about garlic and crucifixes here! Though Neil Jordan is not the greatest director, a more than stellar cast (also including Christian Slater, Antonio Banderas, and Stephen Rhea) pulls this movie together and makes it the most truly unforgettable vampire movie ever.

","This film has to be one of the best vampire films I have ever seen. Not only are the cast fantastic but the set and costumes are brilliant. I don't understand why so many people are angry about Tom Cruise, Brad Pit and Kirsten Dunst being in this film because I think if anyone else played these roles it just wouldn't be the same and they all do an excellent job with their roles. I'm not a fan of Pitt or Cruise because I don't think either of them are excellent actors but after watching this film I realised what talents they do have and it's just a shame that the roles they have played since (especially Pitt) haven't been very good. Dunst on the other hand is fantastic and I think this is an excellent role from an excellent actress. I am dissapointed however that her more recent roles haven't been very challenging at all and they have just been parts in pathetic teen movies (apart from Drop Dead Gorgeous which I think is hilarious and I love Kirstey Alley... I think that's her name). I would really like to see Dunst in more challenging roles because after watching Interview.. I think she could be in a lot more films and she could have excellent parts to play and pull them off wonderfully. Bravo to Anne Rice for gracing us with such a brilliant book that has now been turned into an excellent film."

","""Interview with the Vampire"", a film based on Anne Rice's first novel of the Vampire Chronicles series is a haunting story of damnation, eternal regret and eternal love. The story begins when Louis (Brad Pitt), a vampire finds an interviewer (Christian sLater) and leads him to his room to tell him his story. The story starts in the 18th century in New Orleans when Louis after a terrible loss in his family (in the film it is implied that he lost his wife and his newborn child but in the book it's his brother that commits suicide) starts to be obsessed with death himself.  He then meets a vampire, LeStat (Tom Cruise) who gives him the opportunity to become a vampire, experience what he longed for, which was death, yet still live forever. Louis who was so eager to die finds the lifestyle of the vampires unbearable and in the first time in his life starts to value human life.  He starts to hate LeStat for being so senseless and killing everyone and everything he can get his hands on and retreats to eating mouse and other small animals to survive because he can't find the strength to kill a human being. His disgust for LeStat becomes so strong that he is about to leave him when LeStat turns a 5 year old orphan, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) that Louis had fed on but didn't have the courage to kill her, into a vampire.  Louis will then stay with LeStat and will become a father to Claudia. As Claudia grows up her relationship with Louis becomes much stronger as they still sleep in the same coffin and she demands to know the truth of how she became a vampire and why she will never have the body of a full-grown woman.  Louis tells her the truth which angers her so much that she is willing to take revenge from LeStat.  I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but I'll just say that the relationship between Louis and Claudia becomes much stronger after being together for almost a century until an ancient vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) and his attraction to Louis, which by the way is mutual, is putting the couple's love in danger. Some might think that the relationship between Louis and Claudia, a 24 year old man and a 5 year old girl is gross but it isn't because vampires are not sexual beings and besides, Claudia despite her diminutive stature is technically 100 years old when they kiss in Paris.  Others might be bothered by the attraction between Louis and Armand or even between LeStat and Louis but I want to believe that our society is able to accept homosexuality even if the attraction between the vampires is by no means sexual, since vampires as I have already said are not sexual beings. There are a lot more I'd like to say about this film but there's really no reason to do such a thing in a review. Interview with the Vampire is a fascinating and heart-breaking story and one of the best stories about the vampire's eternal pain and their internal struggles between their morals and their needs."

","""Interview with the Vampire"" was a really good movie. I didn't like how it didn't follow the book.What bothered me the most, though, is that in the movie Lestat was made by Marius but in the book he was created by Magnus. I didn't like Antonio Banderas as Armand. He did not fit the role and he wasn't French enough. Kirsten Dunst was the perfect Claudia. Brad Pitt did an okay job as Louis as did Tom Cruise. In the book Louis looses his brother not his wife and children. The movie was good but not as great as the book."
"ar87","10","1","2","10 August 2003"," Great
","I highly recommend this movie. It's the story of two vampires living through time, narrated by Louis (Brad Pitt), who is being interviewed by a reporter (Christian Slater). Louis was made a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise), who takes him under his wing and shows him the vampire way of life. They ""adopt"" a girl named Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst). Claudia and Louis consider it a curse to be a vampire, and grow to hate Lestat.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise steals every scene of this movie. I know Anne Rice complained publically about his casting, just imagine how stupid she must feel now. Lestat is the character we root for in this one (even if he's something of a bad-guy) which makes the ending so great."
"polargirl","8","1","2","8 August 2003"," ""Alright feed on what you want rats, chickens, poodles..""
","I saw this movie a couple of years ago when I was pretty young and found it scary and too bloody. So now when I rented it again I was very surprised that I actually thought it was really good.<br/><br/>* SPOILERS* This movie is more a costume drama where the characters happen to be vampires, than a horror movie. There are maybe two scenes that people may find frightening( Lestat returns from the swamp with his new lovely face and when Louis takes his revenge on the Paris vampires) * END OF SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The reason why this movie has a strong drama element is due to the brilliant performances of Dunst, Pitt and especially Cruise. I do agree with many other reviewers here that Dunst should have gotten an oscar nod for her portrayal of Claudia. It took awhile  for me to get use to seeing Pitt as  a vampire but he did a solid performance as guilt-ridden and confused Louis. Last but not least Cruise's Lestat is the cream of the cake in this movie. Even though Lestat is a pretty ""evil"" character Cruise manages to actually make him multi-layered and by far the most entertaining of all the vampires in this movie. Lestat is a perfect contrast to the brooding Louis, I think the movie would have been better for it had Lestat's screen time been increased. The things Lestat says are just so funny: ""Louis, Louis, Louis, still whining"". Cruise has been able to tone down his usual mannerisms that are usually in all of his movies (Magnolia being also an exception)and becomes nearly unrecognisable in his make-up.<br/><br/>The art direction  and production design is also great in Interview with a vampire.<br/><br/>A slight problem in this movie is the plot. There is now clear story. The movie merely follows  and tells the life of a vampire. This might make some viewers bored and start wondering what's the point with this movie. In my opinion Interview with a vampire is just supposed to be an atmospheric tale of the life of a vampire.If you can appreciate it as that you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>This movie is by far one of the best vampire movies out there, keeping the gore factor pretty low, but there are some pretty explicit blood sucking orgies in this one as well!<br/><br/>

","Having learned a little bit about what might be like to be a vampire(through my readings, and in a fictitious sense), finally I have had the chance to see what the movie ¬ëInterview with the vampire' was like. As I kept watching it, I found myself liking it more and more. It had a very intelligent story, a great cast and gory scenes where human blood was the main menu for our blood-thirsty characters. Vampires might be complex people, but in this movie they are also intriguing and fascinating creatures.<br/><br/>The undead are among us and livelier than ever, in this spellbinding screen adaptation of Anne Rice's best seller. Louis is lured by the charismatic vampire Lestat into the immortality of the damned, then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill. Interview with the Vampire offers enough thrills, shocks and fiendish fun to last a lifetime... and beyond. What a sheer delight it was to watch this movie. Now you might find that comment a little bit hard to understand, considering the topic that the movie is covering, but I found myself really consumed by the story of the film. Based on Anne Rice's best selling novel, the story is brought extremely well to the screen by the screenwriter, director, cinematographer, and the actors. Director Neil Jordan did a fine job in creating an eerie kind of existence for the vampires in the movie and also does justice to an incredible story.<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by Anne Rice, and I am certain that she would have put all the vital aspects of her book within the screenplay. The part I love about the story the most, is the way the we get it told by one of the main characters, Louis Pointe du lac, as he is being interviewed by a reporter (Christian Slater). It is also interesting to see a vampire story that shows how important it is that these people really need a family to feel happy, not unlike us mortals, is it?<br/><br/>The cast of this film is also of the finest quality. Tom Cruise proves why he is such a great actor in his role of Lestat de Lioncourt. He is a really impressive vampire, with his character's subtle humour a real highlight. Lestat makes a vampire out of Louis Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who is as equally as good as Cruise. I really like how his character shows that he is extremely uncomfortable in the immortal phase of being a ¬ëvampire'. The way Pitt tells the story was really interesting. I am glad I have found roles that Cruise and Pitt were good in, as I have had mixed feelings towards both of them as actors in the past. Their performances in this film have in some way vindicated themselves to me.<br/><br/>Yet the actor that was the best from my prospective is the very young Claudia (Kirsten Dunst). She is a real revelation as the old vampire that never ages. I mean however young Dunst was when she played this role (12 I have heard), she did a remarkable job in such a complex role. She reminds very much of what Haley Joel Osment was like in ¬ëThe Sixth Sense'. Having had a mixed opinion about her career in the last 12 months or so, it is great to see that she got it off to a good start. I also liked the vampire Armand (Antonio Banderas), and although he had a small role, he was still very affective.<br/><br/>The people behind the scenes of ¬ëIWTV' also need to be commended. The make-up department, headed by Stan Winston (with Michelle Burke) did a remarkable job with the actors playing vampires in the film. Cruise, Pitt and Dunst all were enhanced by make-up, which made them look all so wicked and evil. The cinematographer, Philippe Rousselot and production designer, Dante Ferretti, both did amazing jobs in this film. The look of the story being retold was terrific, as it had the feel of something like ¬ëSleepy Hollow'. This was due mainly to the way the camera looked at the many things, especially the way these vampires act in the world with normal humans, and how depressing it could be, to be a vampire.<br/><br/>I really am kicking myself, considering that this movie was made 9 years ago, and I have only watched it now, which is almost criminal. I believe that Anne Rice's book ¬ëInterview with the vampire' would have to be a great read and I might try and get around to reading it, as I do have one of my own vampire novel, that was a really good read. I especially like the conclusion to this movie, as it is not only satisfying, but surprising as well. The main reason for watching this film was so I could get to see 2002's big hit ¬ëQueen of the Damned', a film that is once again based on Anne Rice's story and looks into the extraordinary world of vampires. I have seen ¬ëQOTD', and to tell you the truth, it was a terrible movie, nothing like this one. It is well done to all involved with this film and it has become part of my growing movie collection.<br/><br/>CMRS gives ¬ëInterview with the vampire': 5 (Brilliant Film)"
"alell_rhianna_jornadesh","9","1","2","26 April 2003"," A truly superb display of Acting, Directing and Writing!
","Having read the novel Interview with the Vampire by the spectacular Anne Rice before searching out the film and watching it I have to admit that I was a little sceptical over the choice of actors.  As I had thoroughly enjoyed the unique character, Lestat de Lioncourt when written down on paper I had already considered the difficulty that the director might have had to face when casting someone for the part.<br/><br/>I had not seen any of Tom Cruise's films before this; however, I was completely aware of his expert acting skills but this did not stop me from doubting his performance as the illustrious 'Brat Prince'.  Lestat has such energy as a character, a wicked demeanour and sarcastic nature, but somehow one can not help falling for him- how would an actor such as Cruise carry off such a deep role?<br/><br/>Louis de Pointe du Lac is the miserable and 'weak' fledgling of the Vampire Lestat and is said to be the most human of all Vampires.  His mortal-pitying, self-hating attitude was another profile that I was unsure would be carried out to its full potential; however I doubted Brad Pitt less than I had Tom Cruise; I knew that Pitt's soft voice and strong appearance would fit snugly into Louis' character.<br/><br/>Already aware that Anne Rice had written the screenplay herself I was ready to accept anything that differed from the book.  A little more romance was added to the film with the death of Louis' child and wife; in the book it had been the death of his brother that had caused him to withdraw into himself and I was willing to accept this as a much more sensitive side to the story.<br/><br/>From the moment that Brad Pitt appeared on the screen I had fallen for his portrayal of Louis, he had everything about him to a tee, even the way in which he held himself in which he looked about his surroundings and treated other people were completely accurate.  I had to bite my lip and apologise profusely for my doubting his performance.<br/><br/>And to add to my complete awe and satisfaction, I had already fallen for the Lestat that I saw before me on the television screen.  I laughed at his sarcasm, his mood swings, happiness and the way in which Cruise portrayed Lestat's high maintenance attitude.  To watch Cruise on the screen was as much fun as reading about Lestat in the novel.<br/><br/>All of the characters that Anne Rice has come up with throughout the Vampire Chronicles keep within themselves something that would be a challenge when put onto the big screen.  However, Claudia, the young Vampiress belonging to Louis and Lestat meant the involvement of a child actor- a side to film that is rarely explored.  Kirsten Dunst was chosen to play this part and at the age of twelve, only two years younger than myself when I watched the film, she carried off the part with maturity and as much understanding as was possible.<br/><br/>The only character with whom I was not impressed was that of Armand, whilst Antonio Banderas acted superbly the character had been cast too old. Armand was 'made' at roughly the age of 17 (I believe) and the age that they had worked him into the screenplay at seemed much older than that.  He was much darker than I had ever imagined the character would be and seemed less careless than that of the fun loving, red head Russian that I had read of.<br/><br/>Whilst the last paragraph could be construed as the wishful thinking of a huge Anne Rice fan I believe in as much accuracy as possible when it comes to film adaptations and am sure that the pure immortality and beauty of Vampires might have been displayed to a much further degree if Armand had been cast with just a little more thought.<br/><br/>Overall this film was positively fantastic.  It was bright and colourful, dark and mysterious, gruesome and terrible.  This film was full of its own magic and it left in my mind the enticing beauty of immortality, the seductiveness of the way in which a Louis and Lestat viewed the world and the timeless story of the Vampire from the ideas of a truly inspirational woman; Anne Rice."

","i must say, when i was preparing to watch it, i thought ok this is probabley gonna be your typical Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt pretty boy movie. Usually i find Tom Cruise's acting ability to be corney and non-emotional, Brad Pitt's movies typically kinda funny and not so original. But i was quite mistaken after watching this epic tale of the torturing soul and coniving vampires. I don't know if it was because the make-up artists did a good job making Cruise blonde and pale. But through out the movie i actually forgot it was him. He was brilliant as the Vampire Lestat with the evil laugh and crude antics. Brad Pitt brought to life the torturing soul of my favourite character Louis. i was very pessimistic about him as i really didn't want to see a actor portray what i had thought of Louis in the novels, especially a well known pretty boy. But again i was wrong. The chemistry between them was of brothers the fighting, and caring at times. Lestat as the older brother teaching his young vampire Louis. They bond together to parent the young Kirsten Dunst character Claudia,when you think about how young she was at the time she did a awesome performance. It is very unfortunate that Tom Cruise refuses to reprise a role, especially because both actors haven't done a good drama since. That did well because of a good script and not because of media hype."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I really liked this film.  As usual, Pitt's acting is great as well as everyone else (even the young Kirsten Dunst).  The film was masterfully set in a very dark mood to reflect the feeling of Pitt's character.  Anne Rice creatively humanized the vampire condition and gave them emotions.  Because I understood the vampire's perspective, I didn't look at their killing as reckless or evil, but necessary.  Harsh reality.  Superb work, and would have gotten a 9/10 if it wasn't for the last couple scenes.  Those could have been done much better.  When Pitt walked out of the movie theater in 1988 you get this great sense that he's a walking anachronism.  Then Cruise kills Slater to some cheezy song playing on the radio on the Golden Gate bridge while exclaiming ""I've been listening to his whining for centuries."" Poor, poor.  More scenes like Pitt's sad exit from the movie theater would have been great.  It is an unheard of event that a man gets to experience modern technology and transportation while knowing the inconveniences of the past.  Not to mention the changing culture and morality.  A greater focus on that would have made this film a 10, but no.  8/10."

","I just watched this film for the umpteenth time on DVD and haven't tired of it one bit. Never one to be easily impressed by a film or won over by gore or special effects, my love of this particular film is rather deep.<br/><br/>To start with Neil Jordan is a marvellous director, who has brought us such classics as The Company of Wolves, The Crying Game and The Butcher Boy. This man is a genius of vision and brings out the most honest performances from his cast. I don't think that we will ever see a better performance from any of the actors. It was, unfortunately, Kirsten Dunst's zenith of credibility at such a young age, nothing that she has done since has come close to her brilliantly painful, evocative performance here as the tortured Claudia. Nor is it likely that Brad Pitt's morose Louis will be outdone with any of his other roles (nay, I think Louis even outdoes Pitt's portrayal of Jeffrey Goines in 12 Monkeys). And Tom Cruise has never been so powerful in a role. All three bring wonderfully nuanced subtlties to their roles as the vampire trio and it is enormously compelling and emotionally touching to watch them on their journey.<br/><br/>Every detail of this film, from Philippe Rousselot's award-winning cinematography to the wonderfully detailed art direction and Stan WInston's always reliable makeup and effects, are exceptionally created and add to the brooding mood of this film. Without Elliot Goldenthal's sombre, beautiful score which was shamelessly beaten at the oscar's by Hans Zimmer's score from THe Lion King, the film would been very different. The moving string and choral melodies and horns provide such a marvellous atmosphere.<br/><br/>The story itself is so heart-breaking and involving. If you let yourself into the world of the vampire (which is rather accessible through the afforementioned cinematic techniques) Interview with the Vampire proves to be a beguiling and unique experience. It is a soaring emotional journey, a quest to not only find the meaning of immortal life, but the very reason for existence.<br/><br/>I am greatly moved and satisfied by Interview with the Vampire each time I watch it. It is a great shame that the sequels (which were obviously originally planned to follow on closely from this film - or so the ending suggests) were not handled by the same crew. Queen of the Dammed (actually the third book in the Vampire CHronicles - they skipped The Vampire Lestat) is rather pitiful and lacks the depth and intelligence of Interview with the Vampire. Hopefully if others are to be made, Neil Jordan, or someone at his level, will take the helm. If not, at least we are left with this beautiful film, for there is no other vampire film quite like it."

","So funny, isn't it? I used to think that Brad Pitt was just a nice baby face in a good nearly forty years old body. So I did with Tom Cruise, and you can imagined what I thought of Kirstin Dunts after a funny but stupid Bring it On. This movie shows why this actors are so famous today. They do now how to act, only they don't do it very much nowadays. The performance given from Brad Pitt as Louis is perfect, and really captured the sad way of living of his character which, for me, never really wanted to be happy. He's always looking foward to horrible things in a way, and there IS people like that. As for Tom Cruise, I hated Lestad, which is good. I think that was the intention. I hated him as much as I hated Santiago, although I love his ceiling dance. I don't like Antonio Bandera's Armand, and thats it. Claudia is one of my favorite characters nevertheless, and I love her scenes, including the one when she cuts her hair. At that point I knew totally this wasn't a little girl, but a big, mature woman. Her relationship with Louis is the greatest thing of the film. At the beginning he is the perfect father, later a fantastic big brother, and at the end a handsome lover. Nobody talks about it, but I was worried they would never kissed throughout the movie, and when they did the whole stoy suddenly changed, and I was this close to cry when Louis finds her with Madelaine made ashes.<br/><br/>At that scene, his expression shows the whole acceptance bussines of humans: negation, rage, negociation and finally acceptance. I'm still this close to cry when I see his sad expression. But later, Louis becomes a total vampire. His human no more, his eyes are so bright you're scared of them and his expression is still ""irresistible"" as someone close to me said so.<br/><br/>What girl woudn't give the world to have her first kiss at eleven with no one but Brad Pitt. The music is just hunting, and I had to buy the soundtrack. The script feel perfect and captures the spirit of the novel. I nearly give it a 10, but I won't because I'm scared of that number. It has such a meaning.<br/><br/>Something else: I love Yvette, adn Madelaine, and Stelle, and they all talk so little. The good thing about several movies is that even the smallest characters have a meaning. They had it, to me."
"jwick76","Null","1","2","25 October 2002"," Great flick by Neil Jordan...
","Too bad he only has a handful of his movies that are even close to this caliber of direction.<br/><br/>Very gothic, very dark.  Cruise is exceptional.  Pitt excels in his follow-up performance to Legends of the Fall.<br/><br/>This movie has a fantastic soundtrack that compliments the film very well. It is the same story as Anne Rice's first Vampire Chronicle title, and luckily she was still alive to write the screenplay.  She did change it up significantly for the movie, and I think it flows a lot better than her novels...which I regard as the Danielle Steele of vampire romance.  If you're into the factual basis of any of this and are expecting it to give a true depiction of vampirism, then this isn't for you.  Yet another romantic glorification, without any concrete explanation for anything.  She gets into those aspects a bit more in her books, but they are still just romantic notions.  If you can ignore this fallacy, then the movie is wonderful.<br/><br/>Pitt and Cruise play their roles extremely well, as does Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst.  This movie is one you can watch over and over again...unlike Queen of the Damned, which I deleted from my hard drive 6 minutes into the movie (I download and preview movies before I purchase them, rent them, or see them in the theatre...very useful with the quality of movies Hollywood has been presenting to the public).<br/><br/>
The only thing I like about Anne Rice is her characters and her ability to tell a tale...when she wasn't involved in Queen of the Damned, I was skeptical.  And rightly so, it's probably the worst movie attempt to mix The Crow and Blade together, soundtrack included.  I would say it's on par with The Crow 2/3/4 and however many more they churn out before someone puts a stop to the mockery.<br/><br/>VHS or DVD, this movie is great.  Not enough to warrant the DVD scenery-wise, but definitely for the sound quality."
"AEBarschall","Null","1","2","17 October 2002"," OK: some good points, some bad points
","I became a Tom Cruise fan after I saw ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" which came out much later than this, so I've been slowly trying to catch up on renting videos of his back movies.  I had put this one off for a long time, because I was afraid it was going to be scary and my husband didn't want to watch it with me.  Now maybe it's because my TV has only a 5"" screen, and maybe it's because I'm getting jaded in my old age, but this just didn't seem at all scary to me.  I notice some other reviewers thought it was, but I didn't think so.  So, if you, like me, are putting this off because you're afraid of being spooked, maybe you needn't wait any longer.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought that the movie was more philosophical than scary.  Tom seems to like stories that examine the inner workings of the human soul and that show moral complexity.  This movie fits into that pattern ... not that it is really profound, mind you, especially if you've seen ""Dark Shadows,"" where a lot of these issues are already examined.<br/><br/>One thing that disappointed me was that I was mislead by the cover photography on the video.  I thought that because Tom had the largest photo he must be the lead.  WRONG.  Brad Pitt is the lead.  Tom is a supporting actor here.  This was frustrating to me as a Tom Cruise fan.  The shots of him were too short.  He moved too fast.  I didn't get to focus on his face long enough.  Now, Brad Pitt is a fine actor, and there were several lingering shots of his face, which should appeal to HIS fans ... BUT I'm not into blonds, so that didn't do too much for me.  Tom is also wearing a light colored wig, which was a bit hard for me to look at.<br/><br/>The pleasant surprise was Antonio Banderas, who isn't even a tiny bit blond. I spent all his scenes wondering where I had seen him before.  Then I went on IMDB and saw that he was the goofy dad from Spy Kids II.  What a contrast, seeing him as a vampire! This guy can really act!  For my money he out-acted both Pitt and Cruise, and was better-looking than both.  He is definitely an under-appreciated talent.<br/><br/>Another pleasant surprise was gorgeous period costumes.  I'm really a pushover for those old clothes, particularly the beautiful dresses that some of the female vampires got to wear: just oceans of shiny satin.  I loved that.<br/><br/>Now this is going to be boring for those of you who are not big Tom Cruise fans, but you can really see that Tom's nose has changed if you look at this movie after seeing ""Vanilla Sky"".  I see three possibilities: 1.  he had a nose job; 2.  his nose has grown, dramatically (A doctor once told me that our noses keep growing throughout our lives, so that older people have larger noses than younger people, so that could have happened.); OR 3.  sometimes he wears a fake nose as part of his makeup. Does anyone know which of these is the case or is there some other possible explanation?"

But one star was lit in this movie, and what a star it is.

His Lestat is dark and creepy and I was shocked to read that Anne Rice, the author of the book, had critisized the choice to cast him.  Brad Pitt is great in the role of Louis. He does well to convey the misery he feels.  Kirsten Dunst as Claudia delivers by far the best performance in the films!  The other supporting roles performed by Christian Slater, Stephen Rea and Antonio Banderas are also brilliant.<br/><br/>This film is dark and gothic and in some places like a black comedy.  One of my favourite scenes of the film is when Lestat discovers Louis killing Claudia and picks up Claudia's dead mother and dances round the room with her declaring ""there is life in the old lady yet!""  there are also some horrificly frightening scenes where Lestat is set on fire and later when Claudia and her new vampire campanion are killed by the sun light and again when a vengeful Louis kills sleeping vampires.<br/><br/>I find I like this film more and more each time i see it and would recommend this film!

But this movie was totally different from that. Yes, it had its moments where Louis went mad and started to kill the vampires, but it had that greatness to it. It showed the love and anger between two vampires who are supposed to be friends. And it shows the love of a daughter. I cried in a couple parts, just of how good it was. As for them looking girly at times, thats how it was back then. Guys wore wigs that made them look like women at times. Thats why they had it in that time frame.

The film revolves around the life of Pitt who is being interviewed by Christian Slater. He tells of his desent into the world of vampires and of the tension that arose between him and Cruise resulting in their departure from each other. The always great Antino Bandaras and a very young Kirsten Dunst also give effect performances as blood suckers. The script is great and Crusie and Pitt deliver all their lines with power and emtion making this two hour plus movie seem to speed by.

One word of warning to potential watchers, there is undeniably a homo-erotic undertone to this film so if you don't like that kind of thing stay clear.<br/><br/>Lestat is captured almost perfectly by Tom Cruise. He manages to convey the vampire's hidden insecurities but also his confidence, vitality and sensuous pleasure in his existance as one of the undead.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's Louis is very faithful to the book character. His sadness and pain is clearly seen in Pitt's eyes and his relationship with Kirsten Dunst's Claudia is wonderful and moving to watch. Dunst's performance is e ye opening and terrible. The trauma felt by a woman trapped in a child's body could not be any better presented.<br/><br/>Christian Slater, although not what I pictured Daniel Malloy to be does the part proud as does Stephen Rea in the role of Santiago.<br/><br/>The only problem I have comes from Banderas' portrayal of Armand. Although he does it extremely well, capturing Armands power and grace and seductiveness I cannot meld the image of Banderas' black haired man to the beautiful 17 year old Russian that Armand is in the book.<br/><br/>But the relationships between the characters are filled with the tension and passion that comes to the fore in the book, although I would have liked to have seen interaction between Lestat (Cruise) and Armand (Banderas) as these two are very dynamic personalities. Overall the film is excellent. The set and score are haunting and although die hard Anne Rice fans might find fault with the ending in particular it would be hard to create a better interpretation of her novel.

However, I was a big fan of the book and there were a couple of changes that I thought were unnecessary, but I guess we don't have to dwell on that. Obviously, when Anne Rice wrote the script, she intended the film to stand on its own outside of the canon of her books.

The vampires in the movie are supposed to be as graceful and women like because it is in their nature as french men and Vampires. They are very elegant and gentlemanly in there own unique way. The fact that louis and Armand look like girls is only because they are white with death and their eyes are supposed to be that color. Vampires are supposed to be sexual characters that is what gives them half the interest they have. If you have not read Anne Rice's books then you will most likely Not understand this movie because sadly enough the movie does not follow the book but the characters in it do.

","There are a number of reasons as to why opinion is so divided over the board in regards to this movie.  I could state several, but I would rather emphasize the point that most individuals tend to overlook: this is not a horror movie.  In fact, neither the movie nor the book were intended to fall into that particular genre, but rather, they were meant to provide a look into what the life of a vampire may be like.<br/><br/>As director Neil Jordan has said, there is an inherent problem in this when it comes to translating the concept to a narrative:  since vampires are immortal, the threat of danger is practically non-existent.  As a result, we must settle for the emotional corrosion that everlasting life can cripple one with--a concept that is perhaps so farfetched to today's populace, who would rather identify with more realistic matter, that it becomes impossible to grasp and come to senses with.  If somebody is going to be a monster, it is much more entertaining to make them out to be droning, thoughtless creatures, as opposed to the philosopher which Anne Rice argues develops over time.  At the very least, there's action to be seen in the screen when this is the case.<br/><br/>Given how much I adore the novel, I was surprised at the overwhelming response I had when I finished watching the film.  Typically, movies based on literary works tend to exclude much of what makes the original material a joy to experience, opting to include only the elements and feelings that are discernible throughout as large an amount of viewers as possible.  Yet this work manages to convey nearly all of the base elements of the novel, particularly in the mood and in the feelings of the characters involved. Lestat is as charismatic here as he was in the novel;  Louis is still the very definition of detachment;  Armand, the one who purports to know all, once again hints at the fact that he is as insecure as Louis about immortality;  and Claudia retains the very essence of evil that was multiplied tenfold in comparison to every other character in the story.  She remains as vindictive as ever, though to a slightly lesser degree.<br/><br/>There were two substantial changes that were made from the novel which require mention.  One is that Armand is now featured as an adult as opposed to an immortal with the body of a teenager.  It works for the better, and did not irk me, but it simply makes you realize that out of just about any literary work, Anne Rice's characters are perhaps some of the most complex to adapt to film;  imagine casting a six-year old girl to play the part of Claudia.  The performance Kirsten Dunst gives is beyond belief even for her age, but it does bring me to the second point:  it appeared as though Claudia was toned down just a bit from the novel.  In it, she was constantly immersed in books, and in addition spoke with rather evolved vernacular, which gave the haunting image of a true adult trapped in the body of a child.  In the movie, however, Claudia retains a large amount of her immaturity due to her somewhat plain dialogue, and she even resorts to speaking like a child in a few scenes, as when she says, ""I shall never ever grow up.""  The innocence is portrayed fine due to the movie not showing any of her kills in action, but the character lacked a certain edge... which is surprising, considering how faithful all of her other action were to the original work.<br/><br/>There remains not much to be said, other than to state that this is an extremely ""classy"" movie, with some expertly handled sexual innuendo that seduces just as strongly as that of the novel.  Watch it knowing what you are getting into firsthand, and take delight in some of the most unique and captivating characters to be created in modern literature.  And keep in mind that this story, as Anne Rice has stated, is more about us than vampires. It is a wonderfully introspective piece of work."

","Interview with the Vampire is one of the best films I seen in in my lifetime. Richly filmed, and musically perfected, this film follows the struggles and feelings experienced by vampire Louie in his 200 years and counting of immortality, proving that even the undead have feelings, and daily struggles, perhaps resulting from their own lost humanity. Brad Pitt, who's performance is both amazing, and thought invoking <I must say this had to be the movie I saw way back 7 years ago when it was out that convinced me he wasn't just something nice to look at.> The real impressive acting here comes from Kirsten Dunst and Tom Cruise, Dunst, who is a favorite of mine anyhow, plays Claudia, the eternal child, who's mind is as grown up and intelligent as that of an 80 year old, but who's body remains that of a doll, I was highly impressed vy the ability of someone who off the screen is as yound as her performance to master humanity, and the struggle to a T. Tom Cruise, who has always been to me ""Top Gun"" pretty boy, blew me away, I have always found the ""supervillan"" to be a favorite, the more evil, the more likable somehow. You could have not found a better Lestat, a lot of people were objective to having Cruise in this part, including me, but that changed within 5 minutes a his screen entrance, even to this day I cannot watch that movie without disbelieving that was Tom Cruise. Cruise is never less than convincing as a vampire that has been at this game for so long, he's long since lost any sense of guilt or remorse, but there are scenes where it does seem to be present for however brief a period it may be. In closing this movie offers up vampires as exotic creatures, who for the most part look the same as the rest of us, rather than some ugly creature <ie: Nosferatu> which in itself is a great film, doesh't leave much to be desired in the eyeful dept. I highly suggest this movie."

","'Evil is a point of view. God kills indiscriminately, and  so shall we. For no creatures under him are so like him, as ourselves' (-Lestat)<br/><br/>I adored this movie. At first I wanted to watch it because I'd previously liked Dracula with Winona Ryder and Anthony Hopkins, but this vampire movie was so different! I always thought Tom Cruise got to the top thanks to his looks, but after watching IWTV I know this is not true; this guy is talented to the toes. Some people considered him a 'lightweight vampire' in this movie, but I thought the opposite was true. He did a perfect job in his French haute couture and golden hair. The only thing that could be improved was his accent. Not a very convincing Frenchman, but ok. And he doesn't really reflect Lestat's remoteness, his loneliness and despair for a true lover and companion. Although I've read the Vampire Chronicles, I prefer the movie to it, as it breathes a very rare type of style; Neil Jordan's ""certainly outdone himself"". Antonio Banderas did a perfect job as Armand. He's got this special vibe over him, earlier noticed in 'Philadelphia'. I enjoyed his appearance very much. Kirsten Dunst was the real surprise in the movie. Her eerily precocious character Claudia is perfectly played, only sometimes she read it out straight from the script, that was a pity. Brad Pitt, as usual in a passive though beautiful role was magic as ever, but I think he plays this kind of role too much. Prefer Fight Club and Snatch to it. Lestat de Lioncourt's character was the best, and Tom Cruise played it really well. He was the ultimate one who could scream, bleed, be rebellious and evil. For me, that seems the best role in the part. Nail Jordan's movie was magic. Big compliment to Dante Ferretti also who made the costumes, the actors looked great in French decadence.<br/><br/>Yours, Claudia"

I had to read every book of the ""Chronik der Vampire"" (in German for sure, my English is not that good) - ""Vampire Chronicles"". I really fell in love with Lestat (not with Tom Cruise!).

It will help explain some things that may have confused you in the movie or can fill in some gaps.  I am currently in the 4th book of the Vampire Chronicles and I am constantly finding things that make me think, ""Oh!  That makes a lot of sense now!""  The soundtrack is also very good.

","Interview With The Vampire is flat out the best vampire movie ever made. In Interview, we see vampires more as people, who have feelings and are not just the bloodsucking zombies that the orginal Dracula made them out to be. I felt pity for the misery of Louis (Brad Pitt) and unlike others saw Lestat (Tom Cruise) not as a villain but as a vampire who has accepted who he is. Unlike any other film on the subject, we see that vampires can be compared to us.  That during all our lives we feel like an outcast at some point, and vampires are the outcasts of ""demonic"" fiction.  It was also a nice surprise that we saw most of the vampire ""rhetoric"" done away with.  The garlic, crucifixes an stakes through the heart.  It is more realistic to see that vampires can be killed in conventional ways like any human, and not in absurd gestures created to add shock value.  Overall Interview With The Vampire is a ""mature"" vampire movie with characters we can all relate with, the movie actually portrays a sense of relevence.  And to quote Louis when inquired by the interview, Malloy (Slater) about the myth of dracula ""The demented ravings of a drunk Irishmen."""

This movie is about Louis(Pitt) who is a mortal plantation owner who has lost his wife, and therefore his will to live.

","In truth, I believe that the last comment that I had seen was slightly incorrect in a slight number of ways, although will state for those who have not seen the movie... it is a wonderful representation of Vampires and their uniqueness rather than the primal Dracula with his comical and yet semi-boring journal resources as the story.<br/><br/>This is far different. This is not the memory of a number of people who have limited ideas. This is the knowledge of a single being whose life has been that of a Vampire with an actual soul for kindness and knows when there has been wrongdoing. He is a fair-natured man, although the paradox being that he is a fair-natured beast, a Caring Vampire. However, Lestat is much more memorable than Louis from what Louis states.<br/><br/>The best quote I found of the movie is merely the fact which I find is very correct and well put into irony.<br/><br/>""Evil is a point of view. God kills indescrimanently, and so shall we. For no creatures, under God, are as we are. None so like him as ourselves.""<br/><br/>I shall not tell anymore of the movie in that manor, but I do believe in the fact that each vampire is singular, not just in power but personality. Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, and Brad Pitt expand the personality of the book characters. Although I know friends who say that the characters on the movie are not as good as the story, I quite think the opposite. The movie characters are by far much greater than those of the novel the movie was based on.<br/><br/>As a person who likes Gothic movies, join the many of us who likes this and watch the movie.

","Having seen my share of vampire films in my nearly 40 years, I don't think I've ever seen one as well-done as this one.  Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" wasn't bad, but there was far more fluff than substance.  Carpenter's ""Vampires"" was ludicrous...and ""Blade""?  Well, let's not even go there.  This film, however, gives a depth of meaning to the life of a vampire that makes the monster far less threatening and far more understandable.<br/><br/>In this movie, we get to see what motivates them...why they do what they do and the general depths of depravity that isn't only innate to characters as vampires, but to that of humans in-general.  I found the emotions portrayed in this film as more real than in any of the aforementioned vampire-themed films.  And more, all the main actors did extremely credible jobs in their roles.  I think the only role where Cruise has even come close to what he put into Lestat was in ""A Few Good Men"".  Pitt was a bit pouty, yes, but that's his morose style anyway.<br/><br/>Anyway, this a thinking person's film.  If you want blood, gore and body-parts all over the screen, see the films mentioned in the first paragraph.  If you want something that makes you think, watch this movie."

"morpheus825","Null","1","2","18 December 1999"," Excellent film
","The problem with most book to film projects is that it is almost impossible to capture all of the essence and meaning of the original work onto the screen.  I think IWTV is perhaps one of best translations of this. Although there are many parts of the novel that have been excised from the film I feel it managed to keep everything that was integral to the original story. The Homo-erotic scenes are significantly down-played, I assume for the sake of avoiding controversey.  Too much of that would have just made viewers regard it as whoring trash and realistically, I doubt that either Cruise or Pitt would have agreed to display themselves in overt homosexual themes. This works out fine because the heart of the story is not just about sex or love.  (Although it is the driving motivation for many of the characters) This is not the type of film to see if you are looking for a grandiose villain with a nefarious plot who meets his end in a gruesome display of blood and gore.  It's more than just splattering eye-candy.  The story is about Human exploration.  Rice initiated a romanticized theme in Vampire lore that has been imitated in almost every medium since.  I think the film is about re-evaluating ones values in light of tragedy and testing the boundaries of immoral hedonism.  It paints the vampire in a portrait that I think others have either never dared to or never succeeded in capturing. My only complaint is the casting choice of Antonio Banderas.  He is way too old and much too masculine to be playing the role of Armand.  I think a much better choice for the character would have been (if he lived) River Phoenix. I think he would have been a great Armand.  Many viewers ended up having a lot of complaints about various characters.  Most notably, Louis.  The only defense that I can offer is that you must read the written story.  And not just Interview, but the follow ups as well.  They lend so much into the nature of the characters that it explains their actions in their first film/novel.  All in all....a very good film."

This is the most beautifully shot movie of the decade...outside of The Thin Red Line.  Also, Elliot Goldenthal's score is both haunting and moving.

In this movie and the equally thrilling novel by Anne Rice, Vampires are presented, not as hating, evil, blood thirsty creatures, but as creatures with logical human or animal type emotions and cravings.

","One of the greatest things about Anne Rice is that when you read her material, she has all this strange symbolism hidden and tucked away in every corner of her stories.  And like she says in the beginning before the movie starts, this movie is about us, and not just vampires.  In truth, I didn't really quite understand that, but I guess now I have a distinct idea of what she means.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I love ""Interview..."" for it's haunting message and the sophisticated and old fashioned image that surrounds this film.  Vampire films are usually like this, and they are also romantic in their own way. This movie isn't as romantic as ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (I mean the 1992 one), but like ""Dracula"", it's dark, it's haunting, and very suave.  Anne Rice has a very sophisticated imagination, and who knows what runs though her mind to expand her creativity.  Whatever it is, it turns her work into masterpieces.<br/><br/>For me, reading Anne Rice is like staring at a painting.  When you stare at modern painting in an modern art museum, you try to figure out the meaning behind the painting, and when you read Anne Rice, you try to figure out the meaning behind each story she writes.  Of course, you can expect that from ""Interview..."".<br/><br/>I loved the set to this film, especially the Theatre Des Vampires, and the costumes are just brilliant!<br/><br/>I thought that Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt gave wonderful performances as the playful Lestat and the gentle Louis.

","amazing is the only word that can describe this movie...i am an Anne Rice fan, and i have read all her vampire chronicles and most of the rest of her books...since the screenplay was written by her, the movie captures everything about the book that should have been captured...Lestat is finally portrayed in the flesh, a chance for all us Lestat admirers to see what he really might look like (though i doubt he looks like tom cruise) tom cruise plays lestat brilliantly, and brad pitt captures every little depressed mannerism of louis....and the most surprising performance was that of kristen dunst...her portrayal of claudia was absolutely horrifying (in the best sense of the word) her character was supposed to be horrifying, a mature woman trapped in a child's body, and kristen was perfect....her make-up made it all the more real. i believe this is one of the most amazing movies of all time, and truly it tells how it is, not how we think it is!"

","Yeah I saw this film without first reading the book, but it inspired me too. The characters are more or less perfect, none more so than Tom Cruise, who I liked even though his other film performances have been middle of the road. The music added extra atmosphere to the whole film, and it brought forward some good aspects of the book, I just wish they were making the second one in the series, instead of jumping to the third book - Queen Of the Damned."

"theCute1","7","1","2","6 April 1999"," More than vampires
","Anne Rice's tale of a vampire's struggle to accept himself for what he is puts a new twist on the vampire genre.  Usually the vampire is bad and there are limited ways to kill him.  In this movie however you don't want the vampire dead because Rice makes you sympathize with him.  Everyone must come to terms with what they are or are not and do whatever they can to compensate for it.  Louis, one of the main characters, must accept the fact that he is a killer.  He must also realize that the one person who can help him make his road to self discovery easier doesn't or can't help him. Watching all the obstacles arise and watching Louis confront them is very interesting and as a result I think this is a must see for all fans of horror movies."

An instant hit with an all star cast, the touching tale of Louis(Brad Pitt) as an immortal with no lust for life, his maker Lestat(Tom Cruise playing a gentleman worthy of an oscar), and their little bloodthirsty vampire daughter Claudia( Kirsten Dunst). It is the story of how Louis came into existence and learned how to take life through the most precious fluid in a mortal body, blood. It's action packed! Other characters include Armand(Antonio Banderas), and Daniel Malloy, the interviewer(Christian Slater)."

","I call this the perfect vampire movie for one reason. It is. It's not your everyday teen slasher, this movie goes for the epic. You actually care about the vampires in this movie, and don't just wish them dead. The performance from Tom Cruise in portrayal of Lestat is both dark, and scary.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt does well too, and Kristen Dunst delivers a great preformance. So check out this movie if you're into serious vampire, or horror movies. If you are looking for a few quick scares, look somewhere else.

The only quibble I have is about Brad Pitt's hair. No 19th-century Paris gentleman would have hair like that! Overall, one of the best films I have seen.  9/10"

I just don't view ""Interview with the Vampire"" as a horror movie... Or at least not the kind of horror movie that many are used to.

"alex-216","Null","1","2","25 February 1999"," The best vampire film of all time?
","Surprisingly close to the book, the faults the film has are those of the book.  We might ask for example how come the vampires appear not to notice the first or second world wars  even though they are in Europe at the time.<br/><br/>Louis' hair is also a curiosity - a man simply could not walk round in early twentieth century Europe with long hair in a pony tale and not be stared at at the very least.  Since a vampire presumably wants to be inconspicuous this is a problem.<br/><br/>There is an obvious homoerotic charge between Louis and Lestat and Louis and Armand, but this is even more marked in the book, and I understand it was reduced in the film to protect the sensibilities of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Brad Pitt's flat delivery is ideal for the world-weary Louis, though I do think it a pity Anne Rice's suggestion that he should play Lestat was not taken up.<br/><br/>I already knew Brad could act, having seen Kalifornia.  This film convinced me that Tom Cruise really was an actor, not just a pretty boy trading on his face.  But the honours have to go to Kirsten Dunst as Claudia, an utterly believable child vampire."

Honestly I wanted to hug her, she can be my daughter anyday.  Tom Cruise was pretty good pick.  I didn't really enjoy Brad Pitt's character.  He did however do a good job playing it but his character just could've been cooler.  I don't know what everybody is talking about making stomach's churn.  This movie is not that gross at all.  In fact, I had a recent bet with a friend saying this movie is bloodier than Sam Raimi's Evil Dead.  You have got to be stupid or an idiot to think this movie is bloody.  I was expecting much more.

When you compare this film to other Vampire films(see titles listed above)this film is in a class by itself. however this film falls more along the lines of a period drama than a horror story, and it's spellbounding to watch. I got so into this film that I didn't want this movie to end. Several great actors and they all did a terrific job.Tom Criuse gave the best ever performance of his career as LeStat, Brad Pitt also had his career best performance in this film too. The music score is fantastic, the costumes are great, but this film keeps a somber feeling from start to finish. you can't take your eyes off of this film,You dont simply watch this film, you EXPERIENCE it. I missed this film when it was playing at the theater, and I didn't bother to rent it when it came out on video. I was at my brothers house and my sister-in-law played it in thier VCR (The movie had been out for at least 4 or 5 years) So I was a late bloomer to this film.-And I was captivated by it. I went 2 days later and purchased the film. It is one of only 2 Vampire films I have ever purchased for my own personal home video library(Bram Stoker's Dracula-1993 being the other -I also like the Blade films,but I consider them to be action films and not a true Vampire film). Upon watching this film the 2nd time, I realized what a great movie experience Interview with the Vampire is and what I had been missing out on all these years. I LOVE THIS FILM.

Can we just knock on the head the idea Anne Rice didn't like Tom as Lestat?(which I've seen quoted several times)  Here's a quote from her - for the rest see Miscellaneous on this page: From the moment he appeared Tom was Lestat for me. He has the immense physical and moral presence; he was defiant and yet never without conscience; he was beautiful beyond description yet compelled to do cruel things. The sheer beauty of Tom was dazzling, but the polish of his acting, his flawless plunge into the Lestat persona, his ability to speak rather boldly poetic lines, and speak them with seeming ease and conviction were exhilarating and uplifting.

For one thing, Lois never had a wife, it was his brother who died from falling off a balcony.

This film doesn't over-glamourise the vampire world but still makes it look intriguing rather than disgusting. It shows the story from the view-point of the vampire and is presented as a life story.

"Howlin Wolf","9","1","2","17 January 2002"," Vampires never looked so good... (POTENTIAL FOR SPOILAGE.)
","... in an aesthetic sense, I mean. For whilst the production design, costumes and photography are all lavish, this is a world away from the iconic, rock star status bestowed on vamps in such previous movies as '80's teen classic ""The Lost Boys"" for instance. (Quite ironic, really, given that I've just read that Lestat becomes a rock star in the follow up: ""Queen of the Damned"") The life of these vampires is shown to be all surface glitz, hiding the inexorable loneliness they feel at being the only ones around on the earth to witness life go through all its changes. The beauty of this movie is that you can take it anyway you want though; you can see it as a character study, straightforward thriller or period piece. It is ALL of these things, in fact, bound up in one glorious whole.<br/><br/>Allaying the fears of many an Anne Rice fanboy/girl (and even the author herself) when his casting was announced, Tom Cruise does fine in the pivotal role of Lestat de Lioncourt, an embittered, aristocratic and charismatic vampire who serves as a ghoulish guide to Louis (Brad Pitt) into the world of the undead. The common misconception is that Cruise can't act, you see, but he CAN. Unfortunately, he's just cursed with that 'idiot grin' so accurately skewered by the villain in MI:2. Still, gleaming gnashers aside, he's given many a good performance, and this is actually one of his best.<br/><br/>The rising star that was then Brad Pitt also does fine, although some wags (like me) will no doubt simply label his character 'a miserablist g*t'. It is Kirsten Dunst who waltzes away with the acting honours here though, delivering a frighteningly mature performance at such a young age. She really does look young here, and not like the lovely lady who sets this reviewer's heart a-flutter these days. I noticed a trend amongst users before me to categorise her character Claudia as 'evil'. I don't really understand this. She just seemed to me to be quite understandably PO'd that Lestat and Louis had stolen her childhood. (or rather, prolonged it interminably.) Besides, her companions are hardly paragons of virtue themselves, are they? Even Louis caves in the end... E-mail me if you feel you can shed any light on this issue.<br/><br/>Perennial Jordan favourite Rea also shows up. Then there's Antonio Banderas, whose character Armand doesn't really work at all. Also look out for Thandie Newton (yes, Mr Cruise's love object in the aforementioned MI:2) and Christian Slater, in a role undeserving of such a big name, which was probably only allocated to him in order to further 'up' the male totty factor.<br/><br/>There are several lavish setpieces on display, which work splendidly thanks to the invariably good acting and magnificent sets, and it's interesting to see a characters life explored that we don't usually get much insight into, beyond the usual garlic-phobic clich√É¬©s. For unadulterated horror fans, though, it's not really THAT scary; more a methodical exploration than an all out gorefest. It's all treated with the usual elegance by Jordan, who seems the perfect director to enliven Anne Rice's material because of his artistic sensibilities. So much so, in fact, that I had to abandon the exercise of reading the novel after seeing the film, because the movie had become the definitive version in my head, overshadowing everything that came from the true author's pen.<br/><br/>It is a shame, therefore, that I have been denied an aspect of my literary education by the film, but my movie-loving faculties have been stimulated instead. A wonderful film, see it if you haven't already."

","When I first sat down to watch IwTV I had no idea what is was about and no expectations so I was overwhelmed by the amazing plot, direction and of course acting. Dunst shows strength and depth of emotion in her role as Claudia which I have never seen from a child actor/actress and which is often lacking in many adult performances. Dunst and Pitt portray the very ambiguous relationship between Claudia and Louie with such aptness that even after Claudia has been killed I was still changing my mind and trying to decide whether as a couple they were father and daughter, siblings or lovers. We cannot of course forget the characterisation of Lestat de Lioncourt by Tom Cruise - truly magnificent. Cruise and Pitt together offer the compelling difference in attitudes, towards the Vampire existence, of Louie and Lestat without over dramatising the characters. The characters written by Ann Rice here truly excel: Louie, grieving his dead wife and child has nothing but contempt for his new found life, power, eternal youth and sees it only as a perpetual hell of damnation; and Lestat on the other hand sees his existence as his saving from the dull and meaningless human existence and approaches everything with an optimistic outlook which is rarely disappointed but Louie starts to bring him down and Claudia appears to be the solution. That she is until she becomes ""insane"". The way the plot then twists the characters around so Louie sees reason for life with the `rebirth' of Claudia and Lestats loss of passion due to the arguments with Claudia and Louie followed by the dramatic scene of the attempted take on his life. The story stays realistic though as no one does a full 180 in personality terms however long they live so the characters are brought right back to their original mind states when Louie meets Armand and Claudia is killed and when Lestat feeds upon the interviewee. Masterful script writing on all counts. If you are a person that prefers the thrills and spills of big screen action then you may enjoy this purely from the action and gor side but for those who are intrigued by original and interesting script writing, superb acting and powerful visual effects and images to empower the previously mentioned this is the movie for you and very much the movie for me."

","All in all, I give this movie ten out of ten.  It was, simply put, a great movie.  The visual effects were spellbinding, and the actors/actresses were unique and incredible within their individual roles.  In the beginning it was somewhat slow, but with time the story line progressed and you really get into it.  Kirsten Dunst, a newcomer at the time, will be forever remembered as Claudia -- the supposed ""vampire gone insane,""  as Lestat put it.  The emotions she poured into her portrayal of the vampire damned to eternal immortality and child-like appearance, were beyond realistic. Although I have never been a huge fan of Tom Cruise, I now appreciate him greatly for his acting.  I do not recommend this to anyone that cannot stomach gore.  It's not, of course, disgusting to the point of nausea, but it can be disturbing at times.<br/><br/>WARNING!  SPOILER --<br/><br/>The particular scene where Claudia persuades Lestat into drinking blood from the dead, and then slitting his throat, is not at all comforting in it's visuals.  I advise anyone not a fan of blood ( or death ), fake or real, to fast forward.  Thank you.<br/><br/>It holds outstanding performances, and overall the charm of the undead and the potency of heartfelt emotions. The relationship between Claudia and Louis is almost soothing compared to the occasional arrogance of Lestat's comments toward the both of them.  Regardless, you can't help but feel sympathy for the lovable, deceiving, serious, yet comedic Lestat.  In other words:  he's very multi-dimensional.  Anyway, see it!"

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what it is about this dark, melodramatic fantasy that I like so much, but it's certainly carved a niche in my all-time list. I can start with the great opening and closing sequences that bookend the film and continue on to the intense performances by Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, the brooding New Orleans and Paris landscape, the chilling musical score and on and on. I used to say I liked horror movies and I suppose I still do, somewhat ... and yes, the movie chills and thrills, but thanks to the characters and the screenplay, this is much more than a horror movie. I didn't go into this movie the first time with any particular interest in Anne Rice or anything but a curiosity. But this film has a heart, a soul, a horrible beauty, an ambiguous sexuality and many other elements that greatly intrigue me. At its heart, though, IWTV is about the heart and soul of Louie (Pitt) who lives with temptation and regret every day of his 200 years, which is something most of us can relate to. His performance, along with the spectacular ones of Cruise, Dunst and Banderas is spell-binding."

"flawless-1","10","1","2","29 July 2001"," Best movie ever made
","I can't say I read the book before seeing this film, but the movie based off of Anne Rice's ""Interview with the Vampire"" has inspired me to, and not only did I read the book, but I actually have the whole series now and am awaiting her future writings.<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire takes you into the world of Louis de Pointe du Lac, a two hundred year old vampire who tells the tale of his eternal life of hunger, betrayal, love, and suffering. The general mood of the movie is quite depressing, but this doesn't take you off guard, as the plot immediately sets in as soon as it starts, so make sure you're prepared from the beginning. Almost all of the movie is set in the late 1700s, then continues on a bit further, then briefly goes over the events throughout the nineteenth century. A note beforehand: This movie has some gore... it's not all about feeding on helpless victims or special effects, but about the first hour may seem very gory for some people, but this doesn't last long at all, so don't for one second start to think this is what the movie's all about.<br/><br/>**SPOILER WARNING**: Anyway, the immortal Louis (Brad Pitt) tells of his life as a vampire and his own personal hell. These vampires are beyond amazing- they are not just bloodsucking creatures, and feel as they felt as humans. This captivating tale takes you back to 1791, where Louis has turned suicidal what with the recent deaths of his wife and infant son. He roams to taverns, drunk, picking fights, with an invitation open to anyone to end his life. Soon a vampire, by the name of Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers Louis a life without pain, one that cannot end. Ever. Louis accepts, not really knowing what he's getting into, and so therefore Lestat transforms him into a vampire. Immediately the movie's theme mood is set: Louis is distressed. He despises his vampiric ways (You'll find out MUCH more about this if you read the book) and hates to kill more than anything. As explained in the novel, he was extremely sensitive about death due to his family's death, and simply could not take a human life. When he did kill, he felt awful and throughout his time with Lestat went bitter. As the movie continues- and you're praying for poor Louis to be happy- fights start breaking out between him and his maker, who only wants Louis to share his love of human blood and immortal power. <br/><br/>Then, one night, when Louis' hunger was unbearable, he drank from a little girl named Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and Lestat appeared... then, as a gift (as said in the book, but in the movie it's more brutal) Lestat makes her as one of them. Thankfully, the scenery changes, and there are a number of funny scenes- Claudia's clumsiness and Lestat's inevitable impatience- then, of course, Claudia started asking questions. After all, she was made immortal in such a small body and seeing all the older and larger women, she grew distraught and closer to Louis. In an unforgettable scene, she throws all her dolls out of a trunk and Lestat sees she hid a dead mortal in there... then, in a fury, she screams at Lestat and Louis, demanding answers, and then cuts her hair and runs into her room, only to scream even more hysterically when she sees it has all grown back in a matter of seconds. From here on, she is as Louis is, and then the plotting begins.<br/><br/>Let me add that this took me totally by surprise when I first saw the movie. Claudia had come to hate Lestat so much that she hints of killing him- and then does. Sweetly, she makes peace with him and leads him to two 'drunk' boys, who are actually dead, but filled with a poison that keeps their blood warm. As a rule, vampires can't drink dead blood or they'll go down into death with their victim. And so did Lestat... and in another breathtaking scene, he drinks from one of the boys and starts gasping for breath, thrashing around on the room and yelling for Louis, but by the time Louis arrives, Claudia has just cut Lestat's throat, and the two watch- Louis in shock, Claudia only smiling- as Lestat chokes on his blood and shrivels down on the floor, dead. The two fledgings then drop Lestat's body into the swamp, figuring the blood put an end to him. The two make plans for Paris, both wanting to seek out others of 'their kind' as Claudia put it, and then, on the night of their leave, they hear someone at the door. In a heart pumping scene, Louis opens it and sees no one is there. In a long moment of silence, he looks around strangely, and then turns around in confusion, when suddenly Lestat jumps up and shoves Louis against the wall, his hand around his throat. Louis then slams the door on Lestat's hand, making him back off into the street.<br/><br/>He picks up Claudia and the two run up the stairs. Entering a room, they stop in fear as music from the piano suddenly starts playing, and they see Lestat is there, alive and well... but, not exactly. The makeup in this scene is excellent. ""Claudia... you've been a very, VERY naughty little girl.."" He then attempts to harm Claudia, and with a thrust of his arm, Louis throws a lantern on Lestat, aflaming him. The two escape and barely make the ship, watching from afar the burning city of New Orleans. Another cheerful section of the movie is set in as the two arrive in Paris. ""We were alive again,"" Louis says. The scenes of Paris are also breathtaking... then the part with Armand comes.<br/><br/>A lot of people don't like Antonio Banderas as Armand. I agree. Armand is supposed to have a cherub face, but 'play the devil' inside, him only living up to 16 years of mortal life, but 500 as a vampire. Instead, the Armand in the movie has an evil expression... and the age not even appropriate for his character. Here, Louis so sadly seeks out the answers of their kind; what they are, where they come from, when Armand answers the best he can, when really they're both just falling in love with each other. Claudia immediately senses this, picking up a message from Santonio, Armand's evil side kick, and assumes Louis is going to leave her... and with thinking that, she demands Louis make a dollmaker from one of her favorite shops, by the name Sybelle, immortal. Louis desperately denies him ever leaving her, but still ends up making Sybelle immortal, in one of the most emotional and powerful scenes in the movie. And as soon as this resentful deed is done, Armand's vampires (from the Theatre Des Vampires) come and take them to the theatre. Santonio then orders Sybelle and Claudia executed, and Louis to be shut up in a coffin for eternity. They want to punish them because Santonio thinks Louis killed his maker, and also, though not known to Louis ever before, children are NOT allowed to be made vampires.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the killing of Claudia and Sybelle is successful- with regretful Armand shutting himself up in a room while the three screamed for him beforehand- but he gets Louis out right away, who then discovers the bodies of the two vampires, and then- in one of my favorite scenes- slowly walks out of the room and turns to the vampires, with the most powerful glow in his eyes, full of hatred. And for a good reason. That night, he returns, and burns the Theatre Des Vampires to the ground, killing all of them except Armand, who then saves Louis from the daylight, as he wasn't exactly keeping track of time while destroying all of his enemies. The two are then together, but not for long. In an emotional scene, Louis confronts him, and of how he could have stopped them, and with that, leaves Armand.<br/><br/>This is the part that kills you. The music from the beginning comes back- ""Medley"", the theme song, which is extremely sad- and as it was as his last days of mortality, when he longed to die, the mood is the exact same but worse. By now anyone watching the film feels his pain terribly, and he talks about what he did after that, recklessly traveling from country to country. ""But the world was a tomb to me; a graveyard full of broken statues, and each of those statues resembled her face."" He then tells of how the technological miracle, film, let him see the sunrise for the first time in 200 years. The movie is definitely concluding, but not before Lestat pops up again. Coming out of the theater, Louis catches the scent of death as he walks into a graveyard... but it wasn't coming from the graves. He continues to walk and then finds Lestat, weak, dry, his back to him, talking in a small voice. The reunion isn't too long... in a touching moment, Louis comforts Lestat when he fearfully cowers when a pilot comes over them, and then, pretty much Lestat telling him of how he can be like he was in the old days, Louis simply says ""I have to go"" and leaves him there. He then goes on to say he lives on, night after night, feeding on those who cross his path. The scene comes back to the setting of the first, where Louis has just told this all to an eager reporter (Christian Slater) by the name of Daniel. Daniel then comes to say that he's not dead, and with a sudden outburst, Louis comes and threatens him, scaring Daniel away. He runs out of the building and into his car, racing along the street. Daniel then starts to calm down, joking to himself a little, when suddenly Lestat comes up behind him and sinks his fangs into his neck. Daniel screams out as the car swerves madly on a fast moving highway, and then, Lestat, regaining the wheel, hears Louis' tape playing. ""Have you heard enough? I've had to listen to that... for centuries!"" Lestat sneers, then turning it back to the radio. ""Don't be afraid. I'm going to give you the choice...I, never had.""<br/><br/>He then looks at Daniel and starts laughing mockingly, which, is a very funny ending, as it reminds you of his cockiness in the beginning of the movie. It ends with an upbeat tune of 'Guns and Roses', the singer actually telling about his immortality when the credits come on. This, truly, is a classic.<br/><br/>The movie goes through three stages: Louis becoming a Vampire- His meeting Lestat and learning the ways of a vampire, the suffering even more intense and neverending. Falling in Love- A part of the movie where it's actually funny and somewhat high spirited, how he fell in love with Claudia, still mixed in with a vampiric sense of evil. And then... the happiness ends. Surviving it All- Conclusion to the movie, where it's back to where it was in the beginning, only far worse. The last scene is great and it sets the mood for the other Anne Rice books, and the upcoming sequel of this movie, 'Queen of the Damned' due out in October, starring Aaliyah (none of the IWTV cast).<br/><br/>If you can understand English, you should see this movie. I love it! If you want more info email me. It truly is a classic."
"goevikes","9","1","2","18 July 2001"," seriously cool
","I was a bit skeptical of this when I went to see it. I have been a long time fan of the Anne Rice books and I couldnt help but groan when I heard who was playing the leads. In fact my doubts were overruled as soon as the film started. I am forced to grudgingly admit that both Cruise and Pitt did a good job in this and I like this movie very much. The film is stunning and beautiful and its not often that I use those words unsarcastically. My only complaint is that Interview With The Vampire left out a few key plot points (Lestat's father being first among them) Which prevent making a sequel from the much better book The Vampire Lestat which would make an awesome movie (yes, even with Cruise as lead). This flick also made Lestat into more of a villian for added dramatics. Kirsten Dunst as Claudia is really cool and she's the sort of character that you love to hate. I give the film an A+."
"Maxta","9","1","2","14 July 2001"," Vampires not as monsters, but living things.
","This movie showed us the other side of the vampire, the side that, like us all, is searching for the meaning of it all. The side that loves, that feels lonely, that seeks companionship. Unlike movies such as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", who care to portray vampires as ugly, primitive, uncivilised monsters, we are presented with vampires that yearn to discover the meaning of it all, yearn to move with the times and yearn to see once again the sunrise they have forsaken.<br/><br/>The acting by all characters in this film is quite extraordinary, with special mention going to Kirsten Dunst for her portrayal of Claudia. Every facial shot of her expressed so much emotion for such a young girl making us truly believe she really is a much older, wiser, killer. Tom Cruise also deserves mention. Although many tend to see Lestat as a villian, I saw him more as just a vampire who enjoys what he is, unlike Louis who has just come to grips with the endless killing. The fantastic make up for all the vampires, especially Lestat's, also gave much to the film. Quite a brilliant scene when Lestat returns from the swamp playing the piano. Spine tingling!<br/><br/>Other excellent points about the film include the soundtrack, following the timeframe to perfection. The costume design, again with special mention for Claudia. And the architecture of everything from New Orleans to London to Paris.<br/><br/>For a different, and refreshing view of vampires. See this movie. A brilliant movie on all counts. 9 out of 10. See it, you won't be disappointed."

","i came across Anne Rice's original novel before i caught the movie on TV last year(long enough, huh?^^yeah i know it's rated R(A) here and i was not yet 18 then...too much blood, i guess^^) well anyway, i watched it. it was thrilling, but lacked a certain atmosphere of mystery as the novel, nevertheless they did a good job in bringing such a story to life. i guess the mesmerising quality is in the story itself: immortals, eternally young and beautiful, with supernatural powers, walking in darkness with pride, no longer the appalling monsters with fangs. but they are suffering emotionally, once or now (yes even including Lestat) because they all WERE mortals, and some of them never get free of the past.<br/><br/>personally i like the art design the most: the buildings, the furniture, the costume (lace, lace, lace^^), and my favourite goes to Armand's Theater, exactly as what i thought when i read the book!<br/><br/>the cast was, too, excellent. anyone who says Brad Pitt is not as good as Tom Cruise should go and check the scene when Louis saw the ashes of Claudia and Madeline. i think Brad Pitt was perfect for our most human, tender, weak, guilty (and sometimes fanatic) Louis; Tom Cruise was Lestat the Brat Prince himself, the cunning and devilish boy enjoying his immortal powers; Claudia was an amazing doll-like woman (the performance was almost flawless); Armand, in physical appearance, was not quite the one (he was supposed to be 17 when he became immortal as in the novel), but Antonio Bandreas gave a brilliant interpretation of the experienced yet innocent being (Armand, in my opinion, is the most passionate vampire of all, despite his oh-so-cool looking in this movie^^). as a whole this movie dazzled.<br/><br/>but (as i have mentioned, the book was certainly better) there was too much sentimental stuff. (i guess the director wanted us to pity the vampires, but...?) and a large part of the original novel that describes Louis and Claudia's journey to Paris was cut. i thought that part was too good to miss. the later part of the novel was a bit too fast and the story seemed to end in a hurry...<br/><br/>after all it was a splendid movie. yet still i strongly recommend the novel to those who want to explore the world of the human immortals. the complete CHRONICLES consist of 5 novels, with INTERVIEW as the 1st. personally i like the 2nd, THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, the best, and really hope that it would be made to a movie, too. there's also the NEW TALES OF THE VAMPIRES, which consist of the beautiful THE VAMPIRE ARMAND and PANDORA so far.<br/><br/>
and i would like to comment a bit on the *homo* side of the movie that was mentioned in one of the comments...^^well, i guess it was sort of a very strong emotional attachment between the vampires (think of how few there were of their kind). but Lestat and Armand did have some special relationship in the past (no dirty stuff, i guarantee, but very interesting to read) mentioned in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT, and Armand himself was deeply attached to Louis, too. but no relationship parallels the bond between Armand and his maker, the legendary Marius (mentioned in THE VAMPIRE LESTAT and detailed in THE VAMPIRE ARMAND), it was a bit bold, but very touching^^essentially there is NO physical relationship between any vampires, so i hope people get clear of the picture that they are only strongly attached and felt for each other, especially between a maker and his fledgling(s). (maybe not for Lestat: he makes vampires out of fun sometimes^^)<br/><br/>so all in all to those who love the movie: read the novels, and i'm almost sure that you'll fall for at least one of the vampires (mine is Marius, for example^^). they're simply lovable."

","This is definitely one of the top most memorable vampire movies out there. A definite classic, it takes its story from the vampire's point of view and shatters everything we think we know about them regarding Vlad the Impaler, crosses, bloodlust and nearly everything else. Tom Cruise is at the height of his career with this role that he should most definitely reprise, Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas as both spellbinding and Christan Slater makes the most of the scenes he has. My favorite of course is future babe Kirsten Dunst who plays the female vampire trapped immortally and eternally as a child. The only thing that gets me through the rest of this is the hope that Pitt finds away to bring her back, but seeing Cruise's incessant returns just when you think he's really gone also kept me watching. Lestat's and Louis's odd twisted partnership of less than friends and more than enemies is very similar to that of Barnabus And Angelique on TV's Dark Shadows. The whole surreal situation seems to be the real plot of the movie and the true calling of the Anne Rice material. Ten Stars to this film, its stars and its legacy !"

Kirstan Dunst captured Claudia wonderfully also, her brilliance and her strength and everything that went with the character. I thought Daniel was played very well too as he is one of my favorite characters. The little problem with the cast was the character of Armand as i imagined him to be a 16 year old boy with curly auburn hair, but even with the physical differences i thought he was wonderful still in the movie.<br/><br/>The story line itself was rather good too, a very captivating story without being too boring.

The entire cast is brilliant, and Tom Cruise showed for the first time that he was more than just a pretty face. The costumes, make-up and scenery are wonderful. Having read the book (and many other Anne Rice novels), I must say that this is one movie that I feel surpassed the book itself. It brought the characters alive and maintained the atmosphere throughout. Some may object to the violence or ""gruesome"" bits but to be perfectly honest, what kind of vampire movie would it be without it?!

","24 November 2009. Before Buffy the Vampire Slayer or perhaps more pertinent, before Angel, there was Brad Pitt, a creole who became a vampire who shunned his new nature derived from Lestat played by Tom Cruise. This dark look at the undertones of raw and gritty vampirism put flesh to the undead without the luxurious trappings of modernity and romance. Instead there is the bittersweet of trust, disloyality, of evil and even love. This Hannibal Lector dichotomy is well captured by Tom Cruise and the curse of the undead is lived by Brad Pitt along with the young actress Kirsten Dunst who may have been the most intriguing character of all. A well-paced and psychologically penetrating family drama of the occult kind. 9/10."
"ThomasDrufke","5","1","3","16 October 2016"," Peculiar, Bloody Horror
","I'm always down for a horror film that switches up the conventional tropes of the genre. Interview with the Vampire certainly does that, but it also fails to capture one's undivided attention for a full 2 hours.<br/><br/>Coming out in 1994, this was the very beginnings of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's rise to fame, and that plays into a lot of the fun with the film. Cruise plays a seasoned vampire, Lestat, who seeks out a partner in crime, Brad Pitt, to be the next vampire along his side. Pitt had dealt with plenty of loss in his life and so a step away from his normal life and into the immortal life isn't the worst thing. But Lestat's harsher ways of living prove to be too much for Pitt's 'Louis' character. And there you have much of the first half of the film.<br/><br/>It's pretty weird watching these established actors back when they were obviously taking on more risky roles such as these. I can't see either of the two taking on a vampire film now, so I guess that adds to the uniqueness of this film. There's plenty of bloody fun to be had with the film. There aren't a ton of scares, which is disappointing, but there's no shortage of obscure Cruise monologues and slasher twists.<br/><br/>With that said, the film takes an unexpected turn about half way through, and the rest of the story falls of the rails because of it. So much so that the first and second hour feel like completely different stories. Mixed in you get a touching arc about Louis taking in a young Kirsten Dunst, who is surprisingly great (at only 12 years of age), but it's not enough to overcome a really weak second half.<br/><br/>To me, the film is at its best when it explores the dynamic between Louis and Lestat, and lets Cruise and Pitt go crazy with dialogue and peculiar actions. Once we dive deep into why there are vampires and Antonio Banderas' character, the film falls flat.<br/><br/>+Cruise & Pitt playing strange/creepy vampires<br/><br/>+Bloody fun first half<br/><br/>-Flat second half<br/><br/>5.8/10"

","Tom Cruise seemed almost a natural to play Lestat in Interview With the Vampire. The locations were excellent, the late-18th-century set design superb, and the cinematography competent.<br/><br/>But director Neil Jordan seemed at a loss for ways to give the plot primacy. As a result, Cruise and Pitt had to distract the viewer from the film's substance deficit by playing up their screen presences. The former, unfortunately, overshadowed the latter beyond what the script required.<br/><br/>It's as though Jordan, who has done very creditable work on films that dealt with his native Ireland (The Crying Game, Michael Collins), let Louisiana languor swamp his direction. Jordan recognized that he'd gone about things in an ""unconscious"" way (see his IMDb bio). His interpretation remolded, circumscribed, and sometimes denatured the seamless world into which scenarist and author Anne Rice had long lured her readers. The film, Jordan said, ""seemed to me to be about guilt."" <br/><br/>Viewers who had read Rice's novel by the same name may find it hard to believe that she had much of a hand in the final product. Still, as vampire films go, this one is truer to the literary genre than most. But judging by my stubbornly wandering thoughts, it did not work.<br/><br/>To hazard a hypothesis: Sensing that Jordan was adrift, Cruise commandeered directorial and authorial control. And ultimately he sapped the film's vitality by diverting and squandering its essence."

","I watched this film with preconceived expectations that it would be a masterpiece seeing as how it derived from the masterpiece that is Anne Rice's novel and due to the cast that's brimming with talent. I, however, was bitterly disappointed. The regard by which I esteem Anne Rice for her amazing storytelling capabilities makes me refuse to believe that she took part in the making of this movie! Yet I can't quite pinpoint exactly where the movie went wrong. At times Brad Pitt's acting seemed exquisite and perfect yet at other times it was over-dramatic. One thing for sure this lad was certainly out of his area of expertise. Tom Cruise as Lestat was wonderful. Kirsten Dunst also played Claudia skillfully and so the only thing i can attribute the fail of this movie to is the directing. Also the editing and music choices were awful and over-dramatic. WE NEED A REMAKE!"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","1","3","11 February 2007"," Interview With a Whining Sadsack
","Prior to Interview With the Vampire it had always seemed like quite a fun idea to be a bloodsucker. Not only do you get to spend eternity feasting on large bosomed women, but you get to stay up late, too. Who could ask for more? Well, Neil Jordan put pay to those notions. Here we have vampires who wallow in guilt, act bored and feed on rats. In other words, immortality sucks.<br/><br/>However, the film doesn't. And the film succeeds because it makes the undead the focus of the story rather than being a sideshow. For once they're allowed to be something other than monsters. But that's not to say that everything in the film works. For example, why do vampires always have to have long hair? Is this part of the curse of being immortal ¬ñ that you can't have a decent haircut? Indeed, this may very well be the case, as there's a scene in the film that addresses this very issue. At one point Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) hacks her hair off only to see it grow back. No wonder so many vampires go mental.<br/><br/>Another vampiric clich√© I can't get my head around are the clothes. Does getting bitten suddenly give you a taste for rumpled cuffs and billowing shirts? Of course this is mainly a result of the goth subculture that has appropriated these types of stories, but I can't help but feel that nothing is less practical as regards bloodsucking than a large white shirt ¬ñ eating spaghetti Bolognese in a similar sort of garb is bad enough.<br/><br/>But the goth influence, for better or worse, is present through the whole story. For instance you have the main character's perpetual moaning. Now, in less assured hands, this could have rendered the film unwatchable, but Jordan juggles the tone expertly, including enough soul searching and despair to make it interesting, but never wallowing in it. Another goth influence is the rampant homoeroticism. More than once it seems that we're going to have some hot man on man vampire love action, but it never actually materialises. Instead what you have is story about a thinly veiled gay couple. Take the first encounter between Lestat and Louis. Louis is bitten and then shown ascending to the heavens in a painful but orgasmic embrace. And then later you have Lestat's desperate attempts to ensure that his 'companion' doesn't stray. He gives Louis a daughter and they become a dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>However, I think the family aspect is one of the film's most successful elements. It allows room for the characters to develop and it also provides some much needed humour. One of my favourite bits has to be when Claudia is seen killing various hired hands. There's a dressmaker who gets bitten and then, best of all, a piano teacher gets killed ¬ñ the comic timing, with the man's head striking the piano at the right moment, is wonderful. And I also love the way that Lestat is only annoyed that she's killing in their household ¬ñ she's disciplined like she hasn't tidied her room properly.<br/><br/>But while there are plenty of humorous moments, the film does also have some more disturbing scenes. For example, there's the prolonged killing of a buxom wench who gets to experience her own coffin (but even that scene has some dry humour). And then you have an attractive woman getting fed on at a pretentious French vampire theatre. Both scenes don't hold back and help lend the film a seriousness and weight that is seldom seen in a genre that is often bogged down by camp.<br/><br/>Another excellent scene that pulls no punches is the scene where Louis exacts his revenge on a group of garlic eating bloodsuckers. He burns them and chops them into pieces. And it's kind of what you've always been waiting for someone to do in a vampire film. After all, I can't be the only one who's wondered whether so called immortal creatures would be so immortal if you chopped them in half and burnt them to a crisp¬Öcan I? Obviously not.<br/><br/>And that leads me to another wonderful scene. I love the re-emergence of Lestat after he's 'murdered'. It's superbly filmed with Cruise obscured by billowing curtains as he plays the piano. And the idea of him having to survive on the blood of crocodiles, toads and snakes is a magnificent one.<br/><br/>And it must be pointed out that Cruise is excellent in the film. As he's proved recently there's something rather disturbing under the million dollar grin, and it certainly comes out here. In fact, I always think he's more convincing as a bastard. Magnolia, Collateral and Rain Man are other prime examples. But one negative that comes out of his presence is the fact that the film suffers when he's not there. I mean, Pitt is pretty good in the film, but his role is rather thankless. Louis certainly isn't a barrel of laughs (unlike Lestat who has lots of memorable moments, one of my favourites being his dance with Claudia's dead mother ¬ñ I love the way he drops her dead body on the floor like she's a piece of trash).<br/><br/>Almost as memorable as Lestat, though, is Kirsten Dunst's performance as Claudia. Petulant and greedy, she pulls off a difficult character with ease. Indeed, it's rather strange seeing Dunst perform so well, because she's certainly failed to live up to her early promise in her adult roles.<br/><br/>The only weak link in the film is Banderas. There's nothing behind the posturing and half of his dialogue is unintelligible. But the magnificent visuals, lush score and impressive production values make his presence easy to forget ¬ñ sure the film is one of glittering surfaces with petulant whining masquerading as depth, but the film has enough going for it to make the shortcomings easy to forgive."

","I thought this movie was brilliant. It is a bit different from the book because this picture does not show the life of Lestat before he met Louis, as the book did, but the movie still was very transfixing. Also in the movie Louis does not tell much about his life before becoming a vampire. He only tells that he was depressed and wished for death. In the book he goes into great detail about his life before becoming a vampire.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it could have been better, but it was still more than acceptable. Tom Cruise was not the best choice for Lestat. They needed someone taller, and with a bit more reserve. But Cruise exemplified Lestat's ruthlessness quite well. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt was an excellent choice for Louis. He played the role very well. He captured the charisma and humility of Louis. <br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was good as the character of Claudia, but she could have done better. In the book, it seemed to me as if she would be older, maybe 16 years old or so. But in the movie she is played out to be no more than 10 or 11 years old. <br/><br/>Antonio Banderas was very good as the character of Armand. He could have been a bit more krass, but he was still very good for the part.<br/><br/>Overall, I would rate this movie as 4 stars. Others may disagree because it does not strictly follow the book, but the movie was excellent. It would have been terrible if Anne Rice had not been supervising and intervening during the production of the film.<br/><br/>~Aaron"

Now, Banderas as Armand was a bad call, as Armand was supposed to be 17 years old when he was made, Russian, and with auburn hair. Banderas is old, Latin, and has long black hair, the complete opposite.<br/><br/>I suggest reading the Vampire Chronicles before seeing this movie though, so you get a real feel for the characters.<br/><br/>As for the comment above, Interview (in the novel) DID NOT delve into Lestat's past, the next book entitled The Vampire Lestat did.<br/><br/>Anyways, I give this movie 2 thumbs up, one of my favourite of all time."

"katiepoppycat","Null","1","3","8 July 2004"," a beautiful adaptation
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire is a powerful, moving opening chapter of a story. I think it's a shame that Ann Rice had to jump on the cash cow and take it long past the point where it's interesting any more, but here is not the place for that discussion.  I followed the ups and downs of the movie adaptation with great interest - Rice's hostility to the actors, her campaigns against the film, and her subsequent retraction of her objections. That alone makes this an interesting film.  However, it is as powerful, and moving as the book itself.  The long slow unfolding of the loss of Louis's soul and his tortured quest to retain his humanity is one of the most powerful performances I have ever seen, and contrasts beautifully with Lestat's devil-may-care, detached killer.  Yet all along, one feels that Lestat has depths that he is hiding - Cruise obviously read the chronicles and occasionally hints at the philosopher lurking under Lestat's pale skin. Kirsten Dunst also turns in a memorable performance as the woman forced to live in the body of a child.  It's a shame that they couldn't keep Claudia's age as it was in the book, but no six year old could ever have lived up to the role.  She is the perfect vampire - with no memory of her human life she is cold and remorseless in her killing.  Yet, she is also strangely vulnerable, and the death of Claudia still makes me cry, despite having seen the film so many times in the ten years since it's release.  The atmosphere of the film is delicately handled, from the swampy, sultry airs of New Orleans to decadent 19th Century Paris.  Antonio Banderas hints at the depths of Armand's character, and his coven are as repulsive as they are in the books.  This is one adaptation that can hold it's own as film in it's own right, as well as doing justice to the book - a rare thing, until LOTR came along.  I only wish Jordan had kept the reins and prevented the travesty that was Queen of the Damned."

The majority of people out there don't realize what this kind of tripe is really inspired by. It is inspired by women's childhood sexual molestation issues.

"alainenglish","Null","1","3","1 May 2004"," Rich, dark adaption of the novel (major spoilers ahead)
","""Interview With The Vampire"" is a noteworthy motion picture in today's times.  Much debate has been written about the translation of great literature to the screen and while the source novel itself is not really that old (it was written in 1976), it has gone on to be considered a classic in vampire lore.  It is then interesting to watch how Rice's text adapts itself (it was she who penned the screenplay) to the film medium.  The only major problem, as rich as this film is, it has slight inconsistencies that will baffle any viewer that has not read ""Interview"" or its follow-ups.<br/><br/>The film begins flying into downtown San Francisco through to the window of a quiet room, cut off from the busy world outside.  A vampire, Louis (Brad Pitt), recounts the story of his life to an intrigued journalist (Christian Slater).  A plantation owner living near New Orleans, Louis had recently lost his life and his daughter and had sunk into a self-destructive depression.  He meets Lestat (Tom Cruise), a vampire.  He's attracted by Louis' pained grieving and persuades Louis to let him turn him into a vampire.  Louis, however, regrets the decision and refuses to share Lestat's love for hunting and killing humans.  To remedy this, Lestat gives him a companion, an orphaned child Claudia (a very young Kirsten Dunst), to keep him company.  However, Claudia comes to resent Lestat for turning her, sparking off a tide of events that take Louis from New Orleans, to Paris and back...<br/><br/>The story has many strong themes, and it does not take the traditional view of vampires as purely monsters (as depicted in ""Dracula"" and countless rip-off Hollywood films) but sees them as individual personalities.  The very fact they will never die, and thus never change, is what truly cuts them off from humanity.  Therein they must live off the blood of those who do change, in order to survive.  This is the very fate that most deeply affects Claudia, condemned to spend her eternal life in the body of a child. Louis resists his vampiric urges and ponders, in his own self-pitying way, the meaning of eternal life.  Lestat, on the other hand, has no time for that and enjoys indulging his bloodthirsty cravings.  If you're going to live forever,  you may as well enjoy it.<br/><br/>This bleeds into other themes too.  When Louis and Claudia discover the Parisian Theatre of the Vampires, and Armand (Antonio Banderas), Louis discovers that there vampires are mutually inable to discern their history. In trying to do so, however, they end up decadent and marooned in the past. To count this, Armand advises disregarding the past altogether and embracing the changes of the future.  He says to secure Louis' affections, and Louis very nearly takes him on. <br/><br/>There are inconsistencies.  You would need to have read ""The Vampire Lestat"" to understand how Lestat has powers slightly different from other vampires, thus enabling him to survive Claudia and Louis' attempts to kill him, not to mention his ability to fly at will.  This is not explained sufficiently in the movie.  Yet these are minor nitpickings, for the main semblance of the story is intact and the film is all the better for it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt makes for a thoughtful, contemplative yet at the same time passionate Louis.  It is very easy to sympathise with him.  Tom Cruise (initially derided by author Anne Rice) attacks the part of Lestat with a dark, charismatic relish.  Kirsten Dunst is a strong, tragic presence as the doomed Claudia.  Antonio Banderas is fine as Armand, even if he does not generate the homoerotic tension necessary to understand his attraction to Louis.  Stephen Rea is quite happy to go clownishly over-the-top as the sadistic vampire actor Santiago. <br/><br/>The film is very well shot, with some wonderfully sweeping cinematography from Philippe Rousselot.  This is accompanied by Eliot Goldenthal's eerie music score, which is seamlessly weaved in with classical music from Beethoven, Handel and even Mick Jagger.  The direction is good, but anyone expecting a scare-fest will be disappointed.  The film is not overtly frightening, but the more physical scenes, with the vampires and their victims, are appropriately bloody and erotic.<br/><br/>A rich, dark and exquisite picture.  Well recommended."

Anne Rice is not Bram Stoker and thus does not write her books or the screen play as he would.

","¬ëInterview' has been a long time for me one of those movies you keep meaning to see until you finally do, years later. Now that I have, I can only express my disappointment. I don't think the slightest attempt was made to capture the romance, the passion, and the pure ambience of the story. Now I do concede, as has been said many times, that if a novel is good enough to be made into a movie, it's probably not even worth it. It's old news that the book is always better than the movie. I grant this, but much more still could have been done with it. This movie should have been an homage to the novel, but it was in fact a disgrace.<br/><br/>However, as a film it did have some redeeming qualities. The cinematography was beautiful, the acting superb. Tom Cruise is in his element here (larger-than-life characters) and they don't get much larger than the Vampire Lestat. I cannot envision anyone else take on the role the way he did. Pitt I was surprised and impressed with, though I was doubtful at first of his being cast. Kirsten Dunst shows amazing talent. I have a common gripe ¬ñ Banderas as Armand. Though, incredibly, he does some acting, he's a terrible choice for the part. And I would have liked to hear them all adopt a French accent.<br/><br/>The ending was horrendous, the worst possible example of creative license I have ever seen, and gave an awful impression of the real story.<br/><br/>Definitely read the books; don't bother with the movie if you're looking for more than performance.

I first saw this when it was released and it was kind of a revelation, in its presentation and storyline. Vampires had rarely been depicted in such a 'normal' manner. They had only escaped the serious/campy vampire identity via farcical vampire films. But, for the most part, I felt like I was watching ""Pretty Hair of the Pretty Vampires"", or yet another farce. Brad Pitt was pretty then, though, have to admit. But the mistakes, horrid makeup, and strange editing (like they had something to hide in the sets/effects) had me turning it off halfway. Not to mention all the gore, which I didn't remember, and much of it is gratuitous, but I guess the true horror fans will love that. Granted, I am more picky than in 1994, but no reason this movie should be this bad. Even the script (adapted by Anne Rice from her novel) had a lot of sad moments (perhaps the reason I never got through the book). Oh, and don't get me started on Tom Cruise's accent and acting flaws.

"johnnyboyz","4","1","4","19 July 2011"," Too bad it wasn't done in the style of a ""Vox Populi"", since that's about as much as I could've taken of what this particular vampire had to say.
","When we begin, we begin with a quite wonderful opening crane shot detailing the night sky of San Francisco before rearing downwards onto the embittered road level; the camera moves through an array of people on a street lit only by the meekness of an array of tall lamps, as various folk are pushed through with a real sense that the track is trying to get somewhere specific, as if trying to look for someone. Alas, we settle on that of a motel room; a cut to within revealing that of a man standing with his back to us gazing motionlessly out of a window, as a second man jitters together some sound equipment with a far more animated disposition. If the opening crane shot instilled this sense of looking or desiring somebody to zero in on, it is a shame that it is the man whose story is eventually told we've had selected for us; Neil Jordan's Interview with the Vampire a grotesque spectacle, a spiralling, idiotic freak show of a movie without merit nor a drive for the unabashed and quite disgusting places it goes. <br/><br/>It is Brad Pitt playing the titular vampire named Louis de Pointe du Lac, a man who claims to have lived as far back as the late 1700's and is on the way to being immortal, all of which was born out a certain meeting with a certain someone whom gave him unspeakable ability under this guise of what many refer to as Vampirism. Here and now, in the late 1980s, he meets with a reporter named Molloy (Slater) to lay bare his tale, a character fronting the titular interview; Molloy very much acting out the role of the audience in regards to probing certain quandaries and reacting to certain revelations. Jordan's film is little more than a repulsive, flitting circus side-act feeding, if you excuse the pun, off a core premise reading: ""there's a vampire in contemporary times ‚Äì he's had to kill people to live but never felt good about it; he's lived for two hundred years, and stuff's happened during that time."" Whilst later helming 2005's more rounded and, in comparison to this, certainly more successful Breakfeast on Pluto, as a curiously offbeat male hopping from instance to instance; from locale to locale, some stranger than others; some funnier; some scarier, not once are we provided any stone-wall reason to get behind Pitt's du Lac nor find anything of what happens in Interview with the Vampire remotely anything more than a big, fat and bloody waste of time.<br/><br/>We begin with du Lac's life taking a turn for the worst when he looses his wife and child, suicidal ideation then following before he meets that of Lestat; a vampire whom does what is necessary to turn du Lac into what he is, doom him to immortality but essentially grant him a new ""lease of life"", so to speak. It is Tom Cruise playing Lestat, an overly encroaching role for a man we usually rather enjoy watching, or indeed backing, in whatever predicament in whatever other film we've seen the man in - a role here which we have precious little pleasure in watching him play, and one in which he brings an aggressive amount of overacting to proceedings. Through a lot of blood; some frayed morals running in sync with a lot of flayed other stuff, du Lac succumbs to his torn mindset and comes to kill a human being in order to survive.<br/><br/>Life as a vampire sees these curious beings waltz around sporting big, bulging eyes; veins all over one's face and neck and generally look a little worse for wear as is. In spite of this, they are a big hit on the social scene and especially with the women of the piece. Du Lac and Lestat whisk from one place to another, du Lac's desire to spare human's and seek a more concrete understanding of life as a vampire seeing his philosophical demeanour in stark contrast to that of his friend and rival's lust for blood and misogynist indulgences which often lead on to an array of agonising female death's misguidedly precipitated as cinematic spectacle. Issues open up with the introduction of Kirsten Dunst's character Claudia, the indulging in her relationship with Cruise problematic if only because that old ""unreliable narrator"" scourge rears up; an hour or so has gone past and nothing in this guy's life has changed, we're continuing down the blood-lust trail full of murders, of which nobody else around appears to notice, and everything's just a bit gooey and unpleasant.<br/><br/>Long after Pitt's character has 'died' within, the film has died on its feet; a deeply unpleasant film covering what is effectively just a lot of killing and nonsense dressed up with tonally self-important voice-overs and this sense of the grandeur: a lot of time goes by, he travels the world; meets an array of people, some die and some do not ‚Äì all of it amounting to very little bordering on absolutely nothing at all. As du Lac questions his own existence and reasons for presence in this world as what he is, we begin to question why it is that we're all hearing his banal tale at all; a flimsy, misjudged biopic of somebody whose premise for coming about to even exist looses weight very quickly and just becomes very dull on top of what is a bloody, episodic chore covering a great deal but doing very little. The similarly constructed Forrest Gump arrived in cinemas mere months prior to Jordan's mess, a genuinely humorous; fun; life-affirming piece hopping through the ages with a joke every other thirty seconds covering this man's life from one instance to the next - begging the question: why stand when you can sit?"

","Neil Jordan's Inverview with the Vampire strikes me as one of those films which can only be appreciated if you read the novel, which I have not. Like Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein (which came out in the same year) this is not really a horror film, it is a glamorous Gothic drama, but not a very good one. Quite frankly it is boring, lacking in direction, and features too much dialog which is intended to be poetic or melodramatic, but instead strikes me as silly. <br/><br/>It starts in a tiny hotel room, with a journalist played by Christian Slater. He is interviewing Louis, a dapper young fellow, who proceeds to dictate the story of how he became a vampire. It started when he met L'estad de Lioncourt in 18th century France, who offered to show him the the ways of darkness. From there the story becomes a series of strange chapters, decade after decade, century after century. If I was in Slater's shoes I would be asleep, long before Louis finished his story.<br/><br/>One of the differences between novels and movies is the amount of story. A book can take as much time as it wants, while a movie needs to cut things down a bit for structure. It is for this reason that I am sure Interview with the Vampire is an excellent and very intriguing book. As a movie however, it is a dud."

Once he exited the movie the energy level went down and I couldn't wait for it to end.  The main problem is Pitt, who pardon the phrase, was as stiff as a corpse.  Through the entire movie he just seemed bored.  Once Cruise left we are stuck with him and then they introduce a very bland Banderos who also offers very little.  Dunst does rather good as the girl vampire and Slater is also good, though he is not in this one very much.  What to say about the plot, there sort of is none.  It is mainly Pitt telling a reporter about his early days as a vampire, nothing to horrific is really featured in this one.  Just a bunch of people in those old time clothes.

","This film begins on a very interesting premise: the intrinsic sadness of being immortal, having to live from other people's blood, aimlessly wondering through time and history. Definitely a more existential take of the vampire myth. Unfortunately, it falls short of portraying these issues in a dramatically compelling way. Despite the remarkable art-direction and the unnoticeably creative digital effects, Jordan's direction is clunky and episodic without an acute sense of pace that might have given some life to a drab charting of events on a vampire's 200 year life span. There is practically no focal point in the plot apart from a vague sense of seeking some meaning in a vampire life, something that is forced in the movie than developed, lacking decent scenes to support it. When the film tries to get serious, it becomes laughable mainly due to badly written dialogue and to catastrophic performances. Tom Cruise tries but fails to become convincing as a brash, hedonistic vampire aristocrat, Brad Pitt is totally inept in conveying any sense of existential anguish and Banderas is as usually monolithic. A truly missed opportunity for a compelling take on the vampire myth."

","What I found most disturbing about this movie is its almost cult-like popularity with some gen-X fans. I know one young woman who owns the video and watches it on a regular basis. (She's seen it dozen of times.) She says its additively fascinating to her, something like watching an execution. Is it any wonder that events like the shootings at Columbine High are routine when blood drinking, sadism and homo-eroticism comprise acceptable ""entertainment"" for young people? It is frightening that in so many scenes the victim begs for mercy and is simply ignored, desensitizing the viewer to human suffering. The victim is not a person--he/she is ""dinner."" I found the scene where the young (naked) woman pleads for her life but is nevertheless turned over to a hungry vampire hoard particularly disturbing. The makers of this film should be jailed. Anyone who could create this sick stuff is truly deranged. What's next Anne? Filmed autopsies as entertainment? Secret films from the Nazi death camps? Animals being tortured to death?"
"EdYerkeRobins","7","1","5","10 March 2002"," Doesn't Suck, But Has No Bite to It
","Anne Rice is one of the few niche mainstream authors.  Her novels, be they on witches, mummies, or vampires, are captivating to the many who read them. To those like myself who for whatever reason don't read them, they are appreciated for their usually good writing, but are just not interesting. ""Interview with a Vampire"" shows that movies based on her books (she wrote the screenplay, so there's no question of it being true to the book) suffer for the same reason.<br/><br/>	Before anything else, its important to note that the leads, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, give excellent performances, Pitt as the tortured vampire Louis who would rather drink the blood of rats than mortals, and Cruise as his loving-to-the-point-of-insanity companion Lestat, who cares about nothing, it seems, except Louis.  Though I never had any doubt about Pitt's acting abilities, this was the first ""good"" Cruise movie I've ever seen, though he's still a bit out there, even for his character (I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the film).  The best performance comes from neither of those two though, but a young Kirsten Dunst as the young vampire Claudia, devious, spoiled, and angry, but at the same time lonely and confused.  Her precocious acting ability is amazing, and its a shame she has been in only a couple movies since where she gets an opportunity to challenge herself and give such a good performance again.  The characters are definitely not the problem with the story, as they are interesting characters to observe, particularly Lestat's almost homo-erotic dialogue in regards to his feelings for Louis and Claudia's questions and childish angry response to seeing a nude young woman and the developed body she will never have.<br/><br/>	Unfortunately, the plot is simply not as compelling as its characters.  It spans multiple eras, and accurately depicts those eras, however characters change and it never adequately explains when or why.  For example, about 30 years after the creation of Claudia, Louis scoffs and jokes about how he used to drink the blood of rats instead of people.  It never explains when or if there was a specific incident relating to Louis' sudden change in attitude, though all of the movie up to that point explicitly detailed how he didn't want to take human life.  Whether these plot holes are a fault of the original book or just the movie I don't know, but they were distracting enough to prevent me from really getting into the plot.  Calling it a plot might even be a bit of a stretch; similar to last year's blockbuster ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" (which I also disliked for this reason), it seems more like hours of character development than an actual coherent storyline.<br/><br/>	This is really a shame because, in all other aspects, the movie is REALLY well-done.  The atmosphere is terrific, and as mentioned earlier, the differences in eras are accurately depicted.  Gothic undertones prevail every setting, as locations are dark, but mysterious instead of horrifying. The score fits this mood perfectly, and there is some excellent cinematography and direction, such as the best scene in the movie, a performance of a group of ""stage-vampires"" (who of course are real vampires) that kidnap, strip, and drink the blood of a young woman as part of their totally unrealistic (does anyone really believe such an act, which would be controversial and probably banned today, could have taken place in 19th century Paris?) but eerily beautiful choreographed theatre act.<br/><br/>	""Interview with a Vampire"" is not a bad movie, its just not very compelling.  While its a beautiful thing to watch once, there's nothing that really grabs a viewer (aside from the vampire theatre performance and Kirsten Dunst) enough to make it a truly great and enduring film."

","This film is entirely full of ups and downs. While the performances by Bradd Pitt, Tom Cruise and Kirsten Dunst are incredible, the film on the whole, neutralizes itself to much less than greatness. At times the direction, lighting, script and acting lock in to be nothing less than masterful, and yet at other moments the camera angles are odd and all too ineffective, the script is weak, and almost impossible to act convincingly. The script at many points does a disservice to Pitt, who has absolutely nothing to work with, in scenes full of melodramatic dialogue. And yet there are other moments that lend themselves to a subtle beautiful portrayal. The same is unfortunately cast upon Cruise one time to often. Dunst however, is brilliant in her role as the immortalized child. However, for all it's great moments, there enough ridiculous ones, including the films ending, which is entirely out of place in direct contrast with the mood of the rest of the piece, that on the whole, the movie is mediocre."

","Vampire shenanigans abound in this fairly close adaptation of the popular Anne Rice novel detailing romantic vampires (neatly slotting in between Hammer's ghastly Gothic vampires and the current craze for teen vamps, a la TWILIGHT). Cue macho soul-searching. It's an arty, historical film full of burning candelabras, bloody necks and vampires who mope around and complain about the boring life of the undead. The main thing that takes the enjoyment away from the film are the characters, most of whom are completely horrible and unsympathetic.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the worst culprit. His Lestat is vain, self-satisfying and pompous. Brad Pitt is very bland and uncomfortable in his leading role, only sparking into life at the eventful climax. Christian Slater barely registers in a minor part; Antonio Banderas is great but underutilised as a genuinely suave, sophisticated creature of the night and Kirsten Dunst is supremely irritating as a spoiled brat who finds herself transformed into a spoiled brat vampire. Not much change, then.<br/><br/>The film boasts some early, decent CGI work and plenty of Gothic imagery, especially in the Parisian theatre of the Grand Guignol. However, Rice's self-serving vampires are so caught up in their own woes that they become repulsive to watch on screen, and you couldn't care less about their predicament. In some places, the film becomes hard to watch because of this; looking back, it's a so-so production."

","From director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game) this is quite an okay horror film with some good stars and an interesting incite into what a vampire's life would be like (if they existed of course). In today's time, in San Francisco, a young journalist follows a man through the streets, and they find an anonymous room where he interviews the man, where he reveals he is an over 200 year old immortal vampire. Louis De Pointe Du Lac (Brad Pitt) proves it's true (not by biting him if that's what you're thinking) when he disbelieves him, and starts telling his story of when he was 24 in the 18 Century of New Orleans. He was destroying himself drinking, when Lestat De Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) found and bit him. He starts to get used to the fact that he is now a blood-sucking creature of the night, but life still wasn't that fun for Louis, till he met little girl Claudia (Golden Globe nominated Kirsten Dunst) who changes his existence forever (she is the best example of vampires desperate and lusting more blood). Also starring The Crying Game's Stephen Rea as Santiago, Antonio Banderas as Armand, Christian Slater as Daniel Malloy, Crash's Thandie Newton as Yvette and The Vicar of Dibley's Roger Lloyd-Pack as Piano Teacher. As far as I can remember, the effects aren't bad and the story's quite interesting, not a bad film at all. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Music for Elliot Goldenthal, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up/Hair, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

Louis begins in 1791 when his wife died & he too longed for death until he met a charismatic Vampire named Lestat (Tom Cruise) who turned him into a Vampire, Louis continues through the years & describes his experiences that include murder, betrayal, revenge, loneliness & love....<br/><br/>Directed by Neil Jordan I have read plenty of positive comments & reviews on Inteview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles & maybe I'm missing something or perhaps I just watched it at the wrong time from my point of view but personally I honestly didn't think it was anything special. The script by Anne Rice based on her own novel of the same name is a bit ponderous, a little pedestrian & in my opinion lacked a strong central story. The film tells the story of Louis the Vampire, fine but it's a rather lethargic & dull story. It's a bit episodic & bitty, characters come & go a bit too easily & I couldn't get into it. The story & the way it's told didn't hold my interest, it never engaged me or made me want more & I disliked the lazy nothing ending. The character's themselves aren't that great & the dialogue tedious. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly well written & if you like these life-story type films then I'd imagine you would love it but it's not really my cup of tea.<br/><br/>Director Jordan does a fine job, the production design is fantastic, the period sets, locations, costumes & props are top drawer although the tens of millions spent on it probably helped... There's no real scares in it as it goes for realistic brutal violence, this is a story driven horror film for the intellectuals who look down upon us horror fans & consider horror only just above porn. There's some good gore in it, Tom Cruise gets his throat slit in graphic detail, there's plenty of wrist slitting, neck biting, blood drinking, a decapitation & a cool bit where someone is sliced in half with a scythe.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles has the top notch production values that you would expect a big budget Hollywood film to have. Despite it's very impressive cast list I didn't think the acting was that great & no one stood out for me except a young Kirsten Dunst who I thought was highly annoying & bratty as Claudia.<br/><br/>Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles is an OK film, it's got some decent gore & it's very nice to look at but I thought it lacked a strong central story & didn't particularly entertain me.

So while I was watching it, i was trying to figure out just what makes this so awful. Is it the actors? Well.. no.. brad pit can act, just watch seven, fight club, 12 monkeys, or true romance... and he's the center of the movie. Is it the director? Well.. no.. there are plenty of well shot and memorable scenes. I believe it all comes down to the source material. The dialogue is so cheesy, often to the point of being downright idiotic, that there is no way you can present it with out being completely awful. I'm sorry, but it's Anne Rice's fault. I believe a more appropriate title for this movie would be ""Brad Pitt's Flowing Locks"", since that's what it seems to be centered on.

The whole affair is a bit overlong and repetitious and quite frankly, there is not very much that happens in terms of plot. As far as casting is concerned, it is hit and miss. While I loved young Kristen Dunst's performance, (who I believe was the heart of the film) I was not that enamored with Tom Cruise's or Brad Pitt's. It looks like the casting of these two young, attractive and bankable stars was a ploy to draw in the female audience. Interview with the Vampire does have some winning attributes. Neil Jordan's gothic tale of a tortured vampires struggle with immortality, has a dark atmosphere and first-rate production. But as good as it looks and feels, the poor choice of the leads and the faults of the script hurt the picture a great deal. A flawed but somewhat interesting and stylish film."

","During the late 18th century Louis (Brad Pitt) tragically loses his wife and child. He can't take the grief of losing them so sets out to make himself the target for murder. Unfortunately it's a vampire that accepts his invitation that of the monstrous Lestat. Lestat invites Louis to accompany him in the afterlife and with regret Louis accepts and endures Lestats murderous lifestyle but unlike most vampires. Louis has carried his emotions and regret with him.
The interview comes about when a reporter (Christian Slater) stumbles across Louis path and instead of making him a meal. Louis decides to give him the story about his unnaturally long life.
This isn't a horror story but more of a biography about a vampires sad afterlife and losses. I believe despite his great looks that Brad Pitt is 1 of hollywoods best and what an amazing performance by Tom Cruise as Lestat! He doesn't nearly fit the part but pulled it off so well. Kirsten Dunst is so incredibly great aswell as Cluadia. A vampire that was made too young and despite gathering the wisdom of a middle aged lady still keeps her child form. 1 of the best child performances that I have ever seen. That's what makes this such a great movie.

The whole story is told through long interview flashbacks as Christian Slater is conducting the interview, which is sort of funny in its own right, of the protagonist vampire played by Pitt. The stories help to illuminate what life would be like living as a vampire with the pros/cons to eternal life and their daily struggle for survival as well as many mundane parts of life told through two male vampires and a pre-teen girl. It was interesting to see the progression of a man convert into a vampire and his first few days. The new vamp is conflicted with taking lives for his own survival as his mentor shows him the ropes. The two guys transform a little girl with the fatherly need to take care of her. Watch how the vampires progress through time and how their relationships with one another evolve.

","The film almost makes me want to go out and read the Anne Rice novels. I say almost, because I don't know if I want to expend the effort it would take to read something I might not have a compelling interest in. But I do credit the picture for clearing up the meaning behind one of her titles, that being 'The Vampire Lestat'. That would have to be the Tom Cruise character in this story, the four hundred and some odd year old vampire who brought along Louis (Brad Pitt) from unwilling trainee to charter member of the undead. The film's most intriguing aspect was the way it managed to be so passionately erotic and creepy at the same time. I have to credit another reviewer for expounding a little bit on the whole notion of vampire love and sexual attraction. Apparently, author Rice's writings reveal that a vampire's ability to love is completely disengaged from a sex drive, so the hunger that burns in a vampire's heart has more to do with a taste for blood than any other consideration. Having watched and reviewed a fair amount of vampire films over the course of time, I'm always left amazed by the introduction of still another element of vampire lore I wasn't aware of. This picture introduces the idea that drinking 'dead blood' is a vampire no-no, a concept put to good use by the newly minted demon Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), with a little throat slitting thrown in for good measure. You would think with all this blood and gore the movie wouldn't have been that entertaining, but it had it's moments, with the period costumes adding a much appreciated vibrancy to the story. Cruise and Pitt perform well in their roles, though I didn't quite know how to react to some of their early scenes together until I got the skinny on vampire relationships. It's an entirely different take on the kind of vampire legend first introduced by ""Nosferatu"" and ""Dracula""."

","Having not read Rice's novel (and never will), I was expecting a straightforward vampire flick involving teeth biting, vaporisation by sunlight and plentiful scenes of smouldering. Whilst these are all included, the luxurious gothic horror period aesthetic appeal elevated the atmospheric narrative substantially, setting a rather high bar. Chronicling the immortal life of Louis who was turned into a vampire by the devilishly suave Lestat, where his new abilities are slowly viewed as a curse. The unconventional narrative structure is what truly differentiates this film, as the story is told through an interview-like narration. This naturally enables foreshadowing and finer details to be illustrated in a more contemporary method, and it works beautifully. Vampirism is positively viewed by Lestat who relishes in immortality and has come to terms with his curse. Conversely, Louis clings onto his humanity and despises the process of human feeding. The opposition and differing personalities allows drama, humour and tension to arise throughout the story, creating a well-rounded film. However underneath the regal costumes and grandiose musical score, are thematically powered elements that give life to this undead story. From an ambiguous relationship between Lestat and Louis to questioning existentialism and mortality. These strands thicken the blood-soaked narrative adequately. Casting was a surprise. Pitt carried the film with his broodiness and a young Dunst was exceptional. Yet it was Cruise that astonished me. I just didn't expect him in this role, and whilst it did take me a while to warm to him, I thought he was excellent. Arguably the first half is greater than the second half, with Rea and Banderas' characters feeling underdeveloped, and the concluding three minutes were far too convenient. But director Jordan has crafted a bloody divine adaptation filled with luscious authenticity and superb performances that I just want to sink my teeth into. Turn me now, Lestat!"

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","7","0","2","12 May 2016"," Unconventional, atmospheric and very well made
","Neil Jordan's film version of Interview With The Vampire is simultaneously one of the most sumptuous and tedious visions of the affliction to ever hit cinema. On the one hand, it's an absolutely gorgeous, atmospheric and old worlde glance at two damned souls who carry out their macabre destiny with flair and vicious grace. I say tedious as some kind of bitter compliment, because no other film has quite captured the internal torture of eternity or the nocturnal gloom that must prevail over such an existence quite as well as this film has. It barely runs over two hours and we feel like we've been planted in front of the screen for years. Such is the dedication of director Jordan, a sneakily versatile gent who augments his stylistic and tonal approach to whatever material he is working with. The film is exciting and raises a pulse, but only on its terms, and for long periods of time we sit through languishing despair that no doubt adds to the mood, but exists to serve the psyches of our two leads, and dares the viewer to suffer alongside them. I have somewhat of a bone to pick with certain producers behind the scenes who no doubt had a forceful hand in the casting of Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. You see, author Ann Rice had her heart set on a filmic version starring Rutger Hauer as Lestat, and Lance Henriksen as Louie. Now, Cruise and Pitt are at the utter opposite end of casting types in Hollywood, and while Jordan is never a guy to compromise or chase stars right off that bat, I am still sour when I think of the film we'll never see, starring two actors infinitely more fascinating and vampiric that Brad and Tom. Nevertheless, I have som much appreciation for the film that I can't take it too hard, and remain a steadfast fan. Pitt plays Louie, a depressed Louisiana plantation owner with nothing left, especially to lose. He meets roaming vampire Lestat (Cruise), who promptly turns him, and the two embark on a century spanning odyssey of nighttime escapades, thoroughly fraught with homoeroticism. It's isn't so much an organized narrative as it is a lengthy look at these two, trapped by their condition and making the bitter best of it. They meet others along the way, including Armand (a slinky Antonio Banderas), Santiago (Jordan regular Stephen Rhea, lively evil incarnate) and Claudia, a child who Louie turns. She's played by Kirsten Dunst in the best performance of the film. A young girl with the vampire curse thrust upon her at such an age, who mentally matures into a steely, furious woman trapped in the body of a ten year old. Not many actresses could succeed at that, but she is a spitfire little shryke who dominates every scene. All this is being retold by Louie to a 1990's journalist (Christian Slater) who morphs from bemused disbelief to cold terror, and eventual morbid fascination. It's a slog to get through, but an ornately beautiful one with some really bloody effects and the always terrific stewardship of Neil Jordan, whose films are never short of mesmerizing, whichever genre they fall into. A dark, dingy horror with lacy elegance at its core."

They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.)<br/><br/>On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision."
"The-Sarkologist","6","0","2","21 December 2012"," Nowhere near as good as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
","I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin.<br/><br/>I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it.<br/><br/>Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained.<br/><br/>There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that."
"carlaswayder","6","0","1","29 April 2012"," different than i had expected-wanted more machismo
","I was around 4 or 5 when this movie came out. I just saw it for the first time now. I'm a vampire movie junkie, and I admit a fan of Twilight, being a girl and a teen when that first came out, what choice did I have (lol). Thirsty for more I have been venturing out and watching older movies and came across 1994 Interview with the Vampire on Netflix. Not what I expected. I'm now confused about my entire ""Vampire World"", and not because of Twilight or Interview with the Vampire, but more because of 1992 Dracula, which I also recently saw (it came out when I was about 2 or 3),but I'll get to Dracula in a moment. As I mentioned I'm a Vampire junkie, and I came across and read Anne Rice's novel which got me to watch the Interview with the Vampire movie. Differences, some, Brad Pitt's character (Louis) was upset at the beginning of the movie about losing his brother, he didn't have a wife and kid in the book, but that's okay, point is, he was depressed. Also, when a Vampire's cries in the book, they cry tears of blood, but in the movie it was regular tears. I think they should have did the blood tears. Minor, but still felt an important detail. Here comes my biggest problem, I found it very ""Gay"" at times and almost uncomfortable. Brad Pitt was beautiful in the movie, and I'm not homo-phobic, trust me on that, but at times it was a little too effeminate for me. I know Vampires are A-sexual, and it's about the love and there is no sex more or less, but I felt in this movie it WAS about the sex the way the actor's played it, and their lust or their motivation for desire was homo-erotic and more sex driven and portrayed or should I say exploited than it should have been played. Their love or lust was Gay, and again, I'm not hating on ""Gays"", I like both men and women equally in that department, I just feel that the way it played out in the movie was more about sex than what it should have been. They were portraying Vampires, not humans. Not easy to explain in so many words, but it just did not come across as what two vampires should share, it came across as two mortals that were Gay. Before any one throws the first 'rainbow' stone at me, read what I've written, homosexuality doesn't bother me, or to be to the point, I'm Gay. I just feel they played it on a homo-erotic level suited for humans and not the love of two Vampires. Let me carry on from here, earlier I mentioned that I was confused after watching the 1992 version of Dracula. Here is why, I've been watching the Twilight movies, and several others (including ""Interview"") and then I watched Dracula. Dracula is on a completely different level. Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are masters. I feel like a fool for being a fan of other Vampire movies. It's like I've been given ""Movie Goggles"" and now I can see the difference. I guess Interview with a Vampire was somewhat the Twilight of it's day, it looks great, it's cool, it's sexy, but Dracula feels real and not so, well, stupid. Interview with the Vampire was definitely worth the watch. Biggest drawback for me is that when I want a man, I want a man, and in fantasy land when I want to be taken by a Vampire, I want a Vampire. I like my women effeminate, not my men. Most of my friends are Gay, but when I want a man, I want a MAN. Felt like if I got into a threesome with these ""Vampires"" I'd have to strap on my strap on and take charge, and then smoke a cigarette after as they make me dinner and do my laundry. Maybe I'm just an ol' fashion kind of bi-sexual chick."

"baseballgirl-94-8671","9","0","1","1 July 2011"," It was pretty good.
","OK. To start off, this film was very good. When you read the other reviews about people saying ""Not for Anne Rice fans"", don't listen to them, OK? This is an amazing film that was very much like the book, having direct quotes from the book. I'm a younger viewer, one who is not authorized to see R movies. So, I watched the movie on TV when it was edited for content. To start off, for someone who really doesn't like bloody gore, Im happy to say it didn't bother me. Though there was a lot of gore, being a vampire movie. Another thing was sexual stuff. That was pretty bad, seeing that there was, in two instances, full frontal female nudity, where you could see anything, other than that, and the main characters dealing with (dining on) whores, there's nothing else.<br/><br/>This film stars four very popular actors: Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas, and Christian Slater, so many younger kids, because of this amazing cast will want to see this movie. Don't let them unless your ready for them to have nightmares or emotionally disturbed.

Everyone else in this movie (Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, etc.) did really good as well. I could definitely see why Anne Rice was pleased when she saw a screening of it when it came out . . . It's fabulous! I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

Yet now if someone were to ask me if I like him, I would say ""Yes! He's Lestat."" So there you go. He's amazing as this beautiful blond immortal, sprung from the pen of Anne Rice, and I applaud his performance. Same with Brad Pitt as Louis. Wow!"
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","1","22 December 2010"," Great sophisticated vampire film
","So what did I learn from Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles? I learned that Twilight could have been awesome. Interview with the Vampire is the heavily romanticized story that chronicles the life of vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac. It takes place in the present day but is told through flashbacks as Louis tells interviewer Daniel Malloy his life story. The film strongly romanticizes the vampire story, but in a very respectful and successful way. Really, this film is awesome.<br/><br/>The movie starts out pretty slow and I wasn't happy with it at first. It seemed too pretty boy and melodramatic for my taste. This was mainly due to the leading actors Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. I found the film ridiculous to begin with, but it slowly picked up and just got better and better as Louis' life grew more tumultuous. The film delves deep into the psyche of a vampire and it is a very unique and fascinating interpretation of the eternal vampire life. The narrative style itself is also interesting because of the way it switches between past and present. The movie keeps your attention from start to finish and any time you think you might lose interest something exciting happens to grab it once more. The film really seemed to take off after the introduction of Kirstin Dunst's character who added a whole new conflict to the film. Looking back I can't think of a time when the film started to drag after it really picked up. I was hooked as soon as a lot of the romanticized BS had filtered through and the film started to get really good.<br/><br/>The movie also stays interesting because of its diverse cast of characters that appear and reappear throughout Louis' life. The film boasts quite the A-list cast. Brad Pitt plays the main character Louis. It isn't his best role but he does a decent job for what its worth. Tom Cruise also plays a major role as Lestat, the vampire who first bites Louis, turning him into the undead monster. I was tired of him and his character pretty quickly, but I can't deny that he plays a crucial role in the story. He also plays into the end of the film which is incredible and very unexpected. Other important characters show up throughout the film such as Kirstin Dunst and Antonio Banderas. Christian Slater plays the interviewer and although he isn't in the film much, he's great when he is there.<br/><br/>One thing that is so interesting about the film is the amount of time it spans. Louis' story begins in the 1700's and ends in the 1980's. The majority of the story takes place in the late 1700's and early 1800's, making this a period piece with vampires. What more could you want? The filmmakers took this time period and did a lot of good with it. The costumes and sets in this film are fantastic and very fitting for the time period. The research that went into this film is very evident when watching all the visual aspects come together and create a fulfilling period piece experience. The music also compliments the time period very well. The film has a great score anyways, but it is enhanced by the visuals accompanying the time period. Interview with the Vampire is a visual treat.<br/><br/>This movie starts out very slow and it can get a little annoying, but give it some time and it will be extremely worth it. This film is a vampire story done right. It isn't for the kiddies and doesn't ever try to be. The film is extremely graphic which is good to be but I'll mention it as a warning for others. If you want a taste of the true potential of the modern day vampire story, watch Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles."
"TheMara61","10","0","1","7 December 2010"," about ""Interview with a vampire"" not being a horror
","I had seen the movie and that has determined me to read the book. Both movie and book are miles away from the horror genre. Both are exceptionally profound. The book is better, tough. That may be because of the power of the word. Example: read the section where Louis is awakening to his new vampire ""life"". The sensations, the intensity of perceiving the sounds, colors of the night are astonishing described. One does not need a psychological book after reading ""Interview with a vampire"". Yet those pages are quite impossible to be visualized. The movie, I am keeping in my mind as excellent and quite unique. And I remember that Tom Cruise has searched a way of uncommon vampire biting. He has founded that in the lions attack, he moved half a circle around, then the bite. So professional attitude."
"blackburn_liverpool","10","0","1","1 November 2010"," Interview with the Vampire review
","Perhaps it's a bit curious that my favorite book is also my favorite movie, such is the case with Interview with the Vampire, and I've wondered whether my love for the story and the themes I connect with so much made me miss some faults with the movie. But the more I re-watch it, the more I am convinced it is a genuine masterpiece that deserves much more recognition than it gets.<br/><br/>From the cinematography to the acting, everything is spectacular. The establishing shot of the San Francisco bridge with the modern city glittering in the background to the music of ""Libera Me"" is one of the most haunting and beautiful movie intros I have ever seen. I think the film, even though it has both major and minor differences from the novel, is so successful because it manages to bring to life the style of the novel. Some plots are skipped or shortened in order to fit into the two hour limit, but the frame lingers on precisely those subtle moments that matter most. Louis watching his final sunset, the tear that drops on his hand when he remembers Claudia, his resignation to having lost his ""last breath of humanity"" on that balcony in Paris...this is what constitutes intelligent pacing, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The acting is also extraordinary. Kirsten Dunst usually gets the most praise for her performance, as she should, as it's amazing how she handled the material at such a young age. But in my opinion, and I realize not all share it, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are incredible as well. Again, even with the minor differences, I felt that both actors were deeply in-tune with their characters, and gave the material full justice. I would be very surprised if they had not both read and mediated on the book thoroughly beforehand. As a film major, I think of myself as moderately knowledgeable about movies, yet I would struggle to name two more emotionally dedicated performances. It's very curious to me why they haven't worked together again, even just for the commercial success such a partnership would generate.<br/><br/>If there are other film adaptations of the Chronicles, hopefully the same amount of commitment and understanding of the story will be involved. Queen of the Damned, even though there are a couple of things I liked about it, didn't even try to give justice to the books."

You can't fail to fall in love with this film. It's a must for vampire fans everywhere. It is as brilliant as twilight; if not, more so.

"Green_Lump","8","0","1","29 June 2010"," not a fan of vampir-y stuff, but this one had a meaning in it.
","Although I have found some stuff in this movie misleading, or mysterious, I still loved it, it had a point and a story after all instead of just vampires flying everywhere, so my overall opinion is 'good film'! the reason why Id given it a 6, I did not get some of its parts, -first of all Lestant -if im not mistaken- , Cruise's character, we were told that vampires are immortal, but the -never drink dead blood- part brought me to the question ? do they lose their immortality when they drink dead human blood as we saw Lestant getting killed by Claudia the moment he drank the dead blood, when earlier the wounds on his face would disappear immediately -before drinking the dead blood-, but later then he still lived, how? two possibilities, -He was still a vampire when he was thrown into the sea. -If he has lost his immortality when he was thrown into the sea how would he have survived on the reptiles' blood ? his first death and his first show-up after death didn't quite confuse me, I began to think later on when they kept bringing him back, when he -looking completely creepy- was burned by Luis, he was brought back again looking so fresh and young like nothing ever happened? and he remained a vampire. That was my first confusion point. my 2nd one, I didn't quite understand the relationship between Luis and Claudia, because I watched it on fox movies perhaps ? maybe they cut off some romance if there ever was any? Once she calls him father and he calls her daughter, then they switch to calling each other 'my love'?! This is not a very weak thing in the movie anyway, I just thought I'd point it out. The movie also sounded or -seemed- as a play more than a movie, the way they spoke, interacted, the performances -to me- were not very powerful, I was not blown away by any of the actors' performances, and for Claudia, I thought she was a weak performer. and my last criticism, a very tense vampire movie ending with a tempo-beat song, REALLY?"

","This movie was incredible and amazing display of both Anne Rice's vision and the creature that seems to now fascinate everyone, the vampire. Truly, after watching this I can't understand how anyone could find Twilight to be that amazing. The books were good, slightly addicting but not nearly as enthralling as Anne Rice and her beautiful, fragile and complex vampires. And of course let us not forget the actors of the movie, Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst all of which made their characters alive (in the theatrical sense, of course). I loved this movie and it encouraged me to seek out the other books to further immerse myself in their world. But overall everything was superb, acting, the attention to detail in costume, set, accents, chemistry. Nothing I would have changed, not even Antonio's obvious departure from what Armand should have really looked like. Let's face it, he was hot, had a sexy accent and he was a terribly good Armand."

","Why can't you be honest anymore? It is in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made. I have seen hundreds of films and have had experience with most horror especially. Anne Rice wrote the book as inspiration because of the death of her daughter; Claudia is her daughter and Louis is portraying metaphorically, how she dealt with losing her daughter in the book and film when Claudia dies. This movie has much more depth than it is given credit for and the characters do too. I love how Anne Rice; instead of using the conventional vampire as the traditional bad guy, she exposed them behind the scenes of their predatory nature and developed their character and personal lives deeper, suggesting maybe they are just like us. The book and movie was too personal for her to just make a horror movie as it was beyond horror and beyond the genre. It was meant to be unique so she could evolve the characters into a better and more understood monster that could be relatable to people for the first time. Obvious it was original and I'd certainly credit Anne Rice for this, nobody will or has ever come close. She was just seeing it in a different way and way ahead of her time! I first saw the movie when I was 14 with a friend, I had no interest in vampires particularly, more-so ghosts and shock horror in the movie genre, but I watched it and couldn't believe how unique it was for a vampire and horror film. It got me hooked on vampires and the books. To this day NOW at 23, every now and then I still am amazed when I watch it. It is somewhat different in some parts than the book and some things are missing or added. But if you read her books you still should watch it for the movie itself! The actors are great, the story is deep and emotional about a couple of male vampires basically trying to raise a child and trying to find a means of a normal life together in 18th-19th Century New Orleans. It's very humorous and tragic, dark and romantic, beautiful and cinematic all at once. Which is why I love it! Pay close attention to the movie so you understand it better in some parts and read the book before you do if you can! The book is excellent and the movie lovers may prefer the movie and the book lovers usually prefer the book itself. I would suggest reading The Vampire Lestat before you touch Interview With The Vampire. It is possibly much better than her first book. I Anne Rice decides to make a movie with excellent directors and producers for The Vampire Lestat. Queen Of The Damned was a complete disaster and tragedy compared to the masterpiece Interview With The Vampire. 10 Stars <br/><br/>1.Great Actors 2.Great Cinema 3.Stunning Atmosphere 4.Impeccable storyline between Louis and Claudia 5.Deep meaning. Characters represent suffering to find a semblance of truth and meaning in life as a newly created animal.

","When my friend offered me to watch ""Interview With The Vampire"", I had no any basic idea about how the plot could be or which actors to be involved in this project. 15 years passed on this film and in the beginning when I saw the names, I was surprised. Because in those days Brad Pitt or Antonio Banderas or Kirsten Dunst were not well-known. But there were some great actors (famous in those days) like William Slater and Tom Cruise. Thus, I can say that cast is very strong; indeed less experienced.<br/><br/>As the title reveals, the movie is about an interview of a vampire. The interview is about the biography of Louis the Vampire who had suffered of taking lives, searched for the existence of vampires and lost all of his humanity by proceeding every obligations of being a vampire. I do not want to spoiler but simply the movie consists of the themes that are mentioned above.<br/><br/>About the character of Louis, he is a vampire but not prefer to be monstrous just like the other vampires. In his first times of being a vampire, he really tries to stay away from the humans and confines himself with rats and birds and chickens. This shows that although Louis becomes a vampire, he could pretend to continue his life as a human by not killing other humans. However, it doesn't last for a long time. He loses his humanity as time goes by. And the scene where Louis converts Madeleine to a vampire is the time Louis loses all his humanity according to him.<br/><br/>The main conflict in the movie is ""choice of being a vampire or get killed by a vampire"". Lestat (Tom Cruise) states several times that the vampire that bites him doesn't give him chance to choose his future. And Lestat just makes Claudia a vampire without giving her opportunity to select her future. On the other, again Lestat allows Louis to choose his future and so does Louis to Madeleine.<br/><br/>Throughout the story, the directer underscores the existence of the God and the Devil. And the result according to this film and perhaps to the book, there is no God nor Devil existing. However, the final song ""Sympathy For The Devil"" of Rolling Stones performed by Guns 'n Roses is totally contradictory to ""unexistency of the god and the devil"". The only mistake in this movie is selection of the closure. Otherwise, it is a masterpiece of Anne Rice."

On the contrary, Tom Cruise put down the performance of a lifetime. He never seems to have trouble capturing the exact core of his characters. He was funny, serious, dark, malicious, and haunting. Because of him, this movie was enjoyable for me. Also, Kirstin Dunst did a very fine job in this film. For such a young girl, it's surprising she did not win the Golden Globe she was nominated for.

I know this is an old movie, but as a huge fan of the novel, it is just a shame when I read that Tom Cruise did such a good job as Lestat. He was a mistake. A HUGE mistake. The ONLY casting decision in that movie that was a good choice was Antonio Banderas. He gave the most credible performance, the only one able to capture the sensuality and creepiness that Rice imbued in her vampires.<br/><br/>Cruise has a limited emotional range at best and absolutely no understanding of understatement or sensuality, a quality this role demanded.

What was most strange was Tom Cruise who was in a role that it so different to any other role he has ever done.  You just couldn't imagine him as Lestat in this but as soon as you seem him biting onto Louis's neck played by Brad Pitt there he is, as the cold hearted vampire Lestat.  A friend told me who was a big fan of the book that a lot of fans thought that Cruise would never be convincing as the book's character but changed there minds when they saw the film saying that no one could have played him better than Cruise did.  That's what being an actor is all about though, and that's getting into character and reading up on it and that's was Tom Cruise did. Brad Pitt was excellently cast as the tragic Vampire Louis who wants no part in being a vampire but has no choice to except who he is and feed like the rest.   <br/><br/>It was a great all round cast and was probably one of the mainstream films I can remember which stared Christian Slater as he is quite obsolete nowadays. Antonio Banderas puts in one of his better performances known in recent times and the under dog of the film Kirsten Durnst who pulls off a great Claudia as a little vixen vampire.   I thought the movie was very epic actually as there was great scenery and excellent landscape.   Neil Jordan is a director who I think has directed some quite different films in the past, The Crying Game being one of them and this is his masterpiece I would think.  But Tom Cruise is the centre of attention here and I don't think I have ever seen him play a role where you fear him so much and he is the man who haunts your dreams.<br/><br/>Bits which I thought weren't to good was we didn't see more of the interview between Pitt and Slater.  More scenes with Armand would have been nice and some flashbacks about Louis's time with his family would have not gone a miss as he is always thinking about them during the film but I didn't get a feel for it as we never saw what they were like together and what Louis was like as a father. <br/><br/>An Excellent if a little flawed vampire flick."
"Silverzero","Null","0","1","20 June 2003"," Gothic horror with magnificent art direction despite a limp narrative.
","`Dangerous Liaisons' meets `Fright Night' in this lavish, over-dressed horror drama. This genre of costume piece-cum-gory horror certainly is an acquired taste to say the least. While it has a `hip' quality to it, the movie is also subtle and sophisticated- not simply a mindless action flick. In fact it could not be further from being an action movie. `Interview with the Vampire' is done in the same style as `Bram Stoker's Dracula' made in 1991. It has familiar props, but a slightly stronger narrative.<br/><br/>
Of course, one huge flaw is the homo-erotic overtones, which are made so disturbingly obvious throughout the film. While these may be in tone with the period in question, they make the movie all the harder to sit through and for the most part are unintentionally funny. Even in the most serious scenes, it's hard to resist laughing at the effeminacy of all the characters. If someone dressed like that in the modern era they'd simply be laughed at (deservedly). I mean, let's face it- there's vampirism, and there's just plain gay! `Interview√Ç‚Ä¶' crosses that fine line one too many times. <br/><br/>Good solid performances from the entire cast, in particular from Tom Cruise. Those expecting the hotshot egotist from `Risky Business' and `Top Gun' will be in for a humble surprise. He creates a bizarre, disturbing, unintentionally funny, highly effeminate yet ultimately compelling character that wouldn't have been done quite as brilliantly by anyone else. He handles the simplest roles and the more complex ones with equal va-va-voom. A very girl-ish Brad Pitt is convincing as the vampire of the title.<br/><br/>
Antonio Banderas and Stephen Rea are appropriately creepy in their parts but don't get much of a chance to flesh out their characters. Christian Slater is good as the freaked-out interviewer but, again, doesn't properly develop his character. The surprise talent is from a very young Kirsten Dunst as the child/student/vampire/part-time lover (now THAT is weird). She should get more talented roles in the future and a departure from kitschy sophomoric material. <br/><br/>The narrative and dialogue are below par and simply can't support the movie. Luckily, the real stars of the movie are the magnificent set pieces and costume designs- kudos to art director Dante Ferretti. Lurking in the background is the Oscar nominated soundtrack from Elliot Goldthenal (who won this year for `Frida'). It sets an appropriately moody and atmospheric tone- well paced and impeccable timed. Anna Rice did a good job adapting the screenplay, though perhaps it gets ahead of itself in parts, assuming that we know how it feels to be a vampire. <br/><br/>In conclusion, `Interview with the Vampire' isn't for all tastes, but if you stick with it you'll probably be pleased. Unusual is the fact that the movie ends with Guns' N' Roses playing in the background. This is certainly strange, but it leaves a satisfying taste in the mouth when all is done. My IMDb rating: 6.8/10."

","I've just watched this film again, and wow I'd forgotten how powerful and dark it is.<br/><br/>There is not a bad performance from any of the actors, easily one of Tom Cruises(Lestat) finest performances and Brad Pitts only better film in my mind was Kalifornia.<br/><br/>The film is based around an interview between Christian Slater and Bradd Pitt (Louis) in current day America. Louis declares that he is a Vampire and begins telling the story of his 300 year existance.<br/><br/>The main storyline of the film takes place in 18th century New Orleans and Paris. It becomes quite believable that a disfunctional family such as Lestrat, Louis and Claudia could exist in these places without being noticed. The film is full of strong sexual suggestion, especially between the Doll Like Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) and Louis. This adds an intensity to the plotline that keeps you hooked the entire time.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst really does manage to hold the uncontrolled blood lust and innocence together and slowly throughout the film show more of the woman within a childs body, amazing.<br/><br/>The sexual side of things does not stop there, since the relationship between Louis and Armado (Antonio Bandaras) looks decidedly more than just friends! <br/><br/>The Vampire has always been a symbol for seduction and female Submission but I feel that this film has captured a human side to the immortal vampire that other films missed.<br/><br/>The main point of the film appears to be that even though these characters are vampires, Lestat & Louis are individuals with differing morals. Louis does not agree with drinking the blood of humans, even though he craves it. Lestat enjoys his powerful role as predator and bestower of immortality. Louis wants to understand the purpose of his existance,and why he has become what he has become. Is the vampire any more evil than another predator? Lestat accepts the role of predator on humanity just as the wolf accepts his role in the food chain. Who is right?<br/><br/>Thats all I'm going to say for now so just get this out on video.<br/><br/>I gave this film an 8. Enjoy"

","This is not the best film ever, but vampires have never looked so good!!Brad Pitt looks a bit odd, though, and I reckon a short 'do suits him better.Tom Cruise portrays the evil one perfectly, and it's nice to see the very young Kirsten Dunst. She is SO adorable!!Acting is generally good, the story is just okay...not very innovative.All the eating scenes were quite disgusting( not the scenes itself, but the cries of the victims)But this is just another movie which (kinda...) proves that Brad Pitt always does these not-so-hot movies."

","I will always remember Interview with the Vampire because it was the first R rated movie I ever saw in the theater. I was 15 and wanted my first R rated movie to be an experience to remember.<br/><br/>And what an experience! The sets and costumes are great, as are the actors. Tom Cruise over-acts with a passion, but it fits the character of Lestat. Brad Pitt brings a gentle humanity to his character of Louis, who is Lestat's polar opposite. <br/><br/>Don't miss the last scene. You'll laugh your head off!"

","Lestat knew his prey would become his companion, but his prey did not know this. This film digs down into the core of what it would be like to travel the world as a vampire. This movie in some ways reminds me of a different horror film called Mary`s Shelley`s Frankenstein both films draw you into the minds of the characters, it`s not just blood and guts and ""sudden"" things to scare you but rather it`s an examination of the evil minds and hearts of the characters!! This is my favorite type of horror!! Although I really can`t compare this movie to the book because i never read it, so i can only judge this film as a fan of horror movies. And i must say this is one of the best vampire type movies i`ve seen. It really is very creepy and sends chills up and down your spine. And i really liked Kirsten Dunst`s character, have you ever seen such a cute little vampire in your life?? Anyways, if you`re into horror movies this is a must see. And if you like it, check out Mary shelley`s frankenstein it`s another one that will send chills up and down your spine, also if you know of any movies that are like these two email me. rating (best of 5 stars).....3 1/2....."
"tritisan","8","0","2","2 December 1999"," great film, flawed casting
","I read and loved the book years before the movie was made. Of course, I painted myself a pretty detailed picture of it in my head, what the characters looked like, the location and atmosphere, etc.<br/><br/>When I heard Tom Cruise had been cast as Lestat, I felt like starting a riot on Hollywood Blvd. Blaspheme! And Brad Pitt? Yuck.<br/><br/>But I couldn't help myself and had to see the movie all the same. And I was pleasantly surprised. The ""look"" of the film was very close to what I'd pictured, with deep shadows and saturated colors.<br/><br/>Even more surprisingly, I enjoyed Tom's performance. He successfully embodied Louis' hedonistic, egomaniacal abandon. Brad, on the other hand, produced exactly what I'd feared: a shallow, pouty performance. I had pictured someone much taller, and more elegant. Brad is cute and all, but sophisticated he's not.<br/><br/>And then there was Antonio as Armand. Antonio is a pretty good actor, but the book described Armand as much younger, more innocent-looking, like a choirboy. <br/><br/>But Kirsten as Claudia was perfect, and everyone else fit the bill nicely.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","Werner Herzog's Nosferatu stars the incredible Klaus Kinski as the Vampire. It succeeds in all areas where IWTV fails.  Anybody who likes this film should check it out, especially now it's available on DVD.  Watch it in the original German, most appropriate for the undead."
"CoolHand-4","7","0","1","1 April 1999"," To the Point!
","A very different and entertaining vampire movie, albeit slow during certain times during the movie.  An excellent performance by Dunst surrounded by above average to average jobs done by the rest of the cast.  Sumptuous designs, sets and photography definitely make up for the slow periods in the movie.  But, when the scenes are good, they are very, very good. A rating of 7 out of 10 was given."
"complication7","Null","0","1","7 February 2002"," What I think of the movie and the book.
","Well, I've seen the movie and I've read almost all of the Chronicles (I'm still on Blood and Gold).  This movie is a good summary of Interview with the Vampire, but I don't know why they had to change certain things.  For instance, Louis' wife didn't die because he didn't have one.  His brother died and he felt guilty and that's why he didn't want to live. Anyways, like I said it's a good summary.  The acting is fabulous as well as the over all atmosphere of the film.  I believe that they kept the over all feel intact. I have to like this movie for one thing, it got me into the Vampire Chronicles.  I started reading them when I was about 14 and I'm now 19. I'd have to say that they've had a good impact on my life in the past 5 years. There are just certain things that make you think.  I really wished that they would not have changed the story line so much in Queen of the Damned. From what I've learned, Interview stays more true to the original story than QOTD.  Oh well, see the film if you want to contemplate your life and become depressed.  Or just to see Lestat be a brat."
"snivlem138","Null","0","1","1 April 2001"," The Vampire Chronicles
","This is a good movie, it would've been better if it used a lot more elements from the novel that didn't make it to the film.  Tom Cruise as Lestat is suprisingly great! All the actors in this film are wonderful in the portrayal of their characters.  Antonio Banderas, who dosen't even come close to fitting the novel's portrayal or Armand, does a good job.<br/><br/>This a really enjoyable movie, don't pass it up."
