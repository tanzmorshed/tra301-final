","I was really optimistic going into the theatre, I didn't expect it to as great as the original, but I thought it would still be good movie. But most of the material was stuff taken from the original only tweaked, and I hate to say it but I was actually bored for a good part of the movie. Some of the jokes/scenes dragged to long, to the point where I didn't find them funny anymore. There were some good moments, but the truly outrageous/original scenes that made the original so great were too few and far between. Some of the scenes were more outrageous in the sense that there was some full frontal nudity, but I'm not someone who finds that super entertaining. Overall it felt to me like a re-hash of stuff that had already been done with some naked people thrown in, and it just wasn't enjoyable like the first movie."

","2009 wasn't exactly the best year for movies, but out of that year we did get a comedy that will last for years to come, The Hangover. When I heard that there was going to be a sequel, I was telling my friends that I had a feeling that this was being made for the money. After all, The Hangover made over 200 million dollars world wide, they are going to milk it for everything that it's worth. Plus what made the first Hangover so great was that as crazy as their night was and outrageous, in some strange way it was believable where we've been so drunk we couldn't remember the night before and somehow did the most insane things. How is this supposed to happen again and be believable? But I loved the first Hangover so much that I went into this just hoping it was going to be a good time and sadly, it was exactly as I feared, this was made for money because it was nothing but copy and paste.<br/><br/>Phil, Alan and Doug travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding, but after their escapade in Las Vegas, Stu has opted for a safe, subdued pre-wedding brunch. They go to Thailand with Allen as well, when Stud did not want to invite him due to the previous events. They all look to have one drink on the beach, however, things do not go as planned after they lose the 16-year-old brother of Stu's fiancée and somehow wake up in Bangkok. Now they must go through the whole mystery again of trying to find their missing friend, but everyone they meet tells them that ""Bangkok has him now"".<br/><br/>See, the thing is, I did laugh a couple times, I will admit that. But the beginning and ending verbatim is the exact same thing first Hangover. A lot of the jokes are the exact same thing as the first film, the monkey was the replacement for the tiger, the silent monk was a replacement for the baby, the brother was a replacement for Doug, Paul Giamatti was a replacement for Leslie Chow, Stu's girlfriend's attitude problem from the first film is now his future father in law's attitude problem, you get the idea. Leslie Chow becomes more of a main character in this movie which I felt was another problem, as I mentioned in my review of the first film, even though he was funny he was the only thing about The Hangover that I felt was a little too over the top. He did make me laugh still, but again, it's more of the same. Also I don't know why but it seems since Stu had such an awful girlfriend in the first Hangover, they felt they had to go to the extreme opposite and give him a girl that not only looks 20 years younger than him but also is the perfect girlfriend who doesn't question anything and thinks Stu is the best man in the world.<br/><br/>I really wanted this to be an excellent film, I was so looking forward to having a good laugh, but when it's the exact same thing as the first film, how could you enjoy it? There are no surprises and the magic is gone. They made Allen into a mean character that is totally unbelievable, Stu is over the top in being a sissy and Phil is now there just to be the pretty boy and I really wish they had used Doug more in this one since we didn't get to see him in the first Hangover much, he seems like a great character. Seriously, skip it, this is not worth your time or money, the first Hangover is a classic. If they make a third one, make the girls have the hangover or bring a new group in because the story is just done. This was lazy and pathetic and I want my money back.<br/><br/>4/10"
"ferguson-6","6","108","149","29 May 2011"," It' Happened Again ... And Again
","Greetings again from the darkness. Two years ago, director Todd Phillips presented a highly creative, hilarious, raunchy, unique film comedy called The Hangover. And now, he does it again. He presents that SAME film again. I am unsure whether this is a sequel or remake. The only substantial change is the setting ... Bangkok instead of Vegas.<br/><br/>Now I fully understand WHY most sequels follow the formula created by the successful original film. Filmmakers want to keep their audience satisfied. If it worked once, it will work again. Especially when the first film grosses a half-billion dollars! So the chances are very good that if you liked the first one, you will also enjoy this one. But for me, I get excited for creative filmmakers ... not re-treads.<br/><br/>The key characters are all back and played by the same guys: Bradley Cooper (Phil), Ed Helms (Stu), Zach Galifianakis (Alan), Justin Bartha (Doug), and Ken Leong (Mr. Chow). All of these guys have worked constantly since the first film, but it makes perfect sense to return to the scene that put them on the Hollywood map.<br/><br/>This time around, Stu (Ed Helms) draws the long straw and has the storyline based on his pending marriage to Jamie Chung (Sucker Punch). Stu's ""wolfpack"" buddies agree to a one-beer bonfire beach bachelor party, but of course, something goes very wrong. The next morning finds our boys staggering to regain consciousness in a sleazy Bangkok hotel with no recollection of the previous night's events. The only clues are a monkey, a severed finger, a facial tat and international criminal Mr. Chow.<br/><br/>No need for me to go into any details or spoil any moments. You know the drill if you have seen the first. What follows is nearly two hours of debauchery and moments of varying levels of discomfort, gross-out and comedic skits.<br/><br/>Supporting work is provided by Paul Giamatti, Jeffrey Tambor, and Mason Lee (Ang Lee's son). There is also a cameo by Nick Cassavetes as a tattoo artist. This role was originally meant for Mel Gibson, and later Liam Neeson. Cast and crew protests kept Gibson out and Neeson's scenes were cut when re-shoots were necessary.<br/><br/>I feel tricked by Mr. Phillips. The first Hangover had me excited that a new comedic genius had entered Hollywood and would quickly blow away the Judd Apatow recycle jobs and copycats. Instead, we get Todd Phillips copying Todd Phillips.<br/><br/>This is certainly an above-average comedy and there are plenty of laughs from the characters we kind of feel like we know - though, wish we didn't. Just know going in that are witnessing a clear attempt at cashing in, not a desire to wow."
"pauljraab","4","66","90","28 May 2011"," Predictable to the point of boredom
","I had modest expectations, they weren't met. This is Hollywood milking a successful movie with a contrived followup. This is the same movie. The jokes are the same, just dirtier and more low-brow to get shock reaction. This is like the joke ""the Aristocrats"". Same joke as before, just dirtier and more disgusting. Drug overdoses, kidnapping and hiding bodies as a premise for a comedy isn't entertainment, it's desperation to go ""over the top"" without originality. The interaction with the lady-boys was obvious and a cliché for Bangkok humor. It's the Heather Graham joke from the first movie with a little sodomy mixed into it. The inappropriate observations and comments by Alan that made the first movie clever just push the envelope but don't even feel awkward anymore. If your brand of humor falls along the lines of ""the more disgusting and grotesque the better"" than this is your movie. If you want some creativity and originality for your money, don't bother. I gave it a 4 instead of a 3 only because of the monkey."

","The Hangover II is the perfect example of a Hollywood sell-out.<br/><br/>Somehow, despite being set in an exquisitely beautiful country, there was nothing new or even entertaining in the cinematography. An amazing achievement given that Bangkok is a voyeurs dream. In the end, The Hangover II offered us nothing more than travel brochure scenes and worn out clichés.<br/><br/>The story, merely reheated leftovers, is a sexually confused 12-year-old's wet dream. I've never seen so many flaccid penises in one place before. The sad fact that so many people find this movie entertaining is pathetic and down right scary. If all it takes to satisfy the males of an entire nation is a bunch of homo-erotic fantasies, stale clichés, and some exposed titties - we are all screwed - with a capital F.<br/><br/>In the end I'm left with the feeling that I've been felt up, taken advantage of, and somehow have been forced to pay for the experience. If I could erase the images from my memory - even if that meant a hot poker to the ear hole - I would willingly offer myself up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, instead... I'm left with the bad after taste that The Hangover II has left in my mouth - a taste that reminds me of stale cigarettes, bad tequila and vomit."

","Select All. Cut. Open New Document. Paste. Thesaurus. Print. I can nearly guarantee you this was the process in writing the sequel to the most successful R-rated comedy of all-time. In one of the craziest and most blatant filmmaking moments of carbon copying an earlier installment I have ever witnessed Hangover II paces, moves, and delivers in the exact same method, style and speed as the original. The musical transitions are the same, some of the set-ups are the same, some of the conflicts and revelations were eerily alike and worst of all, the entire third act felt like the original----and they are thousands of miles from the United States. Every strength in this movie is deterred by the fact that Todd Phillips and company put no effort in trying to change things up a little aside from setting.<br/><br/>Is the movie still funny? Yes, it is funny and there are indeed some standout moments. But, all the freshness and originality of the first Hangover is definitely not present here, and it hurts more because they could have fixed some of the setbacks of the original. This time Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand in order to gain approval from his fiancée's father. During a night of drinking with the ""Wolfpack"" (Bradley Cooper, Zack Galifianakis, Justin Bartha) and the fiancée's brother, something went wrong, and the crew is many miles away in Bangkok. And of course, one of them is missing. And of course, they don't remember anything. And of course, they are mixed up in multiple situations occurring within the city. The difference between this one and their stint in Vegas is that the stakes are much higher, as the adventure in Thailand is much more grim and dark than in Sin City. <br/><br/>Hangover part one was hilarious, unique, and had flair of comedic originality. However, it needed a few polishes in order to become a true comedic classic. Zach as Allen is the biggest of the flaws. His characterization in the original was very uneven, too random, and just didn't deliver as much sympathy as the other characters. In the sequel, he is ruder, crueler, and an absolute pain to witness. In the original his actions are mildly justified because of his stupidity. Here however the stupid act gets old extremely fast. It doesn't help that Galifianakis doesn't have the comedic timing that superior funnymen possess. The rest of the cast throughout the movie was great, with Ed Helms and Ken Jeong being the best examples. <br/><br/>Todd Phillips should have known better, as he is a good director with a nice track record. I am extremely disappointed that instead of taking an approach to trying something new while still offering the same type of R-rated college humor, he chose to stick to the formula far too close. You can copy some of the jokes and get away with it, but to imitate the entire three-act structure of the original Hangover is nothing more than lazy and uninspired filmmaking. He still has a few tricks up his sleeve with a few raunchy and hilarious surprises, but far too much potential was wasted in order for me to forgive him. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: You will most likely have a good time watching this if you enjoyed the original. That being said, it will feel exactly like the original---except it's in Bangkok and the setting is much darker. They cranked the ante in conflict, but failed to improve anything or change anything from the 2009 comedy smash hit. Playing it safe hindered this movie, as part of Hangover's appeal was its inability to stick to a formula. Hangover II is funny, but lacks the satisfaction, zaniness, and appeal of the original. Hopefully they can spice things up for the third installment (you know it's coming out, stop lying to yourself) otherwise all I have to do is copy this review and paste it to the third chapter. <br/><br/>diac1987.blogspot.com Entire Planet Observed on Daily Basis"
"gregeichelberger","3","58","82","28 May 2011"," Even Alka-Seltzer won't cure this 'Hangover'
","In a classic case of going to the well just once too often, ""Hangover, Part II"" should be a lesson to all directors and screenwriters that what sets a successful sequel apart is SOME kind of divergence from the original movie's plot.<br/><br/>But if a story about three friends who end up in crazy situations while celebrating their buddy's upcoming wedding can make $300 million at the box office, why argue with success. Like most recent Hollywood tales, the writers aren't stupid, they just dupe it.<br/><br/>Plus, I truly cannot decide what was the worst moments of this picture, the jokes, the writing, the forced nudity and vulgarity, the poorly mismatched vignettes or the assaultingly bad obscene rap soundtrack I was forced to endure. Let's just say it was all equally horrible and added up to one lousy day at the movies.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips (who did himself no favors in helming ""Due Date"" between the first and second versions of this film) brought most of the cast from the wildly popular ""Hangover"" back for what amounts to a major rehashing with Bangkok substituting for Las Vegas.<br/><br/>Here, the idiotic trio, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu the dentist (Ed Helms, ""The Office"") and the obnoxious Alan (Zach Galifianakis, ""Due Date""), who were shanghaied in Vegas during Stu's bachelor party, now find it's deja vu all over again. This time, however, the raunchy fun and silliness of that plot is replaced by drugs, death and dismemberment and few laughs of which to speak.<br/><br/>Add to the mishmash a ton of completely unnecessary supporting characters (Stu's brother-in-law-to-be, Teddy, Mason Lee; the coked out Chow, Ken Jeong; Mr. Kingsley, Paul Giamati looking like Jabba the Hut in a leisure suit; a totally unfunny Middle Eastern gun dealer; a gruff future father-in-law, as well as a smoking, drug-dealing monkey that replaces part one's tiger) and you will feel like you're in the midst of an actual hangover.<br/><br/>And that's sad, because there were a few genuine laughs in this picture, and not the kind in which a character just repeats the F-word over and over again (which all of the characters did, by the way) or with homo-erotic situations that seemed more bad afterthought than real comedic inspiration. Most of the guffaw lines came from the pompous nerd Galifianakis, his long locks now shorn as a tribute to a night of debauchery.<br/><br/>Helms also gets in a few decent scenes, most revolving around his discovery that the tattoo on his face pays silent homage to Mike Tyson. Cooper, on the other hand, while a pretty face, comes nowhere near a laugh in the movie's mercifully short 100-minute running time.<br/><br/>The funniest scene in the movie, for me anyway, was Stu holding a bachelor party brunch at IHOP while his disbelieving friends sit stunned. If only that kind of inspired fun could have permeated the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Don't think too much about this one, though, friends. Just get some aspirin, ginger ale, black coffee, tomato juice or the hair of the dog — anything to erase this awful hangover from your system."
"Jpeffer","4","42","58","14 August 2011"," It was better the first time around
","The Hangover was a surprise hit in 2009 that went on to be not only a critically acclaimed film, but also a huge box office success. The Hangover Part 2 is exactly the same movie except this one takes place in Bangkok, and isn't nearly as good or as funny as the first film.<br/><br/>This time around Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married and they're having the wedding in Thailand, which is his future wife's home country. Coming back along with him we have bad boy Phil (Bradley Cooper), the groom from the previous movie Doug (Justin Barth), and the person who practically stole the entire first movie, Alan (Zach Galafianakis). Once in Thailand we meet a slew of new characters who really don't ever seem to matter all that much and eventually we get to the next day and where the movie turns into an exact copy of the first one.<br/><br/>Why the writers and director thought essentially remaking the first movie would be good is beyond me. Other than they figured it would make a ton of money regardless of how they made it. But to make almost exact scenes over again is just ridiculous. The gang loses one of their own again but this time it isn't Doug, it's Stu's soon to be brother-in-law Teddy. They wake up and have no idea as to what happened the previous night and have to go on another wild adventure to try and figure out everything that happened, only this time it doesn't seem nearly as interesting.<br/><br/>They even go as far as to bring back characters from the first movie that have no business even being in this one. Ken Jeong comes back as Mr. Chow and while he was one of the few funny characters, he really served no purpose in being there. Mike Tyson also comes back for another cameo, singing once again. Only this time it feels like it was just crammed in because he was in the last one and had a really great cameo. In this movie it's just unnecessary and makes you wish he didn't show up.<br/><br/>Our main characters this time around aren't even as funny as they were before. Alan just seems almost too outrageous and crazy, Stu freaks out every moment of the movie and Phil is just kind of there throughout. There were about two times that I actually laughed out loud and another few times where I got some chuckles but that was pretty much it.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie felt like it was made just to cash in on the very successful first movie and they ended up just remaking the first one only this time it wasn't nearly as good.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10"
"treeskier802","6","149","235","27 May 2011"," Unfortunately Predictable Relying On Same Gags
","What made The Hangover fun and entertaining unfortunately leads to predicatability in The Hangover II. The only reason I got any enjoyment out of this movie at all was because I liked the characters in the first movie. I wish they had tried to do something fresh with the story and the characters, but it was the same old gags.<br/><br/>When I first saw the original Hangover, I thought the movie might become a classic comedy. But honestly after watching it a few times, it seems less funny where as many comedies you pick up on small things on multiple viewings that make the movie even funnier. With the Hangover, the element of surprise is lost the next time around and the story loses its appeal.<br/><br/>So taking what I just said into account, if you've watched the first movie multiple times and then have expectations that the second movie will be a fun adventure with fun surprises around the corner, you will be somewhat disappointed. The writers even wrote in another animal with the Monkey (Tiger first film) and baby with the old Monk (baby first film). The gags just didn't seem quite as funny the second time around.<br/><br/>There was a lot of hype leading to the release of this movie. In fact, right after the first film was released rumors that a second was on the way already surfaced. Really a disappointing film of what might have become a pretty fun movie franchise. Rating 6 of 10 and this is being nice because like I said, I got some enjoyment out of the film simply because seeing some of the same characters from the first movie was nostalgic."
"lisa-629","5","46","67","29 May 2011"," How much lazier can Hollywood get?
","If you loved the original, then you will love this one. The reason being is that part II is the carbon copy of its predecessor, and reinforces the idea that laziness is running rampant throughout Hollywood. Lets rundown the similarities, shall we: 1-Movie starts out with Stu's wedding in Thailand. 2-The men wake up and don't remember a thing. 3-Stu hasn't lost a tooth this time, he has a face tattoo. 4-No baby, but an adorable coke snorting, cigarette smoking monkey. 5-Doug isn't missing, but the bride's younger brother Teddy. 6-No missing tooth this time, but a missing finger, which just so happens to belong to Teddy. 7-Follow a hot lead to find Teddy, but it turns out to be a Buddhist monk (black Doug reference). 8-In order to piece together the previous night, the guys head to a strip club run by the very same guy that ran the Wedding Chapel from part one. 9-It is also at the strip club, like the chapel in part one, that we learn that Stu is cheating on his fiancé-part one was a stripper, this time a stripper with a weiner! 10-Then the return of Teddy lays in the hands of Mr Chow and him transferring money to a Russian mobster who supposedly has custody of Teddy, just as Mr. Chow supposedly had custody of Doug in the original, with neither having custody of their supposed missing friends. 11-The phone call from Phil claiming they had F*&*ed up. 12-Just as in the original, Stu has an epiphany and figures out where Teddy is, stuck in the hotel elevator. 13-The guys make it to the wedding just in time. 14-The guys end the film sitting together when Teddy finds his phone and all the pictures that they are going to all look at once, but then delete. Its funny, sure, but it's really just embarrassing to come to terms with the knowledge that these writers think that the viewers of this movie are so stupid that they won't mind the similarities. I say similarities, but it's just down right the same movie in a different city. My response to the writers and to the director Todd Philips is, How dare you?! Didn't you make a butt load of money? Didn't this movie get nominated for a ton of awards? You couldn't afford some real writers? Or did you just not care enough about your viewers to give us something different?"
"bernierb","9","10","12","27 June 2011"," Still fun and a good time to have to
","This movie was a lot of fun to watch. The cast is funny as always and the story is very good. For those complaining just don't watch it, simple as that. A comedy is probably the hardest type of movie to write because it has to be ""funny"" and it hard nowadays to write something funny because most of everything funny has been done over and over.That being said, you can go different ways in your comedy but this movie is the type of comedy i like,it has a plot, is mature and it not a brain dead mishmash of stupid things or stunts or language that a lot of younger kids like. It is old fashion comedy and i hope they do more of this series.<br/><br/>It is not going to change your world but if you want a break from reality, this movie is it!"
"KnightsofNi11","6","68","106","28 May 2011"," Funny, but don't expect the original
","Remember that one movie that came out in 2009 called The Hangover? Of course you do. It was only one of the most talked about films of the summer, surprising everyone as one of the funniest comedies in a long time. Two years later it was only fitting that a sequel be made so that we could relive the original Hangover fervor and kick off summer 2011 with a bang. Well, the basic rule of thumb for a sequel is that it either a) needs to be a continuation of the story from the first film or b) tell a new story with the same characters. The Hangover Part II decided to invent their own option c) which is to tell the exact same story all over again, but just changing a few details.<br/><br/>And that is what The Hangover Part II is. This time Stu, Alan, and Phil are in Bangkok, Thailand for Stu's wedding. The wolfpack reunites for another awesome bachelor party, this time brining along Stu's sixteen year old brother-in-law, Teddy. Stu promises only one beer and then he is calling it a night, but of course that isn't what happened or this wouldn't be The Hangover Part II. Nope. Once again a crazy night ensues and the boys wake up the next morning with absolutely no recollection of what happened the night before. They only have small clues to go off of, but they have no choice but to use these clues in order to find Teddy, who has gone missing. From here things play out much like they did in the first film with the same elements as the original. Instead of a tiger we have a monkey. Instead of a baby we have a monk. Instead of a regular Las Vegas hooker we have, well... I won't spoil that.<br/><br/>I, like so many others, loved The Hangover. I was happily surprised by how funny and just how well made it was for a film that looked like it would be another silly comedy movie. Of course it was that but it had something great about the raunchiness of the jokes and the cleverness of the mystery story that unfolds. The Hangover Part II doesn't quite have that and it only seems to try as hard as possible to outmatch its predecessor. It is this excessive one-upping of the first film that also drags down the films story. For one, it is just the same story all over again, but I can get past that because it worked in the first film. I won't say it wasn't annoying seeing so much of the same things happen all over again, but I'll get over it.<br/><br/>I was disappointed though because I loved the mystery aspect of the first film. The process of finding out where Doug was in the first film coupled with the incredibly entertaining humor was done just right. The Hangover Part II just tries so hard to go even further over-the-top that the mystery aspect here falls flat. It isn't nearly as interesting, thus the thing that made The Hangover more than just another comedy is lost in The Hangover Part II. The film does everything in its ability to be raunchier and more over-the-top than the first film, affecting all aspects. The obviousness of this effort actually ends up being distracting and it just reminds me why sequels too often suck, especially comedy sequels.<br/><br/>But The Hangover Part II doesn't suck. It definitely hasn't lost all of the magic that was there in the first film. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms obviously love these characters and you can see it come through in their performances. The hilarious trifecta are just as great in this film as they were in the first, and I never thought for a second that they were losing touch with their characters in the film's attempts to one-up the original. And honestly, this film really is funny. I laughed hysterically at plenty of moments throughout the film and there is never a dull moment. Each moment just gets raunchier and and more insane, keeping you laughing from start to finish. The comedy in this film isn't as clever as the first film, and it really sort of boils down to fart, poop, and dick jokes, but I love the characters of this film too much to not be entertained by that.<br/><br/>I won't say that I wasn't thoroughly entertained for the 102 minutes this film ran. I still think Zach Galifianakis is one of the funniest human beings currently on this planet and I think Todd Phillips still knows how to make a funny movie. But The Hangover Part II certainly doesn't live up to the hype and it doesn't even come close to the first film. As much as I laughed during this film I really just can't think of it as much more than just another comedy."
"gailhachenko","5","55","91","12 June 2011"," So disappointed
","Loved Hangover and was really looking forward to the sequel but... I kind of expected them to write a new story and not simply rehash the old one.<br/><br/>And I mean rehash.<br/><br/>It's exactly the same movie. Just not as funny.<br/><br/>I know they rushed this out, but now I kind of feel they rushed it out simply to steal my $$$.<br/><br/>Well you managed that. But next time... I'll be much careful about paying over my cash. It takes a lot to get me out. Gotta get the subway. Pay the money. Buy the popcorn. Next time Hollywood promises me a good night out I'll be having second thoughts... and next time I might just stay at home or spend the $11 on drinks with friends.<br/><br/>Well done Hollywood!"
"antony-1","3","26","41","30 May 2011"," An anxious sequel, more drama than comedy
","I adored the original Hangover, and while I didn't expect this to be quite as good I didn't expect it to be this bad.<br/><br/>I don't mind the rehashing... with a sequel to that Hangover it has to be a bit tongue in cheek. But this is like a dark twin to the original movie.<br/><br/>The Vegas setup made, despite someone being missing, for a fun, uplifting movie. A sense of ""oh I've been there"" but with an exaggerated tone. It was all about what a great night they'd had and were trying to piece it together.<br/><br/>The sequel is the opposite, it's a dangerous, anxious movie. They are in a strange lady, and they've lost a 16 year old and his finger is in a bucket. It's a race to find this kid, and work out if he's even alive. There's someone who has unprotected sex with a ladyboy. Someone gets shot. Even the wedding was anxious because of the father-in-law. While I knew they'd find the boy in the end, it still leads to tension while they piece together a bad night (rather than the good night of Vegas).<br/><br/>In terms of humour, it wasn't also very funny. There were nuggets of potential jokes but they didn't feel well executed, which is surprising given it's the same director as last time. Mr Chow is excellent, but underutilised in this movie.<br/><br/>Then it ends with them finding the boy, who's missing a finger and laughs it off. Erm, yes. This guy who is a gifted musician and wants to be a doctor has lost a finger and doesn't care. And Stu isn't running to get an STD test before he marries his wife, which he would do if some random transsexual prostitute ejaculated into him. Maybe I'm taking this too seriously, but it snaps me out of the movie as a 'step too far'. Or maybe the step too far is the desperate inclusion of Mike Tyson at the end.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very disappointed - mostly that it took a fun evening with the lads where while they got up to mischief no harm was done and gave you a feeling of ""what an epic night"" in Vegas to this dark tale where there's just no enjoyment as to what they got up to the night before."

","After seeing The Hangover in 2009, I could not wait for Part II to be released and it was worth it. I really don't get why people are saying this movie sucks because it has the same plot. What do they expect? Of course Todd Phillips is gonna use the same formula as the original but it works with this one. I can honestly say while Phillips did take this one a step up with how crude and nasty the jokes are, it still made me fall out of my seat laughing, especially Alan's new attitude in this. To me, the only thing that would make The Hangover Part II a failure is if Alan was the one the trio ended up losing the night before. Without him, The Hangover movies would suck!

After being horribly disappointed by The Dilemma, grinned occasionally at Hall Pass and Just Go With It (but not really carried away by either), it was about time we got a decent 2011 comedy - and here it is.<br/><br/>Plot wise, Hangover II is more of the same from what we've got in the first installment. A lot of main themes and characters from the first film return in different forms, and there are a lot of nods to the aforementioned 2009 mega-hit.<br/><br/>However, I will say this. It seems as if the writers knew that the concept isn't as fresh as it was in the first film. So instead, they went for sheer shock value. As a result, some of the things our guys run into during their mess-up in Bangkok are so controversial; I was surprised they were even allowed to show it on screen. Prepare yourself for a lot of in-your-face humor, awkward nudity and misplaced violence.<br/><br/>Also, the dynamics between the main protagonists were believable and hilarious. You get to learn more about the characters, and you actually feel like you really know these guys and care for them, after hanging out with them during the first film. The Bangkok location also opened up a whole new world of possibilities and mishaps for our characters to run into, and at one point things turn so crazy I just couldn't stop laughing.<br/><br/>Oh yes, there's a plot to explain briefly. OK. So this time, it's Stu's wedding and instead of going to Vegas the whole gang winds up in Thailand. You see, after ditching his bossy girlfriend from part one, Stu ended up with this incredibly hot Asian American, and they decide to hold her wedding in her homeland. So Phil, Alan, Doug and Stu all hop on a plane across seas. The night before the ceremony, the guys decide to go out for a drink, and take the brides' young teenage brother, Teddy.<br/><br/>The next morning, they wake up with another of their infamous hangovers. This time, they are somewhere in Bangkok, and it's not Doug that's gone – it's the adolescent Teddy. Instead of a baby, there's a monkey in the room, Stu had a Mike Tyson style tattoo, Alan's hair is shaved and somehow Mr. Chow from the first film is there.<br/><br/>There. I won't say no more. But I promise you this – go watch this film in the right state of mind, and you'll laugh yourself silly. While not as refreshing as the first one, the Hangover II does deliver a fun, memorable time at the movies, and that's all I really wanted."

","Hmmm, where to begin? I'm guilty of laughing out loud while watching the first hangover, I have to admit. Therefore I have the capacity to enjoy silly comedies...but this...this was painful to watch. The humour was really low quality, as if the writers did not give a flying truck about a viewer. It was in fact so bad that I felt embarrassed for them. In general they used the oldest (and least funny) stereotypes, the stupidest jokes, and the cheapest tricks. Let's take the scene with a monkey smoking a fag. How was exploitation of this animal funny? Yes, 'no animals were harmed during the making of this movie' (probably) so what? What is the message they are sending across? Entertainment it is not. Is Thailand really just lady-boys, drugs, fakes and huge disparity between very rich and very poor? Maybe...But rather than exploiting this painful reality they should stigmatise it in my opinion (Monty Python style!). Instead, a disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I sometimes enjoy silly stuff-who doesn't-but this film was disrespectful: 'just take the horse poo we serve and shut up'. There is nothing else to write about this movie except: don't pay for it it is sooo not worth your money. I would certainly give it a zero on a voting scale."
"svetiev_b","1","18","28","25 October 2011"," The same thing again ... only with a pointless and utterly unbelievable ending
","I have never given a movie a rating of 1 before, but this one deserves it for more than one reason. First of all, as others have stated this movie is just a copy/paste screen job from the original most brilliant piece of comedy I've seen in a while. But that doesn't bother me as much as the total lack of common sense that the protagonists seem to have in this installment.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ahead ...<br/><br/>All right, they wake up bricked up once again not knowing where they are and how they got there, only this time they find a cut off finger that belongs to Stu's future brother in law who is both an excellent musician and studying to be surgeon and off course he is missing. The characters express general concern for the fact that he is nowhere to be found and after discovering his cut off finger they do what??? THEY GIVE IT TO A LITTLE DRUG DEALING MONKEY!!!!! After which the finger is to be seen no more.<br/><br/>Now what kind of a retard do you have to be not to put the finger on ice and preserve it (as it was already done - they found it in a glass of melted ice water) so when they actually find the kid he can at least have the chance of getting some proper medical care. <br/><br/>The most idiotic thing about it all is that the father in law who is being an asshole to Stu all along and totally disrespectful as well suddenly develops a new found respect for his future son in law after he brings his ""pride and joy of his life"" son back mutilated after a night of ""Hangover"" style partying all over Bangkok. <br/><br/>And yeah they actually go through with the wedding once again. All right it was fun and believable the first time, but this one was simply over the top.<br/><br/>One more thing about the finger. If you are a musician, none the less a wannabe surgeon, than you sure as hell will care about what happens to your fingers. That's just bellow than average script writing. <br/><br/>Apart from all of the above mentioned anomalies, the beginning and middle part of this movie are quite great, as a matter of fact as great as the first one, but the ending just ruins it all."
"digital_killed_projection","1","31","54","29 May 2011"," why?
","Quite possibly one of the worse films of 2011, (and its been a bad year for films) with out doubt the most over rated so far, Where do I start? the reason the first one was so good was because of how original the concept of the film was, so using it again for part 2 takes away the feeling of watching a new idea, part 2 was just a carbon copy, pretty much a scene for scene remake with slightly different jokes, there were quite a few things that in particular annoyed me 1, smoking monkey! just not cool 2,everything was in the trailer and merchandise, from Stu's awful tattoo too knowing Mr chow was alive all the time because the trailer told us so, the vast of Alans funny bits...... also in the trailer 3, predictable, OK so they in Bangkok, there was only a matter of time before we see a 'ladyboy' and given how the film lacked anything remotely funny there was only a matter of time before we get to see the proof that Stu's prostitute wasn't quite what he thought, this is just one of so many jokes that was so predictable because straight from the off you know where this film is going 4, I'd be pretty annoyed if i lost some fingers, (couldnt tell how many he lost) 5, there was no Mel Gibson cameo on account of Zach Galifianakis protesting about his past racist slurs........ this film was racist from beginning to end 6, Phil...... quite possibly the most annoying character I've ever seen, if this blokes hates his job so much then why is he a teacher? he comes across as a clever guy who could talk himself into pretty much any job he wants, he hates his family yet in part 2 we see him with a new baby, would have been better off he got locked in toilet with the tiger in the first one this list could easily reach 20 points but the more i think about the film the more i hate it, so a few more things i hated, swapping the baby from the fist one with a monk, how did Stu manage to pull Jamie Chung, Mr chow in general, Alan's evil side towards Stu's new bother in law, Alan just shouldn't have a nasty side... thats it for now, hope you enjoyed my first review, and i apologise for any spelling mistakes or grammar errors, its never been my strong point"
"southtroyballa","2","22","37","30 May 2011"," Much worse than the first one
","When i first heard about the hangover 2 i was thrilled and i wanted to see it. i just watched it and i want my 15 dollars back. It started out funny and then it just stopped. And by the end of the movie i was shocked that i dislike this movie so much because i absolutely loved the first one. I didn't dislike it because it was just like the first one (only in Bangkok), i disliked it cause it was not funny and it had no originality like the first one did. And what happens to poor Stu is not funny at all. So in closing, do not go see this film. You will hardly laugh and you will just wanna walk out halfway through the movie. So please don't be like me and millions of other people, don't waste your money."

","I'm afraid if I start talking about this movie then I'll keep going on and on and on, so I'll just keep it simple and not give away anything that might ruin it for you all. I had the opportunity to see the pre- screener of Hangover Part 2, and it was amazing. This was my first pre- screening, and everything about the experience was brilliant. The excitement, anxiety, and even the two hours of waiting.. Totally worth it! I'm sure most of you know by now that the movie is based in Thailand, if you people have seen the trailers, then it is pretty obvious that this time the ""wolf-pack"" is in Bangkok, Thailand. And today all the things that I have heard about Thailand has been confirmed (that it is a beautiful place and all, no pun intended..OK maybe a little) This movie offers exactly what you expect from it, hilarious, a bit gross at times, but definitely worth every penny. The first one has a 7.9/10 rating here, and I'll give the second part a 9/10 rating just because it is even crazier than the first one. Well I did get mixed response from my friends some liked the first more and some liked the second. But the common denominator was that they all enjoyed the second part... so folks have fun with this one and enjoy!"
"claudio_carvalho","5","25","43","17 March 2012"," Replay of the Same Jokes
","The dentist Stu Price (Ed Helms) is getting married with Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Thailand and his best friends Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) and Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) travel for the wedding. After the dinner party, Doug, Phil and Alan invite Stu to drink a beer around a bonfire on the beach with Lauren's brother Teddy (Mason Lee). Phil brings a pack of beers and marshmallows to the group.<br/><br/>On the next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan have a hangover and they do not recall what they did last night; their room is upside down; Teddy is missing; there is a little monkey in the room; Teddy's finger is in a glass of water; Alan's head is shaved; and Stu has a tattoo on his face. <br/><br/>The trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover Mr. Chow on the floor under the carpet. They learn that they are in Bangkok and Mr. Chow sniffs cocaine before telling what happened last night. However he dies and Phil, Stu and Alan follow a lead to begin to unravel their crazy night.<br/><br/>""The Hangover Part II"" is a replay of the same jokes of the first film. The main difference is the location, changed from Los Angeles to Thailand, and the animal with a monkey instead of a tiger. But the rest is the same structure and similar jokes, with Stu hysterical and Alan very stupid. My vote is five.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Se Beber, Não Case! Parte II"" (""If You Drink, Do not Marry Part II"")"
"skullislandsurferdotcom","1","17","28","30 May 2011"," Braindead Retread
","Las Vegas is where our boys woke up with a hangover the first time. What happens in Vegas, stays there. You've heard all that – and at this point, you've probably seen it too.<br/><br/>And now, here we go again: the new blind-spot odyssey taking place in Bangkok which, unlike Sin City, has little for most audiences to relate with. Nor our characters, who, after waking up hungover (constantly reminding each other: ""It happened again"") wander around like bored tourists gathering clues for the disappearance of not Doug this time. He's back at a hotel for Phil, Stu and Alan to periodically call: a safety-net that didn't occur in the original. And even though the self-claimed ""Wolf Pack"" is a lot further from home, the situation doesn't seem as dire or hopeless this time around.<br/><br/>Stu's getting married and his wife's younger brother is the missing-link the boys have to find... in time for the ceremony. It's all very familiar, but the wry humor's replaced with over-the-top gross-out situations: making us forget this is a comedy with characters who made us laugh the first time around; not only for their predicament, but their personalities. Bradley Cooper's Phil is a bland, almost non-existent leader; Ed Helm's Stu makes for a surprisingly passive victim of circumstances; and ringer Zach Galifianakis's bearded-bizarro Alan is no scene-stealer.<br/><br/>The only funny parts occur during the slide show at the end credits. So perhaps the already-discussed part three should show us that stuff during the movie, and save the hangover till the end. Hell, it has to work better than this."
"RevelatorJohn","1","17","29","31 May 2011"," Boring. Unoriginal and just bad
","This movie is unfortunately still relying on the same gags as in the first hangover. I was actually looking forward to this movie, but maybe it was just me expecting to much.<br/><br/>Everything is the same with just little twists. In the first part Zach Galifiniakis pulled the movie up sky high but in this movie his lines are short, does not really do anything much and is just the guy who are tangling along. <br/><br/>Teddy? A replacement for Doug, but still the same as in the first. <br/><br/>Stew? Nothing needed to say. He was the man giving it 100% in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall this movie could have been made far better it would not be so boring. The movie was 5% cool, 40% boring and was 55% the complete same as hangover part 1 just in a different location."
"oceaniclilly","9","46","91","25 May 2011"," Exactly what you expected, with a touch more!
","Do I need to say anything other than, it's Hangover Part: Two! It follows the same amazing success as the first part. Everything as good as the last, only maybe just a couple of less laughs and a tad more serious. It has the same cast and the same dynamics as 'The Hangover'. Instead of the high night life of Las Vegas, they go to Thailand to prepare for Stu's marriage. Quite different from the glamour and penthouse suite of Vegas, they are in the gritty hard streets of Bangkok. Phil, Stu and Alan are on the run from gangs and drug lords in the search for Teddy (Stu's Brides little brother). With the expected hilarious antics of strip clubs, obtaining extra baggage, and plenty of beatings along the way. Will Stu, Phil and Alan be able to find Teddy, or will Bangkok take him first?"
"watchEarthlings","2","35","68","29 May 2011"," Same plot, different location
","As a fan of the first Hangover movie, I was pumped for the sequel. While watching it though, I couldn't believe how much it mirrored the first one. There was: a hangover (I'll allow it due to the title), wiped memories, tits, a tiny Asian penis, an exotic animal, drugs, guns, action scenes, mike tyson, a wedding, prostitutes, the same three main characters on a search for a missing character by retracing their steps via gathering one clue after the next on how the bachelor party unfolded, etc.<br/><br/>That all being said, I laughed a lot during the Hangover 2. From a movie critic standpoint, though, I was so disappointed at the overwhelming similarities. It was like watching a recycled script of the first one. There was hardly any character development either. Phil remained the cool and collected ""wolf-pack"" leader, Stu the reserved doctor (aka dentist - yes, they recycle that joke a few more times from the first one), and Alan as the overly weird Jonas brother fan.<br/><br/>The only real difference between the two movies was the location, as the movie went from an upscale Las Vegas location to a run down Thailand (or Thay-land as Alan calls it) city of Bangkok. And yes, there is a bang-cock joke or two in there.<br/><br/>I'd only recommend this movie to stupid people who like hearing the same jokes twice...or thrice. Enjoy!"
"asha-albert","2","16","28","29 May 2011"," Unmemorable and unfunny
","I loved the first Hangover. It was just so fresh and funny and irreverent...and so unexpected! The second one attempts to ride on the success of its predecessor...and it just does not work. Comparisons are odious, I know, but the filmmakers have INVITED comparison by making the second movie an exact copy of the first one, albeit set in an ""exotic"" location.<br/><br/>What was funny in the first movie just seems plodding and labored in the second one. Case in point - Alan (played by Zach Galif...whatever). The first time around, he was sweet and clueless. Now, he's just unpleasant, yet just as clueless. The other characters don't even merit a mention - they are just so lacking in personality, it's hard to believe that we laughed at their antics last time around.<br/><br/>And yes, there is a monkey...I do hope he/ she/ it got paid handsomely. Nothing is going to compensate for the fact that the monkey has to perform an unmentionable act on a certain body part at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The first part (yes, the comparisons are inevitable) at least had an element of suspense...as in ""what the hell happened?"". Now you just don't give a hang."
"gerold-firl","10","8","12","30 January 2012"," superb comedy better than Vegas
","Hangover 2 is actually better than the first one. Many have complained that the plot is total reprise of the original, but a classic comedy can be seen over and over, and it's still funny. Both Hangovers are classics, and the sequence of events is secondary to the relations between the characters. Hangovers one and two can be watched as a double feature, and they're both hilarious, but number 2 is actually the superior movie.<br/><br/>In both it's Stu who is the character that grows during the movie. When we first meet him he is a total weakling and a phony buffoon, abused by his vicious fiancé, and always lying to her so she won't get mad at him. A truly pathetic figure. By the end he actually gets one of his nuts back, and breaks off their engagement. One point for Stu. But the other members of the wolfpack really don't develop at all. Phil is still a dick, Alan is still a retard, and Doug is the nice guy who avoids all the insanity. <br/><br/>In Hangover 2, Stu gets his other nut, and finally embraces his inner demon. In the process, he becomes a man. All the plot twists, the absurdity, the impossible challenges surmounted by luck, pluck and guile - they merely form the backdrop for a voyage of self-discovery by a pompous sissy-dentist on the way to becoming a man. And it's funny as hell. <br/><br/>Bangkok makes the ""sin city"" of Las Vegas look like Disneyland in comparison, and all the challenges are amped-up in proportion. In Vegas, Stu marries Jade, a very nice girl who happens to work as an escort. In Bangkok, he gets sodomized by a she-male - and he loves it. It's pretty nasty, but it's part of the strange alchemy required to turn a sissy- dentist into a man. <br/><br/>Watch this movie and learn. You'll laugh like crazy while doing it."

This is an excellent piece of cinema. the theatre was full and we were all laughing the whole way through the film. The premise is much the same except this time set in Bangkok. Why break and tried and tested formula? well they didn't and you will find yourself laughing and cringing at the same time ( you will understand when you get to that scene).

I couldn't wait for it to end so I could do anything else.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms characters were distorted into such idiotic caricatures of their roles from the original that it was insulting to watch.<br/><br/>Outside of a few funny moments and Ken Jeong's time on screen, this movie about as fun as getting a root canal."

For example, it shows a scene close to the end from the beginning, there are VERY inappropriate pictures during the end credits, and, of course, the problem- what the **** happened that night.However, it definitely was not the same as the first. It was MUCH more inappropriate than the other one. There were many scenes with breasts, penises, and I can't remember if it showed a vagina. However, that sort of made it funnier.

","Hangover Part II: Film Review Hangover Part II. what a great film, yet another fantastic storyline. People doubted whether or not it could top the previous film, and if the sequel would ruin the originality of the previous film... they thought wrong. Part II is still the same idea, they all go out loose there memory etc etc, but Part II offers so much more comedy and thrill, there is more at stake this time, more too loose. It was great to see the ""wolf pack"" back together but unfortunately Doug was not in the whole drama again, he went home early, it would have been nice to see him get more involved in the film. This time they do not live the high life glamour like they did in Vegas, they were in Bangkok, there seemed to be a much darker and depressing tone in the movie, they wake up in the grotty, dirty hotel were all the power goes off, they find themselves in the slums of bangkok. the film gets much more graphic, near the beginning and throughout there are strong drug uses and strong sexual actions and nudity. I would say that this film is really a teenage humor, for 15 to 28 maybe but adults will enjoy just as much To sum up this film i would say it is a fantastic must see, its got to be comedy film of the year, its going to win loads of Oscars and just a general fun and fantastic film to watch.

"doctormd509","1","31","66","28 May 2011"," Unoriginal, crude, and offensive to Asian-Americans
","I saw this movie last night and I thought the first movie was much funnier. It was less crude humor and more crazy, surprising, and original humor with a relatively unique way of telling a story.<br/><br/>This movie follows the EXACT same format down to a slideshow at the end that they can only view once before they have to delete. I disliked this movie on several grounds.<br/><br/>1) Raunchy/Gross/Shock-factor humor - Everyone has their own opinion on what's funny, I get that. But really is looking at penises, chain-smoking monkeys, naked transvestites, and amputated fingers stuck up noses what's considered funny these days? Maybe it is for some, but I personally just find it stupid and a sad state of affairs if this is where comedy movies are heading towards.<br/><br/>2) Offensive - As an Asian-American male watching this movie I couldn't help but be disgusted. I dislike calling out the race card but this is one movie I feel it's warranted. First, you have depicted a relatively attractive Asian female with a white male. Now, I'm all into believing in true love and I have no problem with this by itself, but at the same time how many times can you recollect where you've seen a movie with an Asian male with ... well, anyone? It's hard not to notice the disparity when it's 100 to 0. It makes you wonder about how Hollywood works ...<br/><br/>Secondly, one of the few Asian male appearances starts with showing what is likely is a pathologically small penis who of course just ""happens"" to be an Asian guy. How many movies have you seen an Asian guy's penis? Yet this is the one time they do show one?! In my opinion, and probably as any guy will tell you (just ask your bf/husband), the worst you could do to a guy is question their masculinity. That's just sickening that a movie tries to perpetuate a negative stereotype. I mean, I think most of the humor comes from shock value and sensation of superiority (i.e. laughing at another's misfortune). If the penis were extra large on an Asian or black male, would it still be funny? <br/><br/>Anyway, on a side note, I've spent the better part of my 20s obtaining a medical degree and M.S. in health policy to improve the health system of a country that I love. But it's sad when every time I go to the movies, anyone who looks like me is often portrayed like crap. My suggestion is not to support this movie -- plus it's really only a cruder rehash of the first one. I think I might have to rededicate my life to improving media representation if movies like these keep coming out ..."

The critics have panned this and I foolishly disregarded them. <br/><br/>Everyone had said it had the same plot as the first, but I thought, that'll be okay: if it is half as funny as the original, I'll have a few laughs.

In the absence of a funny script, a few 'shock' value scenes, but that's about it.<br/><br/>I kid you not, but no-one in the audience laughed out loud and one couple walked out half way.<br/><br/>I find it suspicious that the critics have panned the movie, yet the net is full of audience reviewers saying how funny it is ( check a rival site).

","Having seen the first part, you must be fooling yourself if you didn't expect the sequel to be absolutely crazy and awesome. The movie offers exactly that and much more. Its plot is more or less the same as the first, the only exception being Bangkok instead of Vegas. Even though the comedy is more hardcore and below the belt, it leaves you with tears of laughter and you're jaw stuck to the floor. Some scenes were so hilarious that for a second I almost forgot that it was a sequel.<br/><br/>It may not be as good as the first movie, but it was a pleasant relief from the drought of comedies this year. The Wolfpack was awesome as ever with Zach leading the way. No offence to anyone, but, no one plays a weirdo better than Zach.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I didn't quite like the ending, maybe because I knew what was going to happen next. This lack of originality may be the only reason for low ratings. But then, you don't expect the sequel of a movie like Hangover to be original, do you? I think the director did the best he could with this movie and delivered a gut-busting, rollicking experience.<br/><br/>Hangover-II is the best comedy this year and if you watch it without any cynicism, you're sure to have a laughter riot."

","First off, I always thought the first ""hangover"" was totally overrated. It was good, but best R-rated comedy of all time good? Heck no! So I wasn't that surprised when it turned out the second movie followed pretty much the exact same storyline with a few extra Asian jokes thrown in. As much as I love Galifinakas, Alan just was not as funny in this movie. He had his moments and his delivery of certain lines made me laugh, but it is hard to laugh at the same jokes we heard in the first movie. Lines about the ""wolf pack"" and pagers aren't as funny the second time they're used. A lot of the jokes were taken right from the first movie. Ed Helms was boring as usual and I was very disappointed in this film. Especially when Mike Tyson showed up at the end. What's funny about a washed up, former rapist/boxer who bites off people's ears when he can't scare them into losing a fight. Just his voice, and the fact that he thinks he has a chance at actually becoming an actor. A lot of sequels are bad, ""Hangover 2"" is one of the worst! Thank god for Zack Galifinakis, or i would have given this only one star."
"djay1948","1","2","2","15 May 2014"," Sad
","I guess I understand a bit better now why our society, especially American society, is in the toilet. I live in Thailand and only ran into this movie because the cable menu indicated that some of it was filmed in Bangkok. That a film like this could be created in the first place and that on one poll it could be rated A- on a scale of A to F by an audience primarily of young adults, is really depressing. That a comic like Ed Helms, who I like, would want to make a fool of himself, let alone be associated with a project like this, is very sad. Maybe the first version was funny. I can take a certain amount of raunchy violence if the underlying story has some redeeming value. But this crap calls for a redefinition of the meaning of pornography. No, on second thought, it IS pornography. <br/><br/>That some critics, including Roger Ebert, could find anything of merit in this film, simply confirms, as I suggested, how deep into the toilet we have plunged our heads. <br/><br/>I'm sure the producers of this film laughed all the way to the bank."

","Any part-time binge drinker knows that when you end up with a hangover the next day, no matter how much fun you had the night before, you're not going to be dumb enough to mix the same lethal cocktails ever again. ""The Hangover Part II"" would not be one of those hangovers you brag about the next day. Using the same ingredients with limited ""X"" factors, ""The Hangover Part II"" stirs up a familiar and predictable drink. Despite the familiar and comfy cast of characters, what once got America punch-drunk in 2009 will leave very few buzzed the second time around.<br/><br/>One can sense a tangible fear of deviating from the formula that brought moviegoers out in droves two summers ago in Todd Phillips follow-up effort. The events that unfold in Bangkok do so with minimal procession and perfunctory malaise, just as you expect them to, building to nothing but the next clue as to what happened the night before.<br/><br/>If only the night before were worth uncovering clues about. Visits to a monastery, tattoo parlor and a Thai strip club lay in store as the Wolfpack of Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Alan (Galifianakis) try and find out how they got drugged and lost Teddy, a 16-year-old who happens to be the brother of Stu's bride-to-be and child prodigy of his disapproving father- in-law. Despite antics from a drug-trafficking monkey, the return of Ken Jeong's crass and effeminate Mr. Chow and a barrage of inappropriate inserts from Alan, the laughs are few and far between, with some of the best already having been revealed by the trailers.<br/><br/>Normally, comedy sequels' undoing comes from such painstaking desperation to top the antics of the original that the follow-ups come across as blunt and hollow despite the laughs. ""The Hangover Part II"" plays it the opposite, hoping that by virtue of playing it safe that the lovable characters of the original will win out. In a story following such a rigid formula, however, new elements need to come from left field or the act gets stale quickly. It will not take long into the run time for ""Part II"" to feel uninspired. Even the character interaction and subplots remain identical to the first: Alan still seeks approval from the others, Stu still freaks out at every new bit of info learned and Phil tries to play it cool. Everything about the sequel feels like retreaded material with an Eastern flair. Redressing a formula can work, but not in a comedy whose predecessor relied so heavily on the element of surprise.<br/><br/>The lack of laughs provided for in the writing pins a lot of that responsibility on Galifianakis. Although Alan remains the best of the several characters he's played in the two years since being shot to fame by the original, he takes on the role of comic relief (along with a bit of help from Jeong). He has a 50-50 success rate, but he's kind of left out to dry because Phil and Stu simply aren't funny in this movie.<br/><br/>Laughs aside, however, the real killer proves to be the predictability. Phillips gives you at least a 10 second window to figure out what's coming next in almost every key scene. He's almost lazy in trying to conceal the script's few good cards and it weakens the laughs. Also, considering no characters except one have motive, figuring out how they got drugged again a second time takes little to no detective work. That reveal adds no emotional turmoil to the process. Devoid of any substance or creative thinking, the film come across as what it appears on the surface: an attempt to capitalize on the financial success of the original.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","First off, I previewed this movie for free. I did not waste my money. This movie was a vehicle for Zach Galifianakis' weird humor and Kim Jeong's high, screechy, awkward, ironically-gangsta voice. Ed Helms is stuck in his 'Office' character, and Bradley Cooper is... well, I'm pretty sure that he was in the movie, though he did nothing memorable. Mason Lee, (the future brother-in-law,) was such a terrible actor that I cringed when I saw him on screen. Mike Tyson wasn't much better, but I think the two could have switched roles and nobody would have cared. Paul Giamatti snapped me out of my boredom coma, but only long enough for me to lean over and tell my girlfriend how the rest of the movie was going to play out. I was mostly right; not because I'm clairvoyant, but because the script was just that bad and predictable. Todd Phillips will probably make a third movie in which Zach Galifianakis stages a fake engagement with a monkey in order to hang out with his friends, drug them, lose somebody and *spoiler* break Kim Jeong out of prison. Will Ferrell will make a cameo as the monkey.<br/><br/>P.S. I laughed when Zach Galifianakis said, ""I wish monkeys could Skype... maybe someday..."" and when he threw the anchor out of the beached speedboat."

","This movie is so bad I am really annoyed by the popular vote on it. Drugs, grotesque sex, violence, total lack of responsibility and morals, all presented as normal as a field of daisies. Is this what sells a picture today ? No, well-balanced people won't buy it. Would any accountable adult let his/her kids watch a piece of filth like this ? It's sickening. As for the so called action, hastily sewed together by some uninspired script writers, it's insulting to the people and authorities of Thailand, the big way. I very much doubt this rubbish will have any success in Bangkok. Probably the most appreciated scene will be the stick beating of the ""heroes"" by a monk. It's the only realistic and gratifying part of a production that didn't bring and shouldn't bring a single smile."

","This is another movie that was just done because the first one made a lot of money. Every single element of the previous hangover is present. There are no surprises frankly. You alredy know that they are going to take things a little further in terms of scathologic jokes, nudity and some slight twists on the plot. Now if we keep in mind that this is a comedy I did not heard many people laughing out loud like in the first movie. Surely it has its moments, but most of them are already seen in the trailer. The characters still have some chemistry on screen but Zach Gialafanakis is not fun this time ( its more like annoying). In the end a very regular movie to watch on TV on a Sunday afternoon. Compared to this the first one might still be considered a classic in the future."

","The second installment of the box office hit, ""The Hangover"" was not that great through the eyes of critics, but I honestly enjoyed watching these guys drunk again, even if they were too lazy to come up with new material. The film reunites the gang from the previous movie, as they all celebrate Stu's wedding in Thailand, but once again, after a long night of partying, they forget everything and they have to find the missing brother of the fiancée, and go on a little drunken scavenger hunt.....again! Now, I did laugh at this movie a lot, but I honestly felt that it was too dark. Meaning that, some of the jokes went way too far. I mean, this movie was way too raunchy, when it was supposed to be raunchy at an appropriate level. But at least I laughed a lot in this movie, but it's just that the first movie was funnier. I felt that a sequel to ""The Hangover"" is just plain pointless. If there was a sequel, it would be too predictable, because you would already know what's going to happen next. I felt that this was a completely unoriginal sequel, with such lazy writing. I bet the writers didn't know how to make a Hangover sequel, so they decided to just add the same premise from the original, and thought nobody will notice. Not smart, and not good. But, at least I laughed throughout the movie, but there were just some scenes that just went way too far! I did enjoy the characters again, there were some funny scenes, but that doesn't mean that it's a great movie overall, just a funny comedy with an unoriginal storyline. But that's all I want in a comedy, just make me laugh! I was easily entertained by the movie, and I enjoyed watching these characters again, but just watch the movie to laugh, because you just won't care about the plot! ""The Hangover Part II"", in my review, ""completely unoriginal, but totally hilarious""."

","It was terrible, I wish I could get back the last 102 mins of my life that I spent on this dreadful movie. If it wasn't for the exotic and beautiful landscape of Thailand, I would have fallen asleep. The same old formula unfortunately did not work this time around. To say that this was made for an immature, pubescent audience would be an insult to 12 year old boys. This movie is an insult to its audience, period. No wonder Asian countries make movies that portray Americans as rapists or crooks, look at how the main characters behave in Hollywood movies, made for the American male audience. I'd ask for my money back if I saw this at the cinema but thank goodness I watched it online at a European site, for free. Even then, NOT worth it."

It might be too much to say that the plot was predictable, but it sure as hell did'nt surprise me.

Misses wit and humor like the first one.<br/><br/>Warning for viewers, DO NOT SKIP end credits as it answers some questions that are not addressed anywhere in the movie.

","This is a prime example of how success can kill a franchise. The sequel to The Hangover is nothing more than a rushed, thoughtless, cash in on the first movie's success.<br/><br/>The plot is exactly the same as the first movie, they literally try to recreate every scene from the first movie, and thats no exaggeration, only now its set in Bangcock (and yes they joke about the name).<br/><br/>No character development is present in the span of these two films, in fact they seem to regress into even bigger idiots this time around. Alan has gone from a well meaning man-child to an obsessive, crybaby, asshole. Phil has no identifiable change at all, and Stu basically repeats the same character development that he did in the first film all over again.<br/><br/>The ""Wolfpack"" (which is what they constantly refer to themselves as) gets drugged by Alan again, and loses a friend again, forgets the night before again, meets up with Chow again, and has to piece the night together again. Stu cheats on his girl again (with a man this time, I didn't know muscle relaxers and ADD meds could turn you gay.), scars himself again, and even sings a little song again. But they finally find their friend at the zero hour again, rush back to the wedding again, Stu makes a big scene again, but the wedding goes on anyway again, Mike Tysons cameos again, and the movie ends with them looking at the pics on the camera again.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 2 just because Ken Jeong has an occasional funny line. Don't waste your money."

","I really liked the first Hangover movie because it was a very funny and original comedy. But The Hangover Part II turned out to be pretty much the same story as the first one except in a different country and city and it's one of the worst movies/sequels I've ever seen. <br/><br/>However, the only scenes that I enjoyed was when Phil gets shot and when Alan confesses that he drugged them again with the marshmallows. But the movie seemed to rely on vulgarity than comedy. And that part where it shows that Stu had sex with a transvestite was extremely disturbing. And the whole movie just felt unnecessary and a waste of money."
"g-bodyl","9","5","8","16 February 2013"," Predictable But Hilarious!
","The second installment in the Hangover franchise is very predictable since it almost exactly follows the plot line from the first film, but for some whatever odd reason, I laughed more in this film and thought the gags were a little better. The first film is a comedy classic, but this is just the film you wouldn't want to take too seriously. My favorite character in this film was the capuchin monkey because he was adorable and funny.<br/><br/>Todd Phillip's film reunites the wolf pack from the first film and this time sends them to Thailand for another wedding, which is Stu's this time. After a supposed-to-be-innocent campfire, the gang wakes up in Bangkok in deep trouble as they are having yet another hangover. It all goes bad to worse when they realize the brother of Stu's wife-to-be is missing.<br/><br/>The actors have really great chemistry and they feed off each other's energy. Bradley Cooper reprises his role as Phil and he is great again. Zach Galifinakis makes the perfect Alan since he is so weird. I just loved Alan's weirdness and that dinner scene where he is reading those notecard facts. Ed Helms is also really good as Stu who wants to take it easy but is resisted. I liked Ken Jeong's return somewhat but I found him more annoying in this movie than funny.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is on par with the original film, maybe even a little funnier. This has a way darker tone as most films do these days but I was pleased there were many jokes here to counter that. Despite it's predictability, I laughed and laughed. I'm ready for the third film as long as it has something different. I rate this film 9/10."

","Loud, crude, stupid and BORING! The 1st Hangover was barely tolerable. It too was loud and stupid, but it had enough laughs to keep me interested to the end of the film. Apparently the producers figured that being lewd, crude and obnoxious to an even greater degree was all that was needed for the sequel. After 45 minutes of this mess, I had not even cracked a smile. I was even willing to bet that the government of Thailand was seriously regretting ever having issued a filming permit (maybe they didn't issue a permit). In any event, this movie lacked any humor or other redeeming social value. After the tasteless scene in the Ladyboy bar, I had enough and called it quits.

Two parts of the movie made me laugh, one was a ""realization"" one of the guys had in Thailand and the other was a cameo appearance at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Watching this movie reminded me of how spoiled I've been with sequels of late (ie Wall Street - which was actually pretty good).

","The Hangover Part II is a great movie with a well written plot and a terrific comedic cast. As far as sequels go, I found it to be a very solid one that lives up to the fun and mayhem of its predecessor, taking the characters to new heights and higher risks. It had me in stitches, as well as enthralled by this adventure. <br/><br/>I do think that it borrows far too many elements from the first Hangover, it felt like the writers were far too aware of what made its predecessor a success that they did not even bother to try to come up with fresher material. What happens to the characters is the exact same as the first, only bigger, but that does not mean better. <br/><br/>The cast are as brilliant as ever, with them all still bouncing off one another brilliantly. It is an absolute pleasure to have Zach Galifanakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper return to their respective roles, and they are joined by many other cast members, old and new, that fit the ensemble terrificly. <br/><br/>A fun sequel that is very forgiveable for not being perfect. The Hangover Part II is good fun that I would certainly recommend fans of the original check out. <br/><br/>

And, I guess, some people love the ""originality"" so much that any film without something really ""new"" in itself is purely unbearable to watch; which means that these haters will not be able to tolerate almost 99% of the films since you can almost always follow a script, directing and even acting to another film in the history.<br/><br/>Hangover II was smooth, funny (not as funny as the first one though), with an above average acting and directing.

","The premise of The Hangover: Part II is nearly identical to the first – the same ""wolfpack"" from the first movie, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Doug (Justin Bartha) and the not entirely welcome man- child, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), throw a wild, out-of-control bachelor party that results in the loss of an important character.<br/><br/>At first blush, it seemed as though this movie, with its recycled premise and familiar characters another painfully obvious attempt to wring the last few cents out of a Hollywood cash cow. However, director Todd Phillips, easily quiets these criticisms by playfully mocking the similarities and by upping the raunchiness, insanity, and humor of the movie.<br/><br/>Galifianakis once again steals the show as the perfectly crafted weirdo Alan, who's sporadic and bizarre interjections enliven momentary lulls in the movie. Alan's antics are further accentuated by the return of the humorous and insane criminal, Chow (Ken Jeong). Combined with new, shockingly outrageous situations, the duo keeps the laughs coming and in doing so gets the audience to forget the movie's lack of originality.<br/><br/>Regardless of my strong recommendation, wholesome moviegoers and those who are wholeheartedly convinced that this movie is nothing but a remake should skip The Hangover: Part II because, to be honest, this isn't a movie to be taken seriously. It is not a cinematic masterpiece by any stretch and the storyline is weak at best, but if you're willing to venture into the bowels of Bangkok for a raunchy, silly, sophomoric, and extremely amusing movie, call up your wolf pack and head to see an amusing movie you'll never forget – hopefully."

","Two years ago, a movie came out that was so original and hilarious that it became the highest grossing r- rated comedy of all time. That movie was The Hangover, and now it's time for the obligatory sequel. With this sequel comes the most disappointing film thus far this year. That's not to say The Hangover 2 doesn't have its fair share of laugh out loud moments, and that's not to say it's the worst film of the year so far...it's just to say I was expecting so much more. The Hangover 2 is an exact copy of the first one except in the aspects of originality, humor, and just plain fun. In the original, Alan, Stu, and Phil lost the groom, Doug (who was left out of the gang again in this one...which felt really forced.) Now, Stu's getting married and they lose Teddy, Stu's fiancées younger, much more successful brother. Just like the first one, they have to go find out just what happened by going through a series of wacky events, but these events aren't wacky, they're just forced which ruins the whole point of the film. I won't tell the many people who are going to see this anyway no matter what I say what ends up happening to Teddy, but let's just say it's pretty mean spirited and dull. Also, Ken Jeong returns as Chow, which feels really tacked on and ruins every scene Chow is in. Overall, The Hangover 2 is very disappointing if not at times laugh out loud funny. At the average of $10 a ticket, it's just not worth it to see it in theaters. I'd say wait for Redbox or Netflix, if even that."

If you've seen the movie, then Todd Phillips who is both a co-writer and director, just stole your 12 dollars.<br/><br/>You essentially get the exact plot as the first Hangover. Scene by scene. The only thing that changed was the setting. Instead of Vegas you get Bangkok. All the comedy comes at the expense of stereo types. Asian's with small penis, jokes about Asian women not having breast, or my personal favorite, comparing a Thai monk to the Grand Wizard of the KKK. Let's not mention the fact of buying a black man...but not permanently, just for the night. Also the idea of American children frolicking about Bangkok, taking shots of alcohol, drinking beer, snorting cocaine all while hanging out with transvestites... that type of shock humor just doesn't qualify for comedy. The film gives you the type of laughter you get when you feel uncomfortable, you just don't know it until you leave.

The jokes are often crude and there are only one or two strong laughs mainly coming from Galifianakis. People will like this film or pretend too, just because of the first movie, for example laugh when Alan or Phil do anything out of the ordinary, like most of the audience did at my theatre.

"MosHr","4","36","94","24 May 2011"," An exact copy of the first Hangover in Bangkok with a displeasing undertone for Asians
","The movie needs no introduction nor a plot outline literally; it's basically a carbon copy of the first one and so instead of everyone screaming ""what's happening?"", it's everyone screaming ""it happened again"" and then basically everyone going through exactly the same motions.<br/><br/>One thing this movie illustrates, albeit very unintentionally, is the pathetic state of the Asian-American influence on Hollywood and American entertainment industry. The subtext of the movie is the emasculation of the Asian male; the proud father whose daughter is taken almost against his will, a bright young man who is a brilliant musician and a aspiring surgeon has his finger chopped off and casually discarded, an Asian gangster whose penis is the size of a mushroom whose driving skills aren't that good to boot and worst of all Bangkok, whose most prominent resident is a transvestite. Poor Bangkok! Bangkok isn't the virile and threatening place that's been seen in many movies, it's just an ""Asiantown"" to be conquered and beaten - words echoed by the characters themselves.<br/><br/>Stu (Helms) is now marrying Lauren (Chung) however her father considers Stu to be boring as white rice. The father-in-law is half a dimensional character and rather sadly I can't think of a solid Asian actor who could give it more dimensionality. Lauren's brother Teddy is the apple of his father's eyes who is played an actor who is nothing short of a bobble-head who doesn't express a single emotion and goes through the movie with a contorted smile that he can't stifle. Ken Jeong gives a good performance playing a gangster who is unpredictable and out of control, but completely toothless, meek and nonthreatening; and ultimately discarded without a single thought. The movie tries to be about the empowering and masculinization of Stu and that there is a darkness inside him but it really is just thrown in there in the end and not a theme whatsoever. The three main actors Cooper, Galifianakis and Helms have since the last Hangover gone on to become big names and they do their thing.<br/><br/>It's a cliché but the Hangover Bangkok edition could have been so much more. But, what it is that it's a slumming through Bangkok with the ugly American point of view, and a testament to the pathetic state of Asian-American actors, cultural icons and general influence on the entertainment industry."

Everything is significantly grittier, darker, and ruder. At times Zach Galifianakis' character was less like the Alan we met first time around and more like Ethan from ""Due Date"". He was still very funny as are the other guys, but there was just an air of disrespect and insolence to the whole thing.<br/><br/>Their references to the original ""The Hangover"" were quite funny, and although I probably would have rather watched it, this was another original take with the same characters and formula that I fell in love with. I laughed not as often as I did the first time around, but I still laughed just as much as I was expecting too.<br/><br/>The problem when Hollywood gets their hands on a good idea, is that they need to make everything bigger and bolder. The jokes are more outrageous, less witty, their adventures are more shocking, less creative, and instead of intelligent, snappy dialogue we get chase scenes and explosions. Of course we do. They got to spend more than twice as much money.<br/><br/>Although ""The Hangover Part II"" is an inferior product to the brilliantly funny original, there are laughs and everything is more extreme as they promised."

Start off with a flashback to the beginning of the third act, Bradley Cooper on the phone to someone at the wedding, follow up with a montage set to a Danzig song, throw in some Kanye leading up to the titular event, have them wake up in complete disarray mere days before a wedding, with one of the group (shock horror) missing! Quest to find him while keeping the missus in the dark about the whole situation, with some cute sidekicks a long the way and a bat sh*t crazy Ken Jeong.

While working their way towards the middle to speak with the owner, they bypass tens of young looking, teenage looking girls working as strippers. They finally get to the owner, and he remembers them from the night before and is looking to sell them his gun. The men tell him ""we are looking for a boy"", and he answers ""$2000"". Thinking the owner is referring to the gun, they are shocked and answer ""what??"". The owner then says, ""$2000. What age do you want"" referring obviously to child prostitution. As I sat there in my seat, wanting to puke to death, my wife and I looked at each other and immediately got up and left the movie theater. But even more APPALLING, DISGUSTING, and DISTURBING than the child prostitution joke was the fact that from the 300 people in the movie theater, only two people from the audience decided to leave.

"omsarmalkar","2","11","25","29 May 2011"," The Hangover Part II' is disappointing
","Anyone who swears by 'The Hangover' is likely to be disappointed by its sequel, which as it turns out is a carbon copy of the earlier film. With 'The Hangover Part II', director Todd Phillips has made the exact same movie all over again. Except that he's set it in Thailand, and the jokes aren't that funny anymore. So once again, a bachelor party spins out of control and the guys wake up the next morning with no memory of the previous night's misadventures, only to realize that someone is missing. From there, it's a mad rush trying to retrace their steps and to put the pieces together. Two years ago, 'The Hangover' crept into our cinemas quietly. With a cast of mostly unknowns and a director who was hardly A-list, the film arrived with no expectations whatsoever. Yet, that ribald comedy went down as 2009's biggest surprise hit thanks to the novelty of its premise and the unpredictability of its characters and their behavior. Remember how shocked you were when one of them pretends to jerk off a baby? Or when they discover a tiger in the bathroom? Or when Mike Tyson shows up? The new film doesn't work because it's missing that element of surprise. That joy of stumbling into an outrageous, unexpected joke has all but vanished in 'The Hangover Part II', whose gags feel so familiar that you wonder why you're paying to watch the same film again. Our heroes Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up not in a Caesar's Palace suite on this occasion, but a fleabag hotel in Bangkok. Instead of finding a baby or a tiger in their hotel room, they find a chain-smoking monkey. And Ed, who's the groom-to-be this time round, doesn't wake up with a tooth missing, but with a tattoo on his face. Gross gags are plenty in this sequel, as you would expect from a comedy set in the seedy streets of Bangkok. In 'The Hangover' Stu woke up to discover he'd married a stripper. In this sequel, let's just say he's done something far more shocking. Mr Chow (Ken Jeong), that effeminate criminal from the earlier film returns too, and shows us more of himself than we'd like to see. They even repeat the end credits photo montage, a clever way to fill in the blanks from the blackout night; but while it's more adult this time, it doesn't have the same comic impact as it did in 'The Hangover'. The biggest disappointment in this film is Zach Galifianakis, who reprises his role as bearded man-child Alan. After practically stealing the earlier film with his hilarious one-liners and his deadpan delivery, Galifianakis plays Alan as a not-particularly-lovable weirdo this time. The only scenes in which we see that old spark are the ones in which Alan takes an instant dislike to Stu's brother-in-law who he fears is threatening to infiltrate the Wolfpack. 'The Hangover Part II' is not without a few laughs, but the operative word here is 'few'. The best jokes in this film, incidentally all appear in the trailer. I'm going with two out of five for 'The Hangover Part II'. Prepare to be seriously underwhelmed."
"FilmWhinge","1","24","65","26 May 2011"," Don't bother, you've seen it already.
","The Hangover Part II is the inevitable sequel to a film, which proved that comedies that were unfunny, unlikeable and thoroughly boring could be both commercial and critical hits. This one proves that they can have equally unfunny, unlikeable and thoroughly boring sequels.<br/><br/>The film picks up two years after the events of the first film, with Stu (Ed Helms) preparing to fly over to Thailand for his wedding. Along comes Phil (Bradley Cooper) and, to everyone's dismay, Alan (Zack Galifianakis). Finally, they all wake up in a sleazy hotel room in inner city Bangkok with someone missing and a wedding to get to. <br/><br/>One of the main problems with The Hangover Part II is that it follows the exact structure of the first one, almost scene by scene, making it about as worthwhile as one of Haneke's or Van Sant's shot-for-shot remakes. There are no changes beyond the location and the species of animal that they have to deal with. Smugness pervades as we are dragged from one tired set piece to another without any improvements made to the equally tired formula of the first film. The lack of character development isn't a shock, however, as it has been clearly shown before that these are not characters; these are loud, screaming, incredibly irritating voids. Alan is still weird, Stu is still having trouble asserting himself, Phil is still a child, Mr. Chow (a grating Ken Joeng) jumps out of something and everything stops for another terrible musical number. The idea seems to be that people will be happy to pay to see the first film again if you alter some slight details. <br/><br/>It took three writers to string all of this together, an incoherent film filled with bits and pieces held together by a structure that has proved entirely unsuccessful. It's a mystery film in which people look back at things that have already happened. We know the outcome and we can guess the reason, so why bother showing us. For example, Stu wakes up with the much-litigated Tyson tattoo. Why did he get it? Because he was drunk. Do we really need the film to get bogged down in the intricacies of how he got it?<br/><br/>It is worth pointing out that none of this would particularly matter if the film was funny. Comedy is probably the only genre which can be gravely terrible in every way, but which can get away with it if it is funny. These films aren't funny, because the characters aren't well drawn and the situations they get into just aren't believable. They aim for outlandish but manage only to become fantasy. At least Dude, Where's My Car? was clever enough to become complete science fiction, rather than trying to convince the audience that all this could happen. Ultimately, however, the film just isn't funny because it lacks any conceivable wit, uses only tried-and-tested jokes and repeats them again and again. And then a couple more times after that. <br/><br/>If you like The Hangover then just watch it again. If you don't, then pay for something worthwhile."
"Hellmant","6","6","12","27 May 2011"," The uninspired sequel part 347!
","'THE HANGOVER PART II': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Following the likes of 'GHOSTBUSTERS II' and 'HOME ALONE 2' this sequel is an exact carbon copy of the original with mild variations for setting and time differences. It also plays on the Deja Vu 'it's happening again' formula (used by many unimpressive sequels) for shameless and forced comedic effect (like 'HOME ALONE 2'). Stu, Phil and Allan (Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis reprising the roles that made them famous) are once again completely hungover, missing a buddy and don't have a clue how they got so 'shit faced' or what happened to them. It's once again two evenings prior to one of the three's wedding except this time they're in Thailand and it's the bride's younger brother that's missing. The film plays out almost in step by step formation to the original. Tod Phillips once again directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong (replacing the original two writers). I think the writer change-up might be one of the film's biggest problems because the movie is not only unoriginal but it's not nearly as funny as it's predecessor, with many of the jokes (as well as performances) feeling forced and weak.<br/><br/>This time around Stu is getting married to a young Asian beauty named Lauren (Jamie Chung), who's father completely disapproves of him. At Phil and Doug's (Justin Bartha also reprising his role from the original) insistence Stu invites Alan to his wedding in Thailand at the last minute. This causes problems from the get-go when Alan is immediately intimidated by Lauren's 16 year old brother Teddy (Mason Lee), feeling that he threatens his close friendships with the others. Stu doesn't want anything to jeopardize his ideal wedding so he refuses to have a bachelor party. After agreeing to one drink on the beach with his buddies though things get crazy somehow regardless.<br/><br/>I was a huge fan of the original film, in my opinion it's a 5 star comedy classic (out of 5 stars), so I was especially disappointed with this sequel. I really wanted to like it (like many), so I didn't completely give up on it until I finished watching it. I kept really hoping it might turn itself around but it just didn't work in my opinion. It's not just the fact that it's a lazy duplicate of the original it's the fact that it's just not nearly as funny. The actors feel like they're just going through the motions again at times. I thought Helms was really funny in the original but here he's mostly just annoying. Galifianakis is funny at times but his material also feels the most forced (most of the time). Cooper is the only one that truly stays true to his original character but he's not enough. Although the film has funny moments and reaches new realms of disgusting crudeness the writing just feels uninspired. Phillips' directing would work if the material was fitting of it. The humor has just lost all it's freshness and joy. The filmmakers rely too much on the fact that most viewers are big fans of the original so they think the jokes will work just out of familiarity. They try too hard to recapture the magic of the first film when it's way too soon for that. The nostalgia feel really could have worked for a sequel ten to twenty years later, especially with the characters (and actors) being much older and being too old to be getting blackout wasted and involved in all kinds of drunk hooligan antics. That could be a hilarious sequel and now that I think about it I really hope they do that for the third chapter. Any sequel sooner than that will most likely spell DISAPPOINTMENT once again. Comparing the film to the first movie makes me want to give it something like a two out of five star rating but I know that wouldn't be fair. It's still at least slightly better than your average slapstick comedy film, just extremely disappointing.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB9HKWgqhbY"

","First off, lets start by saying that I have never written a review on IMDb for any movie. I have decided it is necessary with this film because it has been unfairly scrutinized by other IMDb users. This film is predictable! You would probably understand that if you watched any of the trailer before the movie, and if you went into this movie expecting a completely new movie you are an idiot. That being said.. it is very easy to ruin a movie with the same plot, no character development, and just a change of location. THEY DID NOT RUIN THIS FILM. This movie was great, it was funny from start to finish. They even found a way to push the limit slightly farther than the first film with even more lewd gags. It is obvious that everything from the first one is back, the monkey takes the place of the baby, Thailand for Vegas, Doug for a small Asian boy. I have read the other user reviews on this site giving this movie a one star and it makes me sick. These are the type of people that do not enjoy lewd humor, they go for the sure enjoyment of getting angry at a film to bash it on the internet. I read one persons review where they called the first film a light hearted comedy.. Light hearted? Are you kidding me? They showed a baby masturbating.. You knew what you would get from Hangover 2 and yet you still go and complain. Its like any other film that is successful.. don't change the formula.. They have been doing it in horror films for years. Could you imagine Saw 2 if Jigsaw was not back in the film creating traps to kill more people? It would have then just been a 70 year old guy with cancer running around with a gun. Where is the fun in that? Long story short... If you are going to sit in here and talk about camera angles like you are a professional director and film critic just leave, if i wanted to read that side of it I could have read roger Egbert's. THIS MOVIE WAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANTED IF YOU ENJOYED THE FIRST ONE! GO SEE IT, EXPECT THE SAME THING, BUT LAUGH YOUR ASS OFF THE ENTIRE TIME!"

","I am always leery of sequels but this time I figured The Hangover was SO good, how could it go wrong? Well it did. Yes, the story was far-fetched like the first one, but this one was ridiculous. Stu is getting married and the whole crew flies to Thailand for the wedding. Stu didn't want to include Alan this time but was convinced that there will be no problems. Lauren, the bride has a 16 year old brother, Teddy, who flies with them from the states. Teddy is a genius and the family's cherished child. I found it difficult to watch Lauren's father belittling Stu all the time and Lauren just stood by. That got very 'old.' Before the wedding, Stu said that he didn't want to take any chances, so there would be no bachelor party. Somehow sitting by a bonfire and drinking beer, they got into trouble. And once again Mr. Chow turns up. They thought that he was dead after taking his pulse and hid him in an ice machine in a hotel. Yet miraculously later he is alive. And of course someone was lost and this time it was Teddy, the prodigal son. And this time they brought in a monkey who was cute at first but became very annoying. Yes this movie was disjointed like the first one but somehow it worked with the first, this time it didn't. The scenery is nice and it was interesting to see the city of Bangkok, but that was not enough. Yes there were laughs but if you want to see a fabulous comedy now, see Bridemaids, which is not a chick flick."

","A film that honestly seems as though it was written about 30 minutes after the original. Honestly, no thought nor effort has gone into this turd. It plays on the assumption that using the exact same jokes from the first film, and using more of what was popular, is a good idea for a film. That is never a good idea. It's simply lazy. Since DVDs, the internet and streaming have come into play, you'd expect companies to try something drastically new. I don't want to see another version of the 1st film. I can see the 1st film easily enough. The actors are all on autopilot, probably just enjoying the free vacation to Thailand. If this was a 10-20 year reunion film, I could excuse the repetitive nature, and needless cameos, but the original is fresh in my mind, and also a lot damn funnier."

I'm curious - if they make a version based in Paris will they include Big Ben?

I can only imagine that people who hated it didn't watch enough to bother writing a review."
"theclipboards","1","35","112","24 May 2011"," Racist and Offensive film.
","I get films like Old School, Due Date, Animal House, but I don't get how films like the Hangover get made, especially Hangover 2. This film is full of racist jokes about Asian stereotypes. I may not be Asian, but have Asian friends, and I don't think they'll find this even the slightest bit funny. They make fun of Asian families, Asian Monks/culture, Asian Males, Asian Females and their bodies. They also make Americans, White Americans look super ignorant. I'm American, and I don't think all Asians are a certain way. <br/><br/>Besides the racism, the jokes are all typical, and all try too hard. Heard it all before kind of jokes. I didn't find any of their jokes funny, and I laugh at films like this sometimes, but they took it too far. They copy all the jokes that have already been done, and I can't stand Bradley or Zach as actors. The acting is so bad, no comedic timing at all. Nothing surprised me in this film, nothing good. How could these actors agree to a film like this. So disappointing.<br/><br/>I don't think seeing white guys getting drunk in foreign countries is funny, at least not the way these people did it."
"ssvikas","4","6","13","30 May 2011"," Lazy piece of work that reeks of mediocrity
","Precisely two years ago, 'The Hangover' had swept the audience off their feet with its cleverly written humor and making a sequel is a humongous challenge. But Todd Phillips and his team seem to have run out of ideas and merely copy-pasted the first film. Essentially, the cast and the conflict are retained and only the setting is changed.<br/><br/>So, what are the changes? Vegas tuns into Bangkok; the tiger is now a drug dealing monkey; instead of the groom, the bride's teenage brother goes missing; it's an old monk instead of an abandoned baby; Stu falls for a stripper then, now err, ahem, let's leave it unsaid; Stu's girlfriend was mean back then and it's his father-in-law belittling him now; spiked drink then, drugged marshmallows now; the list is endless.<br/><br/>Stu is all set to be married to Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Bangkok. Not wanting to face another disaster, Stu limits the celebrations to a bachelor brunch and keeps Alan away, only letting him in later, albeit reluctantly. After a 'just one drink' night by the bonfire, the suddenly wake up in a seedy hotel in Bankok's by-lanes. Like the first film, the rest of the story is about finding their friend and making it to the wedding.<br/><br/>Those who have seen the first will find nothing new in the second and newbies may miss out on humor having roots in the original. The film does have some genuinely funny moments, like Alan's dinner speech and Stu's song on the boat, but those come between long lulls. The lack of surprise is covered up with explicit scenes and dark stuff like chopped fingers and a guy losing pulse that are unfunny.<br/><br/>The cast is the same and their roles don't change much. Zach Galifianakis as Alan, the weirdo is still the star, but hasn't he become predictable? Remember his similar role in 'Due Date', again by the same director? Bradley Cooper continues as the more balanced Phil and Ed Helms is still a wimp who manages a show of temper towards the end. Ken Jeong has a bigger role as Mr Chow that has been played over the top.<br/><br/>Even if the movie makers were granted a benefit of doubt that the audience expected too much, it doesn't absolve them of the responsibility to come up with something good. They could have experimented with Doug in a bigger role or getting Alan married. And Bangkok is not 'some Asian city' as they call it when it is a bustling metropolis.<br/><br/>Per se, it doesn't really hurt to watch it since it's better than many brain-dead comedies. But in giving it a chance, you could be flirting with disappointment."
"justifythegame","3","7","16","26 May 2011"," Similar to the first film minus the laughs
","There are funny films, where there is something to make you laugh every step of the way, and then there are films where the funniest part in the whole movie is the small bit they showed in the TV ads or trailers. The latter is where i would categorize this movie. <br/><br/>I liked the Hangover part 1, i didn't love it, but i thought it was funny and worth watching. This sequel is similar in terms of the same setup, but i thought the parts that were intended to be comedy didn't land. I had similar feelings to highly hyped comedy sequels e.g meet the fockers - the attempts at comedy just weren't funny like the first movie. It might be a decent movie to go to with your friends and force yourself to laugh every time the ""cues"" are presented though, the crowd sure was into it. But if you're a person who likes to think a bit more about the the actual comedy, plot, and script i suggest you avoid this movie. <br/><br/>*possible spoiler*: The only part i genuinely laughed at was the scene that was already shown in the commercial: one of the guys get shot and the ""dentist"" who calls himself a doc takes a look and starts screaming.<br/><br/>As for the acting, i thought the big three stars acted well enough, i just don't think they had a lot to work with when they got the script. Ken Jeong has a larger role in this movie. If you have seen Jeong in other appearances you will quickly realize he is very unfunny, i have even seen him get booed at live events. Though his portrayal of Mr. Chow in this movie isn't horrible, his extended screen time definitely ruins some of the movie in my opinion. <br/><br/>I would've enjoyed re-watching the first film more because the plot is very similar and there were a number of scenes i genuinely laughed at whereas this movie hardly made me laugh. Thats why i wouldn't even recommend renting this."
"Rickting","1","3","5","9 January 2014"," Ugly and unfunny
","I really liked the first movie, because it was very funny without being mean spirited, and had the right level of rudeness. I was excited to see this, not expecting it to be very good but expecting it to be fun at least. I was wrong. In this inevitable sequel, the wolf pack go to Thailand for Stu's wedding and after another disastrous bachelor party they wake up in a hotel room in Bangkok with no memory of last night and the younger brother of Stu's fiancée goes missing and they have to find him. Is any of this sounding familiar? If so, I'm not surprised since this is literally the exact same as the first movie. But there are a few small differences such as it's a monkey instead of a tiger and they're in Bangkok instead of Vegas. The biggest difference is that while the first was hilarious fun this is a nasty, repugnant, pathetic, numbingly unfunny, abysmally written, lazy, mean spirited and utterly unbearable stink-bomb of a sequel that's more disturbing than funny.<br/><br/>There are a couple of funny moments and the place where they find who they were looking for feels more logical than it did in the first one. Aside from that, this is utterly woeful. The cast lose much of their sparkle, especially Bradley Cooper while the script is painfully unfunny and full of tasteless humour and flat jokes. The film is mean spirited and lazy, expecting audiences to be satisfied with a carbon copy and expecting them to laugh at these unpleasant gags. This takes all that was fun about the first and turns it up to 11. It's racist, sexist, foul mouthed and full of disturbing situations and it, in general, isn't funny. This has to be one of the laziest and worst sequels of all time and while most don't seem to hate it quite as much as I do, many will disappointed. Aside from a couple of laughs (Mainly involving Alan) this is about as fun as being punched in the face. This is evidence that just because the jokes are ruder it doesn't make them funnier.<br/><br/>1/10"

There are times where it is the exact same or almost the exact same.....<br/><br/>So what?

"the_rattlesnake25","5","7","17","26 May 2011"," It takes a little too long for the script to kick in Bangkok style!
","Same cast. Same setup. Different location. Todd Phillips returns to the directorial chair to helm the sequel to the 2009 comedy hit 'The Hangover'. After grossing over $450m worldwide from a modest $35m budget, it was inevitable that the boys would be back for another forgettable (for them anyway) outing. While it doesn't reach the same joke per minute ratio as the original film did, it does provide enough laughs to keep the audience occupied through the one hour and forty minute running time. However if monkey related humour is not your cup of tea, then the first half of the film will no doubt drag a little for you.<br/><br/>Stu (Ed Helms) has finally found the right woman to marry in Lauren (Jamie Chung), and they head-off to Thailand to get married. As Stu sadly still cannot truly recollect the horrors of their Las Vegas night-out, he opts for a traditional and safe, pre-Wedding brunch instead of an bachelor party. However, yet again things do not go to plan for the 'Wolfpack' as Stu, Alan (Zack Galifianakis), and Phil (Bradley Cooper) must attempt to retrace from the previous night's escapade to find Lauren's younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee) who joined the boys on their night-out. As the déjà vu sets in, they move from character to character, including the resurrection of high-pitched Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), and from place to place to try and piece together the forgotten night's carnage before it is too late. A few famous faces are thrown in for good measure, but their roles do not need to be spoiled here as they are merely cannon fodder aimed at extending the plot for just a few more minutes allowing for an extra sequence to be casually included here and there.<br/><br/>With nothing literally changing aside from the location a few minor plot points (e.g. Stu's, rather than Doug's wedding), 'The Hangover Part 2' relies solely on the strength of its script and the jokes it will throw at the audience. Phillips, Armstrong and Mazin essentially centre the humour around three key areas; the changing of the character's normal appearances, the differences and constraints between Western and Asian customs and the actual personality and action of the characters, most notably Alan. Galifianakis is at the centre of the majority of comedic moments, however it is not always what says, but unusually what he does, that creates the laugh-out-loud elements. His little mannerisms and unabashedly reactions both verbal and physical to relatively simply questions are both squirming-ly embarrassing and funny at the same. While both Stu and Phil play second fiddle to Alan's constant ability to make the wrong comment at the wrong time, but in an entirely innocent, and somewhat childish way. He keeps the film ticking over, especially during the first half of the film's narrative and during the moments in which shock value tends to creep into the script intending to both cause shock and amusement, yet it tends to create neither.<br/><br/>'The Hangover Part 2' is the first film, but set in a different city with a couple more extreme characters and sequences thrown in for good measure. The script is heavily set on propelling shock value over verbal humour, but when the script does eventually kick in during the second half of the film, it provides plenty of hilarious moments that seem to arrive just a little too late. However, it must be noted, that as the narration has been replicated almost plot-point for plot-point it is still worth staying till the very end to view one visual joke that does work perfectly in sync with a movie. It may feel like déjà vu, but photos sometimes tell the whole story (and then some)."
"summer_meg","1","4","8","6 January 2012"," Worst movie to date
","I really liked the first Hangover. I was excited to see this one. Unfortunately this sequel was one of the worst movies I have seen to date. Did they even have writers? The movie relied on the gross out, shock factor and was not funny at all. I put this movie down with Sex and the city Two. It's like they had the actors already on contract, they knew that the title would sell so why not churn this garbage out with no thought, editing or skill. It makes me mad to think of how good this movie could have been. That they have missed a opportunity.If you like the first one, don't watch this one! I wish I didn't. Save your money. Don't watch sequels unless they have a good rating. Otherwise you like watching a sad flicker of the original."

","Hilarious.<br/><br/>But for those who've given this less than ten and complained about it being similar to the first movie: Its a sequel...get over it. In fact the film is funnier for following the rubric of the first. Repetition if done correctly in comedy is absolute gold. Re-occurring jokes create symmetry. If you fail to see the humour in the repetition from the first than you missed the biggest joke of the film...shame on you.<br/><br/>From another perspective what else can you do in a movie called the hangover II? really not much, its a painted corner, but a corner that was peppered with just outrageous jokes from start to finish. And thats what we all came for right? <br/><br/>The specific funnies in this film I think far outweigh those of the first. ask yourself, can monkeys skype?"

","So the boys are back in what is basically more of the same of the first film. difference being, it's on a broader scale and the prospective brother-in-law goes missing.<br/><br/>I'm all for sequels where it's much more of the same thing, but when it's done lazily like this, you get something thats more Beverly Hills Cop 2, than something that should up the ante.<br/><br/>The first hangover was original, funny and hit the boundaries on new comedy. The fundamental part being 'original'. We had characters we didn't really care about. apart from the weird one. and the prostitute. Which was totally anti-Apatow, and refreshing.<br/><br/>Gone from this are the likable characters, and in are the barrel scrapings of mankind. A cop who doesn't give a hoot about their situation, The annoying token Asian from the first one, and Alan, who just doesn't have that charm anymore, because we are now used to his shtick.<br/><br/>The main problem though is Helms, who just whines and whines throughout the whole movie. Each scream sounds more like nails down a chalk board as the film progresses, ans one wishes that Cooper would just slap him on his new Tattoo.<br/><br/>Cooper here though is the saving grace. he's laid back and logical, giving the films best lines.<br/><br/>This is by far Phillips worst movie, and to be fair, a blatant cash in of the first. There will be a third one no doubt, thanks to the ticket sales, and hopefully Phillips will do something a little more original next time.<br/><br/>A worthless dud with a few funny lines and thats it.<br/><br/>Gibson got off lightly"
"rushe-place","3","5","11","27 May 2011"," Surprisingly dark tone for a summer comedy
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I just saw ""The Hangover Part II"" yesterday, which kind of turned out to be a bizarre experience as far as films go. Before I talk about the movie though, I should mention my thoughts on the first one.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" I didn't see the original ""Hangover"" in theatres. It looked like a typical dumb stoner comedy and it seemed to have the exact same premise and story as ""Dude, Where's My Car?"", which despite having its moments, was still really stupid. I ended up seeing ""The Hangover"" at a free screening at school, and I ended up really liking it. That movie is what ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" should have been like; it's set entirely in reality, the characters are intelligent, likable, and relatable, and it keeps the plot moving. A few of the jokes are awkward and obviously ad-libbed, but ""The Hangover"" is still overall lighthearted, unpredictable, and funny the whole way through.<br/><br/>""The Hangover Part II"" This sequel is a lot like ""Home Alone 2"", in the sense that it takes the same formula from the first film and just puts it in another, more over-the-top setting. The only differences in the plot are that it has to go to ridiculous lengths to set up the same conflict, and since this is the second time the characters have been in this situation, they keep stopping everything to comment on how they ""can't believe it happened again"" and wonder why it keeps happening. The opening scene of ""The Hangover Part II"" is practically a carbon copy of the opening in the original, except Phil is almost in tears because he and the guys screwed up even worse this time. Kind of a bad omen for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>And that's the ultimate problem with this sequel: it tries too hard to outdo the original on an emotional level. This ends up giving Part II a surprisingly dark tone for a summer comedy. For instance, instead of having one of the characters lose a tooth this time around, one of them loses an entire finger. What's more, the severed finger belongs to the character who's gone missing—a sixteen-year-old kid, mind you—which creates a real fear that he might actually be dead. Did you ever honestly think that the missing character in the first movie was dead? I didn't, because the few times that this possibility came up, it was presented in an exaggerated and humorous context.<br/><br/>The whole sequel is crawling with equally unfunny scenes of the main characters getting into heated arguments with each other and even getting shot and injured. Their reactions to everything in this film seem to be of genuine horror instead of comedic panic and confusion, and Stu has an entire subplot where he seriously wonders if deep down he's a sick monster who doesn't deserve to get married and live happily. I'm not against adding drama and character development in a comedy, but doing it this much and then occasionally throwing in a crude joke just leaves the audience with a bipolar film that they don't know what to think of.<br/><br/>Probably the best example of this is a scene where a character from the first movie drops dead in front of Phil, Stu, and Alan. I still don't know if their responses were supposed to be funny or serious; rather than shrieking and running around the room in a clearly humorous manner, we see Phil frantically searching for a pulse, Stu wailing in anguish, and Alan crying. Considering what the dead character was like in the first movie, it doesn't really make sense to give their demise such an unclear tone.<br/><br/>""The Hangover Part II"" does have some amusing moments that are worth mentioning though, including a beat-down at the hands of a strict Buddhist monk and a meditation scene where we see how Alan views himself and the other characters. We also learn an interesting fact about Mr. Chow during an elevator scene near the climactic showdown. In the grand scheme of things however, these segments still don't salvage the movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line, ""The Hangover Part II"" is a painfully contrived, raunchy, and predictable mess. If you're such a huge fan of the original ""Hangover"" movie that you HAVE to see this one, fine, but it's not worth multiple viewings."

","Watched this again for the second time since it came out to find out if it was as bad as I remember. It was.<br/><br/>Firstly, Bradley Cooper's character Phil is a total jerk here. He gets seriously aggravated because his ""friend"" doesn't want a bachelor party. His dialogue mostly consists of ""F__k!"" ""Holy F__k!"" and ""Oh, F__k!!"" Alan is border-line psychotic, as opposed to socially awkward in the first film, and Stu... well, doesn't have much to do except panic. (Why does Stu not pocket Teddy's finger to re-attach later? You know, they can do that sort of thing these days).<br/><br/>Which brings me to the conclusion: Stu arrives at his wedding with a face tattoo and his bride-to-be says nothing. NOTHING. (Nevermind he's had transvestite prostitute sex, cheating on his bride-to-be, as he notes).<br/><br/>And Teddy- the future surgeon/classical musician- shows up without a finger and his father shrugs it off, because Stu shouts at him (something about demons). Oh well, Teddy seemed to think losing his finger was a big laugh, so....<br/><br/>Lazy, stupid, unfunny, vile and mean-spirited cash-grab.<br/><br/>I haven't seen ""Freddy Got Fingered"" so there's a chance there's a worse movie out there.

","The problem with sequels â€“ even if they are dressed up to be referred as Part I and Part II â€“ is that sometimes you have to watch the first part to remind yourself just how hilarious the first instalment was. When finally you sit down to the second film, one thing that needs to be made absolutely clear is this, you will laughÂ…a lot. In fact you will more than likely laugh so much through the funny parts that you'll need to rewind a little to catch up with the funny bits you missed.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II is a very cleverly made comedy sequel that takes the four friends: Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug, to Thailand for what is to be a straight forward wedding that will see Stu being married â€“ again. Having invited Alan through a sympathy vote on account that his experience in Las Vegas had left the others in a non-talking mood when returning home, they all finally agree that everyone who went to Vegas could go to the wedding.<br/><br/>With the trip to Thailand going well, the get together ceremony of the Bride and Groom with friends and relatives does not go as well with Alan announcing a speech which hints at Las Vegas. It is now that Phil organises a little drink for the guys to have a big boy's moment down by the beachÂ… Filled with hilarity, zany and sometimes 'tongue in cheek' humour, The Hangover Part 2 is a definite Rent or Buy film, whether on DVD or Blu-Ray, the action, comedy and drama is by far one of the best American comedies so far this year. In a ""No Holds Barred"" style National Lampoon's extravaganza, everyone getting their hands on this will not be disappointed. By giving any more details of the film would truly spoil the rest for those that haven't had the luck to see the film yet.<br/><br/>For those who thought Mike Tyson's cameo in the first part was pretty funny, it is with a promise that we say ""You definitely haven't seen everything yet!"" The Hangover Part Two is available to Rent or Buy now.<br/><br/>DVD Archive Rating: 9/10 (10/10 if the soundtrack would have been better)"
"aphex72-224-27509","9","2","3","28 November 2011"," Your typical comedy but with a twist and a deep message!
","The 2011 hit comedy returns with the movie Hangover Part 2 directed by Todd Phillips. It received a lot of criticism for not meeting audience's expectations and being a rewrite of the original movie. Yet this movie surpassed all competition by becoming the number one rated R comedy movie (gross wise). Yes this movie has a lot of repetition but you have to look beyond that, you have to search for the message within the movie. A lot of the criticism received was because people felt as if the movie could've been better and more thought should've been put into it but the message is that this is a reflection of our society and the direction it is heading in. <br/><br/>The film elements used are evident throughout the whole movie. The clash of two cultures with Stu getting married to Lauren where you see east meets west. How the father doesn't approve of the marriage at first is something that we see all around us in modern society whether it be because of one's social status, their beliefs, or just because of where you come from. Especially in western cultures where it's harder to marry someone from there if you are American because of your culture and where you come from. Another issue raised is drug trafficking but that as we know happens all over the world. <br/><br/>What does this movie does that's so great is that it incorporates comedy with real life problems. Yes we see the typical stereotype with Laurens younger brother who is a genius and it's because he's Asian, and we all know that one person in school who doesn't even break a sweat and yet he's valedictorian. All of the messages in the film are universal and aren't just restricted to western culture its everyday problems around the world. Another message is when Stu comes to get married it's a difficult decision from him to go from the fun, free lifestyle with his friends to a more serious role as a husband in a family. Truly this is a problem many people can't adjust to the responsibility of being father or a husband and it's one of the many reasons why there is a decline in marriages and a rise in divorces. <br/><br/>Another film element and something that is relevant to our own experiences is what happens when you get drunk or when you have a hangover we know it can lead to many things but in the movie itself it leads to Stu ending up with a tattoo, they end having started a riot, meeting a former friend and drug lord etc. Of course the chances of these things happening are slim and this is why the movie is a comedy it truly shows us the risks of being high or drunk. How your actions can lead to having children you didn't plan on having or doing something like getting a tattoo that you may end up regretting for the rest of your life. This movie attempts to change some people's opinions on life most people are adapting to the modern age of technology but its addressed to those who believe we are not heading on this path and they are in denial. Overall this movie was entertaining and had a deep message that could be interpreted in many ways but in the end it shows us the road we are paving for ourselves and the future that is yet to come."

","I went into it expecting it to be bad because of all of the negative reviews out there (especially on this board), but I was laughing pretty much the entire time. This movie is definitely worth seeing. The overarching plot is almost the exact same as the first one but there are enough plot surprises in this one to keep you locked in and the movie is just plain hilarious pretty much the entire time. The setting (Thailand--or 'Thigh-land' as Alan pronounces it) was more interesting/entertaining than the first, and the lines were funnier on the whole and the movie was more over the top in general.

Even Mike Tyson is dragged back into this mess for no good reason other than to sing out-of-tune at a wedding (why is this funny?) There are a handful of mildly amusing moments, largely thanks to Ed Helms, but overall this is just a lazy and shameless sequel that does nothing but taint the original."

"TheMovieDiorama","5","1","1","1 June 2018"," The Hangover Part 2 is twice as mad, ""twice as funny"" and twice as uninspired.
","If there is one thing I never really understood, it's comedy sequels. Why? Because it's blatantly going to rehash its predecessor recalling the exact same jokes in a nearly identical formula. This sequel is no different, and its problem is the fact it's entirely noticeable. It's another bachelor party, this time for Stu's wedding, where they all drink again which results in a killer hangover consequently removing all memories from the previous night. Someone is missing, they must retrace their steps to find that person and blah blah blah just watch the first film. It is a symmetrical premise. The plot itself is identical right down to the narrowest of margins, making it pretty difficult to review. Everything I mentioned when reviewing the first film applies here also. Rapid pacing, inventive use of the flashback structure, memorable lines of dialogue, serviceable acting (except Helms...who I still dislike in this) and the inclusion of Mike Tyson...because why the heck not. This also includes the negatives that I highlighted including the lack of comedy, minimal character development and a narrative consisting of a random string of absurd events montaged together to create a motion picture. The only essence that has changed is the location, no longer are we in crazy Las Vegas, we have ventured across the globe to Bangkok. Honestly, it only serves as an environmental plot device to include the character Leslie Chow who seemed to be a fan favourite in the previous film. That's just lazy writing and comes across as mundane. What I will say, is that there is a scene involving kathoey strippers that cracked me up. I should've saw it coming, but I didn't so I'll give some credit. Aside from that, I didn't laugh once but this is to be expected. In the end, Part 2 is exactly the same as its predecessor. If you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this more exotic hangover. If you didn't, don't continue with this franchise...and most importantly don't drink. Alcohol is bad, children (it really isn't, I crave it...)."

","I'm a big fan of the first Hangover. It was hilariously raunchy, but this sequel is the epitome of laziness. Like most movies that are brilliant, they make sequels and somewhat tarnish the impact of the original. There is no passion, and the only purpose this movie serves is to cash in on the original's tremendous success. In many ways, it's the very same movie as the original, only it takes place in Bangkok. I didn't catch myself laughing. I did chuckle a couple times, but that's it. The trio of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis is as reliable as ever, but I don't understand the appeal of Ken Jeong. He is so obnoxious, and he's not even funny. Giving him as much screen time as they did was a huge mistake in my view. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I saw this over a year ago, and I don't remember much of it for a reason.

It's just all these crazy things and some male nudity thrown in.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: More of the same from the first film. It's OK if you want a movie with gross humor."
"toll-8","5","1","1","10 February 2012"," More like The Hangover I Part II
","Have you ever seen The Hangover? I will be really surprised if anyone is thinking no! If you have seen the first just take the entire story, remove it from Las Vegas, take it across the world, and drop it in Bangkok. Then start the story again and replace any pivotal moments from the first with a new animal, incapable human or disfigurement.<br/><br/>The second one is based around Stu's wedding. He is about to marry a gorgeous Thai woman (not a Thai bride and way too pretty for him), and is making Phil and Doug come with him to the wedding, especially since his father-in-law to be hates him. Initially Alan is uninvited but after much persuasion from Doug and Phil, Stu allows it. Once we are in Thailand each character begins to show their typical characterisations: Phil is the party animal, Stu is Mr. Sensible and Alan is stupid as can be. <br/><br/>Stu is adamant no bachelor party will take place but agrees to one quiet beer on the beach with Phil, Alan, Doug and his fiancÃ©e's little genius brother Teddy. Zoom forward twelve hours later and the original 'wolf pack' wake up in a shady hotel in Bangkok. From there we are back in the Las Vegas hotel room with Stu waking up with a tattoo (not missing a tooth) and a monkey in the bathroom (not a lion) and one of the group missing, Teddy (not Doug cause he's boring and stayed at the resort). From here we see the group trying to remember what happened the night before and trace back their tracks through the stuff in their pockets and find themselves at a police station, a hospital, a tattooist and a monastery. Does this all sound familiar? Well if it does when you think of the first one and piece together how they found Doug, you may know where Teddy is from the beginning. Honestly this film just takes the entire thread of the first film and changes a few details along the way. It takes away all element of surprise. <br/><br/>There are still some good laughs in this film. Many will be disappointed but many will still be laughing. The jokes in this one are a lot cruder and darker. It also shows well the dirty shady areas of a place like Bangkok compared to Las Vegas. The jokes though mainly come from Alan (Galifanakas) and mainly at the expense of Stu (Helms). Once again like the first one I found Phil (Cooper) nowhere near as funny as the others and seems to be the one that less funny stuff happens to. Alan's stupidity is really the driving force of the comedy and there are a few very funny bits including the whole scene of have 'a demon' in Stu. Probably the funniest part of it all. The problem with the Alan character though is that they seem to have made him even more stupid and over the top. They've done to Alan what the American Pie franchise done to Stifler. He just got more silly and it became worse rather than better.<br/><br/>The Hangover II is an easy watch, and you will probably be laughing at the anticipation of it as opposed to the comedy of it. We also get Chow (Ken Jeong), back from the first one. He appears much more in this one and at times is completely over the top and it can be a little cringe worthy. Even more cringe worthy though would be the cameo from Mike Tyson. Something that was completely unneeded. He can't act or sing for that matter. There is also a fatter Paul Giamatti. His talents are wasted here and he may watch this and see how bad he looks.<br/><br/>I have to say I am a little disappointed with this sequel but I was expecting that. If the writers had of taken it in a different direction it could have really worked, but by producing a carbon copy of the original they have ruined it. In parts it is funny and it is an easy watch so it won't be the worst film you have ever seen but it is not a patch on the original. You may as well give it a watch as it is a bit of fun but let's just hope, with The Hangover Part III in the pipeline, that they at least take us in a different direction and not just show Alan getting married in Amsterdam, with a snake instead of a monkey, Stu having had a nose job and Alan's Dad going missing.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","1","6 February 2012"," Not As Bad As Its Reputation But Still a Letdown
","The Hangover Part II (2011)<br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>While this sequel isn't nearly as bad as some of the reviews made it out to be, there's still no question that very little effort went into the film and what we've basically got is a rehash of the first film minus all the clever moments. This time out Stu (Ed Helms) is about to be married in Bangkok so of course Phil (Bradley Cooper), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) goes along with him and sure enough they wake up one morning not knowing what happened the night before. THE HANGOVER PART II has very little imagination and it's clear that they were just cashing in on the huge success of the first film. It's really a shame that the filmmakers didn't try to come up with something fresh and original, which was what the first movie was. Instead of them coming up with anything new we're basically treated to the exact same story with many of the same plot devices in full swing. I think the biggest problem with the movie is that there's simply nothing here to be excited about. The first movie gave us a great mystery, a great set-up and we're were having fun from start to finish. None of that is true this time out as the mystery just seems watered down and in many ways you don't care what happened the night before. Many of the raunchy jokes don't work because they seem to just be going for the lazy dirty moment. With that said, there are still some very funny moments scattered throughout but there's just not enough to make the film worth sitting through. The four leads are all in fine shape and they do what they can with the material. Of the four I'd say it's Galifianakis who once again stands out from the pack but then again there's no doubt that his character was given the majority of the good moments. Paul Giamatti and Nick Cassavetes both appear in fun cameos and Ken Jeong is back as well."
"theejamest","6","1","1","4 January 2012"," An echo of the first that lacks depth and originality.
","The second installment of The Hangover promised to be bigger, better and funnier then before and was highly anticipated. Yet it failed to deliver.<br/><br/>Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) embark on yet another adventure following the engagement of Stu. But things never go smoothly for these lads before the wedding as they wake up not knowing where they are and the brides younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee) being missing.<br/><br/>Of course it was wise of Todd Phillips not to lose the groom again -needless to say he had limited options- but the film, following the theme of the first, someone of course had to go missing after a wild night. Although, the film may seem to be continuing tradition from its predecessor, it tries so hard right from the beginning to be funny, something which the first did without much effort. Too hard in fact. Zach Galifianakis' character is evidently targeted by Phillips to be the one who provides most of the humour. The consequences of this however provides a lacklustre and second rate service that guarantees only but a few laughs. And while Bradley Cooper seemingly takes the role of leader of the 'wolfpack' his general input in the film is at a bare minimum.<br/><br/>While the first saw the development of the four characters joining together in friendship, this one seems to lack any depth within the development of characters and seems to sway towards focusing on Galifianakis' character which can at times be annoying.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film has a sense of appeal that will keep viewers watching throughout, but just lacks any real depth, originality or talk about moments to make this a memorable title. Though Leslie Chow (Kim Jeong)is a fun character and without him this would be a bit of a bore. I believe the film has an element of re-watch ability due to the wild and outrageous occurrences and I do not deny that the film can bring enjoyment to the audience.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while it provides an action packed ride with some unbelievable and imaginative scenes (dare I mention the drug dealing monkey?) the overall expectations that have entailed the first one have left this film feeling rushed and hollow in many ways without any true meaning other then being a shadow to its predecessor. I hope director Todd Phillips avoids making the same mistakes in this one, mistakes I believe are shown in the gross takings, severely less then the first one. Even though I point out many criticisms I still believe this film has an essence of enjoyability and I am sure I will at least watch this film one more time."

After making a ton of money a sequel had to be made. The only problem is that this type of movie doesn't lend itself to a sequel. So they did they only thing they could.

"proskyrme","Null","1","1","8 September 2011"," Disappointing
","The Hangover 2 The Hangover, a film which was released to the world in 2009 made everybody laugh for 102 minutes. The Hangover gave us a new and original comedy story which gripped the world and made over $277,000,000 as well as the careers of three maybe four mid-range actors. So the Hangover 2 had high expectations, people wandered if Alan would be the same idiot that we all loved or if Stu would go insane at the thought of anything out of the ordinary. What can be said about the second hangover is that it does not fail to bring the same laughs that we savoured from the first Hangover. The story takes the boys to Bangkok where they get in even more trouble than they do in Vegas. We expect this to mean a lot more laughter than last time, as that is what its all about, however we got the same jokes with a more in depth story line, which is not what we want from the Hangover. The return of Cho is the films saving grace, he plays a bigger role in this film which gives the group and extra dimension. You got to love Cho. It was good to see that Todd Phillips blessed us with the Hangover 2, it did however have so much to live up to and not a combination of the best comedy directors in the world could have pulled off a sequel better than the first, nice try though."

The first movie's tag line was ""Some men just can't handle Vegas."" So now is it supposed to be ""Some men just can't handle Bangkok?"" Ken Jeong was funny as usual. He's the only one who kept me entertained the whole time. As well as Bradley Cooper's good looks. As for Stu marrying the Chinese girl, I prefer Heather Graham.

Maybe it had to do with the Asian take over of the world's economy or the fact that Asians are better people in general- from martial arts to Zen philosophy.

"meeza","9","6","15","27 May 2011"," A good buzz! The unnecessary action sequences cause it not to be a great hangover!
","It happened again in ""The Hangover Part II"". I am referring to many of the ingenious comedic elements that made the first ""Hangover"" a real crowd pleaser- the magnetic rapport between its three main protagonists or better stated, those pack of wolves; the unpredictability of the narrative structure in the protagonists' ordeal trying to figure out the mania that occurred during their obliterated state; the scene-stealing comments from the eccentric Alan character; and of course ""those pictures"". Sure one could argue that it is more of the same from the original, but if it ain't broke don't fix it or forget it for that matter. ""The Hangover II"" takes place in Thailand a couple of years after the first Hangover mayhem occurred in Vegas. Dentist Stu (Ed Helms) is marrying his lovely young bride in Thailand; however, Stu wants to extract himself from anything close that resembles a ""bachelor party"" due to the toothless mania that happened to him in Vegas. Stu's best buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Doug (Justin Bartha) head east with their wives and kids for Stu's wedding. And even the offbeat Alan attends even though Stu is reluctant with the idea. Into the picture in this one is also Stu fiancÃ©e's teenage brother Teddy. And before you could say ""just-one-beer beach bonfire in a Thailand Resort causes Bangkok profound partying"", the madcap fiesta experience returns to the Wolfpack; and Teddy is also along for the ride. Doug does save himself from the forgettable partying by splitting from the bonfire early. I do not want to provide too many more shots on what happened in ""The Hangover II"" because it would then spoil your hangover experience. But let me just say that they don't call it ""bang kok"" for nothing. As in the original, this Hangover flick also gets some zany chow time from the flamboyant villain Mr. Chow, again masterfully played by Ken Jeong. I also loved the cameo work from the great Paul Giamatti. And yes, we do get another scene-stealing Tyson comedic punch in this one from the Champ! In fact, all the performances were as good in the sequel as in the original, but still the top thespian of the Wolfpack pack is Zach Galifianakis, who delivers another comedic brawny performance as the one & only Alan. Director Todd Phillips keeps the pace engaging as he did the first time around, but my only Phillips knock is that in a few scenes he tried to do the whole ""action-comedy"" thing in ""The Hangover Part II"" which made me want to barf, its called ""The Hangover Part II"" not ""Bad Boys II""; nevertheless, another solid directorial orchestration from Phillips. The screen writing team of Phillips and Craig Mazin & Scott Armstrong delivered a funny script outside the whole ""bang bang"" sequences. ""The Hangover Part II"" is a must-see even though you probably will not be as hung over from it as you were when you first had a taste of a cinematic ""Hangover"". **** Good"

"MovieDude1893","4","5","12","26 May 2011"," Has its moments, but lacks the chemistry of the original
","The anticipation surrounding the release of The Hangover Part Two has been palpable. Benefitting from the surprise blockbuster success of its predecessor and a recent legal kerfuffle, Part Two is poised as one of the year's biggest films. The midnight crowd was abuzz with excitement, they didn't just come to see the movie, they came to love the movie.<br/><br/>This is perhaps why I felt such disconnect while watching the film. I'm someone who enjoyed the original Hangover, yet I took issue with the sometimes detestable characters and their dirty deeds. It seemed that some of the events were structured as random, easy laughs as opposed to being the result of the film's comedic momentum. I laughed, I actually laughed quite frequently. Yet, I could not quite join the chorus of celebration.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there I was surrounded by people laughing themselves into a stupor. Couldn't they see what was happening? They were watching the same movie that they had quoted endlessly since 2009. This is a sequel that commits the cardinal sin of all sequels; it repeats the story of the original film.<br/><br/>This is the paragraph where I'd usually launch into some basic summary, but honestly, if you're interested enough in this movie to read this article, then you've seen the first film. If you seen the first film, congratulations! You know every basic plot point of The Hangover Part Two. Zack Galifinakis once again steals the film as the destructive man- child Alan. Like everything else in this film, Alan's boorishness is cranked up to eleven. I'd assume all this hullabaloo constitutes the filmmakers' attempts to disguise the completely derivative storyline. <br/><br/>In all fairness, I did laugh more during ""The Hangover Part Two"" than I would at an average raunch-fest. However, the chemistry too often feels stale, as if the cast is still exhausted from making the first film. Occasionally they manages to recapture the spark that made the original so popular. Yet, when viewed in context of its predecessor this Hangover is easy to shake."

But, after all, the movie is supposed to be a comedy, and it's really not. I watched it expecting crude humour, and I dig crude humour, when it's done well, except this time it isn't. The almost exclusive kind of joke in the film is the ""gross"" kind, the kind to send a group of fifteen-year-olds into a squealing fit. And hey, I get it, 'that's really gross, ha-ha', but the funniest non-PC and gross jokes are the photos during the ending credits. And then, why did I just watch the movie? There are two or three genuinely funny moments in the entire film. I watched this with my girlfriend, and honestly, we buy comedy. Probably our neighbours can hear us laughing at some shows. But this? A few smiles, now and then, that's it. One and a half boring hours. And no, I'm not offended by anything in the movie. Just bored.<br/><br/>So as far as recommendations go: If you like any kind of witty, revealing, dialogue driven, situational, reflective kind of comedy, go look elsewhere. If you like well-made crude humour, still look elsewhere. What you have here is a glossed-over waste of time."

","Like most people I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Hangover' because its a bloody hilarious film, so when I saw part 2 advertised, I was briefly excited at the prospect of more hilarity from the wolfpack. The excitement faded when the possibility 'they're going to ruin it' dawned on me. Spoiler alert: they did; without giving anything away, the plot and story structure are practically identical to part 1, and because of this you can see the punchlines a mile away, so when they happen they arn't funny. Also, because you've seen it all before, lot of the plot is pretty guessable, thus removing the element of surprise that made the first film work. The ending is also poor and anti-climatic. It got to the point that about halfway through I was so bored I almost considered walking out, something I have never contemplated doing before (and I went to see Oceans 12). Occasional comic relief from Zach Galifianakis was the only good thing to say about it. You're probably going to end up seeing it at some point anyway, so just make sure you're slightly drunk and don't watch it with family members"
"metalgtrist17","4","4","9","6 June 2011"," Awesome Sequel
","DO NOT BELIEVE THESE REVIEWS! This movie IS NOT a direct copy of the first movie. It IS NOT a throwaway sequel. You must understand that any filmmaker who puts out a trailer EXPLOITING a similar OR FIRST FILM is INTENDED!! <br/><br/>Now that this point is out of the way, let me explain. This movie knows that it is a sequel. The characters know that the first movie happened. That is why they find this new situation as unbelievable as it is. It is all apart of the plot, and it is an excellent one! I have read reviews on here that comment on the overt similarities and bash this movie for it. These people are superficial and DO NOT GET THE JOKE! It is so infuriating to see a great movie like this lose its credibility over close-mindedness. A lot of the reviews I have read point out how recycled the jokes are, how the brother-in-law is a stick, how Allen comes off as Sad rather than funny, and that the whole movie is a copy-pasted mess. This is all wrong. The jokes are so ingenious and well placed, Zach's acting is PHENOMENAL, the new character additions are flawless, and the whole movie is an astounding experience that deserves repeated views! <br/><br/>Why do people not get this movie?! This movie is worlds smarter than the first and sets the bar incredibly high for the final chapter.<br/><br/>IF YOU LOVED THE FIRST MOVIE, YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE! I in now way ever felt let down while watching this film. You cannot go into this thinking it will suck, because you will always carry that pouted expression through the film, ruining the experience. <br/><br/>Sit back, relax, throw some popcorn at your girl/boy/friend, and laugh. This movie was made for those who enjoy movies. SO ENJOY! And stop with the cynicism!"
"movieswithmitch","4","4","9","30 May 2011"," Don't see it again for the very first time
","Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.com<br/><br/>Don't see it again for the very first time...<br/><br/>Let me ask you a couple of questions. Did you like the original ""The Hangover""? Did you ever wonder what it would be like if you took that film and put a Bangkok, Thailand green screen over it? If you answered yes to both of these questions, well stranger, boy do I have a film for you. If you realized my second question was sarcastic than goooooood for yoooooooooou (it's hard to write sarcasm). <br/><br/>I answered yes to that first question but not so much to the second, and as I feared ""The Hangover Part ll"" is nothing more than an unimaginative carbon copy to Todd Phillip's wildly successful 2009 original. By no means is the original a masterpiece, but it was a lot of fun. That fun came from the films mystery element of being right there with the three bewildered men's night of debauchery and trying to figure where the story was going to take you next. This time around the notorious Wolf Pack's ride is raunchier and it's not that you won't laugh, and it's not that you won't cringe from time to time but all of that devious mystery is gone as beat by beat it's paint by numbers in this numbing sequel. <br/><br/>Wanter of the quiet life, Stu (Ed Helms), is getting married to a very nice Thai girl named Lauren (don't look for more female development than that- not one of Todd Phillips strong suits). Making their trip to Thailand for the wedding is the morally challenged Phil (Bradley Cooper), the perpetual bi@%# of the group Doug (Justin Bartha) who's 15 minutes on screen is used for nothing more than to tell us the other guys have done wrong, and the reluctantly invited, socially handicapped Alan (Zach Galifianakis). After almost a shot for shot recreation of the celebration toast, things once again go very awry, as they wake up in a gritty and dirty Bangkok hotel with no recollection of how they got there. Only this time they lost Lauren's 17-year old brother Teddy played by Mason Lee (director Ang Lee's son) with only one of his severed fingers remaining in the room. <br/><br/>Todd Phillip's and crew try to push the envelope as much as they can, which includes Stu and a Thai prostitute. Oh wait, didn't Stu have an encounter with a Vegas prostitute played by Heather Graham in the first film- SO LAZY! Phillip's might see all these recurrences as a love letter to the first film, but to me it appears as much more of a love letter to making money. These are talented actors who have an excellent rapport together. Galifinakas has the funny one-liners for the most part and Ken Jeong makes a hilarious return as Mr. Chow the Chinese gangster. <br/><br/>Phillip is on record saying that he imagines the series ending as a trilogy, let's just hope for the finale he can change things up more than just the location. Lets just hope for the finale he can change things up more than just the location. (get it)<br/><br/>(get ""this"")<br/><br/>Ephesians 5:18"

","The wolf-pack is back! Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ken Jeong, Justin Bartha, Jamie Chung, and Mike Tyson star in The Hangover Part II, the comedy of 2011. I thought the movie was great, better than the first. Just don't let your kids see the movie because there is A LOT of strong sexual content and graphic nudity, and also coarse language. There is a scene in which a main character finds out that he ""spent the night"" with a transgender person (we see this HAPPEN in photos in the end of the film, yuck). The hilarious character, Mr. Chow has the sailor mouth in this movie. He curses and swears a lot so watch out for that, too. There is also a lot of references to cocaine and a man also snorts it and passes out. There is even some images of a man cutting his finger off (bloody). Just see it for yourself."

","The Hangover is definitely my second favorite movie right after Horrible Bosses, but let me tell you something, this is probably my third favorite movie. Everyone knows or did know that this movie cood not be better than the first, The Hangover is not a kind of idea that has a sequel, but what cooed you expect, this movie was so hilarious as the first, so entertaining as the first and it had a great cast like the first did, but this one was filmed in Bangcock, that was only one of the differences, but I just loved it, I mean, this review can't tell you how much I liked this movie. I laughed several times and for a long time, I was very entertained and I was taken to the world of the Wolpack trying to understand what happened last night.<br/><br/>This movie had a great cast like the first did, the cast includes Bradley Cooper which was hilarious in the first movie and in this one again, Bradley Cooper is known from the first movie, The Hangover, Weddinng Crashers, Yes Man and Limitless, Ed Helms which was the second most hilarious guy in this movie right after Zach, Ed Helms is know from the first movie, The Hangover, the TV show, The Office and Cedar Rapids,Zach Galifianakis who completes a big part of the ""awesomeness"" of the movie, he's just hilarious in it and says a joke every time we seem him in a scene, Zach Galififankis is know from the first movie, The Hangover, What Happens in Vegas, G-Force, Due Date, It's Kind of a Funny Story, Puss in Boots and Dinner for Schmucks, Ken Jeong, who has a weird but still funny role in this movie, which was also in the first movie, he is known from the first movie, The Hangover, Role Models, All About Steve, Couples Retreat, Knocked Up and The Goods, and the cast also includes Mike Tyson again and contains a surprise, Paul Giamatti is in it, even though with not a long screen time.<br/><br/>Stu (Helms) is about to get married to Lauren (Jamie Chung). Stu is still trying to forget Doug's bachelor party. He is planing to only make a bachelor bring, even though his friends don't want to. Phil (Cooper), Stu, Alan (Galifianakis), Doug (Bartha) and Lauren's brother Teddy are all going to Thailand (or Thigh Land as Alan likes to call it) to Stu's wedding. After all of them drinking a sealed beer, what cooed possibly go wrong... Phil, Stu and Alan wake up in a hotel room in Bangcock and it's all mysteriously happening again, Stu has a tattoo all over his face, Alan is bald, Chow (Jeong) joins them again, there's a monkey in the room and Lauren's brother Teddy is missing. The Wolfpack can easily get to the wedding, but they were trapped by a second big hangover, they will not have that much hours and they will have to remind everything with every single clue they can get and they will have to find Teddy to get to the wedding and everything stays okay.<br/><br/>The story is a bit similar to the first movie, and I can honestly say it is, but it's just hilarious, if you love a movie, and you think it's just perfect, what's wrong with making a similar sequel of it, right? Sow, this movie has drunken monks, a hilarious thing that turned out to happen to Stu last night, which was very bad, a drug dealer monkey and much other things.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie will entertain you, it will make you laugh a lot, and basically during the whole movie, you will constantly be thinking about the similar things with the first movie, like the same kind of soundtrack, the same development, a hilarious speech again, another Stu's song and much other things, but I honestly don't care about that, this movie was similar to the first, you laughed right, you were entertained right, then why shooed you call it bad? I totally recommend this movie and I honestly say that this is my third favorite movie, if you didn't like the first movie (wich only happened to a few people, for sure) you won't like this movie, sow, this movie cood not be better than the first anyway, but it's not close to be, not close it all. 100% recommended.

","Wow. I knew the premise was the same as the first film, but I didn't know that the entire thing was going to be the same. From the setup to the structure to even some of the most minor details, almost every single thing about this was just the exact same as the first. I'm having a very hard time thinking of a more lazily written film. The first one was a lot of fun the first time (decreased significantly after the first viewing, but still) and so this one wasn't a hard watch by any means, but the entire time it was just so obvious that they thought they could turn in the same thing and get the same kind of explosive results. Unbelievably lazy, really embarrassing stuff."

","This movie followed the exact same plot as movie 1. The only difference is this time it takes place in Thailand and not Vegas and they lose a different friend.

I laughed maybe 3 times the whole movie. The Asian guy is even more annoying in this movie than the first. He, to me, is a horrible actor and not funny at all. Just annoying.

"mad_mandonna","4","3","6","9 June 2011"," Not so funny the second time around
","I loved the Hangover. The first film made me literally cry with laughter, what made it so funny was the element of surprise. Around every turn something you wouldn't expect happened. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy part 2, but I the laughs were so blatantly obvious. Part 2 isn't so much second instalment so much as a remake of the first one. It is quite literally a carbon copy of the first one, The events that take in The hangover come in the exact same order. I am a firm believer in if it ain't broke don't fix it, but such similarity with the first one cannot be overlooked. <br/><br/>Even making the film based around a wedding I think was a mistake, they could have made they're literal hangovers from a night out anywhere for any reason. And the film didn't have to involve looking for a missing person again. This film suffers from sex and the city syndrome where the first one had way more laughs and felt more coherent, the second follows a similar format and falls flat. Though the negative reviews for the Hangover haven't put off potential cinema goers as Sex and the City 2's did.<br/><br/>The film doesn't entirely sink though. It maintains an energy through out and and still has some pretty funny gags. It's not a joyless ride by any stretch, just one that feels overly familiar. Hopefully the writers will get some spark for Part 3 and make a much funnier movie."
"wikipediacabal","4","3","6","8 June 2011"," Lazy sequels like this are destroying the theatrical market
","The original was great. I was glad I saw it. But when I read the reviews, I could see that this would not be anything close. So rather than hand over my $13 this time, I downloaded a camcorder version.<br/><br/>It is appalling: more like a faithful remake than a sequel. Beyond the same broad structure, we have the same same character accidentally drugging the same other characters, causing an amnesia hazed time shift at the same moment in the story, the same character beating up the same other characters after being similarly imprisoned, the same kidnapped character being subject to mistaken identity, the same character having sex with a near identical replacement character, and even the same type of funny a Capella song being sung at the same moment, to give us the same little pause and mood shift. Then a near-identical resolution to the central problem. How goddamn lazy can one screenwriter be? Why did these talented actors all sign on for this crap? Was it a requirement in order to get them the parts in the first movie? <br/><br/>And yet, it worked out great for the studio in the short term. Just 12 days after the release it is the US #10 grossing R rated film of all time in non-adjusted dollars. Word of mouth must be awful since the second weekend gross was down 65% from the first, but that's not a problem for the producers. The film has made its money and it will go on to make lots more on DVD. <br/><br/>But audiences will not be satisfied with the DVD any more than they were with the theatrical release. They will part with their money and feel ripped off when they realize how predictable the jokes are. Hollywood is poisoning the well with its never ending parade of cash-in sequels that are all about a big opening weekend.<br/><br/>This kind of crap is why theater attendance numbers are shrinking even though ticket price hikes keep grosses afloat."

I wanted it to end about 10 minutes after it started but couldn't leave because I was at the far end of the cinema and didn't want to walk out in front of everybody (because that's rude).<br/><br/>Same storyline as before, only this time thing's go down in Bangkok. Weird how Todd Phillips pretty much 'copy and pasted' everything over yet the film is nothing compared to the original. Pacing was bad and the jokes were worse. Easy gags aimed at 15 year olds who go to the cinema in groups and annoy everybody by doing that social laughing thing whereby they want everybody to know they get the joke.<br/><br/>Little Fockers & Hangover Part 2.

"Zippie1","3","3","6","5 June 2011"," Typical summer bromance chic-flick
","It seems to be the easiest formula for Hollywood to rake in the bucks: take a chic-flick theme, like getting married, add at least one hunk and his friends, put them in a chaotic situation with events unfolding that the viewer has little direct experience with adding up to a series of ""rushes"" spicing up what is ultimately very predictable. Yes, there are some laughs, and to be sure, many people ""laugh out loud"" at a theater because they are with friends, so it is still somewhat enjoyable. However, I was surprised, given all the reviews on TV, even morning family-oriented programs that promoted this flick, that NO ONE ever mentioned the many scenes of nude hermaphrodites, the most penises I have seen in a movie that was not clearly labeled porn, the many still pics showing naked women and one of the men staring at a stripper's spread legs, their heads positioned between, many many scenes of snorting coke depicted as as innocent as beer pong, a whole montage of real children drinking, doing drugs, and fighting as adults, using a monkey in gratuitous ways such as having it smoke, putting a water bottle under a monk's robe and having the monkey simulate oral sex with him.. and what really really gets old is the number of f-bombs, more than South Park:The Movie! Without a doubt, the most obscene dialog I have heard in a theater perhaps ever, coupled with obscene soundtrack--literally gave me a headache feeling verbally assaulted non-stop. I am not a prude by any means but this movie used any lazy means to shock and disturb and get a knee-jerk reaction. In the end, the movie sells us the message ""boys will be boys"" taken to a whole new level, even getting so high you can cut off your own finger and not miss it. I want my money and MY TIME back.."

It got almost uncomfortable waiting for the movie to hit us as funny. There are plenty of wild and outrageous situations, but real laughs are very few and far between. As we walked out of the theater, I said, ""It all worked the first time...what happened the second time around?"" The comic energy, that made the movie work the first time wasn't there. As my son said, the writers concentrated Too Hard on making it outrageous, and MISSED OUT ON MAKING IT FUNNY. <br/><br/>It is not the actors' fault, they delivered what was in the script.

There was nothing new about The Hangover II and it followed exactly the path of part I. It was all too predictable. Not exciting at all. Before word of mouth start going around a lot of people(like me) will have seen the movie because part I was good thinking(and having been let down a lot of times) that part II would be good if it was half as good as part I but it isn't.

"Meven_Stoffat","4","3","6","30 May 2011"," Hungover from the Hangover
","This month, two hotly anticipated sequels were released- Pirates 4 and Hangover 2. For me, this should have been an awesome movie month. Well, OK, Bridesmaids and Thor were awesome movies- however the thing is, these aren't sequels, they're original concepts (OK, well not really original- I'm talking original as in ""The start of something"").<br/><br/>OK, now Pirates wasn't a bad movie, it had its share of entertaining scenes, but felt undercooked for the most part, and sadly, Hangover 2 suffers from exactly the same problem... except Pirates 4 was unfortunately much better.<br/><br/>Now, I LOVED The Hangover. I remember when it came out back in 2009 and I loved it so much, I saw it twice. Every viewing was just as entertaining as the first. When I heard a Hangover 2 was being made, I was excited. I figured the first movie was good enough to have a solid sequel, and Todd Phillips knew what he was doing was good. So I patiently anticipated this movie, and when it got released, I was one of the first people in line.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is no sequel. It is essentially a remake of the first movie. Why is that a problem? Because the first movie was way funnier.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially exatly the same... except this time it's set in Thailand. This time, Stu is getting married to a beautiful Thai woman, and Allan is not invited- he has even been rendered Catatonic for that reason. Yet after a bit of convincing, Allan is suddenly invited along, and alredy having problems with the chosen best man- Teddy, Stu's wife-to-be's brother. After a rather disconcerting celebratory dinner at the resort, the gang, with teddy, go down to the resort's beach and have a few drinks... and then the first movie happens... again.<br/><br/>I'm sure I don't need to tell you the rest, because I'm assuming you have seen the first movie already, and if you have, you've seen this movie too. <br/><br/>The problem with Hangover 2 is that it's just plain not original AT ALL. While it did have a few belly laughs, in particular a scene involving Stu discovering he had sex with a transvestite stripper, they felt forced, and I had felt like I saw it already two years ago. Plenty of people I know, my girlfriend and manager at work included, asked ""Why didn't you like it? It's exactly the same as the first."" The latter sentence is exactly why I was disappointed- I felt that with this being a sequel, they could have introduced something new. Sadly this wasn't the case- everything came from the first movie, and by the end of the movie, I just wanted it to be over. Because I saw it two years ago already, but much funnier. In my opinion, only one movie got away with being a carbon copy of its predecessor- Escape from LA.<br/><br/>That being said, maybe if you haven't seen the first movie, you will love this. But if you have, well, hoo boy, prepare yourself for a mega disappointment. They practically REMADE the first movie, all the way down to Stu singing a song about the crap they're in and then some. If you must see it, rent it on blu-ray- it is not worth the $15.75 UltraAVX price I paid to see it. <br/><br/>OVERALL: 4/10<br/><br/>PROS: -Some great laughs -The cast is great -They did the ""Photo during the end credits"" thing again<br/><br/>CONS: -A remake, not a sequel -Way too familiar -Familiarity even drives the film to the maddening point of predictability -None of the jokes seem natural at all- forced at best, really."
"borninbeds1981","5","3","6","30 May 2011"," good effort, but same stuff...different setting.!?!
","Well where to start, I just saw 'The hangover part 2', which I have been looking forward to since I first heard it was being made(which was a no brainer considering the success of the first). So I went into this expecting a lot I guess, as the first blew me away with laughs and a certain level of originality. But that was the completely wrong way to go into this film!. I mean to put it bluntly, Its very much ""worked in the first, will work in the 2nd"", even though some aspects of this idea from the director/co-writer Todd Philips works, you just don't have that wow factor as in the first!. So even though there is a lot of the same in this, you still laugh due to the brilliant chemistry these characters have together, and how they deal with each crazy, ridiculously (funny at times) situation they fall into. For me its Zach Galifanakis who makes it work, His silly out-of-this-world one liners and comments about whats happening, and his reaction to each situation our boys find themselves in. I know most people think he is like marmit.....but if you get this kind of humour, it works!. As for the other two leads,its the same effort as the first film,but still works and keeps the film afloat, just a shame the rest of the film with the same efforts does'nt. As the credits roll...its the same set up....Guys have few drinks...Guys wake up with serious hangover....guys find they have lost someone in their group(this time Teddy, Stu's partner's little brother).......guys try to remember what happened by back tracking the events of the messy night which there cant remember.....even the ending is more or less what happened in the first. But besides all this, it still has that tinkle most comedies lack these days, you really like the character's. And it does have a few shocks-laughs that you will either make you want to be sick or turn away! 'There's a reason they call it Bankok sweetheart'.<br/><br/>Its worth watching if you loved the first, just try to really not expect better, at times it really shines, its just a shame those times are like a giant slice of deja vu ."

","Dude, where's Teddy?...Um, yeah....Most of the movie is basically the same premise(as Dude where's my car)..find Teddy. It wasn't entirely bad, but it was not good either. It was not a comedy so much as it was a mystery, with some action, sprinkled with a hint of comedy. It was not very original and somewhat stereotypical, and by that I mean it reinforces stereotypes/clichés, not so much in a directly derogatory or negative way, just a very boring normal way. Overall a boring movie, an unfunny movie with a few funny moments, but ultimately fails to deliver anything of substance. The hangover 2 is not as good as the first, I'll admit I didn't 'love' the first, but I did enjoy it, this one not so much, watch it if you have the chance, watch it for yourself and make your own opinion; to each their own."

","I admit that I kinda might had too high expectations for this one. The first movie was absolutely hilarious -you don't know what to expect when the guys start solve the problem. ""What did we do last night?"" ""Where's one of us?"" Well, to sum it up; in first movie they have a party night. They wake up next morning and one of the guys is missing. They start by looking for the clues one by one. There's a Chinese guy. There's a fatal mix-up when they try to find their lost mate.<br/><br/>Hangover Part II? Well. They have a party. They wake up. One guy is missing. They start looking for him. Oh, a Chinese guy. A mix-up just when they thought they'd found the lost guy. ...Wait, wasn't that the first movie?! So if you don't mention Bangkok or the monkey, it's all pretty much the same.<br/><br/>Didn't pay the movie ticket myself, so I didn't lose anything by seeing this.

","Let's just get this out of the way, we all love the first film, so it's only natural that we'd want (and expect) the second installment to be just as, if not more, funny than the first. It seems to me that Todd Phillips thought the same way which is why he and his team apparently tried SO hard to out due themselves with ""The Hangover: Part II.""<br/><br/>Pros: The characters we know and love are back and sure haven't changed a bit. Fans of the first will get a kick out of all the homages to the first. Part II manages to roll out some hilarious scenes (mostly thanks to Mr. Galifianakis). The actors all seem to be having a great time portraying their respective characters and because of this the chemistry between all of them has come a long way since the first. More Chow, lots more.<br/><br/>Cons: Basically, it's the same as the first film in almost every way, except it's much more violent (in a dark, not necessarily always funny sense) and tries to rely on its predecessor for many of the laughs to be delivered. Almost all of the cameos were not worth the hype (Nick Cassavetes, Jeffrey Tambor, even Mike Tyson again). Although I'm a huge fan of Paul Giamatti so I enjoyed his presence in the film. The realization were Teddy is isn't nearly as intricate or exciting as the three figuring out were Doug was in the first. Poor Justin Bartha (Doug) was hardly in the film. Some suspension of disbelief has to be there to not question some of the plot turns (Teddy and his family not reacting more seriously to him missing and LOSING HIS FINGER. Stu's wife's father suddenly giving him his blessing for the wedding even after everything that happened, etc)<br/><br/>All in all the film was quite funny, though obviously not nearly as funny as the first but is still definitely worth the watch, especially if you're a fan of the first which I'd assume you are if you're reading this review. <br/><br/>Go see it, but don't expect the same roller coaster ride as the first.<br/><br/>I just pray to God they don't make a Part III."
"chatterjee_sun","6","3","6","27 May 2011"," Pornish comedy with average story line.
","The sequel has more crazy and shocking scenes, very gross and crass in parts but to be fair it does make you laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The problem however is that the director has relied more on shock value than actual content. The story is predictable and very less imaginative. <br/><br/>The movie tries really hard to cash the success of part one. In doing so it looses the freshness of a new plot. <br/><br/>The acting however has been good, specially the usual suspects Phil, Stu and Alan. The highpoint of the movie has been as usual the wacky- man Alan (Zach Galifianacis). This time however he is in a darker shade and less likable than before. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is no where near the smart comedy of Hangover I. This one is just a pornish comedy with average story. Having said that it is still a good watch for H 1 fans."

","I didn't have high expectations to this movie. I loved the first one, and i wasn't sure that they could pull it off again. I saw it at midnight, and i was kinda nervous cause i really wanted it to be good. And it was. It was absolutely hysterical, i have never laughed so much at the theater. I like it much more than the first one and i cant wait to see it again. Allan (Zach G.) also had a bigger part in this movie than the first, and that was great. He is so funny its amazing, i freaking love him!! Also the credits were hilarious. I don't get why so many people didn't like it, i have no idea. But i liked it, and i am so happy!

","In ""The Hangover Part II"" Stu (Ed Helms) with freshly emblazoned Mike Tyson facial tattoo, has an epiphany, ""Oh my G**! We kidnapped a monk!"" ""The Hangover Part II"" is awesome. The movie is hysterical. Director and Writer Todd Phillips perhaps made the movie he intended to make with ""The Hangover"". Now instead of Las Vegas, the Wolf Pack find themselves in Bangkok, Thailand, where there are no comedic restraints. Scary thought. Phillips with writers Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong brilliantly blur lines of taste with unnerving sense of humor. I read several reviews panning ""The Hangover 2"" as a glossy clone, more than a sequel. Where the characters and story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore were novel and clever, this one is formulaic, but punctures the envelope and is wildly funny. This is an authentic sequel in that a lot of the humor derives from the original.<br/><br/>A lot is familiar. Instead of the baby and the tiger, we have the Zen Buddhist Monk, who has taken a vow of silence, and the drug dealing monkey that smokes. Stu (Helms) again falls for the stripper, this time beautiful Kimmy (stunning Yasmin Lee). However, about 2 minutes into the scene with Stu and Kimmy, as Stu attempts to reassemble his missing day, we get the ominous hysterical punch line. Phillips's genius is leading us down the familiar path, and then propels us beyond: where no one has gone before. Ken Jeong reprises as Mr. Chow--this time as part of the Wolf Pack. Before the collective brain freeze, Allan (goofy Zach Galifianakis) received a text from Chow, ""Let's party bitches."" Jeong could never top his naked crow bar moment, but he comes close and is hilarious. Yes, Mike Tyson is back, and actually surprises.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, as ""The Hangover Part II"" opens frazzled Bradley Cooper as leader Phil, calls Tracy (gorgeous and intense Sasha Barrese), Doug's (Justin Bartha) wife. Phil confesses again, ""We really f***ed up this time"" The crew was at an exclusive resort in Thailand, I'm thinking Phuket, for Stu's wedding. 2 years have passed, and Stu has found the love of his life in Lauren (beautiful and smart Jamie Chung). Phil, Stu, and Allan wake up in some seedy hotel in Bangkok. Stu has the Mike Tyson tattoo on the side of his face. Allan's head is shaved. There is monkey wearing a denim jacket. Lauren's brother Teddy (easy going Mason Lee) is missing. There is a detached finger with a Stanford ring—apparently Teddy's.<br/><br/>The last thing the dudes remember was having a beer around the campfire bachelor party at the resort beach. Of course Allan vehemently claims ignorance. Making matters worse: Lauren's father Fohn (solid unforgiving Nirut Sirchanya) hates Stu with a passion. At the wedding rehearsal dinner he compares Stu to bland Thai rice porridge. Also protégé Teddy, Stanford premed at 16 years old, is the light of his life. Stu may never recover. With straight man Doug (Bartha) back at the resort, The Wolf Pack gradually reconstruct the day and search for Teddy. All looks lost. They must contend with mysterious businessman Kingsley (manic and funny Paul Giamatti) this time around. High jinks accelerate with Russian mobsters, Buddhist monastery, and raunchy strip clubs.<br/><br/>The upside and downside of ""The Hangover Part II"" is familiarity. Mostly upside. Granted it is predictable in the endgame. The rest is wicked chaotic genius. It is all about the fuzzy journey. Bradley Cooper is the strong lead. He is movie star handsome and the anchor in this raucous comedy. As the great comic reactor, he makes ""2"" work again. He is not asked to be funny; he is charmingly fun. Ed Helms is brilliant as the butt of the jokes, and he does this with natural grace. Zach Galifianakis returns annoyingly as dysfunctional Allan. We can never tell whether Allan is an idiot savant or just an idiot. Galifianakis is unwavering in Allan's self awareness void. However, he gives Allan a good heart, albeit misguided. Ultimately, brotherhood and friendship underlies and comes full circle in ""The Hangover 2"", much like ""The Hangover"". So despite the guys getting the crap beat out of them by a staff wielding monk; we pull for them, because they pull for each other.<br/><br/>""The Hangover Part 2"" is a great looking movie as well. The opening shots of the mountainous islands in the seas around Thailand are breathtaking. The resort and beaches are beautiful. This is also offset by the dichotomy of Bangkok. We see the clustered streets of the clubs and vendors balances against the stunning skyline view of a luxury hotel tower. My bud Robert, visual effects supervisor, seamlessly made the monkey smoke cigarettes, among numerous other effects.<br/><br/>""The Hangover Part II"" is the funniest movie of the year. You know the drill: Stay through the end credits. Can't figure out how Phillips makes a sequel, given that Allan is the only one not married. I'm sure they figure this out. And look forward to seeing that one as well—the upside of familiarity."
"blackdoug","Null","15","54","25 May 2011"," The Hangover 2 is a lifeless and empty comedic experience.
","Not as bad as Caddyshack 2 as some are claiming but probably because The Hangover was no classic like Caddyshack. So, it has less farther to fall. The Hangover 2 is a below average follow up to an above average comedy. I really didn't share the over-the-top love for the first film even though I did enjoy it very much. The same can't be said for this go around. This particular incarnation isn't all that witty, sexy or even gross enough to distinguish itself from any number of similar comedy efforts. I hope fans of the first haven't set their expectations too high because this thing really isn't that funny. Releasing it in the summer means it will fade from memory FAST as other more entertaining films are released in this jam packed season.<br/><br/>Bromances may have been all the rage a few years ago but I think most of us are sick of films like this one at this point. The writing is full of lazy clichés and the lowbrow alleged laughs on display are completely dumb and almost never funny. I couldn't decide who was more irritating Zach's character, Bradley and his arrogant one-liners or the thought that the writers of this trash actually got a huge paycheck to draft this nonsense. The Hangover 2 is a lifeless and empty comedic experience.<br/><br/>Instead of a sequel to a funny film all they've given us an insanely unfunny and unlikable film. Way to cash in but phone in a sequel."

","The Wolfpack is back with a vengeance! The Hangover Part II may be better than the original. It has more action, more Chow, and more hilarious Alan moments.

It's been two years since that weekend in Vegas, and it's time for Stu's Wedding. The Wedding is in Thailand, and the gang is forced to bring Alan along. After having a beer with Teddy (the younger brother of Stu's fiancée,) they wake up in Bangkok with no memory of the previous night. Alan has a shaved head, and Stu has Mike Tyson's tattoo.

"StevePulaski","5","4","10","28 May 2011"," Same same
","I can remember the last time I saw a sequel to a movie, I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel that was the exact same scheme and practically a remake of its predecessor. Literally, nothing changes, there is hardly a mention that the three leads have been through this exact same thing. They don't even seem to worry about the teenager they lost losing a finger. Everything is the same.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips seem to think ""hey, they liked the first one, let's keep it the same and make it a different location."" I really must say the first Hangover film I was a big fan of. I thought it was smart, funny, and very heartfelt in places. Rarely do we see leads that are as funny as mystified as the audience. I liked that. Sadly, Phillips doesn't want to experiment and place these characters in different surroundings with them in different events, he literally seems to have taken the first script and moved it over to Bangkok. A sign of unoriginality, uncertainty, and above all, laziness.<br/><br/>The plot, if I should bother to explain it, is the Wolfpack going to Bangkok to celebrate Stu's wedding. The night before the wedding, the wife thinks of a brilliant idea that the guys go out for one drink, and take her sixteen year old brother with her. I find it funny the thought of what could possibly happen to these three the night before a big wedding didn't even cross this woman's head. Not to mention putting them in charge of an adolescent.<br/><br/>No big though, they go out, have a drink by the bon-fire, next thing you know they blackout and wake up in some rundown slum of an apartment in Bangkok. The adventure re-begins. We get the same jokes, the same antics, and the same characters giving their same performances.<br/><br/>We have Phil, the calmest of the group, Stu the wimp, and Alan the idiot. The only two that manage to squeeze laughs are Mr. Chow (Jeong) and Alan. Chow's outrageous attitude and Alan's simple minded, softee persona both bring out the best The Hangover Part II has to offer.<br/><br/>Most of the shots of Bangkok are the scummy and grungy parts of the city and most of which turn people off to a place like that. When in fact, Thailand is very exquisite in parts. Obviously, the filmmakers wanted to capture the blacker sides of town to show what kind of neighborhood the boys were looking through. Still, I think the goal was to turn off viewers from Bangkok.<br/><br/>Some of the events in this film are disgusting, but certainly fitting. The strip club scene is very dirty, but very funny making even the dirtiest parts of The Hangover Part II, appealing. The scene that was probably the most offensive was the photo during the end credits that parodies one of the most famous photos of the Vietnam War that was taken in the Ho Chi Minh city. Most people probably won't get it, and while you think it was uncalled for, it's something you just really need to let go and forget. It isn't worth it.<br/><br/>With so many watered down comedy films like Fired Up and even with R rated comedies that are questionable for that, The Hangover Part II stands out as a film takes its R rating and utilizes it to the rating's full capabilities. While there are many laughs, what it all boils down to is it is just a raunchier and not as fun sequel that takes everything that made the first film so enjoyable and suspenseful and just does it again. This time, we know every twist and turn and nothing is a surprise.<br/><br/>Starring: Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha. Directed by: Todd Phillips."

Quite different from the glamour and penthouse suite of Vegas, they are in the gritty hard streets of Bangkok. Phil, Stu and Alan are on the run from gangs and drug lords in the search for Teddy (Stu's Brides little brother). With the expected hilarious antics of strip clubs, obtaining extra baggage, and plenty of beatings along the way. Will Stu, Phil and Alan be able to find Teddy, or will Bangkok take him first?

"upmet","1","3","7","25 October 2011"," Awful movies
","This movie has just nothing special to it... No highlights at all. For example take the characters: they are extremely pale type of people. Consequently you don't get warm with any of them and you simply don't care about them. In fact they are very unlikeable. Every single one of them. But this is not the one reason I don't like the movie. I also don't like Adam Sandler, but some movies of him are actually pretty good and fun. Talking about fun - in Hangover there are almost no funny scenes. You must force yourself to chuckle once in a while. Many scenes are provided by ""Captain Obvious"" and will easily be foreseen. The whole storyline is also completely nonsense, as was the first one - but not in a funny way, instead in a very boring and far-fetched way. After 10 minutes I thought ""Come on... bring it on""... and somewhere halfway through the movie it gets unbearable. If you think the first Hangover was better - it wasn't. It was all the same pale 08/15 story and content. I don't understand the hype and high ratings about the ""Hangover"" movies. They are both just blunt and pale in all matters.<br/><br/>A word to the ending: the movie shows the guy who marries in the end as a man who evolved into something like ""Mr. Cool"" and who has learned to ""man-up"". Again - it didn't work and wasn't convincing at all. As was nothing in the whole movie. Skip ""The Hangovers"" if you can and never look back."

I can't answer these questions, hopefully the director and writer should, also they should apologise at the same time for this total rip off. There was so much potential for the sequel but they totally messed it up. They go for a stag night out, get drugged, lose a friend and just make it to the wedding in time....yeah, exactly the first as the first....to make matters worse is why is Stu with somebody other than his ""wife"" from the first film? straight away I knew they got it wrong, then the film ended with Mike Tyson singing.....ughh......what an embarrassment.

","Hangover Part II is just as hilarious as part one but in even more crazy city and setting - Bangkok! The cultural nuances of Bangkok, crazy streets & overcrowding add several more degrees of humor, suspense and drama to this comedy. Not surprisingly, the performances of Bradley, Ed and Zach are just as powerful as part one. Unlike many sequels, this one leaves you guessing about how each problem / mess up will solved, and doesn't get boring or predictable at any point during the movie. This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in many years and definitely the funniest one so far in 2011. Well done and I still keep wondering if there will be another one. With the creative geniuses working behind the scenes and these exemplary comedy actors, there is still room for another one that could keep the audiences rolling on the floor with laughter."
"steve_koenig","1","3","7","27 June 2011"," One of the worst movies I've seen in years
","Full disclosure: I walked out of the movie before it was over. I just couldn't take it. I can tolerate, and sometimes laugh loudly, at black humor, gross humor, ridiculous situations. Even some things that might seem cruel if they are done in a certain way (e.g., some Monty Python skits, and films like ""Dr. Strangelove""). But this was one of the most offensive movies I've ever seen. I got upset thinking that I'd paid to see it, was perplexed at the laughs of others in the theater audience (mainly junior high and high school-age kids; this was in Brazil and age restrictions weren't enforced), and then finally decided life was too short.<br/><br/>There are certainly many movies were someone being rude and obnoxious, even in a mean-spirited way, is supposed to be funny. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't . No big deal. But this film was an unrelenting series of gags based on people being obnoxious and/or stupid. Non-stop. The character Alan, and Stu's father-in-law-to-be, are both so dumb and offensive that I really could not see anyone wanting to be with either one. Stu's character struck me as the most realistic (as in people I've met), but finally he becomes as big an idiot as everyone else (until the predictable ending—which I read about).<br/><br/>Writer/director Todd Phillips throws in some very unoriginal gags (e.g., a trained monkey—as in the first film—plus one of the characters having sex with a Thai man he thought was a woman, which is not shown but described in graphic detail). Based on this film, I think Phillips could probably have made a decent action thriller—one that made Thailand look equally as bad as this one—but that would not have achieved his objective, which was to duplicate the success of ""Hangover I."""

","There is probably nothing more dismal in the world of cinema than a comedy that is not funny. The director of this movie tries really hard to generate laughs but without success. This movie proves that goofiness does not necessarily produce laughs. The actors try their best to be funny but their efforts are for naught. Everything about this movie had problems: the poor script, the inane story, the cheesy acting, the transparent attempts to shock the audience, all of which producing a stultifying attempt to get the audience to laugh. Actually, the part of the movie that worked the best was the after the movie ends, with still pics intermixed with the credits. Bradley Cooper is a strong actor but in this movie he is completely miscast. Mr. Cooper simply is not a slap-stick comic. The background of Bangkok, Thailand did nothing to uplift this movie. The seediness and squalor of the city is sad and calls to question whether the Asian continent is as prosperous as reported in the news."
"arayrodgers","9","5","15","26 May 2011"," Very close to as good as the original
","Just about everyone and their mother knows the original Hangover was amazing and one of the best comedies, possibly in all of film history (well of the past decade easily). This sequel is very strange in that it's hardly a sequel, it's more like a reworking.<br/><br/>They seemed to have used the exact same formula of the original, including major plot points and even what musicians soundtrack which scenes (there's a Kanye song playing on both when they're going out, there's a Wolfmother song playing again near the climax, that same singer with the eerie voice has a song at the beginning during the credits, after the ""we screwed up"" phone call), but somehow they managed to basically copy themselves without it feeling cheap.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how they achieved this, but as unoriginal as the film is, it just works. They basically took every crazy scene of the original and amplified times 100. Everything is absolutely insane, they're are definitely some things that will catch you by huge surprise. In some ways, this does indeed make this movie funnier and more action packed than the original, but what really made the Hangover so great was that the characters seemed very real, like you could see all of those things happening to you and your friends if you were at the wrong place at the wrong time, several times in a row.<br/><br/>That feeling of realistic characters and believable disasters is hardly present in the Hangover II, because the events are so extreme and the characters choices go past the morals of an average man (take into consideration that I believe the characters in the original were close to average men lol). If you haven't seen the first one though, you could possibly think this is one of the funniest movies ever.<br/><br/>So while it is funnier, it is less believable which takes away from some of the humor, but I still say it levels out to be about as good as the original."
"Logiebear42","8","5","15","26 May 2011"," More of the same but just as fresh
","The Hangover (Part 1) was a great film - the pacing was excellent, it was a new and refreshing idea executed brilliantly. It stands up on repeat viewings and still surprises with how funny it is. <br/><br/>Now we have Part 2, the set up sounds the same; one of the guys is getting married, they (reluctantly) have a bachelor party end up getting wasted and wake up with no recollection of the night before and a member of the gang missing. Cue surprises as they unravel the mystery. Throughout the pre-hungover set up, I'll admit I was worried. There are many nudges and winks to the original that are genuinely funny but thankfully the writers stop making homage and the originality begins. <br/><br/>I won't ruin any of the surprises as the mysteries set up are excellent and caught the entire theater by surprise every time. Be warned that part 2 follows the formula of the first but never feels old. <br/><br/>Bradley Cooper largely takes a backseat as this is Ed Helms' show. Sure Zach Galafianakis has the bulk of the comedy and is on form as Alan throughout the entire film but Helms grounds the film with his descent into insanity with everything Bangkok throws at him, balancing Alan's childlike naivety and Cooper's straight(er) man perfectly.<br/><br/>The cinematography, soundtrack, writing and direction are all fantastic the whole way through, showing the squalor and seedy side of Bangkok in a classy and energetic way. <br/><br/>The verdict is go see this film. After watching it I honestly cannot decide whether Hangover 1 or 2 is better. surely that's the sign of a good sequel. Sure Part 1 is fresh and original but Part 2 takes the formula and ramps it up as far as it will go. Enjoy the surprises and go along for a crazy ride."

And if you loved that one you will love this one for sure. There were definitely some scenes that threw me for a loop and were a bit of a shock but in a good way! I've been reading some really bad reviews about this movie on other sites saying the theater was silent with no laughs. But they are journalist not regular everyday people that enjoy a good laugh.

But I would be lying. As with most big-budget studio comedies these days, the tone and the performances are pitched so over-the-top that the audience winds up feeling assaulted rather than entertained long before the closing credits come rolling by. To that end, the screenplay by Scot Armstrong, Craig Mazin and director Todd Phillips is filled with wheezy plot mechanics, overwrought action sequences, mind-numbing slapstick, and jokes that fall consistently flat.<br/><br/>The buddies are once again played by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zack Galifianakis and a much under-used Justin Bartha (who may have been the only one career-conscious and savvy enough to ask to be left out of most of the proceedings), while Paul Giamatti and Ken Jeong - who is much funnier on TV's ""Community"" - have been added to the cast.<br/><br/>By any standard but the most crassly commercial - the movie garnered an impressive quarter of a billion dollars in domestic box office receipts - ""The Hangover - Part2"" is a colossal bomb."

Just don't get offended by the P... & F... words and you will love it. The moment the movie starts, you know what's going to happen, but this never made me not enjoy this movie. The opposite was the case, you were just waiting for the next scene to top what you remember from Part 1. And most of the time it did. That is exactly the reason why I went to see it, just sit & laugh, no thinking or following a story line. This movie is just plain entertainment at its best."

Director Todd Phillips takes few chances using the same convoluted recipe of hallucination and black out from the first but with the audience prepared for it most of the humor lands with a heavy thud.<br/><br/>Zach Galinafikis was clearly the centerpiece and biggest contributer to the success of the first film but here he's lost the edge and freshness and his five minutes ( most get fifteen ) seem to be over. As Stu and Phil Bradley Cooper and Stan Helms merely recite what they did in the first. Only Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow lives up to the originals audacity and energy but with the rest of the cast looking winded and ineffective Hangover 2 remains too sober for its own good."

","I really enjoyed the first Hangover when it brought some fresh and frank elements into movie comedies two years ago. I was really excited to see this Part 2 as well. Somehow though, there was something missing in this strangely lifeless sequel.<br/><br/>It is basically a remake of the first movie. This time it is Stu's wedding. Instead of Vegas, they are in Bangkok. But similarly, they get seriously drunk a couple of days before the wedding and wake up with unexplained consequences of what happened the night before. They have to figure out what happened to Teddy, Stu's prodigious teenage brother- in-law to be, before they can go back to the wedding. Can they find Teddy and make it back?<br/><br/>If you have seen the first Hangover, you would know the answer to that question. The story structure is EXACTLY the same. However, I did not find the story too funny this time. Even the wisecracks of Alan (Zach Galfianakis) which were hilarious in the first movie, felt forced and even annoying in this one. The repeated cursing and the graphic naked scenes did not really help breathe life to the struggling comedy. By the time an off-key surprise cameo appearance comes out at the end, you don't really care. I don't think there should be a third one anymore."

","I didn't want to see this (judging by the reviews), I only went to see it because I was with my friends, I wanted to see X- Men first class film. The reviews were right, Hangover 2 just seems like the filmmakers were running out of ideas. Most of the humor seems like they were done for just shock value (like they were forced), the element of surprise wasn't there, and the plot was just like the first one except it takes place in Thailand. <br/><br/>I thought the actors were likable but because of the script, they seemed to be dumbed down.

"zardoz-13","5","2","4","6 June 2011"," Only Half As Good As ""The Hangover""
","Clearly, ""Old School"" director Todd Phillips subscribes to the saying if something ain't broke, don't fix it. ""The Hangover Part II"" reassembles all the fellows but few of the gals from its genuinely hilarious predecessor about the antics of an outlandish Las Vegas bachelor party gone awry. If you thought ""The Hangover"" was rude, crude, and morally offensive, ""Hangover Part 2"" makes the 2009 film appear tame by comparison. Not since ""The Crying Game"" (1992) has a film sunk to the comic excesses that ""The Hangover Part II"" dares. Sadly, some of the best things about the blockbuster original do not recur in the predictable, but raunchy, R-rated sequel. Basically, ""The Hangover Part II"" qualifies as only half as funny as the first film. What Phillips could not replicate in terms of riotous wit, he has replaced with shocking revelations. Prepare yourself for something you may have never seen. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons that Phillips set the sequel in the exotic orient was to take advantage of a far more liberal climate concerning sexual identity that is about as perverted as anything that modern, mainstream Americans can imagine. <br/><br/>Were it not for the gifted ensemble cast, including Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong, the half of ""Hangover 2"" that is hilarious wouldn't be as memorable. Galifianakis takes the smallest things and makes them side-splitting. For example, every time he says Thailand, he says 'thigh-land' rather than 'tie-land.' Galifianakis and Jeong compete to see who can get the biggest laughs. Mind you, ""The Hangover 2"" is not without its share of surprises. Some surprises are amusing, while others add nothing but complications to a contrived plot. Comparably, Phillips makes Thailand appear far more unsavory than Las Vegas could ever hope even with its shady criminal heritage. Depending on your perspective, ""Hangover 2"" makes Bangkok look like either the most sizzling place you could set your sights on or the last place this side of Hell that you would visit. Indeed, one of the revelations about a character who vanishes turns out to be less sinister than you might expect given the reputation of this 'anything goes' Southeast Asia country.<br/><br/>Two years after their shenanigans in Las Vegas, Stu (Ed Helms of ""Evan Almighty"") is scheduled to marry Asian dish Lauren (Jamie Chung of ""Sucker Punch"") in her homeland on the other side of the world at a picturesque sea-side resort. Initially, Stu has agreed to invite only Phil (Bradley Cooper of ""Limitless"") and Doug (Justin Bartha of ""Failure to Launch"") with no thought about moronic Alan. The bachelor brunch that Stu has in mind, however, takes place stateside at an I-HOP before he hops onto a jet. Eventually, an irate Phil prods Stu into throwing a bachelor bash in Thailand. Nevertheless, Stu doesn't want to relive the wolf pack antics of their previous escapade. Just as they are about to leave for the exotic Orient, Doug convinces a reluctant Phil to invite mischievous but well-meaning man-child Alan (Zach Galifianakis of ""Due Date"") on the condition that Alan doesn't spike their libations with roofies. Things get off to an uneasy start in Thailand for poor Stu because his future father-in-law, Lauren's stern patriarch, Fohn (Nirut Sirijanya of ""Ong Bak 3""), roasts him at the wedding rehearsal party. Fohn thoroughly loathes the milquetoast dentist. Indeed, Fohn compares Stu to lukewarm rice. Meanwhile, Fohn lavishes praise and attention on his quiet, 16-year-old Stanford freshman son (Mason Lee of ""The Wedding Banquet"") majoring in pre-med who plays the cello like a master.<br/><br/>After the party, Phil, Stu, Doug, and Teddy gather on the beach for a benign party around a bonfire with beer and marshmallows. No sooner is all that said and done than they awaken the following morning in the seediest motel Bangkok. They are surprised to learn their old Las Vegas gangster nemesis, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong of ""Role Models""), has spent the night partying with them. As it turns, Doug wisely left the party before everybody headed into Bangkok. After the guys wake up, Chow suddenly keels over face-down into a plate-glass table from snorting too much cocaine. Worse, the only thing left of Teddy is his severed finger with a Stanford ring. This time around Alan is shocked that his head has been shaved, and Stu freaks out over a tattoo on the left temple that resembles the one Mike Tyson sported in ""The Hangover."" First, the wolf pack disposes of Chow's body. Wrapping it in towels, they stash it in an ice-making machine. Afterward, they retrace their steps so they can learn what happened to Teddy. The fellows find out that they burned down a bar, cavorted with some questionable gals, and ran afoul of some trigger-happy thugs. Along the way, they encounter another equally dangerous gangster, Kingsley (Paul Giamatti of ""Sideways""), who not only has a million dollar deal with Mr. Chow, but also knows about Teddy's whereabouts. Our baffled heroes also find out that the electricity in Bangkok has a way of going out when they least expect it.<br/><br/>Phillips and freshman scribes Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong spend the first formulaic thirty minutes getting the wolf pack back together before they fly them off to Bangkok. Like the first movie, ""The Hangover Part 2"" opens with Phil making his inevitable phone call to warn the wedding party that they have encountered some slight difficulties. The filmmakers replace Mike Tyson's roaring tiger with a drug-dealing, cigarette-smoking capuchin monkey in a Rolling Stones' outfit. Phillips orchestrates a roller-coaster chase through Bangkok that looks like something out of ""Smoky and the Bandit."" Ultimately, Stu solves a mystery about himself that will either embarrass you with its tawdry tastelessness or having you laugh so hard that you'll burst a blood vessel. Altogether, ""The Hangover Part 2"" is unforgettable in the worst and best ways, but it never crackles with the spontaneity that made ""The Hangover"" so insanely entertaining."

That's the amount of wittiness the movie had offered you and one who has seen this movie, will definitely expect at least the sequel with an equal pace if not a dull one. But the trailer literally shattered the expectations with unwinding the script, a replica of Las Vegas and with same old missing and hangover with less and boring screenplay.<br/><br/>Las Vegas was awesome. Bangkok was dull and boring. The wedding boy Doug was missing and it was gripping until they find him. Bride's little brother comes in a scene and leaves no interest in the hunt. Stu's missing tooth is sensational and had a great Dentist touch to it. Tattoo, give it a break! Mike Tyson's tiger! There is a jungle cat in the bathroom.

The approach of recollect the last night by enquiring different people with little evidences made the screenplay thrilling and captivating. I was blown in the scene when the monk asked to meditate so that they can recollect the past!<br/><br/>As I mentioned, rather than focusing on the title and standing on the same story with absolutely same casting, they must have thought something different to make it fresh and entertaining.

","It must surely be the case that ""The Hangover 2"" is the moment people come to realise their folly in liking the first film, and thus come to review their opinions on it. Indeed, how can one realistically claim to enjoy the initial 2009 effort, about the hijinks of three American men lost and confused in the city of Las Vegas, without proclaiming the superiority of this one too? It may, of course, be the case that you claim to like both, but this is surely mere self-delusion as this second effort is patently not good - it is about as ordinary as the first one, no better or worse - a series of chaotic sequences involving connected men in an alien locale which doesn't happen to have the raw punch of the first because neither the jokes nor the scenarios are fresh.<br/><br/>
Within the first hour, one can practically hear the voices of the producers and writers which radiated out of the well-groomed office suites of a large Los Angeles building bathed in 27 degrees of sunshine - people knocking around ideas for the sequel to the wildly successful and perhaps genuinely funny in two or three places comedy ""The Hangover"". Let's not mince our words: the second film exists because of the financial success of the first, nothing else. <br/><br/>
The film is, more or less, a rehash of the initial outing: the location has changed to Thailand, offering the dynamic of a language barrier for our leads to struggle through, and another character has joined the troupe in the form of the young; Asian and gifted Teddy (Mason Lee), but the formula is not one that has been strayed from especially greatly.<br/><br/>
As was the case with the first film, I did not believe for one second that the parties involved would know one another; care for one another or have anything to do with one another in the real world: Phil (Bradley Cooper), a primary school teacher who steals his pupils' money in the first film, here attempts to swipe a prescription sheet for some narcotics which will take you to a happy place whilst at the dentist. Ha ha. Said dentist is Stuart (Ed Helms), who is the series' lateral thinker and musician. Completing the foursome is Doug (Justin Bartha), whom I spent most of the first film wondering how he would know these people, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) - Doug's somewhat retarded in-law. <br/><br/>
It is Stuart's wedding in Thailand that propels the gang off and away for their latest escapade, one which will eventually see them (minus Doug, whose presence in the franchise may now very well be redundant) charge around the noisy, squalid streets of Bangkok and its surrounding suburbs looking for soon-to-be brother in law Teddy. Todd Phillips and his creative crew tweak the 'winning' formula only very slightly, this time forcing the crew into their misadventure after they each agree to have a quiet drink on the beach rather than a boisterous night out. Things do not go entirely to plan, and someone from the original gang of course is missing when the time comes to wake up in a mysterious hotel room: Stuart does not lose a tooth, but instead obtains a tattoo; there is no tiger in the suite, but instead they have acquired a monkey; the groom is fine, but his father-in-law's pride and joy has disappeared without a trace... <br/><br/>
This propels Stuart; Alan and Phil into action, but the writing is generally lazy: Thai stereotypes, such as the monastery dwelling Buddhist monk on a vow of silence and the ladyboy whore, pepper the experience, while the film has to resort to using a monkey to boost its chuckle count. Monkeys are funny, aren't they?.<br/><br/>
If the writing is lazy, the adventure itself is mostly unspectacular: whether it was the regurgitation of old jokes or something else, very little of ""The Hangover 2"" is actually that funny, but then it struck me that perhaps it isn't supposed to be.... There is a strange air to the film, almost as if the predicament this time round is something to endure rather than have fun experiencing. The gang's hammering around Las Vegas and the surrounding Nevada desert carried with it a fun, punchy feeling - it was a process they sensed they'd survive, if only they could piece together the clues.... In Bangkok, the 'wolfpack' have strayed too far from home and the film plays more like an odd action/horror hybrid as the gang bear seedy backstreets; psychotic Russian cartels and friends' severed fingers...<br/><br/>
Where Doug's fiancée was afforded the opportunity to spit fire at the crew's losing the love of her life in the 2009 effort, tremendous strain is undertaken to prevent Teddy's father from ever knowing that they placed this clean-cut young man in the way of any kind of harm. Despite not necessarily having anything 'wrong' with him, it had already been established that Stuart is disliked profusely by his future father in-law - the vanishing of Teddy under his watch risks enraging him even further, potentially scuppering the wedding entirely. But without Teddy's father ever discovering he was first lost, and then retrieved, nothing is learnt and the entire arc of his coming to accept Stuart as an in-law himself is rendered totally redundant.<br/><br/><br/><br/>""The Hangover"", not to mention this sequel, are films which most people seem to really enjoy - I think most critics seemed to realise they were had the first time round when the time came to see this second film, hence the backlash which seems to have been born out of their own frustration with themselves for not getting the review right first time round. I'd like to be able to enjoy it all with everybody else, but I just find myself unable to get involved with any of it. You could do a lot worse than this and its slightly older brother, but you could probably do better."

I found both films hilarious and am pleased they decided to go with the same approach for the second film rather than rolling the dice and risk ruining something special.<br/><br/>Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis are all excellent and provide plenty of laughs with such ridiculous material. Galifianakis has the ability to crack you up with his facial expressions alone - some of the scenes with Alan in this film are priceless.

","More of a remake of the first 'Hangover' movie than a sequel to it, this second entry finds the friends with short term memory loss and a bad hangover again after yet another bachelor party. The setting is different though, and with the action taking place in Bangkok, there is something fresh to the friends having to contend with unfamiliar territory and locals who do not speak their language in a quest to piece together what they have forgotten. There are also some fun references to the first movie, like Stu instantly thinking ""the roof!"", however, with the basics of the plot so strikingly resembling the first movie (a missing friend, an animal in the room, something with Stu's face and the list goes on), it is hard to blame the characters complaining that they ""can't believe this happening again"" way too many times. And yet, while a pale imitation of its predecessor, there are certainly some funny moments to be had with lots of outlandish surprise revelations and charismatic new supporting characters like Nick Cassavetes as a blunt tattoo artist and the ever-reliable Paul Giamatti, in addition to several of Part One's more memorable characters making appearances. The film might not have much new to offer in the marriage and/or relationship message department, but for a few laughs, it is hard to go wrong with the lead actors here, recycled as the basic story may well be."

","The Hangover 2 gives you the same feeling you get when you drink too much the night before and wake up with a piercing headache. The Wolf Pack is back, this time they are heading to Thailand for their friend Stu's wedding. Stu wants a peacefully relaxing wedding with his friends with no signs of a bachelor party. When the Wolf Pack arrives in Thailand they decided to have one beer by a bonfire on the beach with Stu's future brother in-law Teddy then head to bed. Morning comes and the Wolf Pack awake in a seedy hotel room in Bangkok. Not remembering what happened the night before, the boys try to remember what happened the night before. As they try to recollect what happened, they realize Teddy is missing and they need to find out what happened and where Teddy is before the wedding in two days. My problem with The Hangover 2 is not the similar storyline, just a different city, but the way the movie tries to force you to laugh. Having an almost exact same storyline with some forced laughter is going to bore the audience. I felt bored through the entire movie waiting when the big laughs will happen. These big laughs have to happen soon. Then as the movie progressed, will there be any big laughs? I felt cheated in this movie. There are no real new jokes. Instead of a baby, they have a monkey this time. Their missing friend was where they first began like last time. They got beat up by Chow again like the first one. The same jokes, the same situations continue. The Wolf Pack even thought they found their missing friend like in the first and low and behold the friend was the wrong person. Then the movie tried to push laughter on the audience with the trans-gender scenes and jokes. The jokes grossed you out more then made you laugh, the ploy backfired. They fired a lot at the audience but ultimately failed. No one in the audience in my theater was laughing and the movie was sold out. There were no major problems with any of the direction, cinematography, or acting. This is a comedy; the movie is not graded on those merits as much as a movie like Lord of The Rings or The Godfather mold is. Though Zach Galifianakis has fallen into the same category as Adam Sandler, Michael Cera, Seth Rogen, Will Ferrell, and Rob Schneider, he is type cast as the same person in every role and every movie, though Will Ferrell and Rob Schneider were never good or funny for that matter. The Hangover 2 will leave you searching for that aspirin after a heavy night of drinking. Watching this film in the movies is not worth full price or matinée. I say skip a blind buy and wait for the movie to available in the Redbox for a dollar if you really need to see this. The Hangover 2 is 5/10 or C for average at best"

","Todd Phillips' approach to part two of his surprise comedy smash The Hangover (2009) is that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The original made bona fide stars out of its lead trio and grossed half a billion dollars in the process, so a sequel was always going to be on the cards. The simple formula of the hapless heroes waking up from a stag night of drink, drugs and debauchery to find the groom missing and a variety of clues lying around to help them work out just what the hell happened felt fresh, and the natural charisma of its stars, particularly Zach Galifianakis, made for a hilarious experience.<br/><br/>By sticking to the formula, Phillips has forced himself to a corner where the details have to bigger and more outlandish. Instead of Vegas, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Galifianakis) are in Thailand to celebrate Stu's upcoming wedding to Lauren (Jamie Chung). After a planned quiet night on the beach with a beer and marshmallows, they wake up in a grimy hotel room in Bangkok with no memory of the night before and inexplicably in the presence of gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeung) from the first film. When Chow seemingly overdoses on cocaine, they are left to piece things together themselves.<br/><br/>If this was a stand-alone movie without the existence of its predecessor, then this probably would have been a winner. While its frequently goes overboard with the crass humour, its consistently amusing without succeeding in being quite so laugh-out-loud as the first movie, thanks mainly again to Galifianakis, whose man-child Alan is the funniest aspect of the film. Yet while his naivety and plain stupidity was so endearing in the original, the sequel also takes Alan to increasingly dark places. Here, he is not so much social inept but dangerously insane to the point that he becomes occasionally outright unlikeable.<br/><br/>And this is the main issue - replacing charm and goofiness with extreme humour. Stu was missing a tooth in the first film, but this time he wakes up with a Mike Tyson tribal tattoo on his face. Rather than Tyson's tiger, we have a chain-smoking drug-mule monkey. Rather than finding Doug (Justin Bartha) vanished, they lose Lauren's prodigal younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee), to which the only clue to his participation is his severed finger. And having previously married a stripper, Stu discovers that - in the most uncomfortably unfunny scene - he has been sodomised by a ladyboy. Add to the mix a sub-plot involving gangster Kingsley (Paul Giamatti) and his search for Chow, the film spends too much time away from the hapless threesome's interplay in favour of watching their reactions to a variety of cruel situations."

","It's been a few years now since I watched the first part of this movie, but I still have the memories of how much it did make me laugh. I also remember that although most of it was unthinkable in real life, it did not get to a point of idiocy that turned you against the movie. They did manage to live in that fine line where you still accept what you are watching. In the sequel, that line was slightly crossed. <br/><br/>On top of that, you have to feel a little disappointed about finding some replays of the elements that made you laugh in the first movie. I always take points away when I see a director that copies himself. A few examples: Stu loses a tooth in the first movie, in the second one he gets a tattoo on his face. Stu gets married to whore, in the second one he has sex with a transsexual. In the first movie they had a Lion, in the second they have a monkey; the bearded guy ""masturbates"" a baby, here he masturbates an old man. And again in both of them, they get involved against some underworld guys. <br/><br/>But make no mistake, I know I have not concentrated much on the positives of the movie so far, when the only thing that counts is how much it makes you laugh.

From there it is a series of events to find the bride's missing brother whose severed finger is found. The conclusion is pretty much the same as the first film but without the awe. Todd Phillips will remain a sought after director after the first film became a huge surprise hit in 2009. This time his cast recite the same material that they mastered in Vegas. Bradley Cooper wishes not to travel to Thailand but does on request. Ed Helms plays the dentist getting married and awakens with a tattoo on the side of his face. Zach Galifianakis as Al continues his stunned bewilderment. Ken Jeong returns as criminal Mr. Chow whose high energy forgets that he is a wanted man. Paul Giamatti was comic gold in Private Parts but here as an undercover cop he is as bland as the film. This time he is stuffed into an ice box instead of a car trunk. In the end it can never sober up to the original film's brilliance. Score: 2 / 10"

","This time around, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Alan (Zach Galifianakis), and Doug (Justin Bartha) actually fly all the way to Thailand where Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married. Still stinging from their Vegas adventure, Stu decides to have his bachelor party at an IHOP; unfortunately, it doesn't turn out that way. Just like the first movie, we see the guys raise their glasses and then we see them after another party. This time, Phil and Alan are on the floor, Alan's hair is gone, and Ed is passed out in the bathtub with a tattoo on his face. Oh, and Stu's 16-year old future brother-in-law is missing.<br/><br/>Clearly, director and co-writer Todd Phillips was given a lot bigger budget this time around and the money can be seen on the screen. Beautiful Thailand locations are a plus, but the whole thing could have just as well have taken place in Vegas. This story would have worked in Vegas or Manhattan or anywhere local...I guess the idea of bringing the boys to Thailand was supposed to make the proceedings more substantial, but it still seems to be much to do about nothing.<br/><br/>The actors still work well together, with standout work from Helms and Galifianakis and there's a scene stealing turn from a cigarette smoking monkey, and Ken Jeong's character redefines the word annoying, but if you liked the first film, you will probably like this one too."

","This is not funny it is just gross and stupid. Don't wast your money. Don't see this movie. I pooh on this movie because it is pooh pooh. It is badly written. It is made by people you do not know what it means to be funny. I can't believe people think this junk is funny. I swear any body could have hit comedy. Because people are just so desperate for a laugh. I know bad words and I have been on the toilet so many times in my life I could have a hit comedy movie. The monkey is the most talented actor in this overrated piece pooh pooh. It is very sick at times and that is not a good thing. And sick is never funny sick is just sick.

","The movie doesn't really have anything new to present. It basically runs on the first movie's story and characters. It just changed the location setting from Las Vegas to Bangkok. It sure is quite nice to have a different location and culture influencing the story. But seriously, the plot is simply the same, right to the very details. The only difference in the plot is that this time it is Stu's wedding instead of Doug's, and this time Doug didn't get into trouble. But having everything work out just as the first movie did is just boring. Fortunately this time the comedies are a bit better. We get to see hilarious craziness in them. The ladyboy, everything with Chow, and of course the monkey, are the things that made the comedies worth laughing at. Particularly the monkey is the funniest of those gimmicks.. The acting overall is just as the same as the first movie, if not lower. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zhac Galifianakis successfully reprised their respective designated roles."
"DiCaprio74","6","0","0","1 January 2015"," Not like the first
","This movie was still pretty hilarious although it was a completely different story plot with the same scenario from the first one. Bradley Cooper, in my opinion, can turn any movie around just from his acting skills. Galifianakis was his usual hilarious self along with Helms and Jeong. The only disappointment that had came out of the film was pretty much the fact that they had used the same scenario from the first Hangover movie. You would think that the director would like to go with a different type of storyline, but I guess this was the one that he was sticking to. Along with it being the easiest to come up with as well. <br/><br/>This movie was more than the average comedy film that you would see, but it's lack of good story structure was an issue.  I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't laugh at this film, because I did, it's just that it could've went in another direction. <br/><br/>It's claimed a movie that you either hate or love, but I simply find myself in the middle of not liking it because it really went nowhere, and loving it because it was hilarious. I would tell you to give it a try before continuing to read the rest of the reviewers ratings. Try it for yourself and find out how you like it before determining to stay away from it or not."

","If you haven't seen the Hangover (Part 1) then Part 2 follows the same characters as they, again, wake up after a heavy night with no memory of what happened and plenty of new problems to deal with as a result of it. If you HAVE seen the Hangover (Part 1) then you've basically seen the second one too.<br/><br/>A lot of review of Part 2 use phrases like, 'The Hangover Part 2 uses the same jokes, just cranked up to 11.' I sort of agree. Part 2 isn't a bad film; it's quite funny actually, its main problem is just that it doesn't offer anything new.<br/><br/>The writers (if you can call them that) have basically taken the script to Part 1, photocopied it, changed the locations and (very) slightly adjusted the jokes and sold it to the studios as a sequel. If fact, it's probably not best described as a 'sequel,' a 'remake' might be a better label. I wonder if the writers did it on purpose, i.e. keep the situations identical in a hope that lightning would strike twice. For me, as every new crazy moment passed, I just couldn't believe how similar it was. It became almost weird just how copied it was. In the end it kind of detracted from the story as all I had to do was think back to what happened next in Part 1 to know what was coming in Part 2.<br/><br/>That said, Part 2 is okay if you liked the first and basically want more of the same silliness. It's just a shame the makers didn't wait a little longer and come up with something just a little bit fresher.<br/><br/>The monkey is cool though. Just don't let him near your water bottle."

","In 2009, The Hangover shocked me by being spectacular and being one of my favourite comedies ever. 2011 saw its sequel which people thought would surpass the first. I knew it would not. With low expectations like the first, I was very impressed. I wouldn't say this is better than the first at all, but I will say it is a nice confident. The guys are back and the danger is higher.<br/><br/>Stu (Helms) is about to get married in Thailand, his fiancée's native land. Ready to have a nice, regular time with his best friends, (Cooper, Galifinakis, Bartha) and soon to be brother in law, Teddy, Alan takes a dislike to Teddy and sets off a string dangerous encounters, leaving him and his friends with no memory and Teddy missing. Lost in a much bigger city with bigger crimes, Stu's wedding becomes more jeopardized than Doug's.<br/><br/>The first flaw I found was the scenes with frontal male nudity. I also didn't see why Justin Bartha had little screen time in this one too. Right before anything bad happens, he leaves the area to be with his wife who is sick and the family. Bartha was involved in Broadway plays, so I understand why they used less of him, but there's lots of people on Broadway and other things that still do full movies. The last flaw was how recycled everything was. Since the stuff used was very funny, I didn't mind. But that kept me from finding this better. There may be more danger, but it revolves around the same things. One thing I did like was Teddy's whereabouts. It is a more complex and less predicable place than Doug's in the first."

Stu's plan for a subdued pre-wedding brunch, however, goes seriously awry. The writing is meant to make us all laugh and succeeds. It's an important film, as well as very entertaining. It's meant to be goofy.If you end up watching this, you will probably be like me in saying that it starts off great then gradually begins to suck. It holds the attention but demands complete suspension of logic.From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

It had many events in one movie that made things interesting and the way they tried to solve the complexes were funny. Zach Galifianakis made a great touch to the movie. He played his roll better than great. I have to say I don't think the Hangover would have been as funny as it is with out Zach. All the actors in the movie played their part fantastically. It had a great sense of humor, it would make people of all ages laugh as they watch the movie. It also had great lines. I'd say the movie is suitable for all ages and is a great movie to watch with your friends or family and have a good laugh with them. Overall, it's funny and interesting.

","The Hangover Part II. You know the drill, it follows the same template of cult The Hangover. This time it is Stu's wedding and they are lost in the sin city of Bangkok. Like last time Doug is missing during most of the screen time but this time he is not the missing one from the wolf pack. Instead of Alan, Stu gets the center stage and his pain and sorrow is quite inevitable. Bradley Cooper looks cool and plays the guy with a mind quite good. Alan as usual get most of the funny lines and weird emotional scenes like with criminal Chow from first movie and a smart monkey who smokes. Movie gets over the top and overly crass in its humor sometimes but I think director never promised a clean humor anyway. So if you are watching it with your wolf pack then it is a blast just like The Hangover otherwise it is just the rehash of the same formula that made The Hangover so much enjoyable."

","I have never been a fan of the Hangover series and can't even remember much about the second one because I slept through it. With that being said, I believe that Hangover 3 is probably the best one they have made. I wasn't at all bored or wishing that it would end like I had been in the other movies. This movie actually made me laugh. However, the movie seemed to go by so fast; almost like it was rushed. It had a good plot but it just seemed like they ran out of ideas and just ended the movie. I think that it is a good idea that they ended the Hangover series. I feel like they wanted to make a movie that wrapped everything up but didn't have anywhere else to go with it. I liked that the Allen found love at the end. I think that was a nice touch for them to add. I really enjoyed that Melissa McCarthy was in; any time she makes an appearance in a movie makes it better. Overall, it was funny and entertaining and ended on a good note."

","Although laughs are limited in this, compared to it's predecessor, this inevitable sequel is still a fun watch, thanks the chemistry of the actors, or more importantly the Brat Pack. Again they end up in one hell of a bungle, where someone else goes missing, and worse they've landed in Bangkok, the appearances changed somewhat too. I admit the chimpanzee, who like Mr Chow, becomes soul mates with fruit loop, Allen, stole the scenes. It was great to see the wonderful Nick Cassavettes as Tattoo Joe, too. This sequel still works as just scraping by on it's short amount of laughs. It does have it's moments, like in the dressing room of a strip club, the one where the women are packing the wrong equipment down below, as the pack retrace their steps. Too, check out Stu's different lyrical version of Billy's Joel's Allentown. Plus we've got Allen too, more funnier in this one. We have a surprise visit at the end too, appearing at Stu's marriage do, (remember his intolerable ex) from the first one. I did love the end, of course, with Murray Head's song ""One night in Bangkok"", but that's like a cruel taunt, in view of the hell, the pack have just been through."
"jimbo-53-186511","4","0","0","13 November 2013"," Disappointing follow up which is essentially the same as the first film
","When watching a sequel to a film, I seldom expect it to be better than the original film. However, on the occasions where the sequels are weaker than the originals I will usually try and acknowledge them for trying to do something different. Not only was the Hangover 2 not as good as the first film, it is exactly the same as the first film.<br/><br/>The plot structure is exactly the same; instead of a wedding taking place in Vegas, it takes place in Bangkok. Instead of Doug getting married, it is Stu that is getting married. Instead of Doug going missing, Teddy (Stu's soon to be wife's little brother goes missing). We also have a kidnapping sub plot and another instance of 'mistaken identity'.<br/><br/>In other words, there was nothing original about this film. It actually amazed me that it took 2 years for the writer's to come up with a sequel when it surely can't have taken more than 5 minutes to write the script. This really does have to be the laziest sequel I think I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I must admit I did laugh a few times, but nowhere near as often as I did in the first film. I think that the problem is that it is too similar to the first film; you knew that they would find Teddy and that he would be OK. Predictably, Stu does a complete U-Turn from being a passive pushover at the start of the film to being assertive and not taking any crap at the end of the film just as he did in the first film.<br/><br/>This film could have been great, if only the writer's had been brave and tried to come up with a sequel with a bit more originality."

"CinemaClown","Null","0","0","7 October 2013"," The Hangover Part II --> The Hangover Minus Everything That's Good About It.
","Applying the same formula that made its predecessor one of the finest comedies of its year, The Hangover Part II is the follow-up chapter to The Hangover that brings nothing new to the table, is an absolutely uninspired sequel that tries too hard to amuse its audience, and fails at everything the original managed to get right in the first place.<br/><br/>Set two years after the events of the first film, the story of The Hangover Part II follows Phil, Stu, Alan & Doug as this time they arrive in Thailand for Stu's wedding. In order to avoid the escapades of Las Vegas during their last bachelor party, Stu decides to play it safe by opting for a pre-wedding brunch but once again, things soon head in the unexpected direction.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover Part II completely lacks the freshness, originality & quality the first film had and even the use of humour is disappointing this time. The screenplay is a letdown too for the writers have simply taken the basic plot of the first film, set it at a new location & filled it up with whatever gags they could come up with without ever trying.<br/><br/>The technical aspects share much similarity with the first chapter yet doesn't resonate the same vibe as before. Camera-work is bit more gritty than last time, Editing fails to get rid of many moments the final print could've done without, and the soundtrack isn't impressive at all. Even the performance by its reprising cast is inferior in comparison to their input in the previous chapter while the new additions are simply dull.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Hangover Part II is a lazy, lethargic & lacklustre sequel to The Hangover that never really clicks at any given moment, and is nothing more than the same old stuff being sold in a new package. Every element that worked so well in the first film, whether it's the expert use of wit or creative energy or the seamless interplay between its characters, is sorely missing here and if you have seen the original, then you can certainly skip this one unless you are determined to find out what regret feels like!"

","Alright, here is the review for The Hangover, oh but wait, I already reviewed The Hangover. Is this the Hangover 2? I don't know, maybe because they are the exact same movie. After the success the original Hangover made obviously Hollywood milks the cash cow with a sequel. I'm not going to lie but when I first saw this movie I hated it. I hated how it was exactly the same as the first but after watching it again I started to appreciate it. Call me crazy but I am part of a minority that enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Sure the movie was very similar. It opens with Phil on the phone after a day or two of crazy antics, which is the same. Instead of Stu losing a tooth he gets a face tattoo. Instead of a baby it is an awesome monkey. Teddy becomes lost instead of Doug, and it takes place in Bangkok instead of Las Vegas. Stu is getting married and I kind of expected to marry the girl from the first movie but they needed to go to Bangkok so for the story it made sense. It is his wedding and of course they have a bachelor party and they get drugged, again, they wake up in a mess, again, and similar antics return. Chow returns and when he comes in the movie slows down for me. I really don't like his character and he was a tad overused in the movie. His comedy was a little less forced but his crazy antics were too much for me and I didn't like them.<br/><br/>The old saying ""don't fix what ain't broke"" probably works best here. I'm perfectly fine with them getting hung over again and finding a missing person again. I was fine with it because it worked and it was still funny. Scene after scene was still funny. Characters did little to change but frequently reminded us of the past adventure. This movie knew what was funny and they stuck to it. <br/><br/>Allan was still the lovable idiot who said and did stupid things. Come on, you can't say you didn't laugh when he made his speech at his wedding. Sure the connection he had with the baby is the exact same as it was with the monkey but that monkey kicked ass. My favorite part of the movie was the monkey and it was funny. The movie was actually funnier the second time then it was the first. People complain and complain that the two movies were the exact same and yes it was but it still worked.<br/><br/>I do agree to a degree with what fans were saying. I was OK with the overall story being the same and characters' being very similar but it was the small details that were the same that annoyed me. The opening scene should not have opened with almost the exact same lines as the ones in the first movie. Stu figured out where Teddy was in a very similar way he did in the first. There were some scenes you could take from Hangover 1 and put into Hangover 2. Lines could be interchanged and in the end this movie really is lazy filmmaking for a quick buck. I didn't like Mike Tysons unnecessary cameo and there were pictures during the credits again. The little things that made the two movies too similar. The problem with Hangover 2 is that it doesn't stick out as its own movie. It's basically called The Hangover.again.<br/><br/>I understand where people are coming from. They wanted to see something new and different. In a way, this movie did do that. There are transgender people, monks, missing fingers, Allan is shaved, and many more things that raise the bar in craziness. Hangover 2 is a lot more crazy then the first. Meaning the night they had in the second was a lot more intense then the first. The movies are very similar and are no different in the end but it was still a good time. I still laughed and I want to laugh when I see these movies. It was very similar but most people I talked to about this movie said it was funny bit too similar to the first. I respond with the simple question, ""Was it funny?"" when they answer yes then it is mission accomplished for the filmmakers. <br/><br/>I realize this is more of a defense then a review for this movie but it is worth talking about. Unfortunately, this movie is doomed to judgment. As a movie itself it is hysterical but since it follows up the first it is unpopular. It is doomed to comparison to its predecessor. If The Hangover never existed and The Hangover 2 was released instead, I guarantee everybody would have loved it even more then the first. This was a funny movie but I still agree that the first was better.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hangover 2 followed the same recipe to the first. Not much changed and if the Hangover 2 never existed nothing would really happen. This movie doesn't push the story forward in the trilogy. This movie is literally useless but it was still incredibly funny. For what it is it is a good movie but since it follows up the first movie it is a bad movie. I still liked it because I was still interested in the story and every scene made sense. I was still able to piece together the crazy night with the characters and enjoy the experience. The whole gimmick was reused but it still worked. I still had fun. I would have liked if it wasn't a copy and paste replica form the original but it was still good enough to get the WillyT Honorable Mention award. That is really saying something. The first got the seal of approval and that is only one step above the honorable mention."

","Todd Phillips goes for a 2nd hangover, but The Hangover Part II suffers with its lack of surprises. The flow of the story is as expected; a little setup followed by a whole lot of maniacal nonsense. There is actually a bunch that happens within the 100 minutes of screen time, although things feel quite linear The humor tends to be overly crude at times, which really isn't for young eyes. It also hampers many of the would-be laughs; however, there is so much going on that it is hard not to find at least a few chuckles throughout the picture. A bulk of the amusing antics that take place are at the expense of Ed Helms. The higher annoyance factors overshadow the comedy of Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong, although they are held somewhat in check. Bradley Cooper is more along for the ride here. The Hangover Part II has its moments. Just not enough to categorize it as a must see picture."

Facial tattoos, chopped off fingers and a drug-dealing monkey are just some of the nasties that beset our friends as they wake up from hangover no. 2, along with an outrageously camp ""friend"" who suddenly overdoses on cocaine and whom they deposit down a rubbish chute.<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti makes a cameo appearance as a ""businessman"" and Mike Tyson sings very badly indeed at the wedding at the end.

The equivalent of this would be like making a sequel to ""Superbad"" it would not work instead writers like Seth Rogen take some of the actors from that movie and place them into a new story which will attracted the audience of the first movie.

That's how I will start this review.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips returns to direct returning actors Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha. Two years after the first film, Stu is getting set to get married to his fiancée Lauren, a Thai woman whose family disapproves of Stu. When Stu, Phil and Allan hold a toast for Stu, they awaken the next day, again with no memory of what happened, and must try to solve the mystery of how they ended up in Bangkok, as well as find Lauren's missing brother, whom was with them. Their only clues are a severed finger and Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong returning, even more insane this time around), whom is mysteriously with them.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have pointed this out, but I will address it- this film is cruder, ruder and at times more mean spirited than the original. It is actually very violent at times, and the things our gang (the Wolf-pack) must go through are very disturbing. I won't lie, there were many times where instead of laughing, I simply stared in horror at what was transpiring. It was a bit too vulgar for its own good.<br/><br/>All of the actors are very good, yet again. Galifianakis stands out as Allan, whom has sort-of become the mascot for the series- a man-child who means well, but has obvious emotional and social problems, and can be very childish when he doesn't get what he wants. However, he is pushed a bit too far towards the beginning of this film, and almost becomes unlikable before somehow managing to redeem himself. This is mainly due to Galifianakis' performance- he plays the role just dumb enough that you will feel sympathy for him. Even when he is a total cretin, you know Allan ultimately means well, and is a scared, lonely man. Helms pulls through more this time, and is more fleshed out, and you will care more about him. Cooper plays well, but I still have a problem with his character- he is too irresponsible and at times too mean, which makes him slightly unlikable, especially after seeing a touching moment between he, his wife and his child at the end of the first film- his character doesn't totally ""add up.""<br/><br/>Phillips shows again that he has a knack for visuals. In addition to the gags, some of the scenes are very well shot, particularly a fun chase sequence, and some beautiful shots of Thailand and Bangkok. Phillips is a gifted visual artist. And despite the mean nature of the script by Craig Mazin, it is still a well-structured film, and is written reasonably well.<br/><br/>I really, honestly enjoyed this film. Even though the set-up and pay-off are almost identical to the first film, making it feel more like a remake than a sequel, it is still highly enjoyable. (I didn't even mention the funny drug-monkey or Jeong's uproarious performances as Chow.)<br/><br/>I'm going to give this a pretty-good 7 out of 10. It's a little too dark and violent, and re-treads the original too much, but it's still a fun ride, and is worth watching for fans of the original."

","As someone who really loved the originality and charm of the first film i was hoping to be surprised once again with the sequel, however this film did not have the effect i had hoped. <br/><br/>I had not expected the 2 films to be so similar and was really disappointed that it followed the exact same structure as the first film. When the film got going I found its humour to be engaging and funny but thanks to the samey structure i was constantly thinking i had seen it all before. <br/><br/>in summery i feel that while a good effort in terms of humour the film needed to stand on its own more from the first and really step away and become its own movie. not bad though by any stretch and I hope the third will be much more original"

","The Hangover Part 2 met all of my expectations. Sadly my expectations for this movie were low. The idea of a sequel to the Hangover is depressing because the first movie set the bar so high that there was no way to make a sequel to top it. This is were this movie fails. At times it seems like it's playing it safe by doing the exact same thing as the first movie and at other times it just goes off the reservation. I commend them for trying to take the movie to the next level, however, since the first movie was so crazy taking the sequel to the next level is just to insane for my taste. Most of my complaint with this movie is the fact that it goes way to far. The only real complement I have for this movie is the fact that the mess the wolf pack gets in this movie is far more elaborate than the first film. In the end, after finishing the movie there is no sense of satisfaction just a feeling that you may have wasted 2 hours of your life that you can never get back."

","The Hangover released in 2009, was one of the most comical films of the 21st Century and possibly of all time. The second installment offers pretty much the same. It offers the exact same method and style as the original. The conflicts and revelations between the characters are alike. The only difference being that the guys are in Thailand rather than the USA. However, I still found the film to be thoroughly entertaining, and found myself cringing at how the guys try to figure out how to get out of the predicament that they have found themselves in yet AGAIN! <br/><br/>So the scene is set 2 years after the bachelor party in LA went array. This time around the story is based on Stu and his pending marriage to Jamie Chung. The gang arrive in Thailand for the nuptials and they agree to having one beer together on the beach with a bonfire. Nevertheless, the next morning you find the guys struggling to regain consciousness, with no recollection of what happened the night before, or where they actually are. The main clues being that of a monkey, a facial tattoo, a severed finger and the return of international criminal Mr Chow.<br/><br/>I don't want to go into any further detail or spoil any more moments of hilarity, you know the score if you've seen the first. The Hangover 2 provides moments of debauchery, on varying levels of discomfort and comedic sketches. I would like to mention however, the drug dealing monkey; quite frankly pure genius.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the actors is amazing, and they have definitely not lost their spark from the first movie. The only think i found slightly disappointing is the fact that Doug was not caught up in the thick of the action. Instead he is sensible informant, as the rest of the wolf-pack try to figure out what when on.<br/><br/>So it may not have the same originality as the first one did, but now I completely understand why sequels follow the same formula created by the success of the original. They do it to keep their audiences satisfied. And Todd Phillips has certainly delivered yet again. I will look forward to the third installment next year."

","While 2011 had its share of misfires in theaters, none were so insulting as THE HANGOVER PART II. Not because of it's darker humor and edgier content as compared to the first movie. I'm cool with that. Not even because I thought it was a bad movie; in fact, if you view the movie as a standalone (rather than a sequel) it's still a pretty funny flick. No, the movie is insulting because it's the exact same movie as the first. Now, I was a fan of the first movie and would probably include it in my top ten favorite from 2009 but that doesn't mean a studio can regurgitate the same exact film to me in a different setting. If you've seen the first film, the plot is near identical but here's the rundown anyway: Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand and invites his fellow Wolf Pack along for the celebration. Despite actively trying to avoid a repeat of the events in Las Vegas, he awakens the morning after an innocent beer on the beach with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) in a rundown Bangkok motel room. Stu realizes his fiancé's little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) hassurprise!...gone missing at some point during their night-long bender. Time is running out as the three hapless members of the Wolf Pack comb the dangerous streets of Bangkok for Teddy before the wedding is ruined. Sound familiar? I thought so. And it gets worse than that.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips and the screenwriters essentially treated the original HANGOVER like a Mad Libs, erasing key words and phrases and substituting new elements in their place. The filmmakers' laziness goes well beyond rehashing the same plot in a new locale. The tiger from the first movie is replaced with a Buddhist monk, the baby is replaced with a drug-peddling monkey, and Stu's missing tooth is traded for a Mike Tyson facial tattoo. Celebrity cameos? We've got them too: Paul Giamatti as a local crime boss and Nick Cassavetes as a tattoo artist. A familiar face from the first film even makes a bonus appearance at the end of the movie just to seal the connection (but I won't spill details in case you haven't seen it). Oh, and speaking of the end of the movie: can you guess how it ends? If you answered with ""a series of photos depicting the debauchery of the missing night just like the first movie"", you're either a mediocre psychic or possess common sense. I'm serious: beat for beat, this movie follows the same formula as the first movie. And it made ridiculous money at the box office. Warner Bros must've been laughing all the way to the bank on this one. If they hadn't been released in such close proximity, I'd have guess it was revenge for the poor reception towards their GREEN LANTERN box office bomb. As if my rant hasn't been enough proof, I'm really aggravated with how we were cheated here.<br/><br/>But it's not a terrible movie. It's still funny. Not as funny as the last one, granted, but you can't expect the gags to carry the same weight when we've seen them before. The Bangkok setting and the audience's preconception of the city as the ultimate cesspool of transsexual prostitutes and underage sex slaves give the story the chance to move into darker territory. If you thought Stu's marriage to a stripper was rough luck in the first movie, he's get it a whole lot worse here. The entire original cast return to reprise their roles and, seeing as how they demonstrated their awesome buddy chemistry in the first movie, we have no reason to worry that they won't deliver. Galifianakis has some great moments in this movie. I loved his awkward dinner speech and there's a great moment about halfway through the movie where we see the world through his eyes (he envisions himself and his friends as kids as they tear through Bangkok in drugged out party-mode). Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow and, while his schtick wears a little thin at times, he's still good for some funny. If you haven't seen the first HANGOVER, there's a good chance you will enjoy this movie more than the rest of us. As a standalone movie, it works (as long as you're not easily offended/overly conservative). For the rest of us, it's a retread of old territory so blatant that you know you've been cheated by the end but the Wolf Pack is a fun enough group of guys that it doesn't suck so bad."

","Essentially the overall film basically just follows the same format that the original had but this time the ever raunchy Chaos is erupting in Bangkok, Thiland with even more Crudness, Frontal-nudity and scenes that will either offend or amuse you. New additions to this crazy sequel include a Monkey who smokes and deals drugs for bananas, Lady-boys (eep), A cut off finger and Stu getting a tattoo Fused onto his skin! When you watch the film you quickly realise that this no ordinary Rehash. It's actually one that offers a lot more Adultness that even the likes of South Park or Family Guy could ever dream of.<br/><br/>Being much bigger, The Sequel tends to veer into much darker black-hole content and comedy than the first, But still retains the Madness and hi-cap Hiluarity that helped the original make a name for itself. This sequel will either overall feel like a demented scientific clone Of The first one or The original Upgraded into into something even bigger depending on how you feel. I reckon it will probably feel like both."

","Of course the premise is more or less the same. But it's not like all the jokes that were funny in the first Hangover get repeated here. It's in the same style and if you didn't like the first one (yes indeed there are quite a few who didn't enjoy the first Hangover), then you will not like this one either.<br/><br/>Since you've seen something like this before there is however a possibility that you feel this is a letdown. It wouldn't be fair to the movie to just judge it by its predecessor. Different animal ""craziness"" can result for you to either like that or hate it (had a conversation about the new animal depicted here with another person and she didn't like it a bit).<br/><br/>Again, don't come looking for a different plot (or something that will distinguish it completely from the first Hangover), but only come in to watch this as an enhancement, another take on the Hangover theme, if you will.

","Okay, so I rated 8/10 for the first film.<br/><br/>Why? Because I have not seen a film like it before (I'm 19 just so you know, so I haven't had time to watch every single film like this).<br/><br/>But anyway, when I heard Hangover 'Part 2' was coming out my original thoughts were 'It's going to be exactly the same'. And guess what? I was right.<br/><br/>Remember when that guy jumped out the boot? Well the same thing happens in this film. I was first watching this film with my boyfriend and said to him when I saw he was in it. ""I bet they are going to lock him up somewhere and then come back and he'll pounce on them"" That happened. Also, I found it a bit disappointing that Doug wasn't in on the action this time. I thought it would of added something different if he was in the film this time.<br/><br/>To be honest, the only highlight of this film was in fact the monkey. At times it was once again predictable with them stealing the monkey then going on this crazy drive through the city.<br/><br/>For those of you who have seen the first one. There's really no point in watching the second. Sure Alan makes a funny predictable speech, but you can see that on the trailers... watch the trailers and you'll more or less see the scenes that didn't happen in the first film. If you go see the film. All that will be filled in are redo's of the original film but in another city."

","When a movie is as much of a mega smash hit as The Hangover was in 2009, you can pretty much tell as soon as the credits start rolling that the movie will have a sequel. And that can be a good or bad thing; a sequel can further develop the characters you loved from the first and tell a whole new story, or it can regurgitate whatever made the first so great and just add new words. The Hangover, Part II is the latter.<br/><br/>In part II, the boys are going to Thailand for Stu's wedding and wake up realizing they lost his bride's little brother. Sound familiar? The Hangover part II is very similar to the first one, right down to it starts out almost the exact same way with everyone wondering where they are and Phil calling Doug's wife Tracy. The main difference between this one and the first one (other than it takes place in Thailand) is that the jokes go from funny to uncomfortable to watch. Instead of waking up and discovering one of them lost a tooth, they wake up to find the severed finger of the guy who is missing. Instead of getting tasered in the nuts, Phil gets shot in the arm. Instead of stealing a police car, they've kidnapped a monk. The jokes that made you laugh in the first one makes you feel sorry for them in this one. I'm not saying this movie was entirely bad, Bradley Cooper is still gorgeous (sue me, I'm a girl and that's my main draw for seeing these movies) and there are still some jokes that you can laugh at. I'm saying that they felt the need to rehash or bring in as much from the first one as they could, like Mike Tyson is randomly on the stage rapping at the end, and the movie ends with them looking at pictures from the night before. It makes me hope there is no Hangover III, but I think that would be impossible as the only one left to get hitched is Alan and who sees that happening?"

","Same exact concept, mostly the same hijinks, but not nearly the same payoff. That's The Hangover Part II in a nutshell. <br/><br/>This time, the ""wolf pack"" ends up in Thailand for Stu's wedding, and once again things go horribly wrong and an entire night (and another person) are lost in a haze of substances, carnage, and bad behavior. And just like in the first movie, most of Part II is spent with the guys trying to piece together what happened the night before, get everyone back safe before the wedding, and just generally not die. <br/><br/>This is a pretty unnecessary sequel, and it shows. It's just not early as funny as the first movie, the characters are less likable and more annoying, and the whole thing just feels stale."

","The buddies take a while to get together while constantly talking about what happened in the previous movie. And not just join together in a quick but fluid manner.

This movie is basically a rehash of the first movie, but the first one was more fluid when it came to it's comedic elements and more entertaining. This one just seemed to be trying a bit too hard because the first one was such a success. It was like the movie was trying to make the scenarios cool but it just lacked in it's comedic value. The situation and everything just seemed way too over exaggerated and it goes in a direction where it's difficult to just go with the flow. The only big originality is that the pack is now in Bangkok but even than it doesn't give anything all that new or all that funny. If this movie came before the original I am not sure if this franchise would have been a hit. I was continuously waiting for this movie to be at least a good comedy but it just never really reached that level. It just seemed like they didn't have a clever direction or a good comedic plot but just wanted to cash in as soon as possible. It does have it's moments but it's very few and nothing that really stands out. This so called sequel isn't terrible but it was still disappointing.<br/><br/>5.8/10"

","I enjoyed part I quite a lot and so I was looking forward to seeing part II, and it didn't disappoint me. It was actually quite a surprise, as I found part II to be better than part I.<br/><br/>Why? Well the story for starters, it was more clever and it had more adrenalin rush to it. There was always something really strange going on and the guys were chin-deep in trouble. I was laughing a lot through out the movie, and had my toes curling as well because of the awkwardness of some of the scenes.<br/><br/>And having the story set in hectic Bangkok was brilliant, because it really spiced up the movie quite a lot. However, I would personally have liked to see more of the seedy places that exist in Bangkok. There was too much focus on the rich and glamorous places. Not saying that they didn't use the seedy places, far from it, but they could have used it more, as Bangkok is well-known for them.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper (playing Phil), Ed Helms (playing Stu) and Zach Galifianakis (playing Alan) really have great chemistry and together they really carry the movie with excellence. Each of them make the other stand out and support the comedy of one another. They are so well-cast for these movies. And I must admit that this was the best part I have ever seen Ken Jeong (playing Mr. Chow) portray. His quirky blunt manner was so amazing in this movie.<br/><br/>Be prepared for an adventure like none other. An adventure with amnesia, drug-muling monkey and lots of fun. ""The Hangover II"" is a great comedy."

","After The Hangover which was a wicked good time I knew they would make a sequel, I mean it was a HUGE success. But I figured there was no way they could do all that again. Well I was wrong...I eat my words...they do it all again and it is fantastic fun!! The guilty pleasure returns and is just as outrageous. The key to The Hangover II is that they use the same premise almost step by step and they stick to the 'if it ain't broke'...idea. Whereas some will complain that its just the same thing all over again...it isn't! Yes it is the same premise but the new locale, return characters, and a whole new wild experience makes this hilarious!! As I stated it is easily as good, if not just a little bit better, than the original. The original was so successful because the cast had so much incredible chemistry and this works once again because of that. The three guys, plus some of the original supporting gang, come back swinging and is absolutely hilarious. The two of them together might be two of the greatest adult comedies out there.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis fit back into their roles like it was their real persona. Phil, Stu and Alan are fantastic and their chemistry together might be some of the best on screen. Cooper still fits into the cool smooth popular group leader role flawlessly. Helms' Stu is more neurotic and whiny than ever in all the best ways and the absurd and eccentric Galifianakis' Alan is as hilarious as ever. I think in the sequel Stu got some of the greatest lines and greatest moments but its a toss up. Justin Bartha once against takes a back seat in the story and is hardly around so he's barely a supporting character. I thought for sure that after Ken Jeong's portrayal of Mr. Chow in the first Hangover became a cult favorite and his popularity soared on the sitcom Community that they would severely over-use him in the sequel. Once again I was wrong and impressed that they used him just the right amount. His comedic style is loud and obnoxious and over the top and must be used sparingly and they do exactly that making his appearances downright funny!! Paul Giamatti joins the cast and is a terrific new villain to the story. He's actually more of a serious gangster but his tone and awkward look fits the film perfectly. Keep your eyes open for the perfect cameo by Hangover favorite Mike Tyson in the end of the film! <br/><br/>I said in my review of the first film I could never give the Hangover more than an 8/10 and I will say the same for the sequel. It isn't amazing film-making but it is downright hilarious, very adult, often dirty comedy. It's physical comedy, one liners, sarcasm and National Lampoon's style comedy (early National Lampoon's, like 80's when it was good and funny and gross.) Todd Phillips has spent his directorial career doing gross out/road trip type comedies (no pun intended--he directed Road Trip.) But The Hangover likely will cement his career as an epic comedy director. He manages to make over the top comedies without going over the top...he stops just on the line before its too much and then scales back and that is really a talent. Adam Sandler, and every SNL alumni out there who makes films could learn something from him. The Hangover II is more than a worthy sequel, the two films together are just absolutely hilarious and I hope and pray that they can come back and do it again but it is inevitable that eventually they will stumble and go too far or not find enough new material but until then adults everywhere who loved comedy should watch this sequel!! 8/10"

The end! No no no wait, still got the series NSFW photos of our boys going wild and high. Put it in the credits and now the movie can officially end.<br/><br/>It is not to say that Part II is bad. No, it's not. It's only bad when compared with Part I, as it does not offer the brand new style and crazy situations like Part I does. Part II is more perverse, more crazy, and more boorish.

","Despite the shameless recycling of the first movie's plot (concerning a bachelor party gone horribly wrong). The Hangover Part II proved to be just as raucously hilarious and enjoyable. This time around, it's Stew's turn to get married (to Lauren, played by an absolutely gorgeous Jamie Chung). The only thing between him and wedded bliss is an unduly hostile father-in- law, his friends' insistence on throwing him a bachelor party (which clearly worked out so well the first time around) and a sixteen hour flight to Thailand.<br/><br/>After a seemingly quiet bachelor party (a six-pack and a a couple bags of marshmallows by a small beach-side bonfire), the Wolfpack (sans Doug, who's brunching at the hotel after leaving the party early in the night) wakes up in sleazy Bangkok hotel. A quick survey of their surroundings shows Stew sporting a facial tattoo, a monkey dressed like a biker, Leslie Chow (the foul-mouthed Chinese criminal from the first movie) and the finger of Stew's future brother-in-law (Teddy). The rest of the movie details finding the rest of Teddy before Stew's wedding.<br/><br/>The most enjoyable feature of the movie was Stew himself who, in a manner rare for contemporary non-dramas (and sequels in general), is intelligently wary of bachelor parties with his friends after the events of the first movie. He adamantly declines having a bachelor party, refuses to invite Allen (until he's guilted to by a sympathetic Doug) and even goes so far as to cover his drinks with napkins and refuse to drink from unsealed containers. When Teddy first goes missing, he leads everybody to search the roof (where Doug was found at the end of the first Hangover).<br/><br/>Paul Giamatti lends his talents as an undercover Interpol agent and Mike Tyson (who's a less- than-talented vocalist) sings the apropos ""One Night in Bangkok."" Just like Part I, the movie's bisected by Stew ad-libbing a song about the events of the movie (parodying Billy Joel's ""Allen Town"").<br/><br/>Fans of the first movies should enjoy this outing equally as much while those critical of it will find Part II just as infuriating."

","If you thought things couldn't get any crazier than the first instalment of this film set in Vegas, boy are you in for a surprise with the sequel. The Hangover Part II is a comedy about four friends who travel to Thailand for their friend Stu's wedding (played by Ed Helms. The father of the bride-to-be hates his future son in law so much so that he compares him to wet rice meant for old people and little kids during his dinner celebration the night before the wedding. Although Stu insists that he doesn't want a bachelor party, his friends - Phil (Bradley Cooper), (newlywed)Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan(Zach Galifianakis) convince him to go downstairs and have a few beers on the beach in front of a campfire. The proverbial joker of the bunch Alan harbours a dangerous disliking for the bride's little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) and this time spikes the marshmallows. However everyone accidentally eats the potent brew and ends up in Bangkok for a wild night on the town which none of them can remember.<br/><br/>Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is back in this sequel and ends up in the mix upon Alan's invitation and let's just say things get a little bit off balance with some Russian gangsters, a monkey, a severed finger, a face tattoo, a drug bust by the FBI, a missing Teddy, a brawl with the police and a monk! It's a must see movie if you're into that kind of thing. When there seems to be no hope of finding Teddy, just as before this time Stu is the one that has an epiphany triggered by a glass of water and rushes back to the place where they woke up where he is hidden in the elevator. The friends are reunited and make their way back just in time for the wedding on Chow's boat where they have a crash landing. In the end, Stu wins the respect of the bride's father and Mike Tyson is back and sings at the reception which is Alan's gift to the newlyweds. The bunch finally relives the night's activities through photos found on Teddy's phone which once again they make a pact to delete after the wedding. It's an action comedy at its best, I give this movie 6 stars!"

","My girlfriend and I went to watch this movie last weekend having waited 4-5 weeks since its UK release date. We loved the first one and I can honestly say the first movie is funniest film I have ever seen. Before watching numero uno, I had no idea what the film was about, except the title of the movie was a slight give away. Having no idea of the plot, characters and whom was starring in the movie think helped in the surprise element of how good 1 actually was.<br/><br/>It was my attempt on number 2 to approach it in the same light however difficult it was from its constant trailers and marketing. However I made sure I didn't watch any trailers and when friends spoke about what they had seen before me I would put both hands over both ears and declare repetition of 'la, la, la, la la la' so no spoilers would reach me. <br/><br/>Now having seen part 2 I was surprised the film was good (not as good) but still some fantastic laugh out moments if not as many as part 1. Ed Helms for me steals the show with his amazing energy on screen and on this occasion Mr Chow played by ken jeong makes more of a contribution to the plot which is fun if not just a tad over the top.<br/><br/>Quick plot, Stu is getting married this time and is enforced to have a bachelor party of his own, however it is agreed that this would be of a much quieter affair. However, things don't actually go to plan.

","""The Hangover Part II"" is the perfect example of a movie that was specifically made to cash in on the success of its predecessor. Without any new ideas and following a very similar story, it seems that the producers wanted to play it safe and offer the audience more of the same stuff that made ""The Hangover"" the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time. What they don't understand is that the first one was successful because it was so original and creative.<br/><br/>I don't think that the film's only problem is the fact that it follows basically the same plot as the first one (other movies have done that and they still managed to be very good – ""Evil Dead II"" comes to mind, a film that is even better than the original). The simple fact is that even if this film had a totally different story it still wouldn't have been as good as ""The Hangover"" because it is just not as funny as the first film. One thing that made ""The Hangover"" a good comedy was the relationship between the three main characters. They still manage to be funny here and there are moments that will definitely make you laugh, but those moments are rather rare in a film that relies more on gross-out moments instead of trying to be particularly intelligent. The people who wrote this film simply weren't trying enough because otherwise they would have done a better job.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, Zach Galifianakis being the one that stands out. His character (Alan) is very funny and his performance alone saves this film and makes it watchable. On the other hand, I found Ken Jeong's Mr. Chow to be really annoying (he was annoying in the first film as well) and the film would have probably been better had it not been for him.<br/><br/>With the success of this film, the cast and crew will probably return for a third one. They probably won't make the same mistake and they will try to bring something different this time around. ""The Hangover Part II"" is a lazy film that borrows too much from its predecessor and doesn't quite manage to live up to its expectations.<br/><br/>My rating: 5,5/10"

","i found the first movie almost classy when i compared it to the second. the first Hangover was filled with wit, humor and funny little mistakes that were in most ways easy to solve. they were able to find their friend and in some was reverse what they had done while being drunk. in the second movie, aside from being far too similar to the first, everything was just all around bad. not in a sense of acting or production, but in the sense that they visited some very very politically touchy subjects and problems in bangkok, and actually had the nerve to make them seem funny. they also did many things that were, in every way, disgusting, immoral and irreversible! this, i felt, was just all around sad and sick. in the movie, we witness such problems as a monkey that has been trained to smoke and deal drugs, men posing as women prostitutes and strippers to earn money, lots of poverty, drug abuse and more. all of which are real, serious problems in Asia and especially in Bangkok. not only that, but so much immorality is shown and things are done that in real life would be irreversible and unforgivable. in the beginning, after they wake up, they think Mr. Chow is dead after a drug overdose, so they stuff his ""body"" into a freezer hoping no one would find out. even though that part worked out because he was actually alive, it shows the characters morals in the story! they thought he was dead and they tried to hide it which was totally immoral! also, Stu gets a tattoo, not too bad but still, irreversible and physically scaring. they take a underage boy out to drink. immoral. he has hopes of becoming a doctor and plays the cello. he then loses his finger, rendering him unable to do either. Stu, an engaged man, has sex with a man! immoral and irreversible! yes, in the first one he gets married. however, it was to a woman and he didn't sleep with her. i found it utterly wrong and disturbing how they made Alan so retarded that he has not learned his lesson from the first time to NOT drug people. very unrealistic. it all leads back to everything being his fault and obviously everyone is mad with him. in the first one he made a mistake by drugging them because the drugs were switched, but in no 2, he simply tried to drug a boy using a harmful substance because he was jealous. overall, i didn't enjoy the attempted humor nor the fact that the sequel was just to extend a hit but actually ended up destroying it. sometimes, when you hit the big-time with a great movie, leave it at the first one. don't try your luck again by making a sequel because 90percent of the time, it just ruins it."

","This movie was a pale rehash of the exact same story from the first movie. Yes, it takes place in Thailand. Yes, there are new shenanigans. No, it's not original or clever or humorous. One bright note I did get to see this movie free of charge, but there was a high price for seeing this film, it was 102 min I will never get back again. I think I got gipped. I am at a loss for words on how bland this movie was. The only character I thought was entertaining was the monkey (Crystal). I think it was Penn Jillette who said it best ""there is nothing funnier than a smoking monkey."" Unfortunately, this comedy gold is wasted on an extravagant waste of time. Don't get me wrong: I truly enjoyed watching the characters get the tar beat out of them but I don't think it was for the reasons that the filmmakers intended. If you liked the original, just re-watch it. Do not waste your time on this half-assed retread. I am obviously going to give this movie a red light, for failing to do anything more with the characters or the storyline."

Besides this line the film is a waste of 1 hour and 45 minutes. This movie is a disappointment to fans of the first movie and fails to give the audience more laughs along the way. This movie reminds me of Paranormal Activity 2 because both movies had successful originals and choose to change nothing about for the sequels, but to add more money to the production. Hangover part 2 does not improve on the stand out comedy that the first one had, but it takes away the feeling of what fans were looking for. After seeing previews of this film I knew it would not be as good as number 1, but not this poorly done. 20 minutes into the movie and you start to notice that this is Hangover 1, but in a new setting with less laughs. This movie is a carbon copy of the original and the director throws some distracting elements into the film to help make its running time. Pointless characters pop ups along the way that bring nothing fresh to the story and a plot that seem to drag along during the beginning, middle and end bring this movie down. This movie seem like it was trying too hard to try to improve on the original and fails badly at it. Todd Phillips should have just left people with the first film instead of destroying the series by making this waste of a movie. The comedy is dry, the story is not fresh, and the acting of the additional cast sours this film. There are a few spare moment laughs that get to you now and then, but nothing memorable. It's sad to say Bridesmaids delivered more comedy than this and that should tell the director a lot. If they really believe that these movies should be made into a trilogy than they must not know that making three movies with the same plot is not a trilogy. It's called wasting money on pointless sequels when the first is just fine. So far the summer has only had two great hits out the may slot and this is not one of them."

Shot by shot.<br/><br/>Okay, that all said, let's compare. Shall we?<br/><br/>Both Ocean's Twelve and The Hangover Part II's source movies began in Las Vegas, NV, U.S.A while the sequels took place in another continent. Twelve and II had superior and hilarious origins and followed up by ""how did this happen again"" premises. And (HOPEFULLY) the third segment of (the inevitable) The Hangover Part III will be the ""make-up"" movie Ocean's Thirteen was, much like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was to Temple of Doom.

Unfortunately, minimal laughter came from me. Slightly from the reoccurring character ""Mr. Chow"" (Ken Jeong) and mostly from ""Alan"" (Zach Galifianakis.)<br/><br/>I'll admit: it just wasn't that funny. I got quickly past the ""it's EXACTLY the same as part one – aside from the locale"" part. That was obvious. I was at least hoping for something new or fresh, of which, I got neither. I did get a good, and different, look at Bangkokone that the tourist industry doesn't want you to see. And believe it or not, it did serve as a good, though mediocre ""mystery"" while watching these blind fools retrace their stepsagain.<br/><br/>Okay.so we have the same gang from the original (Phil, Stu, Alan, sometimes Doug and Mr. Chow at times) who travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding along with the clichéd, disapproving father. Eh, forget that last part, cuz it's so insignificant to the synopsis of the foolish group of men who misplaces the bride's brother, Teddy (Mason Lee) during a drunken night of mischief.<br/><br/>Have you seen the superior, The Hangover? Stick with that. I did really like that original first movie. And unless you're a Die-hard fan of these characters that do, say and act the same in this inferior follow-up, EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, skip the sequel.<br/><br/>I have a feeling, The Hangover Part III will be the apology both Last Crusade and Ocean's Thirteen were.

Only two things are clear, they charge me two tickets for the same movie and there can't be anymore bachelor parties.<br/><br/>I guess I'm being rude, I laughed. But who doesn't with Alan (Zah Galifianakis)? Who has proved to be very a talented comedian. Bradley Cooper fits naturally as Phil; equally does Ed Helms as Stu. The problem is I already knew this.

So how does this one rate by itself? There were a couple of funny moments, but only a couple. I kept waiting for some truly funny things to occur, but they never did. For a location like Bangkok, they didn't really film that much of it. It's an epic, hot, sprawling city, but they could have been filming it anywhere. Where were the night markets, the myriad bars and brothels, the heat, and the people? They seem to be largely absent, markedly so if you've ever actually been to Bangkok.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper was the star of the film. The other actors were all a bit crap.

","I had heard many negative things about the 'Hangover Part II' however nonetheless I went and saw it in cinemas 2 weeks after release. The first thing that hit me was the similarity it has with the first one. It starts off with the phone call from Phil telling their friends at the wedding that they really 'f***ed up this time.' From there it follows the same course that the first one did however this didn't affect the quality of the film too much. I believe the story and 'twist' was much smarter and thought out than the first one. However some things such as the quality of the acting, repetitivity and things that just didn't make sense, really brought down the rating from a potential 8 to a 6. Yet this is a must see for all that watched the first one and hopefully Todd Phillips can give us a different and equally funny conclusion to this Trilogy. Story - 7, Some minor loopholes but a fantastic twist in the end. Screenplay - 6, funny but very similar to the first. Cinematography - 7,gives a great perspective of Bangkok and was the high of the film. Acting - 5, Not as good as the first one and at times very unrealistic especially with characters Phil and Stu.<br/><br/>In conclusion 'The Hangover Part II' lived up to expectations but was somewhat downgraded to a 6 due to some unrealistic acting, minor loopholes and repetitivity from the first film.

Most of the watchers in this case belong to the category of ""C'mon, its the hangover...its funny, what more do you expect?"" Many who would care to critique would say its not as good as the first, and a few would love it even more and watch it again. Its a fork on the road for most directors when it comes to sequels unless you are the maker of Godfather 2 and there is a reason for that. A sequel could be continuation of a web already weaved by the story or it could be using the same framework to tell a new story. The later is more difficult if you care about success and applause.<br/><br/>Hangover 2 belongs to the second category of sequels and Todd Philips has done a good job of staying true to the spirit and theme. He could easily have used his imagination to build new characters or offer new situations which you bet would have been like buying a lottery ticket. The movie is smart and sticks to a model of success created by the first hangover. For most people who complain its the same as first, they would have thrown more stones had it been a new story and a wash. At the end of the day what makes hangover worth watching is the characters we loved in one.<br/><br/>The characters use the ramp up from one and they are likable as well as funny. Zack as Alan proves its not a one hit wonder while Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms are spot on! Mr Chow could have used some sharper editing but overall the movie sticks to a tight story without aberration. Mike Tyson could have taken a pass along with some other scenes which make you wonder the sky has been reached if that is the limit.

It captured the mentality, the feel, the utter spontaneity of a ""last night out with your bachelor friend."" It correctly understood that the bachelor party brings together people who meet for the first time - a combination of high school friends, college friends, brothers and cousins - who collaborate on a common quest to celebrate the end of single life for a special person.<br/><br/>That's what made the first Hangover special. For the most part, the sequel lacked that feel. There was less celebration and much more panic. And it really missed the opportunity to bring in an additional character to truly mix things up. The brother of the bride was hardly involved, but when he was, he was too meek, too geeky, and generally a pain to watch. <br/><br/>At times this movie felt too serious for a bachelor party celebration, and at others too repetitive. It was essentially the same recipe as the first, except it was set in Bangkok and with a couple of minor changes.

If you had high hopes and hoped for this film to be as exciting as the first, then you will be highly disappointed<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" presented hilarious humor and comical situations that can get people to laugh from start to finish. The sequel, on the other hand, presented darker and exploited humor that didn't deliver the laugh out loud moments that its predecessor presented. Personally, it felt like the main jokes were re-used from the previous film and the new jokes were scrap ideas that didn't make it to the final cut of the first ""Hangover."" The most that I have done when it comes to laughing was chuckling and scoffing a few times. The humor and situations that these characters have to go through again really didn't live up to my expectations and was very weak.<br/><br/>When it comes to the storyline, there is nothing very special about it and that it is an exact replica of the first story. Basically, the characters get hungover and go through a similar concept only in a different area. There were some fun moments in this film, but overall, the film didn't have that fun factor that you've seen in the first film; not that it was boring or anything, this film didn't deliver the thrill and excitement that was delivered in the last hungover experience. The first film had that mystery on where Doug was, for the person that gets lost in this film, you can probably figure it out easily. Everything was predictable and ended up not having that surprise, especially toward the final sequence.<br/><br/>Everyone from the bachelor party returns again and once again they performed comically. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis returned once again as the three amigos getting hungover and going through a day of carnage of what they have done, finding their friend. However, their comedic performances were not enough to make the film funny. Since Doug wasn't the one getting lost this time, it would have been nice to see him getting hungover and go through the same situation; however, once again, he is left out of the action. Ken Jeong returns as Leslie Chow, the gangster from the first film. He had some funny moments, but at the same time, he had annoying parts. His character didn't have an exact point in the film, felt like he was added for comedy purposes. Other than that, the other cast members were good as their roles.<br/><br/>Not only is this film a disappointment, but the film presented the same concepts and identical situations, only to be set at a different location. Unfunny humor, comedic performances, barely had any fun moments and a storyline that wasn't special. This is a sequel that should have not been made."

Really? ,""Inspiring fear"", one star? Yep, frightening a movie this bad is rated so high but I've been thinking about that. Decent God fearing humans didn't see ""Hangover"" much less ""Hangover 2"" our best and brightest can't review this movie. What does that make me, never mind. Anyway plenty of us (yes us as in me too) didn't like ""Hangover"" they knew not to see ""Hangover 2"" they can't write a review. It got a lot of really deserved horrible reviews. Still 6.6 stars who (or what?) wrote positive reviews? Corruption! They're paying people for favorable reviews or no wait evil? This is one mean spirited movie. STOP! It's just a movie! The production isn't horrible. Is one star too low? Nope I'm going with one star and lousy... Or awful... or waste! It's a waste. Did someone already say that? Sorry my bad never mind."

","My feelings about this movie might have been because of how much I loved the Hangover. But... I would rather actually BE hung over than be subjected again to the Hangover II. I consider this not only one of the most disappointing sequels ever made, but I consider it to be on a par with Ishtar as one of the worst A-list MOVIES ever made. The Hangover II was a flat-out disaster, a mere shadow of the first movie. It had no inspiration, no comedic writing, no subtlety. The plot was artificially contrived to get the people - ALL the people back together again for a cash-out. The only laughs are from grossness and shocks; some of the humor is just sick. It's not believable, and just plain not funny. There was not a second of this movie that didn't have SELLOUT written all over it. If I had seen it in the theater, I might have actually walked out. I actually feel a little bit less respect for each of the otherwise excellent actors in this movie, and I wonder if it hasn't actually hurt the career of Zach Galfinaikis."

","The simple fact is, if I could vote 0/10 for this film I would. I thought the Hangover Part 1 was quite bad, but had some funny moments so I thought I'd give Hangover Part 2 a chance... Oh, how foolish. <br/><br/>This film has the SAME concept as the original with the added benefit of being dreadfully written. If there was ever a film where they went 'Hey, the first one made a fair whack of money. Lets rush out a second without writing a decent script for a pay day' then this is that film. Saddest part is it was a smash at box office which makes me question people's senses of humour if this is funny to them.<br/><br/>In the duration of the full film I laughed once, and it wasn't even a real laugh, it was more of a cringe worthy laugh. The acting is... *thinks of a non-offensive word* ...appalling. The whole scenario of which is film is based is retarded. The script should of been burnt.<br/><br/>I will say one thing that this movie did do well at... And that is having people use their hard earned money to watch this garbage.

","I have loved film all my life and my appreciation of motion pictures as an art form has been a very important part of who I am. I have also always been liberal and open minded in my approach to that art form, seldom seeing in a film nothing of value. However, I left the theater after experiencing The Hangover, Part II, with something within myself profoundly changed. It was as if I had personally witnessed a crime against humanity, a savage act against basic human decency that was not simply depicted in the film but was the very film itself. Unlike the funny fluff of The Hangover, the empty headed nonsense that caused chuckles galore in theaters across the world, Part II is a dark and sinister expression of pure nihilism that assaults the essence of the soul. There are no words to describe how I was affected as I stumbled alone into the night at the conclusion of what was a violation of every fiber of my being. Those responsible for this motion picture not only lack even a small shred of morality, they actively conspired to record images that can never be forgotten once inflicted upon the innocent viewer. No one in their right mind would seek out the indescribable suffering endured by those who have survived The Hangover, Part II, even the most jaded masochist. Perhaps a truly sick mind, the sort that imagined this film and managed to corrupt mankind with what they produced, would find their sociopathic nature enriched by seeing it. To those who even slightly embrace the concept of their personal humanity and have no desire to have violence done to their very being, let this review be a warning. What is suggested to be a comedic follow-up to The Hangover is nothing of the kind. In reality, it is something so terrible that audience members will be haunted by what they have seen for the rest of the lives, if they still wish to continue living after their experience of The Hangover, Part II. I only wish I had read a review by one of this films hapless victims prior to subjecting myself to the repugnant power of such a vicious monstrosity."

","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>"" When a monkey nibbles on a penis, it's funny in any language."" That's just an example of the typical one-liners found in The Hangover Part II, and no, this film is not funny in any language at all. ( Well, maybe in Yiddish. )<br/><br/>This film hit the trifecta for me: I laughed a total of three times, and two of those were due to a talented imp of a monkey named Crystal. This mostly humorless sequel to the original hit comedy franchise follows its same tired formula ad nauseam. Scene for scene is so smugly similar to the series' first successful film that any moviegoer might easily get confused, except this one cranks up the raunch factor and sprinkles in more nudity and isn't remotely as funny as the 2009 version.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II is poorly directed by Todd Philips who was more effective with his original version. The film boasts lousy production values and one of the worst renditions of One Night in Bangkok that has ever been recorded. The writing discredit goes to five writers this time around and they shall remain nameless as to not further embarrass their family or friends, ( although the director is one of them and needs to be held accountable for his lack of finesse and management skills with the cast and crew in both areas of production. To say that he is a double threat gives new meaning to the term. ). This latest script is so disappointing and boring compared to the other film. The forerunner, at least, provided genuine laughs back then with its earlier unique premise and only had two different scribes for that surprising box office success. <br/><br/>The same ole boys are back, with decidedly mixed results. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis as Phil, Stu, and Alan disrespectively, of course. This trio of misfits seems at odds from the start and their interactions now are mostly shrill and quite routine. Its faithful young audiences may have come to accept their roles and and expect their predictable interaction as they did before: Phil is the leading man or ringleader in charge of the shenanigans, Stu is the hapless victim, and Alan is the crazy wiseguy type providing comic relief. ( Justin Bartha as Doug is along for the ride and he again disappears before all hell breaks loose in Bangkok, the scene of the crime / wedding. ) I expected more from these talented actors. <br/><br/>Again, they awaken from a stupor, not knowing what went on the previous night and slowly piece together the mystery while searching for the bride's missing brother. Ken Jeong also returns as the highly volatile Mr. Chow and he wears out his welcome very fast. Incidents occur that have more long lasting repercussions to the boys, yet no one seems to acknowledge that problem throughout the film. In fact, some of the results from their hangover are glossed over and quickly explained in the film's end credits. I guess it's too much work to incorporate those details into the formulaic plot.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for The Hangover Part II to be over. It's pretty sad when the pet monkey outshines the monkeyshines perpetrated by the film's human cast. Hopefully, what happens in Bangkok will stay there permanently. However, I can already smell the stench of the next installment being planned. I shall not be attending. GRADE: C-"
"thekyles99","3","2","5","5 June 2011"," If you put a coat on a dog isn't it the same dog?
","Well this is one time i should've listened to the other critics, i knew going into seeing this that it was the Hangover part 2 hence the some of the similar things that occurred in the first one would re-occur in the second..I didn't realize all of them would re-occur! My god its like they took the first instalment and just put a fresh coat of paint on it and moved it to an exotic locale to get people into the seats. The first one was hilarious, so that being said will be enough to make this instalment some money although i highly doubt that anyone will bother if they decide to make a 3rd as they no longer have their element of surprise and i wouldn't be surprised if it goes straight to DVD rental. That being said, this movie has some funny moments although far and between as we see that Stu (Ed Helms) the dentist is the one getting married this time round and his fiancée's family reside in beautiful Thailand. Due to the horrors that occurred during Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, he has decided he wants his wedding nice and quiet and has decided not to invite anyone. Apon hearing that Phil (Bradley Cooper) guilts him to inviting all his buddies including Allan (Zack Galafinakis) They all arrive and everything looks swell with even Stu starting to chill out by the fire on the beach as all the buddies are together. Stu says you know what? Sorry for not wanting you guys to come this is really nice. Flash to the next morning and the boys are all waking up with huge heads and that feeling of 'not again!' Hence the title it's time for Hangover 2. My biggest problem is, and yes i know that its title is the second hangover however i expected at least some new ideas. The laughs are there however nowhere near the breath taking laughter that i exhumed upon seeing the original. So if you are a fan of the original i say you have been warned"

","I have been in theater withdrawal - haven't been to a movie in a couple of weeks - so, ventured out today to see ""The Hangover part 2"".<br/><br/>I really don't have to provide a summary for this film - substitute: Bride's younger brother for groom, monkey for tiger, Bangkok for Las Vegas and you basically know the rest (if you saw ""The Hangover""). There are some very funny scenes in this movie and it was worth the $5 matinée price - but I wouldn't pay full price for basically the same movie I saw in 2009. As usual with sequels - the original movie was definitely the better of the two.<br/><br/>I am going to guess we can expect a 3rd edition of this movie - maybe the creators of film series hope the audiences are like Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis in that we will all have total memory loss and shell out our hard earned cash to see the wolf pack in another fine mess.<br/><br/>I recommend you wait for on-demand or Netflix or your local video store - or like me, a matinée."

","I didn't have high expectations when I went to go see this, but I assumed it would be as good as the first one or even similar. This was just a waste of a movie. I really wanted to get into it and laugh. The first Hangover was a great idea for a movie and they put all the weird and messed up things in there and really pushed the envelope. So they tried to go over the top of the last movie. Doing this made it seem cartoonish. And when you find out what caused them to blackout you will certainly want your money back. One of the weakest excuses for a plot when your whole movie is based on that premise. Bridesmaids was much funnier and if you are going on a date or just out with some friends I would suggest that to be a much better idea."

","Todd Phillip's sequel to his successfully original The Hangover has a lot of the same situations as the first. That being said, it is still well worth going to see.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II starts off the same way. Phil is on the phone with Doug's wife Tracy and tells her that they will not be able to do the wedding. This time around it's Stu who is getting married in Thailand. While still in Los Angeles, Stu decides that their breakfast at an IHOP is going to be his bachelor party because he does not a repeat of what happened in Vegas. Since Stu's announcement of his plan to marry his new girlfriend Lauren, Alan has been hoping to get an invite, but to no avail. Stu reluctantly invites Alan.<br/><br/>Two days before the big wedding, Lauren's father has shown that he hates Stu. Alan feels intimidated about Lauren's brother Teddy, who Alan feels will steal his friends. They each have one beer before all hell breaks loose in Bangkok.<br/><br/>Again, we have a situation in Bangkok just like in Vegas. The guys went through a crazy night taking on Bangkok and do not remember what they did. Now it's up to them to figure out what they did and to find Teddy, who is the one that went missing.<br/><br/>If you love the original, this one is still just as entertaining. There are hilarious situations involving Stu's Mike Tyson tattoo, a drug dealing monkey, a monk, and Mr. Chow.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper has made Phil into a much stronger leader in this one. While he was great in the first film, he shows how well he works with his friends. Ed Helms has also made Stu into a much stronger character. Helms makes Stu excellent at his ability to not be afraid of showing how he feels. Zach Galifianakis again makes Alan to be one of the craziest and most unique people out there. The three show that they have great chemistry as they walk through the streets of Bangkok.<br/><br/>In a brief but awesome supporting role, Paul Giamatti shows up in the film as an INTERPOL agent disguised as a mob boss who is after Mr. Chow. Giamatti proves his excellence in whatever role he is given. At first, I really believed that he could be a mob boss.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed seeing Mike Tyson return at the end of the movie for another awesome cameo. What I like best about this film is how director Todd Phillips makes this film a similar story to the first one, but set in another city, with some different situations. Phillips has done well at making a true sequel. I am looking forward to whatever movie Mr. Phillips has coming out next."

","In this awesome continuation of the fun comedy film hangover, we're thrown out into the second adventure of the four ""ordinary"" guys Phil, Stu, Alan and Doug. This time the action takes place in Bangkok, which is an awesome location, because it is like the Asian version of Las Vegas. Further more we do not only have the return of ""The Wolf pack"", but also a lot of other known faces apply a nice glance to the movie, like for instance Tracy (Doug's wife), Mr. Chow (The villain from the first movie now actually becomes kind of a friend to help them), Mike Tyson (In the end) and more... The movie is quite good, because it keeps the same story and basics from the first movie and has changed the location and some of the gags in it. So to all the guys, who say that the gags are the same old ones from the first, this isn't quite true: For example the tiger in their apartment has been replaced by a cigarette-smoking monkey.

In fact, at some points I vowed not to go and see it, afraid I might just be wasting my money. However, with all my closest friends going to see it as a group as part of a night out, I couldn't help myself and decided to watch the movie.<br/><br/>As you can guess my expectations were fairly low - ""I just hope it's better than the first one... but than again, anything is"". From the very beginning it became obvious that the whole storyline is basically a copy of the storyline from the first Hangover, with a few changes. From the very beginning though, I seemed to be the person laughing the most. After a horrible, lazy performance in the first one, Zach Galifianakis excelled himself in The Hangover Part 2 - 'My uncle Roger once saw an albino polar bear', or 'Asiatic people', as well as pretty much every single other line of his in the movie are fulfilled with hilarity and amusement. The whole idea of Zach, or Alan, hating Teddy from the moment he met him was also incredibly funny.<br/><br/>That being said, the other characters - Phil and Stu, played excellently by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms, are also fantastically hilarious. Justin Bartha's Doug character is rarely seen in the movie which is a tad disappointing as it seems that adding him to the group would make the movie even funnier.<br/><br/>There is hardly anything that I could complain about when it comes to The Hangover Part II.

","Let's begin by stipulating that the original film - The Hangover - is a lovely tale of prototypical male debauchery, caked in copious volumes of bodily fluids, and told with belly-aching comedic genius. That said, this thing - its snot-nosed sibling, the tellingly-named The Hangover Part II - stokes our worst fears about Hollywood, from our vague notions of which ideologies govern studio decisions right down to our presumptions that many of our adored actors will carelessly sacrifice their bodies of work to squeeze gold from a clear-cut lemon.<br/><br/>Despite our hopes that the sequel would be made bulletproof by its returning cast, The Hangover Part II is Really That Bad. Consumed in a living room full of its prototypical target audience members - GenX white males - not a outward chuckle or guffaw was heard until after the one-hour mark. Finishing the film then led to a few hours of quiet group anger and subsequent cool-down, as everyone bearing witness will surely want those lost hours back at end-of-life.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II presents the emerging reality that any attempts at a well-crafted sequel - equal in ambition to the first - are often never taken up, and instead are preemptively discarded in favor of a poorly-executed but expedient, get-it-while-its-hot shadow of its previous self."

Instead one should make other films.<br/><br/>This film is pretty much a repeat of the first but worse in all aspects: the execution suffered and the director was only trying to repeat what was already done in the first time.

","We've been told before to touch not the things that are without fault. Altering that which is already awesome could be a risky act, but repeating it could be even worse, because it shows no diligence and bravery. ""The Hangover Part II"" resembles its 2009 predecessor so much that it's probably more appropriate to regard it as a remake, than as a sequel.<br/><br/>The extent of the similarity between the two ""Hangover"" movies suggests hungry wallets for its makers. When the script is hurried, the shooting will be also. Paychecks are rewarded earlier, and audiences are left to watch a meaner, dirtier, and more offensive version of the same movie. There is a significant increase in violence, coarse language, and public display of privates. To warn viewers that are more sensitive, I would specify which organs to expect, but the setting of the film is Thailand, and if there's one thing I learned, it's that we can never be sure of what we see.<br/><br/>The setting is in Thailand because Stu's fiancée, Lauren, is from that country, and her parents wish that the wedding is to be held there. Phil, Alan and Doug join Stu, which later leads to a beer at a beach with Lauren's little brother, Teddy. The next morning they uhm forget it. You know the drill.

"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","2","22 November 2011"," Just as good and fun, if not better and funnier than the first.
","Of course I really liked ""The Hangover"" but it was not a movie without its flaws and I still had some problems with it. Surprisingly enough I have far less complaints about its sequel. Yes, I know I'm a minority on this but I actually liked ""The Hangover Part II"" better than the first movie.<br/><br/>Thing most people seem to have problems with is that this movie is nothing more than a rehash of the first movie. But actually I have to really disagree on this. It's using the same concept, of waking up at a strange place, after a wild night, of which none of the main characters remember anything of. But clearly a lot had happened, since there suddenly is a monkey in the room, a finger in a ice bucket, one of the guys has a tattoo on his face, the other is suddenly bald, one of their friends has gone missing and Mr. Chow somehow ended up in the room as well. So it's using the same sort of concept and setup as the first movie but how would it had been a Hangover movie if it was using a totally different concept? And really, just because it's using the same concept that doesn't of course mean that all of the situations, funny moments and characters are all the same as well. On the contrary, ""The Hangover Part II"" has plenty of originality going for it and I actually think it's a better written and constructed movie than the first one.<br/><br/>A problem I had with the first movie was that things felt somewhat forced and all happened very randomly. It was as if they were having a great main premise but they just didn't really knew how to use it. It felt to me as if they were making up stuff with its script as it went along but their was not one clear, whole, finished idea behind of from the start. This movie obviously had an idea behind it from the start and everything happens for a reason in its story. It makes the movie flow more pleasantly and naturally.<br/><br/>One of the things I also liked better in this one were its settings. It's surprising but I actually liked the Bangkok settings better than the Las Vegas ones of the first movie. Perhaps its because it's a strange and totally different country, in which the main characters are totally strangers. They don't speak the language, don't know the customs and get into all sorts of different problems because of that.<br/><br/>And yes, all of the problems they maneuver themselves into are some pretty hilarious and well written ones. Like I said, everything happens for a reason and is connected to each other. Something that might seem very random will eventually come back in the story and play a significant part in it. It's a movie that made me laugh from basically start till finish.<br/><br/>One of the things that makes these movies such great and effective ones are its main characters. They are really convincing as real life, middle aged, buddies and actually also somewhat easy to relate to, despite them being in some unusual situations and also doing some often highly unusual stuff. They are the true driving force behind these movies.<br/><br/>Also the thing that makes them work out so well is because they are being played by some great actors. This is a big difference with most other comedies, in which acting skills seem to be often secondary. You have to sort of feel for Justin Bartha though. In the first movie he spend most of the time off screen and in this movie he also isn't involved with any of the adventures and craziness, while he still actually is a member of 'the wolf-pack'. The first movie launched Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis to stardom but who will recognize Justin Bartha when he's walking down the street? This sequel won't change anything about that.<br/><br/>So all in all, a better written, better made and even more fun sequel. Yes, I'm probably crazy but I actually liked this movie better than the first ""The Hangover"".<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"rahilsp","8","1","2","16 August 2011"," All I want from a comedy
","I've heard many people slate this film for being too similar to ""The Hangover"". OK, many things were the same (i.e. being set just before a wedding and events turning out badly) but for me this didn't retract from the film. It was still as good as the original, possibly even better in my opinion.<br/><br/>As a 16 year old teenager this ticked all the boxes for me. The characters were very funny, especially Alan (Zach Galifianakis) who made me laugh out loud on several occasions. He was given most of the witty lines and Zach's innocent and childish portrayal of Alan over the two films has propelled him to a cult status. The other characters also held their own; Mr. Chow(Ken Jeong)who I was glad to see again was as always a good laugh. Both Stu (Ed Helms) and Phil (Bradley Cooper) were very good in their separate ways as well.<br/><br/>The plot also lived up to my expectations. As I've already said it was similar to the original, the main difference that the gang are in Bangkok, not Vegas. However, it was still entertaining and intriguing with many twists. If anything, this time round their adventure was even better and ludicrous.<br/><br/>This is a must see for all comedy fans."

","I was surprised how much I actually liked the first movie. I'm just glad I didn't pay full price to see this one. A couple of months ago my little brother was in town and we were going to see a movie: either this or X-Men First Class. I told him we could see this if he paid. We saw X-Men. I'm glad we did. I finally saw the Hangover part Two last night thinking I could possibly be surprised again (in a good way) I was not. This movie is raunchier than the first one, but no where near as funny. The new characters of Lauren and Teddy were likable enough, but trying to hit all of the funniest plot points from the first film was annoying, forced, and boring. Tracy was somewhat annoying in this in that she begged Doug to talk Stu into inviting Alan to his wedding then is all ""what is wrong with you three"" Um nothing. It's your seriously disturbed brother you insisted on inviting. Alan's antics were somewhat funny in the first film, but he seriously crossed the line in the second when his actions put people in danger and he was threatening people with violence. Seriously the guy needs to be put in a mental ward. He could have killed Teddy when he was deliberately trying to drug him so he could have Stu, Phil, and Doug to himself for the weekend. And Teddy, Stu and the rest of the family weren't the least bit upset that a monkey had his finger? What about Alan getting Chow involved? An international criminal who tried to kill them in the first movie? Why did Tracy come to get Doug, but Lauren didn't come to get Stu and Teddy? And Stu is okay with all this in the end? I liked him embracing the fact that he has a ""dark side"" and standing up to his father-in-law, that is the only element from the first movie worth trying to repeat. Phil's actions are disturbing as well: wanting Stu to lie to Teddy's family about what happened to him. Guys doing a bunch of stupid crap while drunk is funny. Guys doing criminal activity while not drunk is not funny. If Stu and Doug have any brains, they will ditch Phil and Alan. I really hope they don't make a third movie like Todd Phillips seems to be considering. It felt like the characters were sleepwalking from plot point to plot point in this film. It just didn't have the flow or delivery of the first. Ed Helms and the others can make better use of their time and their talents. The first film made them household names, but they shouldn't let crappy sequels ruin their careers."

","The Wolfpack is back! And are they ever!! Comedy sequels make it tough to get back to the level of excitement you remember from the first, when it was new and uncharted. If it's great, you never look down at your watch until it's over; and then you want an hour more! You want to view it again to get all of the lines you may have missed. The first Hangover did that to me. When the second one was announced I had the anticipation of a little kid and the great fear that it would ruin everything the first one did.<br/><br/>Hangover 2 brought the Pack, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) to the exotic Bangkok, Thailand for Stu's nuptials. Without giving away any of the story, director Todd Phillips worked off of the cast's chemistry and expanded upon it. You can tell in the movie that there are several points of improvisation. Phillips uses the full screen and back shots to entertain you, so pay attention. For a comedy, the cinematography was very well done and timely. Really, if you don't pay attention to the full screen, you will miss a lot in this movie. With the scene changes and camera angles, you can tell that this is not a low budget comedy thrown together to appease the demand for another Hangover. This movie is extremely crude and not something I am watching with my mother. Get ready for HUGE shock factor.<br/><br/>I would say the movie is more of remake with changes than a sequel; but when you have a great comedy isn't that what you are trying to get out of the final product? This movie is never going to get an Oscar, but it should get an MTV Movie Award. By far the funniest movie of the year and very well done.

It was a predicable all round funny movie and I would definitely watch it again but only after I have watched number one first.

","Hard to write a full review for this movie, as so many other reviews summed it up very nicely. If you loved the original movie you will like this, but not as much. If the first wowed you, then this will satiate you a little bit, but you will leave the screen feeling hungry and a little short-changed. The main problem being the similarities to the first one. There were some very funny moments, some shocking, but the viewer does feel that perhaps the film could have been filmed in a different manner to the first, perhaps following the guys through the whole night - crazy and messed up and it ending in a crazy and messed up fashion not a picture perfect wedding on a Thai beach. The writers will really have to try and come up with a different concept for Hangover III, I have no doubt there will be one as this has coined a quarter of a billion already, so the popularity remains. I remember watching the first movie and laughing my head off, this time it was polite chuckles rather than full guffaws. I hope No 3, isn't embarrassed titters. Overall, a 6 for a good effort but strayed close to mediocre."
"blacklist-1","6","1","2","15 July 2011"," A fun sequel, but we've seen it all before.
","The Hangover was an unexpected hit for audiences and film critics alike even with typical American gross out comedy humour we come to associate with director Todd Phillips previously responsible for comedies such as Due Date (which was terrible), Old School (which wasn't bad) and Road-trip (an absolute gem of a film that despite being gross out as I'm not generally a fan of these types, it's an old favourite I've watched for so many years, I don't mind and I couldn't hate it even if I tried. Also as they're students, in a way you expected them to do act like that, and yes I know it's a stereotype and that not all students act like it but still these ones can get away with it, so it's genuinely funny as a result). The reason I loved The Hangover was because despite the gross out humour the characters became likable in their befuddlement and they do grow up at the end of the movie. Not to mention the script was extremely inventive, with just when you thought things for the group in Vegas couldn't get any worse it did making it hilariously catastrophic. The sequel sets the premise as the same as the first one where the same group Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) jet to Thailand for their friend Stu's weeding to future wife Lauren (Jamie Chung). <br/><br/>The night before against their better judgement, the guys go to party along with Lauren's sixteen year old cousin Teddy (Mason Lee) and predictably the next morning wake up (apart from Doug who left to go back to the hotel earlier in the evening) with no idea where they are with Teddy missing and joined by their old friend from Vegas the Chinese mobster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). So Phil, Stu and Alan have to again frantically rush around trying to piece the clues together of what happened and find where Teddy is before Stu's wedding starts. <br/><br/>As reiterated by previous reviewers The Hangover Part II is pretty much exactly the same as is predecessor with the same structure of the story and the similar events that happen to them, like in the first one the guys had to contend with the tiger but now it's a monkey. The jokes are pretty much the same with no comedic originality, so it is formulaic and does become a bit tiresome at moments. It's a pity that Todd Phillips has stuck to the same formula, though I can see why he would as it was such a success in the first one. But part II just goes through the motions.<br/><br/>Saying that the acting is good from the main cast with great cameos from Mike Tyson, Mr. Chow and Kingsley (Paul Giamatti), there is a comfortable familiarity with the main characters and there were enough laughs and chuckles that kept me entertained from start to finish. But they shouldn't commission a third part as they would be pushing it. Part II is a fun sequel and it's worth seeing if your a fan of the first one, but don't expect nothing new as we have seen it all before."

Her boyfriend let me grill her, which was even more amusing. If you are easily offended, then please keep your ass at home. This movie is not for you.

It was a total shock, from start to end - brilliantly conceived, wildly imaginative and wonderfully told - the movie is probably going to be one of the funniest comedies of all time.<br/><br/>So how do you improve on that ? How do you beat that ? The answer is, ""You Don't !"". But the fans of the first hangover wanted more, tens of thousands wanted a sequel, so the producers had to do something - and anything that fell short of the original would like detract from the original.<br/><br/>So, instead of writing a new story - why not take the exact same story, and just film it in a different location ? And thats what Hangover Part 2 is - the same story, with enough changes to make it somewhat different from the original - and with a few new jokes to keep the fans wanting more.<br/><br/>And rather than quench our thirst, we're now all wanting a Hangover part 3.

","The sequel to the hit comedy The Hangover is a sometimes disturbing, but often funny film. Director Tod Phillips takes his characters to Bangkok this time; to celebrate the wedding of Stu (played by Ed Helms), the dentist from the first film. The movie gets repetitive at times, but it serves as an enjoyable summer comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially a repeat of the first movie with the three guys waking up in a hotel room, not knowing what happened the night before. This time, Stu's soon-to-be brother in law has gone missing, leaving nothing behind except his finger. The movie has Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, and Zach Galifinakis running through the streets of Bangkok looking for the brother and trying to find out why Stu has a Mike Tyson tattoo on his face.<br/><br/>The movie is very funny. There are some extremely disturbing moments that are there for no reason than to simply out do the original film, but other moments are genuinely hilarious. The Asian drug lord from the first film, Chow, shows up, and the guys search the city to find their friend, with no avail except the ominous answer: ""Bangkok has him now"".<br/><br/>With a new team of scriptwriters, The Hangover Part II spends far too much time referencing the original. It's as if they don't believe the audience ever saw the first one. And the way the characters talk about their Vegas trip serves as a thinly veiled reminder of how good everyone thought The Hangover was. The parallels between this movie and the first are not really fun; it just seems that the script writers took the easy way out. It's when the film goes off in new directions (going to a monastery, the cameo by Paul Giamatti) that really get the laughs.<br/><br/>Although the movie suffers from major nostalgia of the first installment, many moments of The Hangover Part II are funny enough to keep things interesting. Director Tod Phillips plans on making a third film in this series, and one can only hope the plot won't be so repetitive.

For me, the answer is a resounding ""No!"" There are far more promising avenues to explore with the ""Wolf Pack"" but all they give us here is a rehash of a better film. Putting aside the juvenile humor that is uneven, all that's left is a woefully underwritten motion picture that spends all it's time as a rehash before taking an ill-advised detour into mawkish sentimentality."

","In life the rule is, if at first you don't succeed, then try, try again. In Hollywood the rule is, if something works once replicate it again and again until the life is sucked out of it! By this I mean movies, in this case ""The Hangover"" which was one the best comedies I had seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I believed then, like 2 years ago when the original came out, that this movie should NOT have a sequel, a belief I still cling to...though I guess I might be in the minority on that one. Does Hollywood listen to movie fans who these days crave for some original concepts, ideas, anything besides sequels and re-boots? The short answer: of course not! The long answer...well I don't have time for it.<br/><br/>I could spend time discussing what worked in the first movie that does not work in this one, but what would be the point?! I only want to say that the joy-de-vivre, the excitement and the craziness of the original are lacking here by enlarge. ""The Hangover Part II"" has its moments definitely, but too many times it feels hollow and forced...<br/><br/>That is the best I could come up with for an explanation as to why I was not particularly taken with it...it is not completely awful but by then end I was...meh! If you want to see a better, funnier comedy, my advice would be to go and see ""Bridesmaids"", a movie that hits all the notes that ""The Hangover Part II"" does not! ""Bridesmaids"" works on all cylinders, that is until the powers that be decide to make another ten sequels!"
"rparham","7","1","2","5 June 2011"," Here comes the new film, same as the old film
","There are a lot phrases you could apply to The Hangover, Part II. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" comes to mind as to what was possibly at the forefront of director and co-writer Todd Phillips thoughts when he was assembling The Hangover, Part II, because if there is one thing you cannot accuse the sequel to the surprise comedy hit of 2009 of being, its original. The Hangover, Part II is a near complete rehash of the first entry, just with different locales and certain individual situations. That doesn't necessarily mean it isn't funny, but some of the sheen of the first film wears off the second time around.<br/><br/>The Hangover, Part II finds buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galafinakis) in Thailand to attend Stu's pending nuptials 2 years after the events of the first film. Stu, not interested in being involved in a repeat of the events of Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, has decided to eschew that traditional pre- wedding event for a simple drink on the beach with his friends and his bride to be's brother, Teddy (Mason Lee). The next morning, the trio find themselves passed out in a seedy Bangkok hotel with a trained monkey, a pounding hangover, a visitor in the form of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), the criminal gang leader from the first film, and Teddy nowhere to be found. In short order, Phil, Stu and Alan are prowling the streets of Thailand in search of Teddy via clues they pick up along the way as to the events from the prior evening. The search takes them to a tattoo parlor, a club in a significant state of disrepair, a strip club with ""interesting"" employees and a Buhddist temple, with a threat hanging over their heads from a Thailand based crime boss (Paul Giamatti) to deliver some information for a bank transfer the next morning or they will never see Teddy again.<br/><br/>While it is not unheard of for sequels to films that seemed like a one- shot to try to replicate what made the first film successful, I can rarely think of one that almost completely remakes the original like The Hangover, Part II. Every significant plot arc, story development and twist is lifted wholesale from the first film. If you are really familiar with the first film, I can't see where it wouldn't be impossible for you to guess almost every major event that is going to occur in The Hangover, Part II and end up being correct. We are treated to the characters reacting in very similar manners to the events in the same way as the first film: Stu with complete, sheer bewilderment, Phil with a constant air of disbelief how things can keep getting so bad, and Alan with a degree of detached amusement. The only real element that is a bit different this time is that they friends are in communication via cell phone with Doug, who had decided to turn in early the night they were drinking. It's a way for the creators to keep Bartha involved to some extent without interfering with the trio dynamic that worked for the first film, I suppose.<br/><br/>So, the real question becomes, is the Hangover, Part II funny? Well, yes, it is. Despite the familiarity of the situation in the broad strokes, the individual segments prove to have some decent humor to them throughout. One scene in particular, set at the aforementioned strip club, left me roaring in laughter. Many of the other outrageous moments provide more than just a chuckle, and a chase sequence in the latter part of the film is about as engaging as one in any action movie. Some of the reason the two Hangover films work at all is that, despite the fact that two-thirds of the main trio are rather reprehensible people, you can't help but imagine what it would be like to be in that situation and therefore you have some degree of investment in seeing them attempt to navigate themselves out of this mire they have become trapped in.<br/><br/>As mentioned previously, there isn't a lot different to these characters in general. Phil is the debaucherous friend who is seemingly in a search of a good time to shake off the normalcy in his life otherwise. Stu is a straight arrow who is put face to face with his ""dark side"". And Alan is a clueless social misfit whose idea of getting his friends to have a good time is to drug them with paralyzers and hallucinogens. The actors sell their roles fairly well, especially, once again, Galafinakis, and are supported by Jeong as the subtly homosexual Mr. Chow, who still doesn't seem to be afraid to bare himself (entirely) to the audience. Giamatti, while scenery chewing with the best, can graciously be referred to as giving a ""cameo"" in the film considering his very limited screen time.<br/><br/>The Hangover, Part II's unoriginality once again spills over to its ""moral message"", what little there is of one, and it is once again exclusively directed at the character of Stu. In the first film, he was able to give a comeuppance to his fiancé in a rather amusing, albeit crowd pleasing way. In Part II, there is a similar dynamic with a different character, but this time the moments where Stu must come into his own don't really work, and seem cheesy and, frankly, a bit uncomfortable and unbelievable.<br/><br/>So, when all is said and done, should you see The Hangover, Part II? I cannot deny that I laughed at it more often than not once it got going for the most part, but not to the degree I enjoyed the first film. However, it is also difficult to overlook the complete lack of originality on display in the film, so The Hangover, Part II proves a mixed bag, and one that receives a mild recommendation from me."
"troy-manatunga","6","1","2","5 June 2011"," had there not been a 1st it would have been brilliant
","Had there not been ""The Hangover"" in 2009 how would the audience have reacted to the ""The Hangover 2""? I presume with arms wide open. I would have loved it and I would have said that it is by far one the best fast paced comedies of its kind. However this is not the same when you are a sequel! Its always a tough challenge to any director, writer or even the actors when patching a sequel. Especially if the 1st installment was a worldwide crazy hit and was accepted into our hearts and cherished dearly for us ""The Hangover"" fans. I will write this off with my verdict for a change. I scored tickets with the greatest difficulty and managed a screening in Dubai. Whatever said and done even after a week since its premier, tickets were selling of so fast even though it was on multiple screens. I walked out very happy. I found the movie funny, I found entertaining (Apart from a few scenes that were cut off from the censorship) it was almost as good as the first. But had there not been a 1st it would have been brilliant. So for starters, if you have not yet watched it, cancel all your most valued appointments and go score some tickets and watch how the wolf pack royally screws up in beautiful Thailand!<br/><br/>It's Stus' time for marriage this time round; seems like this guy is like a rabbit, getting a round pretty fast and loves the ladies. The Wolf pack heads on down to Thailand for the wedding and since they had all learnt their lesson in Las Vegas, everyone decided to take it easy on the whole bachelors party and settled down for one beer each. This is all the synopsis I can spare, anything more than that , you have to watch it!<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bratha & Zach Galifianakis brings down the roof with there outstanding performances. They are equally supported by Ken Jeong & Mason Lee. These few men truly bring Thailand and Bangkok and the chaos to our feet. I am so glad that none of the original cast was replaced or none of the characters were removed. It would have been better is Justin Bartha got more screen time, either way it worked. Pulling the acting off to meet the heights of the 2009 release or in my opinion even better than the 2009 these men truly are a gifted bunch with a methodical approach to the performances. Although some of the humorous moments were always with Zach's lines, the interdependency on each other reactions really worked in this movie.<br/><br/>Todd Philips has smashed it out of the ball park again. I firmly believe moving the story to Thailand was a very wise idea. Although the storyline on its own is more of a parody than an original , the change of location really works. What I mostly dislike in sequels is when everything happens so similar to the previous that its almost predictable. Good call on the location!<br/><br/>Seems like everything falls into place with this sequel! The Acting, writing and direction and even location!<br/><br/>The next most important question is what will the 3rd addition be like? Yes there is going to be a 3rd addition as per the gossip in Hollywood. I hope it comes out as an original since the whole bachelor party concept has been milked out dry."
"Fields201","6","1","2","4 June 2011"," I Felt Like I Had A Hangover After This Movie
","The Hangover Part 2 begins when Phil (Bradley Cooper) is on the phone with Stu's (Ed Helms) soon to be wife that someone has gone missing and the wedding may have to be cut off. Cut back to a week earlier, and Stu is getting married to his fiancée in Thailand. They bring along her little brother Teddy who Alan (Zach Galifianakis)despises. But suddenly the boys are drinking and wakes up with a hangover only to find Teddy missing and they must go through a series of events to find him.<br/><br/>Hold on a sec, I seem to be referring to the first movie. Wait, this is the second movie. It's the same scenario all over again. Stu's now got a tattoo on his face that looks suspiciously like Mike Tyson's (replacing his missing tooth from the first one) and Alan now has a bald head. It's the same exact formula!<br/><br/>To be fair, there are a few funny scenes in the movie that made me laugh out loud. I actually thought that the whole movie would be a rush job devoid of any laughs. The audience I saw it with was laughing throughout the movie, with a few down times here and there. Chow even makes an appearance but his return is mostly forgettable. <br/><br/>The first scene that made me laugh was at the toast in the beginning when Stu's soon to be father-in-law compares Stu to rice. It was actually quite funny. Then Alan makes a speech and I really thought the film would really nail it if he struck back at the father-in-law who was obviously badgering Stu in front of an audience of people. However, that did not happen. So close. There were a few other funny moments in the film, but it never seemed to quite live up to the first one. Well, maybe one part involving a monkey, a monk and a bus. The audience was rolling on that one. In fact, the monkey was the real show stealer. I'm betting he will return for the third installment.<br/><br/>The last third of the movie, however, felt very rushed. It was like the writers struggled to really find that ending that was just phoned in for the sake of finally ending this picture. Granted, the end credits helped salvage the rush job that they did, but it wasn't enough to warrant this a worthy sequel to the highly successful Hangover film. <br/><br/>With the third installment greenlit, let me spoil the third one for you. Bradley Cooper will be on the phone with Alan's fiancée, and the wedding will have to be called off. Flashback to sometime earlier, and we lead up to the events where they wake up with a hangover, and a series of events will follow which will probably feel just like the previous two installments. The End."

","I'm not really getting Todd Phillips's intention besides getting more money. I can also dig a whole different ways to make money. I can dig remakes, I can dig retakes, I can dig sequels, I can dig prequels but I can't dig easy copies of movies you made before. Todd just did that. The ingredients to this comedy are the same.<br/><br/>Instead of Las Vegas you get Bangkok, instead of a bachelor party we get a... bachelor party, instead of missing Stu you get missing Teddy, instead of a lion you get a monkey, instead of a missing teeth we get a face Mike Tyson tattoo, instead of Mr. Chow confusion we get another Teddy and so on. A recycled story based on the same content as the first movie. It's the same structure and that bothers me a lot. A movie about a hangover has various options of approaching. There isn't really much to say about where the story goes and how's the journey since it's the same. Besides these problems I have another big one with Ed Helms. he just overreacted the whole movie and felt really unnatural at times. Bradley Cooper as Phil feels like he's going through straight hell acting bored like realizing he's doing the same things he did in the first movie. The real stealer of the show however is again, Zach Galifianakis. His delivery is hilarious. His jokes are straight, funny and he is involved in all the comedic situations. Short reminder: Paul Giamatti's short cameo is amazing. Simply amazing.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is funny, it's entertaining and it delivers a lot of laughs. Problem is you get all these jokes with a little bit of bitterness. I wish I could stop my rant and simply state things that I liked in the movie. I loved some of the landscape shots, I loved some of the locations, the decors used, the overall atmosphere... The songs used were did not have a constant good usage. It didn't matched some scenes like they did in the first movie. It is a very good directed comedy but pity that it's not at least half original. The worst part or the good part is that Todd already thought about a third movie. It's a good idea if he'll change the story and introduce new elements to it but it is an atrocious idea if it will be the same as the first two but in Paris this time...<br/><br/>With that said, The Hangover Part II is not really Part II but The Hangover in Bangkok. It lacks big time in originality but Zach and the funny and ridiculous moments keep you entertained and at times forget the issues the movie has."

The freshness is gone, the charm has wained and we are left with raunch.<br/><br/>If you like ""Hangover"" you'll like H2 as it is the same movie in a different location.

One change, the tiger was replaced by a drug dealing smoking monkey (who looked like the monkey in the Pirate franchise.)<br/><br/>If dialogue containing the ""f"" word was deleted it would be a silent movie.<br/><br/>The pictures in the camera over the end credits showed it could have been considerable more raunchy.

"iReviewFilms","5","1","2","1 June 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: The Hangover Part II
","Hot off the heels of The Hangover, a massive summer success in 2008, The Hangover Part II reunites the wolfpack and the adventure begins all over again in another country and city.<br/><br/>This time around the setting is Thailand and Stu (Ed Helms) is the lucky groom to be. With the wedding taking place in Thailand to help Stu get along with his new relatives, the rest of the gang- Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) head out planning for a more relaxing version of their Las Vegas debauchery. This time however there is another party goer in the form of the brides 16 year old brother Teddy (Mason Lee).<br/><br/>Suffice to say the unthinkable happens and they wake up in the middle of Bangkok and each sporting a very impressive hangover again. Mr Chow (Ken Jeong) also returns and is given a more prominent role in this one with his extreme character providing some of the films more amusing moments.<br/><br/>The writers and director seem to have stuck to the same winning principals of the last film almost identically which you might consider to be a good thing. Yes it is more vulgar and over the top than the last one and they have tweaked it slightly but there is no real variation whatsoever from the original. The tiger is now a monkey, the broken tooth is now a tattoo, a character goes missing etc. This results in a very disappointing movie as not only are you getting the same jokes in the same order with the same characters but you can work out exactly what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>The original won us over due to it's outrageous and original scenarios, this just increases the outrageousness/nudity and thinks that's all that's required to create another success. Completely wrong. In fact most of the best moments come from the characters reminiscing about what they got up to in the first movie. If it wasn't for the nostalgia and likability of the characters that was build up from the first film, I would have struggled to laugh more than once or twice.<br/><br/>Although I wasn't expecting it to be as good as the first one, I was still hoping for an entertaining movie that could have at least tried to break slightly from the template of the first. Alas it fails to achieve this and the result is a distinctly average film that's just been rehashed. I'd rather have just watched the first one again to be honest.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"
"MBunge","7","1","2","1 June 2011"," A whole lot of crappy sequels have been made this same way
","Boy, there's every reason in the world for this movie to suck. It basically tells the exact same story in the exact same way as the first film, but a little more sloppily constructed and just taking what people loved in the original and cranking it up a notch or three. That approach has produced some truly awful sequels. However, The Hangover Part II is not one of them.<br/><br/>Why? Partly because the script is still full of laugh-out-loud moments. Partly because the three main characters and the actors who play them still connect with the audience. Mostly, though, it's because these filmmakers made a pretty bold creative choice that aesthetically redeems the otherwise repetitive nature of this motion picture.<br/><br/>This time around, timid dentist Stu (Ed Helms), his inappropriate friend Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the socially inept Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in Bangkok with no memory of what happened the night before. The three are in Thailand, along with the missing-for-most-of-the-first-movie Doug (Justin Bartha), for Stu's wedding to the lovely Lauren (Jaime Chung). Only now, it's Lauren's little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) who's missing after his night of debauchery with The Wolfpack and the boys have to retrace their steps through the fetid streets and around monkeys, international criminals and transsexual strippers to find him.<br/><br/>That sounds exactly like the first film, doesn't it? Well, it is in most ways. To the folks put off by that, there's really no arguing the point. If you're rubbed the wrong way by seeing another version of what you've seen before, that's not an invalid reaction, especially as this is an inferior version in one big way. While the first movie was about all three main characters, each playing a part and having their own story being told, The Hangover Part II is dominated by Stu and Alan. Phil, who was one of the best things about the first movie, is reduced to tagalong. Frankly, if Bradley Cooper had held out for more money, they could have replaced Phil with Doug and it wouldn't have made much of a difference.<br/><br/>What saves this film from disaster is that these filmmakers chose to make a much darker movie than the first one. Not only in being raunchier and more outrageous, but in generating a sense of menace and danger that didn't exist before. I mean, nobody ever thought something really bad would happen to Doug in The Hangover, did they? Yes, they might not find him in time for his wedding, but there was never any doubt that he'd eventually turn up, was there? The Hangover Part II starts its search for Teddy by finding his severed finger, setting a tone that continues through the whole story. From the squalor of Bangkok to the more extreme physical transformations of Stu and Alan to the enhanced isolation of being in a foreign country without anything familiar to fall back on, this has such a different and more intense feel to it that you're not bothered when it duplicates what happened before. If this wasn't a blockbuster sequel and therefore required to have a happy ending, The Hangover Part II should have logically concluded with a wickedly black moment of comedy that would make even Norm Macdonald a little uncomfortable. We don't get that ending, but that sense flows through everything leading up to the conclusion, giving this film a decidedly different vibe.<br/><br/>I'm not sure they'll be able to get away with it a third time but while slightly inferior to the original, this is one sequel that manages to validate its existence and reward everyone for coming back for more."
"MovieJunky101","4","1","2","31 May 2011"," Sequel or Remake?
","So here's how it goes, three guys wake up in a hotel room with no recollection of the night before, with obvious signs of misdeeds, including a missing friend. Does any of this sound familiar to you genre fans? Well it should, because it is EXACTLY like the first Hangover movie. The same movie only in Bangkok/Thailand, and this time Stu is the one getting married, Doug's wife is pregnant and the bride-to-be's little brother is the one missing. This might sound like good news to some Hangover fans, but this fan was, once again, left unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason is, I just did not like this movie. I wanted so badly to love this movie, but alas, I did not. None of the actors seemed to be on their a-game either, as Ed Helms, over does it with the squeamish, wimp routine and Bradley Cooper seems like he could careless. Zach Galifianakis, who got most of the good lines, pulls them off well enough, but the writers didn't stain any muscles trying to give him anything to work with. <br/><br/>It's hard to say exactly what could have made this movie better. Quiet frankly I can't remember the last time I saw a sequel that was this lazy. The filmmakers even went as far as to recreate, almost to a tea, some of the scenes from the first one. Opening the movie with a phone call to Tracey. Running around on the roof looking for Teddy, mirroring running on the roof looking for Doug. The moment Stu realizes where the missing person is. . . blah blah blah – Oh and take a guess as to how the movie ends?<br/><br/>Overall, The Hangover Part II, is not as memorable as the first one, there aren't as many quotable lines, and Bridesmaids was a much better film. The movie earned it's R rating, but it still managed to feel safe, lazy and tired. So in end the end, I will let this week's movie slide with a 4 for sometimes making me laugh."

","From a regular audience's standpoint, the movie is hilarious! I laughed my ass off. In-your-face gags, comical violence and the whole lot. I couldn't wait for the movie to release (yes, the hype created before the release had a lot to do with it.) I loved the characters from the first installment and Zach Galifianakis didn't fail to hit the funny in me again. The movie kept its pace and everyone in the theater seemed to be having a ball! After the movie I could hear people saying ""I hope there's a part three to this!"" Rumours are that a third installment is already on its way.<br/><br/>From a movie critic's standpoint, it seems like the creators watched Hangover turn into a hit and thought ""hey! we've got a franchise on our hands, let's make some more money!"" and they did manage to mint a butt load of greens through the weekend ($ 86 Million) and from what? A recycled script of Hangover! The writers played it safe. Too safe. Sitting in the theater, watching the movie, I felt like I had psychic powers. It's way too predictable. If you haven't watched the movie and you think you might not get the chance to watch it in theaters, don't worry. Just picture the plot of the first installment in a different location, except this time it's Stu's bachelor party. Seriously, I could've walked after the mid-point of the movie and know how everything would unfold. The same dilemma: four characters get smashed out, wake up the next day, hungover, one of the four is missing, they try to retrace their steps through last night's crazy events by looking for clues and links. The writers did try making it a little fresh with the she-males involvement and a spectacular car chase scene and honestly, I did enjoy that. I'd rate it a solid 6/10 because I like the characters. ""If only monkeys could Skype"" was one of my favourite lines in the movie. To conclude, I'd say: it is in fact a very entertaining movie if your just looking for laughs but if you're looking for reactions like ""Woah! I didn't see that coming!"" then you'd be disappointed. What's next? Alan's getting married in England and they lose the bride's step-dad after a crazy night climbing the Big Ben? The movie is Hungover from Hangover!"

The whole structure of this film is very similar from the first. the beginning, the middle and the end. the elements used in the first film is also used in the second film. the script is similar to the first but with different scene, new characters, and some improvements<br/><br/>In my conclusion, i thought the film was brilliant, i just wasn't surprised and think that it would be better than the first film."

","After the release of one of the most critically and commercially successful comedies of the modern era in 2009, it would only be a matter of time before director Todd Philips and his cast would be given a second go-round. This is in the form of The Hangover: Part 2, which is less of a direct sequel, and more of an 'alternative retelling' of a night they'll never remember. <br/><br/>The film is set some months after the events of the first film. Doug (Justin Bartha) is happily married and it is now Stu (Ed Helms) who is the groom-to-be. He opts for a traditional wedding in Thailand to appease his in-laws, but a night that starts with just one beer on the beach with friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zack Galifianakis) is a sign that the trip will be anything but smooth. Cue the following morning, when the wolfpack awakes to find, among other things, a monkey in their bathroom, a tattoo on Stu's face, a barely-alive Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong, with a much larger role this time) and the severed finger of Stu's brother-in-law, who's nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>So now you know what I mean when I say the film is essentially a retelling of what happened in Vegas. In terms of plot only, the parallels between the two films are obvious, and when you see it in full, you'll realise just how similar they truly are. The monkey replaces the baby, Thai gangsters replace Chinese gangsters, and an unconscious Chow replaces Tyson drugged-up tiger. In fact, every major set piece in Part 2 is in some way adapted from the original. Philips makes no attempt to hide this either, going so far as to recycle the majority of Part 1's soundtrack and even shoot key scenes the exact same way.<br/><br/>Of course, this is not a huge issue, only because anyone who walks into this film expecting something entirely different is either far too demanding, or just kidding themselves. The crew applies the same style of jokes the whole way through, and it works because, quite simply, this is a very funny movie. <br/><br/>I know it's a cliché, but the sequel really is on a bigger scale. At times, Vegas seems like a McDonald's play area compared to the horrors encountered in the red-light district of Bangkok. Wilder scenarios result in greater consequences for the character's actions, and you can overlook the fact that some of these problems (which might leave a regular person at a complete loss) are simply glossed over in the film to make way for a steady stream of gags.<br/><br/>But a word of warning for anyone who may have found the first film overly outlandish and inappropriate in its subject matter. Part 2 takes this hilarity in a more sinister direction, resulting in more than its fair share of uncomfortable moments, punctuated by gross-out humour and jibes at other cultures that could even be taken as racist and offensive, depending on one's individual tastes in comedy. I didn't have a problem with it, but I can see how those with a low tolerance for political incorrectness would.<br/><br/>Finally, it was disappointing to learn that Heather Graham would not reprise her role as a genuine love interest for Stu in the sequel. Consequently, we're just supposed to accept the fact that he's gotten over his break-up, completely lost contact with Jade and moved on to someone we've never met. This makes the film appear just that little bit shallow during the First Act, but it also becomes a non-issue as soon as the focus turns from the wedding to the manhunt. If The Hangover is the most highly-regarded and respected of modern comedies, then the sequel falls a little short of being its Godfather 2. However, it's hard to harshly criticise a straight-out comedy that makes you laugh as often as this one does.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"thewurstone","8","2","8","26 May 2011"," Hilarious, but not as good as the first.
","I went to see the midnight showing of The Hangover Part II with about 20 Friends on Wednesday night, and the majority of us agreed that it was not quite as good as the first one. Perhaps it is wrong to go in ready to compare it to the first one, but it is hard not to when the first one set such high expectations. In my opinion, The Hangover was brilliant, hilarious, and damn near flawless. It kept my attention throughout the entire movie, and there were times when I was literally choking and crying from laughing so hard. There are a few moments when this happened in Part II, however, it did not happen quite as often.After about the first 30 minutes, the comedy seemed to die down a bit. Once you are re-introduced to Alan, and after you get the feeling of ""Here we go again"" when the characters wake up in another effed up situation, the movie seems to take a more dramatic tone. Don't get me wrong, there are still several funny parts from this point on, but the comedy isn't really consistent. There were times when I wouldn't laugh for 15 minutes. Overall, it was a great movie and I plan to see it in theaters again and also buy it when it comes out on Blu-Ray. However, don't go in expecting it to be leaps and bounds better than the first. Also, don't try and over analyze it or try to find similarities between the two (as many of my friends did), but enjoy it for what it is. I definitely recommend anyone who enjoys comedies to check this one out."

I have been to Thailand 8 times. It is very vague on where the wedding is. I immediately recognized the Islands off the coast and the mountain drive from the airport as Krabi. (which is where it was shot; How they end up in Bangkok which is a 2 hour plane ride away is beyond me. There is no beach resort within driving distance except Pattaya. Which is not the kind of place for a wedding. LOL if you know it. It is impossible to take a speed boat from the Chao Po River to Krabi in less than 10+ hours. (not to mention you would run out of gas) You would have to go all the way down the Gulf of Thailand and around to the Adaman sea on the Pacific side (Where the Tsunami hit). The Building that the Helicopter comes up at the end I could swear is a project never finished and they must have fixed up the top for the shoot?; None of the logistics in Bangkok make any sense ........ Also I have never seen a Song tao ( p/u truck taxi ) or a Tuk Tuk that says Taxi on the top. There are great AC taxis in Bangkok and they are way nicer the Tuk Tuk (which the 3+ of them could have never really fit into). So anyway it was fun trying to look for places I have been or seen."

","The Hangover Part II is every bit as bad as you might expect a sequel to be when it simply apes what happened in the previous film. It strives to be uncreative, throwing its dim-witted, unlikeable leads into the same situations, with nearly identical jokes and shock moments. It's not even guilty-pleasure trash.<br/><br/>This time around, it's dentist Stu (Ed Helms) who's getting married. In Thailand, of course, where his betrothed is from. Of course it's Thailand, having them get married in Kansas would be dumb. Anyway, the Wolf Pack schleps off to the Far East, with not-sane Alan (Zach Galianifikis) in tow. Oh, and the bride's teenage brother, who happens to be studying at Stanford. Because he has a pushy dad, that's why.<br/><br/>Things go wrong just as they did in the first one in that, after enjoying a toast on the beach, the friends wake up in some hellhole, this time in Bangkok. They then spend the rest of the film figuring out where they are, where the teenager is, and how to save the wedding - again, somewhat of a repeat of the first film.<br/><br/>Raunchy movies can be a lot of fun, but this one offers very little in terms of wit, just blustery Americanisms (such as yelling louder at someone who might not understand English). Some fun is poked at the seedy underbelly of Bangkok itself and at culture clash in general, but it's an impotent mess. There's much racing about madly as the characters dash from scene to scene. In this case, that may have helped the movie, as one didn't have time to contemplate the implausible plot too much.<br/><br/>Let's look at some good parts. Paul Giamatti has a quick, showy role as a crime boss and does well. Mike Tyson sings and shows some personality. That's about it. The rest might make you cringe - if you had cared enough about the characters to begin with. Oh, there was one other good thing - the weakest character from the first film, Doug (Justin Bartha) is left to communicate with the other three via cell phone, wondering where they are. Smart move, because that guy was boring (he was the ""lost one"" they had to find in the previous film).<br/><br/>I suppose if you got really drunk and didn't care about anything more than a moving picture, you might find this endurable. Or maybe you could make a drinking game out of it - every time a monkey did something interesting, take a shot. Other than that, it's worthless."
"thegoodman-1","8","1","3","20 June 2011"," Equally as good as the first!
","I'm sure what you've probably heard 'It's basically the same as the first but dirtier' Well i'm not gonna lie, it's true, but it's still an awesome film that's equally as good as the first, the title of the film is called 'the hangover' honestly what were you expecting? OK It's always risky if you're gonna repeat the same gags - even in different contexts - but I thought it worked well. It made the actual hangover itself seem a complete copy of the first, which almost gives it a supernatural presence like it's following them.<br/><br/>I just think people were too hasty to point the finger at the similarities, simply forgetting that it was the intention and wasn't accidental. Todd Phillips knew he wasn't going to get away with an almost carbon copy so he had to make it different; he did this by making the jokes a bit more vulgar and disgusting... yeah i'll admit at some parts I did wonder if he pushed it a bit, but I found myself and most of the people in the cinema laughing and I guarantee those who slammed it as 'over the top' laughed themselves. The cast did a great job of portraying their characters, they're all believable characters who we all probably know in real life. I thought the addition of chow was executed well and he did a top job stealing the show along with Galifianakis (Alan) who was also brilliant.<br/><br/>Point is, it's similar to the first... yes, but does a good job of it. It's a great comedy and will definitely make you laugh."
"mrtimlarabee","5","1","3","7 June 2011"," Sort of like watching a rerun of a really good episode
","The Hangover was a one joke premise that stretched into a slew of laughs. It's safe to say that a similar premise would work and be equally as funny. The problem with ""The Hangover II"" is that it has some good jokes, and its enjoyable to watch, but, like an all too faithful cover song, it's wayyyy too familiar and it lacks originality.<br/><br/>My real issue with it is that the premise is too similar to the first. Guys take bride/groom brother with them, have wild night, forget everything, have to find him. The repeat premise and some of the gags are almost cringeworthy. It's almost as if it's the same script with a little cut and paste work done on the gags for good measure.<br/><br/>But some of the jokes are funny. Most of the humor works because the guys are discovering what they did for the evening and forgot. It's when we see this stuff that we laugh. A couple of the outrageous moments involving Stu are hilarious.<br/><br/>But then there's that stuff that drags or the stuff that's too derivative. What's the deal with Paul Giamatti - such a great actor in a small part without much to do. Or the fact that some of their hijinks involves more action than humor that it seems the film, as we near the end, is going through the motions.<br/><br/>Perhaps the first one relied so heavily on the premise that it became a novelty film, and shouldn't have been repeated so faithfully. If there is a Hangover 3, it better have a big dose of originality. If they tried to imitate the premise again, wed end up in Friday the 13th land..and I don't think I could take another 10 of these."

","So, personally, I just didn't find Hangover II very funny. There were surprisingly few jokes. The jokes were great, don't get me wrong, but I found myself really waiting for something funny to happen. This sequel largely focused on the emotional trauma of the characters repeating their weekend from hell, rather than keeping the laughs coming. It didn't aaall need to be as over the top as Stew sleeping with the hermaphrodite, but why couldn't we have something subtler between that and the scene with Paul Giamatti? In fact, THAT scene wasn't even nearly as funny as it should have been.<br/><br/>Greatly underwhelming. Not worth the movie ticket.

","Many critics of this film complain that it's a ""copy of the original"" and isn't ""original"" enough to stand on its own. Honestly, this is a bad thing? To many sequels to good or great movies were disappointments because they tried too hard to mess with the original's winning formula. This movie isn't one of them; all the things that made the first one great haven't been tampered with and (without giving anything away) it can be safely said that the humor is A LOT darker. Long story short, if you want to see one of the rare movie sequels that doesn't degrade it's predecessor, see the Wolf Pack back in action, or just want to see a hysterical detective story, you will want to see this."

The Hangover formula is successful -we all know that -Part II even makes the formula more enjoyable. The acting is great, the jokes are funny, the atmosphere is authentic, the only spot Hangover II misses out on is in fact the thing that made the previous one more than just a funny movie -the formula.

","""It happened again"", Bradley Cooper's Phil tells his fretting girlfriend via telephone. Indeed it has. The very words not only summarize into three words the plot of director Todd Phillips' Hangover Part II, the anticipated sequel to the 2009 comedic calamity of a bachelor party gone hilariously haywire, but they almost seem to mock the concept of the sequel itself, as the latest in lewd laughter refuses to take any sort of calculated risks with the series, leaving us with a tiresome, though still fairly fun, second round.<br/><br/>Cooper returns with co-stars Ed Helm and Zach Galifianakis, who are all whisked halfway around the world for Stu's (Helm) wedding in Thailand. Determined not to repeat the events of their last little drunken escapade, the three down a single beer for the occasion. Of course, last call becomes first call, and morning glory in Bangkok sees an ape on amphetamine, Stu with a tattoo, and Alan (Galifianakis) with a cue-ball for a head.<br/><br/>As per its predecessor, The Hangover Part II is all about the men's attempts to unravel the mystery of their wild night and to find a missing member of their partying party, as every backtracking step leads them farther from the truth and further into danger. Now, the original was outrageous, but that's what made it fun and relatable. We may not wake up to a tiger in our Vegas hotel suite every Saturday morning, but we've all woken up at one point or another having to digest an incomparable amount of intoxicated consequences sometimes we're laughing, sometimes we're not. Part II is well titled, because it does feel like a part, like an episodic continuum of the first instead of an honest sequel. It largely follows the same formula with seldom deviation, and is that bad? No, not at all. It's safe. But maybe too safe.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Galifianakis stole, and still steals, the comedic spotlight, though at times he kind of overdoes the idiot. I've become prone to calling this the Jack Sparrow syndrome, when an actor, under the pressure of living up to his successful role, acts over rather than under his dramatic quota. He's still pretty damn funny though, and Helm and Cooper are in no way useless. The trio, bolstered by the bulls*** that keeps testing their every vein of patience, are just as entertaining in Bangkok as they were in Sin City.<br/><br/>Yes, it happened again, and that means you can predict The Hangover Part II's compliments to a tee. But if you're expecting the same number of shocks that labelled the Hangover, you won't find it here, mainly because you know the sort of shocks that await. Make no mistake, there are just as many outrageous scenarios plaguing Part II, but the subtitle alone tells you: we're recycling the successful and it's not as impactful this time around. It takes very few risks, to the extent that structurally we've seen all this before. However, if it's Friday night, you're looking for a few laughs, maybe even a few Wolf-Pack howls, then you can do no wrong by grabbing a couple of beers and giving her a look. Just a few words of caution: watch your drinks closely."
"DICK STEEL","6","1","3","1 June 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Hangover Parr II
","So I wasn't really that impressed with the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 in Todd Phillips' The Hangover, and my verdict for Part II is, well, quite the same because... drumroll, it IS the same, with the return of familiar characters getting embroiled in the same good ol' shenanigans to draw out laughter at the absurdity of it all, crafted using the same formula which already drew in an incredible opening weekend at the box office. As the saying goes, if it ain't broken, don't fix it.<br/><br/>And scribes Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong did just that, sticking to what worked in the first film, and transplanting the formula over to a new country, that of Thailand and more specifically, Bangkok taking over Las Vegas as this installment's sin city. Which isn't a surprise given Bangkok's rather colourful and seedier side of night life that the filmmakers had a field day to go over, ranging from open drug dealers to go go bar owners, right down to the sex workers whom we all know are well, not quite who they seem. One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble indeed.<br/><br/>The wolf pack of the first film returns, with the dentist Stu (Ed Helms) having moved on and now in a new relationship with Lauren (Jamie Chung) and are getting married in a Thai resort. Knowing just how well the previous bachelor party went, Stu is adamant for only a safe weekend brunch, but that wouldn't be a lot of fun, would it? To get there, we need to spend close to 20 minutes with the usual suspects of Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) finally convincing Stu to involve them all at his wedding overseas, and what would be a safe campfire, single drink only event involving Stu's future young brother in law Teddy (Mason Lee, son of filmmaker Ang Lee, OK?) turning out to be nothing but a bad deja vu.<br/><br/>The trailer had set it all up already, with the all too familiar waking up routine, replacing Stu's broken tooth with a bad ass tattoo ala Mike Tyson's, Alan getting bald, Phil well, going almost shirtless to show off his torso, and the new kid on the block Teddy being all but absent, which sends the troupe into a frenzy since Alan is the favourite son of Stu's soon to be father-in- law. Instead of a tiger, we get Crystal the (in)famous monkey which had made its name in various other blockbuster franchises joining in to well, provide fellatio jokes, and would probably irk animal activists with its constant smoking of cigarettes, whether or not faked (director Todd Phillips was quite adamant that the cigarettes were not lit, and the smoke was digitally added).<br/><br/>So formula means having the group figuring out where their last few hours had gone, having no inkling of their mad party antics which we do get to see glimpses of when they traverse across the city trying to retrace their steps and locate clues as to where Teddy might be. So we get a slew of clichés and stereotypes from characters to situational set ups, each trying really hard to make the audience laugh, with the clock ticking toward an impending wedding to happen that they must return to, intact. It may seem that all the characters here were going through the motions of groundhog day, so much so that this outing seemed a little short on surprises, with everyone being relatively muted when compared to the crazier first installment.<br/><br/>For instance, Zach Galifiankis being the revelation of the first Hangover, has his Alan character being a little bit stale, the man-child that you've grown to hate. Ken Jeong as Mr Chow as usual was the livewire, but alas he was absent for the whole midsection before coming back into the scene. He's the other actor that made The Hangover work with his rapid fire, thickly accented English, and his second outing could have been better if not for a comparatively more self-aware performance that didn't really go for broke.<br/><br/>Will there be a Hangover Part III? From the looks of the box office opening numbers, I don't see how the studio can pass up the opportunity. My only wish is for the formula not to be repeated for another time, because then it would be really cheap and too coincidental for the same old shenanigans to be happening to the same old folks within too close a period of time. My suggestion would be to chug a few beers beforehand with a few like minded pals who go to the movies only for crass comedies, and the alcohol and company would help to boost the enjoyment factor of The Hangover Part II.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you'll have to sit through everything before the end credits roll with what would arguably be the best bits of the film - that all revealing photo montage that spelt out exactly what the wolf pack had been up to, making you envious at the hard partying ways they got themselves into and itching or even inspired to be part of something similar rather than having to sit through the characters' agonizing return to reality."

"Thomasamills","8","1","4","1 June 2011"," The Funniest Film Since, Well, The Hangover
","Just like most people, I loved the Hangover. I remember seeing it for the first time at the cinema and it gave me some of the hardest laughs I've ever had whilst sitting through a film. The first thing that came to my mind when I first heard there was going to be a sequel was, how are they going to do it? They can't just recycle the same plot as the first film can they? Oh yes they can and it works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips co writes and directs, as he did the first film. He re unites us with all the key players including Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis. This time round the guys are in Thailand to attend Stu's wedding. However, things don't go to plan as you can imagine and we end up with a scenario that seems very familiar to what happened in Vegas two years ago.<br/><br/>This is the funniest film since the original Hangover. I must have laughed out loud at least five times and had plenty of chuckles throughout. Phillips brings Mr Chow into the mix, who brings many of the films laughs. The humour is crude and at moments gross, but it is irresistibly funny. Phillips manages to bring fresh jokes into the film, even though he is pretty much remaking the first film. Although a third film would probably be too much, I wouldn't be surprised if we take another trip out with the wolf pack in a couple of years.<br/><br/>After the disappointment of the latest pirates instalment, it was great to see a summer sequel live up to expectations. Fans of the first Hangover will no doubt love part 2 and so they should, it's one of the funniest films of the year."

","Zach Galifianakis is the cute, unpredictable, and mischief-maker. The movie starts off with Stu planning his wedding and recollecting memories from Hangover Part 1. Just when you think Phil, Stu, and Alan have learnt a good lesson already, they are back to fun times where they wake up in a room with a Monkey, a finger soaked in blood and dipped in ice, and a notorious drug dealer.<br/><br/>To add to the fun, there is a monk, a studious Stanford Scholar, and a smart little monkey who share the ride with you.<br/><br/>We all laughed out so loud and went ouch!, and yew! and it was a fun filled 102 min of a movie.<br/><br/>Watch and Enjoy!"

","Many sequels turn out to be disappointments, leave viewers with a feeling of regret - even anger - at the sequel being produced, and can even detract from their memories of the original classic.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say that The Hangover Part II is no such disappointment. The quality of the acting, the script and the gags ensures that audience is thoroughly entertained and will be generally satisfied.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the movie to ""get going"" - it's probably around 30 minutes until the boys wake up in a strange hotel and the familiar comedic storyline begins: Find the missing person and get back in time for the wedding! The blatant similarity to the plot of the original movie has both pros and cons. It brings a certain satisfaction to the viewer. We know we loved the original movie - we are simply getting more of the same. However, it makes the movie very predictable, the audience is able to see most ""revelations"" well in advance. I left the movie satisfied but sincerely hoping that a third installment is not made, there is no need for more repetition.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to anybody who loved the original film; whilst containing nothing original, it is a genuinely funny and enjoyable movie."

","Like most comedies there are moments which make you generally laugh out loud, this film was no exception.Zach Galifianakis' performance was once again the highlight of this film, and the one thing which ensured the laughs were never too far away. The problem I have with this film is the apparently indiscriminate use of expletives when there was absolutely no need for them. And as other people have pointed out in previous reviews, the racial stereotypes where taken a stage too far, many (but not all) of them involving the character 'Mr Chow'.<br/><br/>In summary I would have to conclude that it was funny, but to be honest my laughter was drowned out by the cringe-worthiness the longer the film dragged on and in the end I couldn't wait for it to be over.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Hello again, now i've been waiting all year to see this movie ever  since the trailers came out, i canceled big screenings for this,  because i wanted to have a good time watching The Hangover 2 in my  hometown.  Century 16 & IMAX(which was really nice by the way).  It was a riot getting seats and tickets on the first day, i had to over  buy on tickets, and i was really excited, i loved the first so i was  ready to laugh my A$$ off again or even more and...  Well it had its moments of awe and some of craziness but what i wasn't  expecting was a test?  yes a Test, OK so you're watching it, the opening credits role, music  plays you see Stu, everybody in my Theatre roared in cheers, whistling  and excitement then we got the part where they left off from the first.   I liked the beginning of it but then i don't know for me it was getting  good but i was a little like""wait what? and huh?""  So what i mean by a test is it felt you were waiting for the raunchy  that we saw in the first and those Roller-coaster's of nonstop laughs,  Well it is really funny.  But do be honest some of the jokes were OK and some were a little too  offensive, the nudity and crude humor was off the charts in a barely  RATED-R to an almost NC-17 film, it was very Rated R.  So many IMDb Users have wrote that ""oh its good there's no offensive  parts or stupid parts""  OK i liked this movie but to make it short its wasn't as good as the  first but its funny enough to make it through the weekend.  i liked it(Personally)  It just could have been better.  7.5 out of 10 Funny, Outrageous, Crude, and most definitely not for  kids."
"jergasmic","7","2","13","26 May 2011"," The wolfpack is back.
","I went to the midnight premiere last night. With mixed expectations. I went in totally stoked to see the sequel to the funniest movie ever made. But, I was dreading the sequel curse. <br/><br/>This movie, plays A LOT on the first movie. References to The Jonas Brothers being in town. The opening scene is exactly like the first movie's opening scene. When I say 'exactly'. I mean EXACTLY. Camera angles, characters, lines, stances., music. There are a few new characters added to the wolfpack. The two main ones being Jamie Chung's character as Stu's fiancé, and Mason Lee's character. Stu and Lauren (Chung) are getting married in Thailand. Which I don't get. Jamie Chung is korean, not thai. But I guess we're going by the 'all asians look the same' stereotype and have her play a thai girl. Anyway, I'll just get to the point. The boys go have a drink, and wake up with no recollection of what happened the night before.<br/><br/>If you've seen the first movie, you've seen this movie. 98% of the gags, laughs and jokes are basically repeats of the first. All of them are recycled. Asian guy pops out of something and beats someone. Some sort of jungle animal is in the bathroom. Something is wrong with Stu's face. Scene by scene it's the same movie. I'll admit, it did have it's moments where I was cracking up and roaring with laughter. But I just sat there in the theater a lot, thinking 'I've seen this before'. It was a good sequel, as far as sequels go. But if this was the first 'Hangover' film, it wouldn't do very well. This movie relies A LOT on the first film. It does have a lot more vulgarity and potty humor, which is expected. However, I do kind of feel like the actors phoned this one in, which was disappointing.<br/><br/>Bottom line. If you haven't seen the first movie, don't see this movie. You won't get any of the jokes. And if you have seen the first movie, I'd wait for the Blu-Ray. 98% of the jokes are recycled from the first one, you'll just feel like you're watching the same movie. I do give it credit that the idea of it happening exactly the same as the first one is funny. But it gets exhausting about 45 minutes in. It's a funny movie, I'll admit it. It just felt like I was watching the first film over again. I suggest you wait for the Blu-Ray."

I had previously seen Hangover 1, which although fairly banal, did contain some good, original humour and was well acted by the main protagonists.<br/><br/>As those who have read about Hangover II or, like me, have had the misfortune to watch it will know, the sequel simply uses all the gags from the first movie. It transplants them to some kind of crazy, make- believe Asian state, occasionally referred to as Thailand, (although the local people are referred to as 'Asiatics' not Thai), but which bears no resemblance to any country that I have ever had the misfortune to live in.<br/><br/>Not that this would matter if the film was entertaining; but it isn't.

"kgprophet","6","0","1","21 January 2013"," Urge to both swallow and spit out this sequel at the same time.
","It is easy palatable, following the same exact paradigm as the first film. A common analogy is comparing a movie to a roller coaster ride. Say ""Hangover"" is one of several roller coasters, and it was the favourite one you tried. So, H2 is like taking your favourite roller coaster ride again, except instead of sitting up front you sit a couple cars back. <br/><br/>This film has just about exactly the same beats as the first one, where the right audience would start saying ""Uh oh, I know what's going to happen"" with great anticipation. The wrong audience would start saying ""Uh oh, I know what's going to happen"" with little interest at all. Well, is the film funny? Are there different jokes than the first film? Yes, some of the new gags have alternative punch lines. Things like the monkey don't work as well. The group has chemistry as an ensemble, and you enjoy their bickering most of the time. One thing I remember fondly about the first film is that it kept our main characters normal. That aspect is what made the movie special, and here that same approach is used, but perhaps does not resonate as much at the end this time. <br/><br/>The Thailand location is utilised well, with a little local flare.<br/><br/>But I am still on the fence whether to recommend this carbon copy sequel. If it was so much fun the first time, why not jump on for another go 'round again? On the other hand the idea of ""Oh no, here we go again"" should stop you dead in your tracks from ever visiting this sequel. Since I didn't stop watching once the obvious happened, I guess I will fall on the 'why not' side of the fence. But please, a THIRD sequel is just going through the motions."

","They're all back, they're in Thailand, and they don't remember a thing. Again. Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha all return in this sequel to the wildly successful 2009 comedy. This time it's Stu (Helms) who is about to be married and his friends are in Thailand for the wedding with Alan (Galifianakis) being brought along out of pity. However, this time Stu is determined to avoid being drugged. Imagine his surprise when, once in Thailand, that is exactly what happens. And while a member of the party is, again, missing, this time it's his future brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) who is nowhere to be found. And upon inspection of their unfamiliar surroundings, they find his finger on the coffee table still bearing his class ring.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I, unlike most viewers, saw the first film and considered entertaining rather than hilarious. The second film is certainly lesser, at least as entertainment. In 2010, an action/comedy titled The Losers introduced the idea of 'green terrorism' by demonstrating a fictional explosive with all the destructive power of a nuclear bomb that created no radiation or fallout. The Hangover II is essentially a ""green comedy"". Whatever aesthetic differences there might be, it's primarily recycled materials from the previous film."
"Floated2","5","0","1","6 July 2012"," Not as good as the Original
","I was interested in seeing the Hangover Part II because I enjoyed the original Hangover and I read many more negative reviews. The Hangover Part II feels padded at 102 minutes. At the same time, it sticks so closely to the original's template that it could almost be deemed a remake rather than sequel.<br/><br/>Add to that humor that never transcends the juvenile, and you have an annoying movie. Director Todd Philips and his writing team, Scot Armstrong and Craig Mazin, fill the film with penis jokes, Asian stereotypes, and pop culture references. Not much originality here, just more cruder and much less funny jokes.<br/><br/>A movie like this needs as many solid one-liners as possible. The first part of the film goes to great pains to reintroduce the characters, still recovering from their Las Vegas misadventure in The Hangover. This much exposition seems like a waste of time for a comedy of this nature.<br/><br/>It is also a mistake on the director's part to spend so much capital on reminding us of the first movie-when he is about to offer us up such a poor excuse for a sequel.<br/><br/>Even when the guys finally get to Thailand for the main action, The Hangover Part II takes its pretty time picking up any steam. Their protracted search through Bangkok for a missing teenager who partied too hard with them on another lost night gets old fast.<br/><br/>The characters themselves, which should be the film's strongest selling point, are not really happening either. Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) all feel undercooked now-less than one-dimensional. Philips often has the three screaming at one another as they trek through Bangkok. The chemistry among the three actors has gone flat, and their bickering starts to feel interminable.<br/><br/>The new teen character, Teddy (Mason Lee), Stu's fiancée's little brother, could have been developed into a genuine addition but is basically discarded for most of the movie. The film ends on a decidedly sour note when the guys discover, as in the first movie, digital photos of the night they cannot remember.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hangover Part II has a slapdash quality. The filmmakers probably should have taken more time to think things through. The movie even looks slapped together: the mise-en-scene is sloppy, the makeup is uneven, and there are continuity errors galore. The film takes itself too seriously and it works more as a drama with comedy/action elements than a straight up comedy.<br/><br/>=== As a rewatch (03/06/18') The Hangover Part 2 is somewhat as remembered, it being a very similar copy to the original. From the opening scene and ending scene of part 2, is the same as we saw in part 1. What made the original great is tat it was believable and refreshing, as Part 2 is essentially the same thing, just set in a different location, with minor differences. There are some decent funny moments but nothing as funny and unpredictable as the original. Overall, it's a decent watch of entertainment but lack in the magic and suspense of the original. As a another rewatch 05/31/19' to and a day after rewatching the first Hangover to share the similarities and rehash the memories, it's clear again that this sequel isn't nearly as good and original as the first. There are enjoyable scenes since the crew are back together but overall, this isn't as funny, entertaining or thrilling."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>'The Wolfpack' return, this time with Doug (Justin Bartha) engaged to a beautiful Thai girl and descending on the city for a weekend of the wild partying they'll always be remembered for from the first film. But when one of their group goes missing again, they're thrown into another series of wild escapades, involving their old friend Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) a ruthless gangster (Paul Giamatti) and Mike Tyson! <br/><br/>For the wonderful gems it sometimes churns out, it's easy to forget that Hollywood is fundamentally a business in the area of making money. So while an occasional film like The Hangover may come alike that was a far bigger hit than anyone could have imagined and developed it's own cult following, it's almost a forgone conclusion that they will want to cash in on this and make a sequel that will be commercially quite successful and likely to have a big box office opening weekend, but artistically will be quite a failure in light of it's inspiration. And no doubt director Todd Phillips's ego was spurred on with what a runaway success his first film was and was happy to go along with it and thought he could manage the same success twice. And so we have The Hangover Part II which is basically everything The Hangover was...but isn't.<br/><br/>The formula from the first film is repeated almost exactly, as it often is, with the location simply switched from Las Vegas to Thailand, but this in itself feels like enough to feel down on it, with the bright lights and dazzling spectacle of the world's gambling capital replaced with the more diluted, down played back drop of the far east. But most crucially the laugh quotient is significantly down, with the set ups and delivery simply failing to work the way they did the first time round. <br/><br/>The characters are basically the same, Bradley Cooper's Phil the smooth, charming one, Zach Galifianakis's boorish buffoon getting up to his usual antics and, of course, Bartha's Doug the mild mannered, unwitting one who ends up going mad, as well as a few of the novelty characters from the first film re-introduced, but none to the effect of the first film. To try and liven things up a bit, at the end we have the baffling spectacle of Mike Tyson performing his own little live music stint.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II is simply a sequel that is unsurprisingly not as good as the original. Sadly, it's not by a mile and then some. *"

","I have to admit that I was not at all excited to see this movie. As much as I enjoyed the original, I felt very ""full"" at the end. By that I mean, I had just about grown sick of Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms and the genre of tenuous comedy they were going for. Then hearing feedback that it was much of the same didn't make me excited. The result after viewing the film is much as I predicted; This was a movie that lived off of the fame the first movie offered. It's like a classic car, it was fixed up to run like the original. However, the result is underwhelming. I was actually bored for most of the movie, and it actually made me question what I enjoyed about the first. Overall, unless you were one of those people who quoted the original endlessly, or are really pumped to see this sequel, avoid it."

","I just watched this sequel to The Hangover with my two brothers-in-law on Netflix disc. Like the previous one that I also saw with them (though it was the second time for me), we all laughed at much of the same places though not always. We all agreed it wasn't as good as the first one but we all enjoyed it just the same. Really, the same leads of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and especially Zack Galifianakis, had some funny lines and scenes, just not as much previously. Also, the return of Ken Jeong and a certain boxer also were some highlights but because some of the surprise was gone, not as compellingly funny. But, really, if you liked the first one, I don't think you'll be wasting any time viewing the second one. Just don't get your expectations too high..."
"oneguyrambling","5","0","1","27 December 2011"," The first remake made by the same guys in the same language.
","I've seen remakes of foreign films that were 'Americanised' to cater to a broader market, some of them even used the same director and occasionally some members of the cast from the original film.<br/><br/>The Hangover 2 is the first time I have seen an American movie taken to Asia to be remade in a new locale, albeit with the same cast and director.<br/><br/>For anyone who has seen the original I'll fast forward through the backdrop – it's the same. Phil is still slightly cavalier, Alan is still socially inept (I resent the fact that this is highlighted repeatedly through his love of Billy Joel – I like Billy Joel went to his concert a few years back and everything) and Ed is still worried about what 'others' will think.<br/><br/>A wedding is looming, the trio of buddies get together for a pre-wedding drink (this time not a bachelor party as such), Alan is again a grudge invite as the 'relo of a friend'.<br/><br/>It is Stu that is being married, and the fact that he is marrying a Thai hottie (Jamie Chung) justifies the Bangkok location, which lends itself well to debauchery and all round seediness, (something only exacerbated when helium voiced Mr Chow inexplicably arrives on the scene).<br/><br/>After a seemingly innocent 'one beer' the night before the wedding, the trio wake up in unfamiliar surroundings with no recollection of the previous night. They find themselves changed.<br/><br/>Alan (Zach Galipoliticalfinance), Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) must spend the short time left until the looming wedding to locate a missing individual.<br/><br/>This time round it is the brother of the bride who has gone, a 16 year old genius named Teddy<br/><br/>who also happens to be the favourite of his father<br/><br/>who by the way thinks precious little of Stu<br/><br/>who is extremely worried that the fact that this (now) 9 fingered boy being lost on his watch might count as a minus with the new in-laws<br/><br/>So in these familiarly unfamiliar circumstances there seems to be little option aside from empty the pockets, check the phones and let's go round again. Along the way the trio run into a stolen monk, Russian gangsters, ladyboys, a tattooist and a monkey drug mule, and at every turn they leave a trail of damage somewhat akin to a touring AFL footy team on an offseason trip.<br/><br/>The situation becomes so 'samey' that they might well be working from the same script, anyone who cadged a laugh in the first film returns, the afore-mentioned Mr Chow (Ken Leung), Mike Tyson and many of the events and hijinks are merely tweaked variations from the first film.<br/><br/>My wife rightfully pointed out the fact that somehow a 16 year old Thai boy being lost in Thailand isn't really that big a dilemma. I mean you would hope that the Thai language and customs might not be such a stretch for him<br/><br/>I also wonder how the same three guys end up in the same spot after being absolutely black-out drunk on two separate occasions in two entirely separate continents. I recall when I was younger I had difficulty locating my shoes when awakening from a period of alcohol induced time travel, let alone my mates.<br/><br/>Other flaws include the fact that Alan is leant upon for laughs at every occasion simply because he reacts illogically at every turn, yes it was funny a couple times, but the thirty-fifth time he says something dumb it loses it sheen somewhat. On a related note; Zach G, if you keep on recycling the same character again and again your 15 minutes will soon expire.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 5 / 10. Despite all this I kinda enjoyed The Hangover 2 despite myself, probably because it was in reality a watered down version of itself, but if they try to pull this sh*t again I will have to draw the line.<br/><br/>P.S. To whoever put the soundtrack together: Even one Kanye West song is too many, two Kanye West songs are way out of line, and you only compound the misery by callously including a Black Eyed Peas song to heighten my misery. I'mo be, I'mo be, I'mo be out of patience very soon with this blatantly commercial pseudo hip-hop with no redeeming qualities."

","* out of (****)<br/><br/>Let's cut to the chase: ""The Hangover Part II"" is one of the laziest, unfunniest, and crude films I've ever seen and is the perfect candidate for the worst film of the year. The fact that such a trainwreck was greenlit makes me cringe for Hollywood. Yes, Hollywood has sunken low, but this... this is just hitting rock bottom. The most ironic part is that ""The Hangover"" was one of the best movies of its year. Funny how, fast-forward in time, the iconic sequel winds up being the complete opposite. The sad part such a film like this is making every one of its millions spent back and there'll be more sequels to come, no doubt about it. With a year full of disasters (i.e. ""Sucker Punch"", ""The Rite"", ""Arthur), we might've found a new stinker award.<br/><br/>So what's so rancid and unforgiving about Todd Phillip's sophomore adventure with these mongoloids? First off, almost 95% of the jokes in this movie are completely recycled. I understand as a sequel, you have to include some homages here and there or your humor might be the same, but almost quote for quote, word by word? That just says a lot about your credibility right there. Second of all, this film is a drag. As the film progresses, it increasingly becomes more dull and uninteresting. And what really takes the cake is how lazy this film is. Anything that would be shocking, yet simultaneously innovative is just presented bland and insipid here. Congratulations, Todd, you're film might just snag up a few Razzies.<br/><br/>The acting? Everyone here is under-looked because they leave Alan to be the star of the show and boy, was that the worst idea fathomable. If you don't already know, my favorite character from the first movie was Alan. Every time he was on-screen he just stole every scene and would have me quoting his lines everyday. Now, he is just a waste of a character and someone I would single-handedly like to punch square in the face. Every other actor just looks like they had the life sucked out of them. Don't even get me started on the amateur, poor direction that the director had his grubby little hands on.<br/><br/>You know what I think was the downfall of this movie? The hype got to everyone's head. Here's an idea for a sequel: Either make it right or simply, just don't make it at all. Aside from a few jokes, which are TV sitcom worthy at best, this would've gotten a one, easily. ""The Hangover: Part II"" is not only one of the most disappointing films of the year... it's also the worst."

","The same group of friends that were in Hangover 1 set out for Stu's (Helms) wedding in Thailand. And, as before, of course, they enjoy a last drink with Stu as a single man. And, of course, three of them Phil (Cooper), Alan (Galifianakis) and Stu wake up the next morning in Bangkok, miles away from the wedding site. And none of them, of course, can remember anything of what happened the night before and Teddy (Lee) is not with them and where is he?<br/><br/>The formula is the same. They find a clue where to go and at each place they go to they are told of their bad behavior the night before and somehow come up with another clue toward solving the mystery. And, of course, they remember nothing. Now, all this wouldn't be so bad if the things I witnessed didn't come to pass. When you try too hard to be funny, you fail. And, they failed big time. There is no other way to say it. <br/><br/>Touted as a comedy, I found nothing funny in here. I witnessed a lot of raunchy bathroom behavior that many call humor, a lot of overacting, frontal nudity of both male and female bodies, and raunchy sex language throughout. And, will someone please tell me what Galifianakis' claim to comedy fame is. I do not find him even remotely funny. And, as I mentioned in my H1 review, he was very good in a dramatic role in IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY. Yet, he continues to try comedy. Go figure. <br/><br/>The only breath of fresh air was Mr. Chow (Jeong). Yes, he had the potty mouth (as most did) too, but his delivery kind of livened up the place. He's pretty good. <br/><br/>And, to finish off the formula, you just know a camera will be found that shows pictures of all them and what they did the night before when they couldn't remember anything the next day. And, of course, many of those pictures are really crude. Of course. <br/><br/>The Hangover 2 had to be made because they realized that Hangover 1 was not funny when they promised laughs. Well, not funny except for the taser scenes in front of children as they were LOL funny. But, I guess the joke (give me a break) is on them because this was not funny either. Will there be a H3 to make things right? Stay tuned. (2/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, male and female frontal. Raunchy Sex Talk: Throughout. Language: Throughout"

As is mentioned in the tagline ""Bangkok has them now"", although most audiences will realise that Bangkok has merely replaced Las Vegas, as little else is different.<br/><br/>Still with over $500 million at the the box office director Tod Phillips must have got something right? Meek dentist, Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married to an Asian beauty complete with stereotypical overbearing father, meek mother and idolized talented younger brother Teddy (Lee), a nod to the younger demographic.<br/><br/>Of course his buddies are invited to the bash at an upmarket resort in Thailand, Phil (Cooper) & Doug (Bartha), although man child Alan's (Galifanakis) invite is not forthcoming. Unsurprisingly left on the sidelines due to his errant behaviour in the first film, will he be left behind this time, need we even ask that question.<br/><br/>Everything is going swimmingly apart from the usual inappropriate behaviour by Alan, until the ""one beer"" before the big day, turns into another mammoth hangover wake up scene.<br/><br/>Substitute missing teeth for tattoo's, tigers for a monkey, add in a severed finger, several cocaine ""bumps"" to clear the head, Mike Tyson and stir fry quickly. We are then treated to the stereotypical underside of Bangkok which will do nothing for the Thailand tourist industry. Seedy rooms, criminals in the form of Paul Giamatti and the predictably unpredictable Mr Chow (Cheong), not quite as out of place as some recent films he has appeared in, perhaps the milieu suits his weird character or acting traits better.<br/><br/>Will the ""Wolf Pack"" be able to re-assemble the night before in time for the nuptials to occur on time with everyone happy, if you think not, then maybe you are watching the wrong film.<br/><br/>The journey is the thing and this is where the film deviates from what audiences expect, by providing exactly what audiences expect with no variation on the original film. Less funny, same ""F & C"" bomb heavy dialogue, more raunchy situations, reversing the recent trend from mostly female nudity to a combination of both in the same body. Certainly Ed's new bride seems more understanding than one might expect a new bride to be, stag party mayhem maybe but....<br/><br/>Galifanakis again reprises his role carried across the original ""Hangover"", ""Due Date"" and now the sequel, seemingly popping up in every movie playing a similar part. Cooper of course has gone all ""A"" List since the first film and Helms is also now gainfully employed in the American version of ""The Office"".<br/><br/>Cooper is clearly now too good to be in this tosh and his star quality does show through despite the obvious flaws of the film, Bartha is largely sidelined again and Giamatti obviously fancied a free holiday, with almost a cameo part. Tyson apparently taking singing lessons for his big scene, if this is the result post training then clearly the boxing ring was the right career choice.<br/><br/>Do we need another sequel, do the actors need another film to bolster their careers, of course not. With box office receipts north of half a billion dollars, this however will be a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>Inversely proportional monetary returns against critical or enjoyment value, we are clearly heading in the wrong direction and this trend is unlikely to be reversed in the final installment. Clearly poor reviews nor bad word of mouth will stop the ""Wolf Pack"" juggernaut, big business has them now.<br/><br/>Curiously the closing credits on the Blu-Ray version, retains the controversial fake recreation still of a real life execution, which is odd bearing in mind the offence the shot has caused. This perhaps emphasizes the apparent contempt director Phillips has for his audience.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>A lazy remake of the original and a poor facsimile. Might raise the occasional titter but largely can be avoided unless the ""Wolf Pack"", the Asian version, really appeals.<br/><br/>Disappointing <br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

What kind of director thinks that it would be funny to include such a disgusting creature as the highlight at the end of his film? I won't be watching anything directed by Todd Phillips again.

","Two years after the first film and the wolf pack is back again with Stu (Ed Helms) preparing to marry Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Thailand. Her conservative father disapproves of Stu and doesn't consider him a proper doctor. Both Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Dug (Justin Bartha) are also disappointed that Stu has opted not have a proper bachelor party. Stu is reluctant to invite Alan (Zack Galifianakis) to the wedding, even though he has been waiting eagerly for the pack to reunite. Stu quickly caves in and the group travels to Thailand together. Tagging along with them this time is Lauren's gifted younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee). One night on a beach in Thailand the boys, including Teddy, decide to have a drink together. Stu, Phil and Alan wake up together the next morning and find themselves in a sweaty Bangkok hotel. Teddy is missing, someone's finger is left in the room, Alan's head has been shaved, there's a monkey jumping around and Stu has a real tattoo on his face. On top of this, they discover that Alan invited Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) to party with them the night before. The boys set off to uncover what happened and to find Teddy before the wedding. <br/><br/>The Hangover Part II is a film stooped so far into stupidity that it never had room for Mel Gibson. Originality, or a lack of, is the least of director Todd Phillips problems here. The film starts reasonably, with Stu showing his reluctance because of what happened in the first picture. It looks as though he might have learnt something from his previous experience. Could this be a strand of intelligence? That strand is quickly chewed up and spat out because everything else here works to appeal, very strictly, to the lowest common denominator. The Hangover (2009) earned a lot of mileage from the freshness of its characters and their distinct personalities. But this entry suffers terminally from sequel syndrome: there's no change or development in the characters because of the studio's need to recycle what worked once before. We gave the first film the benefit of the doubt because its characters promised this to be a one off adventure, never to be spoken of again. But what sort of message does it send now when a character has his finger cut off, wakes up in a lift and says that he feels good even though he doesn't remember anything? Alcoholism pollutes the world as devastating as any drug today but here is a mainstream film that comfortably celebrates idiocy by letting its characters off with a laughably soft and irresponsible finale. The plot is already hopelessly illogical but narrative points like the riot, the severed finger (hilarious?) and Stu's tattoo are weightless and trivial because in the end who cares, so long as these yahoos had a good time. <br/><br/>Taking the film on pure entertainment value and Part II is pitifully dull. Although it insists on recycling a number of plot contrivances, it lacks any particularly memorable set pieces from the first film and there's little joy to be found in the dialogue. The colourful quips from the first entry are gone and the film is more puerile than I ever remember the series being. The ultra lowbrow humour, involving masturbation, sodomy and racial stereotypes, has no role other than to excite teenage boys so they can collectively cry 'ewww' together. There's also a worthless car chase that doubles as a shootout but the scene involving a transsexual prostitute is a disturbing new low for films of this kind. This was never going to be an actor's film but on a comedic level the performances can do little to spark the limp comedy. Alan just seems to trot out dumb lines and Stu's shrieking is noisy and embarrassing. In a minute role a bloated Paul Giamatti has little to work with. And Mr. Chow is doing his very best to find a place on a list for one of the most obnoxious characters in cinematic history. And on that character there's more than just a touch of racism about the contrast between fun loving Americans, who are just out for a good time and the way Asians are represented as either ultra conservatives, dangerous or just freaks. Part III of this dwindling series is apparently already in the works. There's never been a better time to become a teetotaller."

","¨Well we're living here in Allentown, and he's driven our lives into the ground. When we woke up we were wasted and drunk; Phil got shot, we got beaten by a monk. I was happy and my life was good; getting married like a dentist should.¨ The trailers got it right when they said the Wolfpack was back; Phil, Stu, Alan, and Doug got together again in this follow up to the highly successful 2008 comedy The Hangover. They even got Mr. Chow to return for the sequel, but what they failed to mention was that one of the main characters from the previous film was missing: Las Vegas. The second part takes place in sunny Bangkok, a long ways away from home. Instead of waking up at a five star suite hotel room, the guys wake up in a roach infested cheap motel room. The movie follows an almost identical premise and the jokes are pretty much the same, but Bangkok just isn't Vegas and that was actually missing in this film. Other than that I had no other problems with this movie: it was fun, entertaining, and all the main characters were back at it again. Same players, same scenarios, different location. With these talented actors it is pretty hard to mess up a movie like this so if you enjoyed the previous movie than odds are you will like this one. The Hangover was one of my favorite comedies of the decade, the second one doesn't quite live up to that category, but it still is entertaining. Of course the originality and freshness from the original was missing, but I didn't have any problems in seeing these guys reunite once again. Todd Phillips was also back as the director after the disappointing and unsuccessful Due Date (which also starred Zach Galifianakis), but he got right back on track where he had left out in The Hangover. He also collaborated with the screenplay along with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong (who replaced Jon Lucas and Scott Moore from the original).<br/><br/>Its been two years since Doug (Justin Bartha) got married and now it's Stu's (Ed Helms) turn. He has fallen in love with Lauren (Jamie Chung) and is planning on getting married in Thailand where her family currently lives. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is upset that Stu is getting married abroad because he has to buy tickets for him and his wife, but he gets even more upset when he discovers that Stu isn't going to have a bachelor party. Stu invited them to IHOP the morning before they had to travel and tells them that there will be no party, so they must enjoy their breakfast and consider that his bachelor party. He wants to avoid everything that happened to them in Vegas. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) finds out Stu is getting married and is depressed because he hasn't been invited to the wedding. Doug convinces Stu to invite Alan since that trip to Vegas has been the highlight of his life and seems to have mentally never left the place. Stu reluctantly decides to invite him so the Wolfpack get together again and travel to a beautiful resort in Thailand. Lauren's younger brother, Teddy (Mason Lee), is studying in Stanford and also travels with the crew, although Alan doesn't like this one bit because he isn't part of the Wolfpack. A couple of nights before the wedding the guys decide to roast marshmallows by a campfire on the beach. They all have one beer and the next thing we know they wake up in a cheap motel room in Bangkok without remembering what happened the night before. Phil wakes up first and finds a finger in a bucket full of water that seems to belong to Teddy, Alan wakes up with his head shaved, Stu wakes up with a tattoo on his face, and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) wakes up alongside them. The movie then follows the same premise the first one did as they try to find clues to piece together what happened to them and where Teddy is.<br/><br/>The movie is missing some of the freshness the original film had, but I still had a fun time. More of the same is not necessarily bad, but it just isn't as funny either. We kind of expect some of the things that are going to happen. Some of the highlights of the film include new secondary characters like Kingsley, who is played by Paul Giamatti and he is really funny in this film. There is also Samir (Bryan Callen), an Arab dealer searching for Mr. Chow, who has a few funny seconds on screen, but I wish his character would have been given more time. There are also some more funny cameos along the way and surprising moments, although pretty much all the suspense and mystery that the first film had is missing in this one. The Hangover II is still a very raunchy comedy like the first, but the effect the first film had on me was just missing this time. I still can't complain because I laughed throughout the film. It was fun seeing these characters back in action again and was very pleased with the film. If you liked the first film, you will probably like this one, if you didn't like the first one then there is no need for you to see the second one because the premise is the same. Just don't expect another masterpiece.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"jboothmillard","5","0","2","18 June 2011"," The Hangover Part II
","The first film a huge surprise box office hit, it reminded me of Dude, Where's My Car?, but it wasn't rubbish, it was fantastically funny, and then I heard that they were doing a sequel, I was willing to give it a chance, from director Todd Phillips (Road Trip, Old School, Due Date). Basically it has been two years since the events in Las Vegas, and Stu Price (Ed Helms) is getting married to his fiancée Lauren (Jamie Chung), and to celebrate he, Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), to Stu's dismay Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis), and to Alan's irritation the brother-in-law-to-be Teddy (Mason Lee). They all travel to Thailand where the wedding will take place, and the boys all spend a quiet stag evening on the beach drinking a little beer toasting marshmallows over a camp fire, they make sure Alan doesn't have any dodgy drugs this time. The next morning however they once again wake up from a bad hangover, in a trashed seedy hotel apartment in Bangkok, joined by Alan's friend from Las Vegas, Leslie Chow (Ken Jeong), the Asian gangster, Alan has a completely shaved head, and Stu with a permanent Mike Tyson style tattoo on his face. While Doug calls them safe and sound back at the hotel resort, they are missing Teddy, and they find his severed finger, as well as a chain-smoking capuchin monkey, so now begins a journey to retrace their steps with clues and leads. Along the way they find out where Stu got his face tattooed, they bail out who they think is Teddy but is actually a Monk who has taken a strict vow of silence, they visited a strip club where Stu had sex with a she-male, and the monkey deals things to people, so gangsters chase them again. Of course, despite swearing that he had no involvement this time with their lack of memory, Alan confesses that he drugged one of the bags of marshmallows with muscle relaxants and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) medication, he intended to have Teddy be knocked out, but he mixed the bags. After being conned by the police, led by Kingsley (Paul Giamatti) into busting a drugs ring, Phil is sure he will have to call the bride-to-be to explain everything, but Stu pieces some facts together and realises where to find Teddy, he is trapped in the elevator because the power went down. In the end they all make it by speed boat to the wedding in time, Mike Tyson is a special guest, and they again relive the night that they don't remember with the photos on Teddy's phone. Also starring Jeffrey Tambor as Sid Garner, Sasha Barrese as Tracy Billings and Gillian Vigman as Stephanie Wenneck. I think the bigger reason I saw this follow up wasn't just because I enjoyed the original film, but because there was some controversy surrounding it, such as Mel Gibson fired from the role as the Tattooist because of disagreements (and possibly that abusive phone call recording), and Mike Tyson suing the filmmakers, forcing them to consider digitally removing the tattoo from Helms's face. The cast are still well casted, and there are some original funny moments in the story, but to me it felt like the same film all over again, only in a different location, but it's not a bad comedy sequel. Worth watching!"

","If you have seen hangover 1 and liked it, then you can think about skipping this one. But if you loved Hangover 1, you must watch 2 also. Except for a similar plot and similar ending, everything else is different this time. The jokes are more hilarious and vulgar, there is a lot more nudity than what was see last time (that may not be a good thing for most of us), and some surprise at the end...... Given the fact that work for Hangover 2 was in process while Hangover 1 was ready for release, it makes sense that the writer used a similar story. Since this year hasn't seen too many good comedy movies, I think the Hangover 2 makes a mark for itself."

","A decent sequel to a great comedy its basically the same as the first just add a different setting a few new gross out laughs then u get basically a poor man s hangover . its not a bad movie its just so similar to the first but fans of the first will enjoy this run of the mill sequel. The characters do the same phil acts like a jackass stu is a wimp with a wild side and alan is his crazy self. the cast has good chemistry and with more of a role for mr chow makes for some laughs. u will enjoy this movie if u are a fan of the first but if your not u will think its stupid hopefully they can inprove with hangover 3 but we will wait and see wanted to give this movie a higher rating than a 6 but couldn't because of its similarities to the first but u should still see this as its better than most comedies out there."

","After reading reviews from critics I respect, I was reluctant to see this film, which I heard was an inferior copy of the original. I totally loved the original, and had limited hopes for this one. So I was pleasantly surprised. Don't take this as a recommendation.<br/><br/>Some potentially hilarious scenes are a fizzle, such as the bit with the monk. Some scenes are more gross than funny, such as Samir's night club with the pole dancers. But there is one element that is priceless: the monkey. Especially the later scenes with the monkey. I usually don't like monkeys in movies, but this is the best performance by a monkey I have ever seen. A lot of the performance is probably CGI, but still . . ."

","I liked Hangover II. The gags still hit you in that disturbing way we have come to love. Fine performances once again by Zach, Ed, Bradley and Ken Jeong as Mr. Chou is given more screen time. The director uses Bangkok to good effect.<br/><br/>If you saw the first movie and liked it, go ahead and see the second. You won't be too disappointed. If you didn't see the first I can't recommend seeing this one until you do. Many of the jokes refer back to gags in the first film.<br/><br/>And there in lies the problem, Hangover 2 isn't fresh. It's just more of the same. Now the SAME is still pretty damn funny. Some big laughs save it from being a so-so movie.<br/><br/>One big problem I had with the film is that nothing was done with the character Doug again. Not to spoil anything but it's not Doug who goes missing this time. I felt this was the perfect opportunity to see Doug in action. He could have roamed Bangkok with the ""three BFFs"" or it would have been cool to see how he runs interference for the guys at the luxury resort they're staying at. Alas more potential comedy was missed. Will this be rectified in a HANGOVER III? Will anyone care?"

","Comedy is not one of my favorite movie genres, i am more of a Thriller or Drama type of guy. however, i like to watch Comdies every now and then. When i first watched the first Hangover movie, i was not impressed much and i thought that it was over hyped and over rated. I was really puzzled by the over praise the first movie got, i thought maybe it was ruined for me because i saw too many clips before i watched the movie itself, and the trailer really did give away a lot of key moments. So this time around, i avoided watching the trailer, and avoided reading or hearing anything of the new Hangover 2, and i guess it paid off, because i felt that i enjoyed this more than the first for sure.<br/><br/>one of the things i liked about part 2 is that it takes place in Thailand, i thought that events happening in unfamiliar territory is always fun, and the director captured some very lovely scenes of the city adding a nice flavor to the film.<br/><br/>I was also surprised with several scenes that were unexpected to me, "" again probably because i avoided the trailer "", the story was fun and of course similar to the first, but kept me interested enough. i liked the action scenes they added to the plot, made it a bit more lively.<br/><br/>As i mentioned earlier, im not a big fan of comedy, and i thought many scenes that were suppose to be funny ended up being ridiculous and lame, but that is just me. however, there were some scenes that were actually funny and i laughed out loud at.<br/><br/>I like Bradly Cooper, and Ed helms was funny. I however, find Zach Galifiankis a bit annoying, and he seems to play the same character in all his movies "" Due date ? "", but the Asian guy Jeong seems even more annoying, they both don't seem naturally funny to me. I loved the Monkey though !! :)<br/><br/>to end up, i thought it was a better experience for me than the first, some funny scenes and a good enough plot. Loved the Thailand scenes, and the monkey. enjoyable, i would recommend this."

It's a plot we have seen before. Even though it is very funny, it has lost the novelty and surprise factor, so ""The Hangover Part II"" has not got the amazing hilarity of ""The Hangover"". It's a good comedy, it's just that ""The Hangover"" set the bar too high, that makes the sequel almost impossible to surpass. And I was wondering why Alan became bald, and why Teddy lost his finger.

"GeorgeEdwardMaier","5","0","1","2 June 2011"," Could have been better
","The hangover films fall into this category where you have to just enjoy them for what they are and not think about them. They are very purely entertaining, on a simple level. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, I'm just saying maybe we shouldn't judge these films on the same criteria we would a film that's attempting be be something else, such as Black Swan, which is one of the biggest contrasts you could draw from the hangover films.<br/><br/>There's a distinct lack of believability to the plot line of this sequel, as was true about the first film. Things happen often without true or thought through cause, which I suppose is intended to be an element of comedy, but sometimes I find it is taking a short cut to laughs, and achieving them on a cheaper level. It's much harder to get laughs about more believable situations, and the trademark of these hangover films seems to be cheap laughs. <br/><br/>Did someone hit repeat? Many of the narrative sub-structures, in addition to the main plot line, seem to follow the first film. The beginning and resolution are pretty much exactly the same as in the prequel. <br/><br/>I found the idea of a smoking monkey frankly disturbing, not funny as the filmmakers tried to pass it off. It paints dark reflections of animal cruelty and anthropomorphising in our society which are key issues, and this film tries to make them funny... I don't think it works, and no one else in the cinema seemed to laugh either. I thought the human race was getting past the idea of novelty from animal cruelty? <br/><br/>Cinematography needs to be noted also, generally average. They seemed to put a lot of effort into getting really beautiful establishing shots, then slack off for every other shot. Furthermore they seemed to follow conventions and not try anything experimental or different. A bit of a disappointment if I'm honest. <br/><br/>I know my review so far may lead you to believe differently, but I actually enjoyed the film overall. I just wouldn't like to see it again. I think the film is worth a watch once you will likely get a few laughs even if there are prolonged moments when it's just boring and predictable and one of the key jokes relying on the exploitation of transsexual characters by supporting backwards stereotypes."
"moviexclusive","8","0","4","1 June 2011"," Wilder, crazier and even more hilarious, Part II is more of the same kind of unadulterated fun you wanna have with the Wolf Pack
","""It happened again,"" confesses Phil to Tracy in the brief flash-forward at the beginning of the movie. Ask yourself this- how much did you enjoy the first movie? And how much are you willing to see the Wolf Pack do it all over again? If your answer is yes to both, then we guarantee you that you'll absolutely love ""The Hangover: Part II"", because Todd Phillips' answer to his most successful R-rated comedy ever is essentially wilder, crazier and a whole lot funnier.<br/><br/>The groom may be different this time round- Stu (Ed Helms) is the one getting married- but the premise is pure déjà vu. Phil (Bradley Cooper), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha) are back to join Stu in his wedding in Thailand, but after a supposedly harmless seaside toast to the groom, Phil, Alan and Stu wake up to find themselves in a Bangkok hotel room. Of course, how can their night of debauchery and drunkenness be complete without some physical disfigurements, an animal and oh a missing member of the party?<br/><br/>Yet again, the trio's quest is to find the fourth guy- the one misplaced happens to be Stu's soon-to-be brother-in-law, Teddy (Mason Lee- Ang Lee's son by the way)- though this time their monkey business has also turned literal in the form of a chain-smoking capuchin monkey. And among the other bizarre characters they will meet is a wheelchair-bound monk on a vow of silence, a straight-talking tattoo artist (Nick Cassavetes replacing Liam Neeson who in turn replaced Mel Gibson), and a local crime lord (Paul Giamatti). <br/><br/>Phillips is the only returning writer from the original, but newcomers Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong have more than gotten the hang (pardon the pun) of the comedic beats which made the first movie such an unadulterated delight. There is nary a dull moment in the entire movie, with each of the new supporting characters adding their own colour and verve to the story. They also know a crowd-pleaser when they see one- hence the return of the off the wall Asian gangster Mr Chow (Ken Jeong), who once again plays a pivotal role in what went down the night before.<br/><br/>With the experience of Las Vegas, Phillips returns with renewed vigour and confidence to tell yet another raunchy tale of misadventure- and he isn't afraid to push the limits even further. Mr Chow's penis is mistaken by Stu and Alan for mushrooms; said capuchin monkey likes to give blowjobs; and last but not least, Stu realises that the morning after that the prostitute he had sex with the night before is in fact a lady-boy. The assuredness by which he directs the madcap proceedings shows in many of the daring creative decisions he exercises in the film, and many of these shocking moments are also laugh-out-loud hilarious.<br/><br/>But as with always, it is the chemistry between the cast that holds the movie together. Here, Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis slip almost too easily into their respective roles, and the friendship and camaraderie among the diametrically opposed characters is even more convincing and enjoyable to watch thanks to the actors' familiarity. Galifianakis' infantile act has lost some of its novelty the second time around, but his socially maladjusted character still gets some of the film's best lines. The scene-stealer however turns out to be Ken Jeong, whose wacky exuberance and derring-do through some of the most insane moments simply lights up the screen.<br/><br/>Indeed, with the combined appeal of Jeong, Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis, who can resist such a boisterous reunion of the Wolf Pack? Sure, it's basically the same things happening all over again, but who's complaining when it turns out as uproarious as before? A huge part of the delight of the first movie came from watching Phil, Stu and Alan have fun with the kind of gleeful abandon we wished we could summon in our own lives. And once again the Wolf Pack has given us the chance to live vicariously through their misadventures- so really what are you waiting for?"

","Having missed out on the first HANGOVER movie, I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, though I had a few notions: non-stop zaniness, as well as raunchy and potentially dangerous situations. It's a tried-and-true formula that has been with us since the early days of cinema. While you sometimes get horrible variations (the countless American PIE off-shoots come to mind) this time, it works! Once again, we follow the gang of drunken idiots on the verge of a wedding, who wake up and have to piece together what happened the previous night. Only this time, instead of Las Vegas, it's Bangkok. Great scenery by the way. You really get a sense of place, as we visit dingy night clubs, bars, and a strip club that's not quite what it seems.

So if you liked the first one, you should like the second one. I really don't get those who low-rate it (Roeper) simply because it's like the first. The fact that the same formula was used does not in and of itself make it a ""bad"" movie, which is the biggest dig I hear about the sequel. No. A good movie is a good movie...even if it's like its predecessor.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movie a 7 because it was HILARIOUS. Raunchy as all get-out, maybe a little too much so at some points, but still it delivers what it sets out to deliver: mouth-wide-open at how far they dare to go shock mixed with fun and humor and even a little sentimentalism. That's the takeaway from this movie. It is EXACTLY what you think, what you expect, what you are hoping for. It is a movie customized for its audience. That's all it is and that's all it promises to be and if you liked the first one, leave your over-expectation at the door and just enjoy an encore."

There is hardly anything new in this movie.<br/><br/>Phil, Doug and Alan went to Thailand for Stu's wedding, and predictably got drunk and then our story starts. They woke up in a god-forsaken place , and then starts the journey to retrace their previous night's activities to find their friend (This time it's not Doug).<br/><br/>The awesome threesome of Phil, Stu and Alan is still great to watch. Phil's charismatic presence and tries of making the situation stable, Stu's hysteria and Alan's brilliant dumbness will still keep you hooked in this one.Though,quite a lot of the scenes and consequently the humor is taken from the part I. Especially the last ending scene. That was way to predictable and one can say a complete rip-off from the predecessor.<br/><br/>There's nothing new for the ones who have watched the old 1st part.

(Come on, how miserable can you be to rate a film that people laugh their bums off watching with one star).<br/><br/>To said reviewers: Seriously, this is HANGOVER PART II. It's called that for a reason, what did you expect, for the director to try reinvent the wheel? It's like expecting Jurassic Park 2 to take place in 2011 with fake dinosaurs.<br/><br/>OK, let's go back to our short review.<br/><br/>For people who didn't watch the first part (Do they even exist? If so, please go and watch it first, it's awesome), this is the principle that both films are based on: characters suffer from an extreme hangover caused by mixing drugs and alcohol, they also lose memory of the last night's events and try to backtrack their steps by following small clues. Hilarity ensues. That's it, no more, no less.<br/><br/>Regarding ""child exploitation joke"" which some female reviewer wrote a wall of text about (one joke mind you, 10 seconds screen time) as far as I know problem's not with the movie but with Thailand. Period. This is a film for mature audiences that can take it for what it is, a comedy movie and means of entertainment.<br/><br/>Saying that, there are some hilarious moments on screen, in terms of sequels...

It's tough to care, you just want to sit back and laugh at the next stupid thing Alan is going to do. Zack Galifianakis is far from a versatile actor, but he has the one type of character he can play down to a tee. ""The Hangover Part II"" just delivers, without doing much more.

","""The Hangover"" was one of the best comedies of 2009. While the plot had similarities to 'Dude Where's My Car,' it proved a far superior beast and the sequel was hotly anticipated. Director Todd Phillips has taken the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mantra to the extreme, as ""The Hangover Part II"" is virtually a shot-for-shot remake of the original. While it may be easy to write it off as cynically cashing in on the first film's success, the sequel is quite enjoyable with references to the first movie and a few 'here we go again' in-jokes.<br/><br/>The plot this time concerns Stu (Ed Helms) who is getting married in Thailand to Lauren (Jamie Chung). After his plans for a quiet bachelor brunch are thwarted, 'The Wolfpack' of Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis – who only increases his whiny man-child characterisation) travel to Thailand for the wedding. After an awkward pre-wedding function, they lose Lauren's prodigal little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) – Bangkok has him now - and wake up in a dilapidated Bangkok hotel with a monkey and Mr. Chou (Ken Jeong) who steals every scene he's in and is the highlight of the movie.<br/><br/>If you're after character development, you won't find it here, but that's not the point. ""Part II"" is all about big laughs, some gross out humour (mainly Stu's unfortunate encounter with a Bangkok stripper) and plenty of action thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>While some may criticise ""Part II"" for a lack of originality, or outright laziness, if you leave your cynicism at the door, ""Part II"" is an enjoyable night out at the movies."
"MorgothsReach","6","0","3","29 May 2011"," A Funny But Very Similar Addition to The Hangover Series
","Todd Phillips' sequel to the hugely successful 'The Hangover' continues the odyssey of three friends attempting to find their lost companion after a drunken night gone completely awry. In the first film it was Doug, the groom, who went missing but this time around his place has been filled by Teddy, brother of Stu's fiancé. This isn't the only similarity in 'The Hangover Part 2' which has lifted proceedings out of Las Vegas and dropped them into Bangkok. On a positive note though the film is still very funny in places with the biggest laughs usually being at the expense of Stu who continues the habit of disfiguring his body: a tattoo on the face is his reward this time for his troubles. The biggest problem however with the film is its lack of imagination with the writers opting to reiterate the formula of the first film. This encompasses three friends: Phil, Stu and Alan travelling around an unknown city in pursuit of information to piece together the events of the previous night. The idea worked well as evidenced by the first film's box office intake and it seems the creative team has experienced some trepidation in changing this method. As a result, 'The Hangover Part 2' feels like something of a missed opportunity. With the stroke of genius that was relocating to Thailand there should have been a wealth of ideas pouring in to use at their disposal instead of what we have as the finished product. For example, seeing as how it deals with three foreign tourists in a country that's unknown to them why not have them separated and alone before attempting to find their way back to one another or have Doug take part in proceedings this time. There is also a palpable lack of danger in the film that could have been exploited to good use such as the sleazy underbelly of Bangkok. We do have glimpses of drug dealers and transsexual strippers but there is a feeling afterwards that more could have been explored and since it is a film, exaggerated. The three leads put in pretty good shifts with Ed Helms surpassing the other two with his portrayal of a Stu struggling to cope with each new discovery with one particularly bad revelation being one of the funniest moments of the film. Bradley Cooper as Phil does not actually have a lot to do in the film with the majority of mishaps being inflicted on Stu which is a shame because Phil's position as the head of the group could have been reverted to take him out of his comfort zone. Zach Galifianakis grows into the role of Alan after a clumsy opening which sees the plot signposted for the audience instead of the easy transition of the first film. In 'The Hangover Part 2' we get a more petulant Alan than the first film but as the film continues we are gradually introduced to the character of Alan that made 'The Hangover' such an enjoyable film. As a sequel to the original this film does not quite match up to its predecessor but there are still some great moments such as the 'death' of Mr Chow and the realisation that the lead characters scaled a Buddhist Temple and kidnapped a gardening monk. There are disappointments such as the widely debated tattoo parlour scene that saw both Mel Gibson and Liam Neeson come and go. It is quite clear that there was a rewrite and as such it is a scene with few laughs. Other opportunities missed could be their one and very standard scene in a Bangkok police station with this scene in particular an obvious platform for comedy. In the end though 'The Hangover Part 2' does exactly what it's supposed to do: provide some laughs but you may feel like bringing out your copy of the original to placate any longings that the sequel does not satisfy."
"nameesh","8","0","5","29 May 2011"," Good one to watch
","Though this movie is a sequel and does not quite compare itself to the previous part, it is worth watching. I would say many times better than the sci-fi and the cartoon movies that have come up recently.<br/><br/>Some of the incidents in the movie are quite funny to watch. Every character in the movie seem to have got into the role very well. Especially the roles of Stu, Phil and Alan came out quite good. But, expected more out of Alan's role. The idea of bringing monkey to be one of the characters to watch out for was very nice.<br/><br/>Speaking of location, glad that it is not based on the Vegas which seems to be the usual location to get a hangover. Hangover can happen part of world.<br/><br/>Would have loved the movie more if things were more structured. The way these people come up with the idea as to where Teddy is or say, suddenly the keys of motor-boat appearing seemed irrational. Anyways, decent portrayal of anyone who would get into a super hang-over ;)"
"mahaveerjain_85","6","0","2","29 May 2011"," Not great ..but OK
","2nd version is not as great as 1st though but for fun you can watch it. Most of time it is quite similar to 1st one; guys hangout before marriage and suddenly woke up in Bangkok and start same story again .. one guy is missing and they search whole Bangkok and find it in same building ... So every time is quite predictable. Alan is act like dumb ass and every time he open mouth he spoke totally against the event.. There was some hype about monkey ; but I don't think there is anything good about it.. there is very few scene of monkey and there is nothing extraordinary about it. It is not a family movie thats for sure so be ready to watch some of creepy scene like shemale scene.... If you haven't watched 1st watch may be you like this one"
"DarkVulcan29","8","0","4","28 May 2011"," Feels less like a sequel, and more like a remake.
","Stu(Ed Helms) is getting married, and travels to Thailand for his big day. And Phil(Bradley Cooper), Doug(Justin Barta), and the man child named Alan(Zach Galifianakis), are his grooms man. Two days they decide to have a male bonding night, and they take Teddy(Mason Lee) along, who is the brides younger brother. But it then becomes a repeat of happened in Vegas, cause Phil, Alan, and Stu wake up in Bangkok, and not knowing how they got there, to make matters worse, they lost Teddy. They try to trace there steps, and find Teddy, but misadventure quickly ensue. Will they ever find Teddy, before it's late? <br/><br/>It never tries to be different, despite some little differences, it's pretty much a rehash of the original. But it was still funny as ever. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms just keep you rolling in your seat, so does Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow. This film really raises the bar of raunchy humor, but unlike Your Highness, The Hangover part 2 gives you time to breath between it all. But if you are easily offended, you should not see this movie."
"hemant-k-rawat","8","0","6","28 May 2011"," Height of Superb Comedy
","This is an ultimate hilarious movie.Every contributing person, giving its best in presenting such a wonderful movie. Alan, has been innocent and awesome as usual and damn too funny as well. Stu is still suffering from this problem of love with prostitutes during hangover. In all this has been such a superb movie. Phil is a dude and proves that dudism still prevails. Chaow as a gangster is fantastic and did full justice to his role. Alan's indifferent response towards each and every situation has been awesome. I was waiting to watch a good movie for a long time and my thirst was quenched after experiencing such a HANGOVER. Watched it yesterday but still the movie is rolling in front of me and dialogues echoing in my head. Awesome.... Stupendous...superb.. :D"
"rgkarim","7","0","4","27 May 2011"," Was it as strong of a hangover?
","Was it as hard of a hangover?<br/><br/>Memorial Day weekend opened up with a bang yesterday as Kung Fu Panda 2 and The Hangover Part 2 opened up. It seems that this weekend was destined to be sequel weekend and I'm here to discuss one of the sequels and whether it's worth your valuable time. The Hangover Part II fits the formula that its predecessor did two years ago. Despite the pact that is made early on in the movie by Stu (Ed Helms), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) , the guys get drunk on alcohol, wake up in a hotel, and start their journey off to find the missing friend, the bride to be's brother Teddy (Mason Lee) whose finger is currently the only clue they have to the mystery. One phone call later from Doug (Justin Bartha) and the gang hit the Bangkok streets in search for the answers they so desperately seek. So the question is, was this movie worth it? Is the same plot and different location worth $8-$10 of your hard earned money and nearly two hours of your valuable vacation time? To help you make this decision let's cover some facts about this movie. First of all the movie is raunchier than the first installment of the film, especially a particular scene where transvestites and a night club are involved. The graphic depictions of police rioting, coke snorting, and the male genitalia are constantly thrown into your face throughout the entire movie, which depending on your humor can be a good or a bad thing. This graphicness even carries on to the credits, which provides a lot of information that the movie itself does not provides, and some of the pictures can be a little extreme, even for this movie. Constantly interspersed throughout the chaos of this movie, is Stu's constant whining, Phil's constant use of the F word and Alan's random comedy lines. The first two aspects are funny to a point, but quickly get annoying and predictable. Alan's contribution is kind of a 50:50 mix of funny and annoying for me. There are points in the movie where his one liners and actions are perfectly timed which made me laugh, or at least chuckle, during the movie. Yet there were times where I felt the movie centered too much on his comedy, and his lines were stale and annoying. As for the situations they were put in, I wasn't as surprised, shocked, or entertained as I was in Vegas. Most of the scenes were incredibly predictable and didn't seem as dire or extreme as what we saw in Vegas. With the exception of the nightclub, most of the places they visited were not really that exotic or scary, which left me somewhat bored throughout the movie. In fact if it were not for the monkey or Mr. Chow, then I believe this movie would have been absolutely dead. This brings me to my next point, fans of Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) will not be disappointed, as the maniacal, lack of morals, outspoken, Asian gangster is back. The stand-up comedian returns in all of his glory as his obnoxious voice fills the screen for probably a good thirty minutes of the movie. Mr. Chow makes a good portion of the plot and even when he is ""chilling"" somewhere off screen his actions are driving the plot. Yes if you thought the comedian was bad news in the first movie, then you have seen nothing compared to this film. Overall Hangover Part II is a diluted version of the first movie. The potential for the experience in Bangkok was just not reached, and it felt like this movie was somewhat rushed in the past two years. Again the acting is fine, and the comedy feels sort of the same, but it seems to me that this sequel could use a revamp. Despite some witty comedy and a very adorable and crafty monkey, this movie really did not deliver to the expectations I had for this movie. Thus my Robbie rating for this movie is about a 7.0 for this sequel. Intended audiences for this movie will include: Die Hard fans of the series, Bradley Cooper or Zach Galifianakis fans, people who like cute monkeys, and fans who like a lot of Oriental Humor. Avoiding audiences: People who are taking 8 year old to the movies, yes I saw a dad bring his son to the movie, people who are easily offended, and those who don't want to see genitalia on screen Until next time, this is rgkarim signing off."
"neil-476","8","0","4","27 May 2011"," Good fun, but lightning didn't strike twice
","With sequels, the question is always whether to do more of the same, or whether to do something completely different. Wisely, perhaps, the producers of Hangover 2 have decided to go for more of the same. They have correctly concluded that what enabled them to catch lightning in a bottle first time round was an engaging mixture of an intriguing premise, well conceived characters, a plot line which held your attention as the mystery of what had happened was gradually unwrapped, excellent ensemble playing, and a very funny script.<br/><br/>All the above are present and correct second time round, with the added bonus of some exotic locations - the disastrous bachelor party takes place in Thailand instead of Las Vegas - and, perhaps, a more dangerous set of problems to unravel.<br/><br/>While this is all very enjoyable, it remains essentially a re-run of the first film in a more humid climate, so it doesn't have the benefit of unexpectedness from which its predecessor benefited. When the inevitable Hangover 3 appears, I think it needs to investigate going in a different direction.<br/><br/>This film does not need the bad language which is in it. Some would have been OK, but there are places where it is distractingly unwelcome.<br/><br/>While Zach Galifianakis reprises the idiot from another planet which was his breakthrough role in the first movie, Ken Jeong remains, for me, the jewel in the crown."
