"Loving_Silence","10","298","319","12 August 2010"," An Epic in every sense of the word.
","Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.<br/><br/>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The Two Towers is worth watching just to see the Battle of Helm's Deep. It is one of the most impressive battle sequences to hit the big screen. But then there's so much more than that-this movie also features amazing special effects with Gollum, dramatic political tension in Rohan, and fantastic moments with the Ents. This is probably my favorite chapter of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy."
"rc_whittle","10","273","317","19 December 2002"," A standing ovation for all concerned.
","It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.<br/><br/>This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).<br/><br/>Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...<br/><br/>A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.<br/><br/>Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.<br/><br/>If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.<br/><br/>Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat."
"Mithrindir","10","101","115","30 December 2004"," A True Fantasy Movie
","From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made."
"docmonster","Null","103","123","18 December 2002"," Hail The Heroes!
","Every great adventure story worth telling has a solid hero - someone who puts others before themselves and uses their talents to do their best at keeping the forces of evil at bay even if it means the loss of life and limb. At its core, this movie has eight such heroes and each one lives up to the call. From Pippin and Merry, the lost hobbits who aid the Ents in battle, to Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas who held back the hordes at Helms Deep to Frodo and Samwise who continue to make their dangerous and arduous trek to Mount Doom. All of these characters are heroes and they're played with love, respect and meaning.<br/><br/>Though the acting in this film was top notch throughout, I found myself amazed by Gollum's (motion captured body and voice by Andy Serkis) overall performance. Though obviously CGI, there was so much emotion in this character that I couldn't help believe he was real! Though ""Final Fantasy"" was the only movie that created the most realistic CGI characters that dominated an entire film, Gollum is lightyears ahead with the simple fact that this deformed li'l hobbit seemed human. He had the spark of life behind those eyes that the FF ""cast"" lacked.<br/><br/>As a film, this movie has it all - action, drama, comedy - but none of it would've worked without characters we cared about, villains we despised and heroes we cheered for. With the obvious success of the first two installments, the release of the final film next December may prove this to be THE BEST trilogy ever made!"
"justinrsko","10","255","318","8 December 2002"," The final hour of The Two Towers is grand, terrifying, and epic on a biblical level.
","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.<br/><br/>As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.<br/><br/>As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.<br/><br/>As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.<br/><br/>In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.<br/><br/>If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers."
"joe_unander","10","149","185","18 December 2002"," If you're a fan, that's not about to change.
","Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.<br/><br/>The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).<br/><br/>For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.<br/><br/>In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, 10/10."
"jedsalazar","10","127","160","19 December 2002"," Beautiful Perfection
","The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful.  This film left me breathless.  I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.<br/><br/>Let's start with Gollum.  Gollum gave an astonishing performance.  The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.  The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor.  Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor.  For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.<br/><br/>
On the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.  I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening.  There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli, and Legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times.  Aragorn's performance is outstanding.  He has proven that he can be put on an A-List of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance.<br/><br/>Gandalf ""the White"" in this film was a twist.  We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard.  Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking ""leaf"" as explained in the novel.  There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard.  No fireworks, or pipes.  Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.<br/><br/>
Very dark are the times for Frodo, and Samwise.  Gollum seams to give Frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well.  It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo, and our hero is slipping.  But the surprise was aimed at Samwise.  Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend.  Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment.  This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair.<br/><br/>
Merry and Pippin's story is very odd initially.  The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others.  The Ents were very well done CGI wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience.  They are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor.  Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them.<br/><br/>This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.  I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent.  This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away.  There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10"
"JohnLennon1985","10","258","338","18 December 2002"," My precious...
","Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.<br/><br/>
Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.<br/><br/>Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. <br/><br/>The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.<br/><br/>
The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>The scale is broken. 10 is not a capacity sufficient enough to hold this movie... my movie... my... precious..."
"calcat91355","9","19","21","5 March 2006"," Magnificent epic
","The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.<br/><br/>This is cinema at its very best."
"tfrizzell","Null","19","21","25 March 2003"," They Accomplished the Near-Impossible.
","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is another excellent installment in the thus far excellent trilogy. The film picks up immediately where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" left off as Elijah Wood and Sean Astin continue their long and seemingly hopeless journey to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor. They run into the creature Gollum (played amazingly by Andy Serkis in a revolutionary character-generation). Serkis' motives are unclear as the ring has literally run him insane and created a split personality that combats the character's natural good side. Meanwhile Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan have escaped the dark forces that captured them, but now are in another dilemma as they try to convince a forest of living, moving trees to support their cause for good and truth. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies receive more help from the likes of Bernard Hill's army and his lovely niece (Mirando Otto). As all this occurs, Ian McKellen comes back and rehashes a role which seemed to have expired late in the first film. Hugo Weaving and daughter Liv Tyler know that victory is not certain and realize that they must leave their true homes forever to protect themselves and the lives of their people. Christopher Lee continues to create chaos with the help of the highly disturbed Brad Dourif (of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" fame). In the end not one, but two key battles will create the sure-to-be electrifying landscape which will be experienced by all in the franchise's final installment (""The Return of the King""). Many view ""The Two Towers"" as an achievement even more impressive than its predecessor. True the film does go beyond the technical faculties of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", but it is hard for me to pick this installment over the first (which will likely always be my favorite). This film is more intense and you get the feeling of real danger and peril throughout, while the first was more of an emotional experience due to its nice elements of friendship, love and personal sacrifice. In short, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is an amazing sequel and it fits in well with the outstanding first film. 5 stars out of 5."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","26","30","19 March 2005"," Absolutely, totally fantastic!
","Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!<br/><br/>Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir, Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.<br/><br/>There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me, he probably is best know for his role as the captain in ""Titanic"" in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum/Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.<br/><br/>Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.<br/><br/>I've never been really a big fan of the editing of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.<br/><br/>But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.<br/><br/>A spectacular adventure action experience.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"classicsoncall","10","22","26","28 December 2005"," ""There's some good in this world Mr. Frodo, and it's worth fighting for.""
","""The Lord of the Rings"" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy, as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor, Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.<br/><br/>The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam (Sean Astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master, particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery, and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in ""The Two Towers""; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though, there was almost a comic element to it, whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.<br/><br/>Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film; I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The ""olyphants"" were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs, wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time, and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.<br/><br/>There's a lot going on in the film, and repeated viewings are helpful, along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie, I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually, the books and the film complement each other nicely, even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that ""The Lord of the Rings"" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time, it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor, loyalty, friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence."
"grendelkhan","Null","11","12","7 January 2005"," Sophomore effort shines as brightly as the first.
","After Fellowship, the world wondered if Peter Jackson could sustain the momentum. The Two Towers is the shortest segment and the story is split into parallel tales. More characters enter the story, including one of the most important. Can Jackson do it? Of course he can.<br/><br/>Spoilers: Two Towers sustains the magic of Fellowship, while expanding the scope of the story. Gollum enters the picture, in full view not shadow, and is a triumph to behold.<br/><br/>The story cuts back and forth between Merry and Pippin's encounter with Treebeard and the Ents; Gimli, Legolas and Aragorn and their attempts to locate the hobbits and free them; and Sam Frodo and Gollum as they move closer to Mordor. Each aspect is well covered, without losing track of the other story. Rohan provides the setting for the first great battle (aside from the prologue in Fellowship) and what a battle it is. Gandalf returns, much changed from his encounter with the balrog. The evil of Wormtongue appears, and Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer take the stage.<br/><br/>There are many great moments, from the mounted battles to Gollum and Smeagol's dialogue, Legolas' surf archery to Theoden's cure. Helm's Deep is a spectacular segment that takes one back to the epic films of the past. Darkness looms for Frodo and Sam, as Frodo slips deeper under the spell of the ring. He finds new, and sometimes strange, allies; as well as new foes. His journey becomes more difficult with each step.<br/><br/>The quality of the production continues. The Rohirrum are a sight to behold and do conjure images of the lost Anglo-Saxons. The battle scenes are engaging and terrifying. War is depicted with all of its consequences. Your heart is torn as you see the young separated from their parents, innocents are killed, and destruction abounds. At the same time, strength and hope come to those in desperate need and courage comes in the unlikeliest of moments. You find yourself in the lowest depths, as all seems lost; and then your heart soars, as hope comes at the last moment. This is storytelling at its finest.<br/><br/>This is not a sequel, it is another chapter in an epic saga. As such, it builds on the previous chapter and advances the story. The pace quickens as the conflict rises. The stakes are higher and the danger greater. The audience is on the edge of their seat, as darkness looms, while the threads of hope begin to weave together. The stage is set for the final battle."

Maybe one or two of the extra scenes could have been cut out, but they only are there to lead into the sequel.<br/><br/>This movie really shows the wonders of CGI in full effect.

The battle of Helm's Deep is a blend of live action and CGI(computer generated imagery), which works so perfectly and just comes across as astounding. <br/><br/>The scene's with Aragorn being lost, were not too bad. The lead up into the scene's were great. The scene's show the connection between Aragorn and his horse who finds him near the river. <br/><br/>The further downfall of Frodo as the ring slowly takes hold of him is very well done. Along with this, we also get to see the first more of the attempts of Sam to help, and protect Frodo. <br/><br/>The breaking into different stories was a cool idea. Showing the progression of the characters from the first film to the second. Orlando Bloom's character is givin a larger part.

","Long before it came out, I knew The Two Towers would be the toughest of the three Lord of the Rings books to put on film. Not only is it the middle child, but the very structure of the book makes it hard to craft a linear story with all the plot lines in tact and interesting.<br/><br/>But I think Peter Jackson and company did a very good job. It's not as strong as Fellowship, but is still outstanding.<br/><br/>All the elements of the LOTR films are here: the beautiful photography, set designs, costumes, scenery, special effects. All amazing, all brilliant, all Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>The performances are terrific, too. Bernard Hill, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, all did great jobs. The supporting actors, too.<br/><br/>It is sad that Ian McKellan's role is relegated to almost cameo status, but that's the nature of the book. The biggest shame is Christopher Lee. He has so little screen time in this film, I think he only says two or three lines on camera, the rest is ""brooding"". Such a waste, he is one of the great actors of our time, a real joy to watch (and a scene stealer to boot).<br/><br/>But the stars of the piece have to be Gollum and Treebeard and the Uruk army. The sequence with the Ents seeing the destruction Saruman wrought upon the trees brought tears to my eyes, and their revenge brought cheers to my voice. The battle of Helm's Deep was probably too long, but impressive nonetheless (and will probably be the model for ""epic battle sequences"" for years to come). And Gollum. What can be said about Gollum that hasn't already been said. We have entered into a new age of CGI, and, like all great works of art, it has a human soul.<br/><br/>A great film. 9 out of 10, the only items keeping it from getting a 10 are the short-shrifting of Christopher Lee and that some parts don't quite flow too well (a problem rooted in JRR Tolkien's novel, not the fault of the filmmakers)."
"dcastor","9","105","147","18 December 2002"," Great One
","I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!<br/><br/>The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.<br/><br/>The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.<br/><br/>I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far)."
"bopdog","10","38","50","18 December 2002"," Jackson remains a genius, and this series remains a masterpiece--Faithful enough to Tolkein, and a fantastic movie!
","I've read ---with care and delight--- the books four times in the last 34 years, including the recent reversion to Tolkein's ""original"" manuscript, edited by his son. I'm a fan. There, I said it, and I'm glad, I tell you!<br/><br/>This second installment of the trilogy is probably as good as a movie could get. It captures the Tolkein vibe probably as well as it could be captured in a theatrical release. Watching the flick tonight I realized that much of the vaunted charm of the very readable and very ""literary"" Tolkein books is in part the time it takes to read the long pages--- 1,000 to 1,400 pages, depending on the edition your are holding. And that time--- weeks and weeks of pouring over pages, re-reading certain passages, pondering and mulling over the fake languages and songs, and histories Tolkein concocted--- allows one to create and invent the Tolkein world inside oneself. That's GREAT! I loved each time I read the original. But no one could possibly expect a movie to give you, in 2-1/2 hours, that kind of luxurious lingering in the fantasy world. Duh!<br/><br/>Therefore, the movie's focus on action--- and FYI, it is dead-on accurate and faithful to the books--- is OK. The Ents' meeting in the forest took 3 or 4 DAYS in the book, and Merry and Pippin spent many more days hanging with Treebeard. The movie telescoped that down into a few hours. But hey!!! Think about it--- how could a movie, ANY movie, capture all of the sylvan reverie (including the Hobbits growing a couple of feet taller with the Entwash, etc.) in a trilogy movie series? All of that dreamy book-world stuff would be great to see on the screen--- but it would take dozens and dozens of hours of screen-time. Who could sit in a theater for that many weeks? There aren't that many ""festive"" people on the planet to make such a theatrical release profitable.<br/><br/>Maybe if we were wishing, we could have wished for a 30 or 40 hour TV mini-series. Then we COULD afford to meander and linger and all of that. Seriously--- I'd have enjoyed it. But then, the battles and evil empire and such would have to be portrayed with a vigor equal to Jackson's efforts, else the drama and peril (etc.) would be lost. For MY ridiculous wishing, then, I'm wishing for them to have made two projects--- the 3 theater-release movies, AND a 30-hour TV mini-series for all the ""literary"" vibe. But then, instead of a $300 million triology, we'd have had a $1 BILLION dollar (but memorable!) TV mini-series.  Oh well--- if wishing were having...<br/><br/>Overall, ""LOTR Two Towers"" is an excellent movie! A ""10"" out of ""10""!!!"

","I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death.

"dreamlanzerl","10","18","22","31 December 2004"," The Best Imaginable Second Chapter
","For this movie, Peter Jackson was faced with a challenge: how to make a great stand-alone film when the beginning and ending are in separate movies? He did a magnificent job. Like the first one, this movie starts with a slam-bang battle; however, where the first film had armies, this film has a clash between two titans.<br/><br/>From there, the movie builds to the enormous set-piece siege. And, along the way, we meet one of the most interesting characters of this, or any movie: Gollum, the complex, torn, schitzophrenic slave to the will of the One Ring.<br/><br/>And, even more than the first film, the Ring is also a character: the viewer can see it wearing down Frodo, pushing him to the limit, tempting those around him. The encounter at Osgiliath, while not in the book, is a fascinating visual realization of more subtle themes in the book. I know that, when I walked out of the theatre, I knew that there was only one movie I was looking forward to during the next year, and that was Return of the King."
"John_Mclaren","10","203","310","6 March 2004"," The Greatest of the Three Rings
","Yes, it's true. Return of the King may have won more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.<br/><br/>The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.<br/><br/>Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"
"Theo Robertson","9","29","40","27 January 2003"," My Visit To The Cinema
","Don`t you just hate cinemas ? No matter where you sit you always end up surrounded by people who spend their time chatting amongst themselves as to the events on screen 30 seconds before they happen . If we`re after a running commentary we`ll buy the DVD thank you very much . Add to this unattended mad mental kids running around wild . In fact many years ago our local newspaper saw a no holds barred letter of complaint about a screening of 3 MEN AND A LITTLE LADY which referred to foul mouthed juvenile delinquents in the audience . And on top of all this I`m a chainsmoker and cinema chains don`t allow patrons to poison themselves or others with nicotine so as a rule I don`t visit cinemas . But it`s a rule I broke in order to see THE TWO TOWERS because I was literally dying to see it . So I booked my ticket well in advance for the premier screening in Rothesay on the 26th of January , popped into the cinema that night and demanded to be entertained<br/><br/>****** SPOILERS ******<br/><br/>I was entertained and more , but I later had some reservations . On a technical level TTT not only does not disappoint but it outdoes FELLOWSHIP in terms of both scope and scale but this doesn`t automatically make it as some people have claimed a better film . The battles of Helms Deep and Isengard are truly breath taking and out do anything Hollywood has done , but ironically by concentrating on spectacle TTT feels more like a Hollywood film than FELLOWSHIP . And all this spectacle causes a problem for Peter Jackson - How does he finish all these impossibly epic set pieces ? The simple answer is he can`t ! As several reviewers have mentioned the fractured storyline comes to the rescue of the director in much the same way as Gandalf rides to the rescue of Helms Deep : Cut to the most breath taking calvary charge in the history of cinema , cut to the Ents attacking Isengard and then cut back to Helms Deep where our heroes have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat  , except they did so mainly off screen . It`s as if the director has used the fractured storyline in order to get himself out of a corner . Likewise reviewers on this site have noticed the story telling technique hides several plot holes involving characters appearing and disappearing to and from the story .<br/><br/>Of course you don`t notice these flaws at the time due to the awesome onscreen visuals but there is one major criticism you can level at TTT as soon as the credits roll and that`s a lack of an emotional impact . Yes you`ll gasp and cheer and feel your heart race but you won`t burst into tears . Remember the scenes in the first film where the fellowship escape into the mountains after Gandalf has confronted the Balrog or the departure of Boromir ? Remember how your throat tightened and you nearly had a tear run down your face ? Of course you do because these two scenes are amongst the most moving and heart wrenching in cinema history . Unfortunately there is no similar equivalent in TTT . And the film also cries out for a flawed but noble ambigous anti hero like Boromir in a story where everyone is either good or evil and no in between , though this is almost certainly the fault of Tolkien rather than Jackson who does manage to get the best out of his cast in film lacking in character development . Special mention goes to Andy Serkis who alas seems to have missed out on nominations for best supporting actor , Brad Dourif who plays a very slimy villain , and Bernard Hill who made me forget that this is the same actor who played Yosser Hughes in BOYS FROM THE BLACKSTUFF 20 years ago . But I couldn`t help but miss Sean Bean and I suppose casting him as Faramir twin brother of Boromir would have been just too obvious<br/><br/>But despite my criticisms I enjoyed TTT immensely and for three magical hours I forgot all about my nicotine addiction and the world outside . No doubt the audience at the Rothesay cinema felt the same way as me as we watched this film in a hushed silence . We laughed at the right bits , gasped at the technical achievements , but no one cried which means I can only award THE TWO TOWERS 9 out of 10"
"fearfulofspiders","10","17","22","26 August 2008"," The Sequel That Dwarfs Its Predecessor...
","The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring was a fantastic start to Tolkien's epic tale. The only true weakness of The Two Towers -- if you can call it a flaw -- is that the film is the middle-child, in that it has no beginning and no end. Though it starts out where the first ended, The Two Towers begins with a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog as we continue to see their fight as they plummet thousands (if not miles) of feet through gaping chasms in the Mines of Moria.<br/><br/>The acting is just as great as the first, and with the addition of new characters, the film's atmosphere has gone from ""new and wondrous"" to ""grim and hopeless"". Needless to say, Andy Serkis as Gollum is one of the best performances of the new decade. Bernard Hill does a wonderful job as Theoden, as well as Miranda Otto as Eowyn. Karl Urban is a nice choice as Eomer, nephew of the king. Possibly the best of the new characters is Faramir, played by David Wenham. Unlike the passive-type as portrayed in the books, this Faramir is more troubled and only corruptible by the Ring because of his desire to be accepted by his close-minded father -- a nice change made by the writers. The character Treebeard is a reflection of the greatness of the CG work on Gollum; both are exquisite.<br/><br/>The writing and directing equals The Fellowship of the Ring, in that the continuity remains, never feeling like we missed any key moments in the plot. The only real flaw, which is mainly due to pacing and events leading up to The Return of the King, is the vast expansion of Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor, aided by the insidious Gollum. The changes and omissions were once again necessary to provide a decent pace and focus on the ever-rising tension of what all leads up to: the battle at Helm's Deep. Yet, with the massive battle near the final 30-40 minutes of the film, there's plenty more to keep a viewer attached to the screen.<br/><br/>Fully seeing the MASSIVE software at work, the special effects incorporated with the miniatures/bigatures still dazzle the eyes in flawless execution, as 10,000 Uruk-hai soldiers lay siege to a seemingly impenetrable fortress. From the Mumakil (elephants) to the Fell Beasts upon which the Ringwraiths ride, we are given the introduction of creatures that play major roles in the following film.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's evolution with the leitmotifs he created from the first film have now been shifted towards a more explosive composition. Equaling The Fellowship of the Ring, the music for The Two Towers is nothing short of awe-inspiring. From the theme of Rohan to the thundering might of Isengard, The Two Towers is full of rousing composition. There's also beautiful moments between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as some wonderful choral work for the last march of the Ents.<br/><br/>Overall, while different from the text in terms of time-line, The Two Towers is an extraordinary sequel to a ""trilogy"" destined for greatness. While the film ends before the events in Shelob's tunnel, there's no doubt one will be amazed in what is to come. One must see this film."

"MinorityReporter","10","10","12","13 June 2006"," The Two Towers! What Is It? The Answer Is: My Precious!
","The second part of The Lord of the Rings saga maintains the style, momentum and integrity that made the first film as brilliant as it is and thus what Peter Jackson gives us is one of the best sequels ever and certainly the best film of 2002. I prefer the first film for being closer to the book but I completely understand the changes made from book to film and I see why they are necessary to keep the film's narrative flowing instead of dropping dead. The film is not without a few weaknesses mainly because of it being a middle part linking The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and therefore not having an obvious beginning or an end. This doesn't stop the film from being an experience that people shouldn't be cheated out of.<br/><br/>The acting is, like in the first film, very good and at times even brilliant. Viggo Mortensen improves greatly and provides a more well rounded and believable Aragorn and proves his qualities as an actor especially in the quit moments (of which there are too few in the theatrical release, this was remedied in the extended cut). Also Elijah Wood deepens his character considerably and shows many of the darker sides of his character in the film. This provides for some interesting exchanges between Wood and his faithful companion played by Sean Astin. Bernard Hill is introduced in this film along with the method actor, Brad Dourif. Both of the aforementioned are excellent in their respective parts even though there are some inconsistencies in Hill's character compared to the character from the book. These changes were obviously made for dramatic purposes and are very plausible. Ian McKellen's character, Gandalf, has been somewhat reduced in the second film but instead he steals every scene he is in. Likewise, Hugo Weaving's character has been reduced but he is still very good and keeps his character in the same style as in the first film. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies returns as well and I have to comment on the choice to make Gimli into comic relief, because while I understand the necessity given that Dominic Monaghan's and Billy Boyd's characters have taken a turn towards more serious characters there had to be someone to relieve the dramatic tension, I found it a shame that Gimli had been reduced to some bumbling clown. Fortunately most of his comic remarks worked. Among other characters introduced are Faramir, played by David Wenham, and Gollum, played beautifully by Andy Serkis. I'll get back to Faramir but for now I have to comment on Gollum. Gollum is quite simply the most interesting film character in the last decade and this relates both to the ground breaking special effects but also Serkis' performance, which was most unfairly not deemed fit for an Oscar nomination. Overall the acting is excellent like in the first film and all actors manages to develop their characters in ways that are at the very least acceptable.<br/><br/>The effects and fight scenes in this second film are among the best ever and is perhaps only bested by some of the effects in the third film in the series. The Gollum character and the battle for Helm's Deep seem to be excellent examples. Gollum is quite simply the most stunning and beautifully created CGI character of all time and he displays extraordinary emotional range. As previously stated The Battle for Helm's Deep is among the finest battle scenes ever created. Well paced and choreographed and above all the editing in between the hectic battle sequences and scared citizens provides for some emotional depth as well (something that was sorely needed in the battle sequences in Star Wars: Episode II). This gigantic battle isn't the only battle in the film. There are many other interesting battles but I'm not going to spoil them so you'll just have to see the film yourself. The battles are consistent with the style that was laid down in the first film they are simply on a much more epic scale.<br/><br/>Some people have raved that the changes made from book to film were too radical but I completely understand and condone the reasons which were obviously dramatic purposes. Especially David Wenham's character has been criticized and after watching it the first time I was a bit unhappy with his character as well but when you think about it the changes in the character were at the very least essential to maintain the narrative structure. There are other examples but it would really be pointless to mention them because the reason is exactly the same as in the case of David Wenham's character. Dramatic purposes.<br/><br/>Overall The Two Towers serves as an excellent link between the Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King and it deserves every bit of praise coming to it. One of the very best films of all time.<br/><br/>10/10 - On my top 10 of best films"
"Justin Chan","Null","66","102","18 December 2002"," Better Paced than the first, the battle for Isengard was excellent
","We have been waiting an entire year for this one!!! The Two Towers picks up right where last years Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring leaves off. The director, Peter Jackson, did not include a recap of the last movie, so if you don't remember what happened in the first movie you better rent it and refresh your memory before you head off to the theater.   <br/><br/>
When we last left our fellowship, it had splintered apart. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue there quest to return the all powerful and evil ring to Mordor where it can be destroyed. They take on the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis) as their guide to Mordor despite Gollum's obsession with getting `his precious' back. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) begin by trying to find the kidnapped Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), but end up getting caught up in a battle to save a race of humans. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), controlled by Dark Lord Sauron created a grand Uruk-hai army that is sent to destroy the race of Humans at the fortress Isengard. The presumed dead Gandolf (Ian McKellen) also returns to lend his assistance in battling Lord Sauron's troops.     <br/><br/>This film was better paced than the first in the trilogy. There were still some breaks in the action that were a little dull, but the dialog was necessary to further the story. With three separate stories going on simultaneously between the three groups of the splintered fellowship, the film kept the action moving quickly. Clocking in at 179 minutes, it is just one minute longer than the first film. This time, I didn't mind the length. The battle for Isengard comprised about a third of the film, and it was very intense.      <br/><br/>The rest of the film had a lot of the same excellent cinematic shots as the first movie. The shots tracking the actors from above (done by helicopter) with the beautiful New Zealand mountains and countryside in the background were just amazing.  The landscapes helped to keep me involved with the story when the action slowed for dialog intensive scenes.      <br/><br/>
The creature Gollum played a very key roll in this movie, and the computer-generated character was very lifelike and amusing. He reminded me of Dobby the `house elf' in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Gollum and the Dwarf were the two main comic relief characters in this very serious film.      <br/><br/>To conclude, we had to wait a year for this film, and it lived up to expectations! A final reminderthis is the middle film in the trilogy so you can expect another ending that leaves you wanting more! Not to worry though, the third and final film is due out next Christmas."
"hanifmuhammad92","9","4","4","18 June 2019"," The Definition of Epic!
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a ripping roaring success. It's in the company of Great sequels that manage to match the original film in nearly every way. it doesn't quite have the narrative focus the Fellowship of the Ring has but it more than matches it in overall quality. The Film delves much deeper into the Lore of Middle Earth than the original film and adds a host of welcome additions to the awesome roster of characters. In short it's pretty much everything you can ever want and more.<br/><br/>As reward for the abrupt ending of the original film The Two Towers picks up right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off. Our heroes are divided and the narrative continuously switches back and forth between multiple storylines occurring simultaneously. For starters we have Frodo and Sam on the most important quest. The Ring bearer must still journey to Mordor and cast The Ring into the fiery pit of Mount doom but they are accompanied by a new companion. The creature Gollum acts as a guide for the two Hobbits and imparts his knowledge of The Dark Lord's minions. He is a vital part of the puzzle but one with a nefarious purpose and an unhealthy obsession with the Ring, one that will lead to his downfall.<br/><br/>The Other primary story follows the remaining members of the Fellowship as they respond to the evil that has come to the great Kingdom of Rohan. We follow Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they grow closer to one another and their friendship tightens. It's not long until they are joined by a revived Gandalf who rides to the aid of King Théoden of Rohan. It is here where the subtitle of the movie is established. The Two Towers refers to the union and alliance between Sauron and Saruman. Between the evil forces of Mordor and Isengard. Saruman sends a Seemingly unstoppable army of ten thousand against The army of Rohan and the suspense builds, keeping the audiences glued to their seats until we arrive at the Battle for Helms Deep at the last half hour of the film one of the greatest War sequences in the history of cinema by far!<br/><br/>
Overall this is an Excellent movie that's almost neck and neck with the first film. The cast is once again perfect and the new additions to the roster are seamlessly interwoven in the narrative. Bernard Hill is nothing short of sublime as King Théoden. The scene when he breaks into pieces and cries over his son's death should have gotten him an Oscar Nom alone! A riveting performances! Miranda Otto is also rather stellar as The King's niece Eowyn and the affection and almost child like crush that she develops for Aragorn is very believable, tender and a sharp rival to the rich chemistry He has for lady Arwen who makes a brief return as well. Andy Serkis as Gollum was a scene stealer and most definitely was robbed of an Oscar as well. Absolutely love his character, Brilliant, Naïve and impulsive to a fault, this character has more dimension than what you can shake your staff at. He's learned and has an almost unlimited supply of knowledge though his mind is scrambled and poisoned by the ring, he's tender at times, vicious and duplicitous during others, playful and humorous yet frightening. Sinister and hideous while also being sympathetic. What Peter Jackson and company have achieved with this character is nothing short of remarkable. He is the perfect Anti Hero for a time and is only more believable as a full on 3D Villain by the reveal at the tail end of the film. There is nothing I can truly say to you that really does this character justice.<br/><br/>This film is as relevant today as it was when it was released. Some of the most important lessons and themes about our world are discussed here. From the nature of Evil, addiction, Greed and corruption, the nature of Warfare. Hope in the face of insurmountable odds. The arc with Treebeard and the Ents is Great as well and is a poignant metaphor for nature vs industry. The scene when The Ents along with the brave Hobbits Merry and Pippin overtake Saruman's fortress is Inspiring as is the ending with Gandalf, Eomer and the Return of the Rohirram, saving Aragorn and ending the battle for Helms deep at the last minute. Sam's final Speech to Frodo about the good of this world being something worth fighting for ties all of the threads of the story in a neat little bow as does his proclaimation that their story may be one of the great stories that people will tell their children in years past. All in all The Two Towers is an instant classic and one that will leave audiences eager for the final chapter of this legendary trilogy"
"MaxBorg89","9","4","4","12 December 2005"," The battle for Middle Earth is about to begin...
","Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments). It picks up exactly from where its predecessor ended: the Fellowship is split in three separate groups, all with their own problems to take care of:<br/><br/>Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard...<br/><br/>This second opus is less talking and more fighting: key characters are reduced to cameos (most notably Galadriel) and new people are quickly introduced so that we can be dragged into some huge battles, culminating in the 40-minute long combat at Helm's Deep, quite simply the movie's highlight. If, however, you want more insight on the characters and their motivations, get the extended cut, whose additional sequences are essential to understand pivotal moments of the third film.<br/><br/>Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two personas, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.<br/><br/>Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."
"leakretschmar","10","10","13","6 February 2005"," It was shorter than expected but still awesome.
","The battle scenes were awesome but the plot was a little shorter than expected and it is more choppier than the 1st and 3rd Lord of the Rings (LOTR). I loved it when Legolas, Orlando Bloom, went on that shield like a skateboard. It was cool. Does any of you recognize Elrond from another movie? Let me give you a hint. ""Mr. Anderson!"" Do you know now? For those who do not know, it is Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving from the Matrix trilogy. Other famous LOTR actors are Sauroman, Christopher Lee, in the Star Wars Episode 2, and Gandalf, Ian McKellan, plays in X-Men as Magneto. Besides Christopher Lee, you notice that some of the good guys play bad guys in other movies. Weird huh? There are others but it is too many to list.<br/><br/>The extended version of the Two Towers is way better than the theatrical. It explains why Eomer gets kicked out in more detail. Also it explains more about Faramir, Bormir's brother, and their father. Gandalf explain more about his rank and what is going to happen next when he returned to Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimili. I thought that the Gollum singer was little jazzy for LOTR. I liked Enya better because she has such a beautiful voice.<br/><br/>In the book, LOTR creatures, such as the eagles, shadow fax, the spider, and so on talked in the story. I guess Jackson want to make the movie more realistic than book. They did a great job on Gollum. The actor had some special juice he drink for that voice. He explains in the special features. I really like the fact that Tolkien made his own language out of a bunch other languages and name it elvish.<br/><br/>I think if you really watch and maybe read the trilogy, you might learn something out of it. I'm not saying you should but I would recommend it. If you like computer games, I would recommend Age of Wonders because it is a strategy game which has characters similar to the LOTR. But be careful, it can be addictive and you might find yourself playing for several hours."

","The Two Towers is another masterpiece of returning after Fellowship of the Ring. This had excellent and brilliant action. Like the Helm's Deep battle which made the 100 best battles of all-time. There wasn't much of a story but who cares, it's Lord of the Rings!!! I loved the sword-fighting and the orcs too. This movie gave me chills down my back from the fighting and the unforgettable lines. Gollum was so cool and funny. Andy Serkis did so well in doing Gollum's voice and the CGI was amazing! The landscape once again was superb. This is another one of my favorite movies. It's not better than the fellowship and Return of the King but was very close and is still a smoking brilliant film.

"tedg","Null","18","28","21 December 2002"," Is It Magical?
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>One hallmark of science fiction and fantasy is the creation of a world that includes to some extent the creator. That way, instead of inhabitants bumping around in a world, we get a complex set of interactions: some as a result of the world affecting the players, and some the other way around. Tolkien's work fits well within this tradition, in fact why it was so successful I think is the thoroughness with which he developed the magical laws. The reader not only understood that the magic had power, but had some notion of how it worked. That allowed the reader to exist both at the level of Frodo and the magical level of the wizards and demigods.<br/><br/>That's the soul of the books; not any episode, not any `theme' about brotherhood or hope or any such sodapop.<br/><br/>The first film of this saga impressed purely with the sheer ambition of the project, and we now have the second one. It is fun watching, just like `Speed' was in its day, but I'm unhappy with some of the choices that were made.<br/><br/>With film, there are specific ways to span the two worlds, ways which a few filmmakers have been exploiting for a long time -- long enough for some of them to appear in mainstream films. Almost none of those techniques were used here. Nearly all the choices were ones that plant us firmly in the world of the inhabitants who are buffeted by the world's forces just like we as people are. This literally boils all the magic out of the books, and we are left with `Braveheart' meets `The Black Cauldron' except slightly more expensively done and with some monsters.<br/><br/>The travesty is not that these choices were made to protect the investment in the films, but that so many Tolkien enthusiasts miss the point and argue about whether elves appear in the wrong scenes.<br/><br/>Further to the philosophy of the film: the manner in which the characters deal with the camera is roughly equivalent to the relationship the readers' imaginative `eye' has with the text. In addition to being cast at the level of the adventures and not the magic, there are other problems. That stance is inconsistent -- the greatest offense comes in the middle of the great battle. Until then, the players have been dead serious. They've been in their lives, not characters in a movie that wink at us. But all of a sudden, we have a barrage of winking: the `surfing' move, the dwarf-tossing joke, the 007-like standoff on the bridge. All of these depend on us knowing it is a movie and the characters leaving their lives and knowingly entering the movie.<br/><br/>Other problems with that stance. The various technologies used each have their own way the camera must be used. The two perspectives that impressed me were the handling of the fight between Gandolf and the balrog and the relationship we have with Gollum. In the first, our eye IS magical as it swoops around sometimes watching the fight, sometimes IN the fight. This use of the camera is new -- I noticed it also last week in `Treasure Planet' when encountering the black hole. But it entirely different than the soliloquies Gollum (and several others) have. Under the guise of talking to themselves, they are really talking to us, nearly looking at the camera. All of the camera engagement is from Bergman, and is his well-studied solution to the Shakespearean stage technique.<br/><br/>I liked both of these, but they are inconsistent with each other, inconsistent with Tolkien's magic as noted and inconsistent with the movieland jokes. But there are even more diverse perspectives. We have the helicopter shots (again from `Braveheart'), and a few similar shots of virtual sets. We could have had some new movement (like the balrog fight), but we are supposed to recall similar shots.<br/><br/>And then there are the Ents, animation straight out of `Poltergeist.' It is another set of views determined by the technology rather the story. Shifting among the bluescreen of hobbits in Ents, to the humanistic CGI Gollum, to the video game animation of the battle was jarring. We never were in Tolkien's world, just browsing through the aisles of your video store, shifting about.<br/><br/>LOTR was written with specific notions of reading in mind and is bound to them. But `Dune' was not. Imagine a film of Dune with this budget and Lynch's originality instead of Jackson's `me-too-isms.' Now that would be cool.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","29","50","2 August 2006"," A Second Look, With Subtitles In Parts, Made This Much Better
","I didn't really appreciate this second installment of the LOTR trilogy until I watched this for the second time. The key was how I looked at the key character of this film: ""Gollum"" (Andy Serkis.). Once I began to appreciate and marvel at this weasel-like character, my opinion of the film went from bad to good. That doesn't mean I like that slimy creature: I don't, but I am more fascinated by him rather than totally annoyed as I was with the first viewing. A big reason was that I put on the English subtitles, so I was able to understand everything he said. I recommend doing that you has a similar problem deciphering his dialog. Now I more fully understood what a tortured soul that pathetic creature was.<br/><br/>Anyway, this second installment, as in the first, offers a lot of fascinating sights and sounds and a nice varied platter of action scenes and wild characters. For younger kids, I am to happy to say there is absolutely nothing, language-wise, that would offend anyone but the violence is heavy and brutal at times.<br/><br/>This is a solid, highly-recommended second installment in the trilogy. It's epic film-making. No, it may not be equal to the first - The Fellowship Of The Ring - but what adventure story is?"
"junk-78748","10","3","3","31 July 2018"," The Best of the Three
","(As with all of my LotR reviews, I am reviewing the extended editions, not the theatrical releases.)<br/><br/>Most people seem to place The Two Towers at the end of their Lord of the Rings tier list. That's understandable when considering that most people only remember being fatigued by the seemingly endless string of action sequences in the theatrical release. But when it comes to the extended editions, The Two Towers is king.<br/><br/>This review could go about discussing the shortcomings of the other two films. It could discuss the extensive denouement of The Return of the King, or the fact that most of the characters in the world are absent from half of The Fellowship. But I'll try and stick to explaining why The Two Towers is superior, not why the other films of the trilogy struggle to keep up.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the characters introduced in The Two Towers are outstanding in their dynamism and are the keystones of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Gollum, who is unquestionably the most dynamic character in the LotR universe, plays a huge role in the second film. The audience is shown so many sides of his character that they don't quite know whether to side with Frodo or Sam regarding his villainy. He's so lovable and so hateable all at the same time. Combining his two battling egos with his key role as Frodo's navigator makes Gollum one of the most important and memorable characters in the history of film (not to mention the revolutionary motion-capture techniques used to create Gollum, and Andy Serkis' legendary performance).<br/><br/>Moving away from the insanity that is Gollum, one of the most humanized characters in all three Lord of the Rings films is Faramir. Boromir's younger brother is put to the same task as his elder sibling: to resist the pull of the ring and allow Frodo to continue on his quest. Yet Faramir faces this task within the context of much more dire and immediate consequences. Faramir must fight against the desire for his father's recognition along with the desire for the ring of power, all whilst coming to terms with his brother's death and commanding an entire army to defend his kingdom. This is no easy task even for the most noble of character. Faramir is one of the most lovable and strong-willed characters in Middle Earth, and he brings so much life to The Two Towers. Plus, The Two Towers gets bonus points for Boromir and Denethor both having a short cameo in the middle of the film in a scene that depicts Boromir as the honorable and dedicated hero he truly is.<br/><br/>Alongside the introduction of the Sons of Gondor is the introduction of the Rohirrim and King Theoden of Rohan. King Theodan is a troubled man, struggling to maintain control of his mind and his kingdom. Sauruman has possessed him and wreaked havoc across his lands. But when Gandalf and the rest of the fellowship come to his aid, releasing Theoden from Saruman's grasp, does he kneel and follow their every command? No. Theoden has his own goals with his own means of achieving them. He does not wish to risk the lives of his people for the lives of those whom have previously abandoned him. Theoden's struggle as King is more intense than any other royal character in the series. His people are not warriors, but they are strong and proud, as is their king, and they fight desperately for their freedom during the course of the film.<br/><br/>Speaking of nobility, it is impossible to forget about Eowyn, Theoden's niece and one of the two leading female characters in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When faced with adversity, Eowyn is one of the strongest characters of all. As a woman, she is tasked with aiding other women and children, and tending to the weak and the wounded. But she remains strong of will throughout her trials and is a worthy carrier of the torch for all the female characters in the Lord of the Rings (few there may be).<br/><br/>This review doesn't even scratch the surface of the incredible characters and events of The Two Towers. Events like the Balrog fight, Gandalf returning from the grave, the introduction of the Ents and the Battle of Isengaurd, the first sighting of the Fellbeasts, Pippin's incident with the Palantir, the hopelessness of the Battle of Helms Deep, Gimli and Legolas' flowering relationship, King Theoden's recital of ""The Horse and The Rider"", and Aragorn's most kingly recommendation to ""ride out and meet them"", The Two Towers is chock full of epic moments that make the second film my favorite installment of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, I love all three films equally, and it kills me to put one ahead of another. But when forced to rank them, I always come to the conclusion that The Two Towers is my favorite, and it should be yours too.<br/><br/>""The Horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep, one last time. Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath, now for ruin, and the red dawn!"""
"raymond_chandler","10","3","3","15 December 2003"," Extended Edition is definitive Tolkien
","I have loved Tolkien's masterpiece since I was 10 years old. I bought the calendars by Brothers Hildebrandt all through college, and I have eagerly awaited the movies since they were announced some four years ago. I just saw the Extended ""Two Towers"" last night at the Seattle Cinerama, and I was absolutely stunned by how improved it is over the earlier edit (which I saw three times in theatres). As good as ""Fellowship"" is, I feel that the restored ""Two Towers"" blows it away. <br/><br/> ****** SPOILERS ******<br/><br/> So many things that felt half-finished in ""TTT"" now contribute to the richness of detail that makes this such an epic. The stable scene with Brego, Aragorn, and Eowyn is pivotal in setting up several later scenes. The migration of the trees of Fangorn to Helm's Deep, the flashback to Boromir in Osgiliath, and Theodred's funeral all serve to bring the story much more in line with Tolkien's vision. Even the raiding of the stores by Merry and Pippin is wonderful, injecting some of the lightheartedness of ""Fellowship"" into what is a much darker story.<br/><br/> ****** END SPOILERS ******<br/><br/> This trilogy will stand as a singular achievement in cinema history. In an era when many big-budget films are mindless, sadistic two-hour pageants of explosions and gunplay, it is remarkable that these films were made at all, let alone with such faithfulness to very complex source material. Bravo to New Line, Peter Jackson, Howard Shore, the entire crew, and of course the magnificent cast, especially Ian McKellen."
"CharlestonNole","9","3","3","1 September 2003"," A Shout Out to WETA!!! Truly Awesome!
","First off, The Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  As with the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers is one of the best films ever.  However, the only problem I find with this film is that it is too short.  Yea, you heard me right! The new characters needed to be fleshed out a little more. The Fellowship of the Ring IMO is superior because of the interaction between the core players.  We were there when they made their journey, we were not hopping back and forth between their individual adventures.  Yes I know that is the way the book is written, but I just prefer the Fellowship's  more intimate look at the characters.  This withstanding the Two Towers is an amazing achievement.  WETA Digital truly deserves all of the kudos that have been bestowed upon them.  They have supplanted Industrial Light and Magic as the preeminent digital effects company.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/><br/>10/10!!!"

"bzb2001","8","9","13","12 February 2005"," A visual masterpiece and better than the first
","So the journey continues with 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.' This review will assume you have seen the first film, 'The Fellowship of the Ring.' Which is fine because Peter Jackson, at the helm of this massive production, assumes you have seen it as well. Intelligently, Jackson does not begin with a redundant and unnecessary prologue. He dives right into what the filmmakers considered the hardest of the trilogy to make.<br/><br/>When we left the fellowship, they were in shambles. Gandalf had fallen; Merry and Pippen were kidnapped by the evil forces; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek their smaller comrades without the help of Boromir, who has also died; this leaves Frodo and Sam on their way to Mount Doom, the one ring still in their grasp.<br/><br/>'The Two Towers' is more successful than 'Fellowship' because the storytelling becomes more complex without drowning us in information. The first film introduced us to the many characters of Middle Earth (too many, I believe). 'The Two Towers' isn't quite as concerned with exposition, though new characters do come on board. Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, a large, talking ""tree herder"" who is concerned about the plight of his forest's future since the destructive orcs and their masters, Sauron and Saruman, burn everything in their path.<br/><br/>Legolas, Aragorn, and Gimli enter the kingdom of Rohan and cross paths with King Theoden and his people. Theoden has been under Saruman's spell as part of he and Sauron's master plan to take over the separate kingdoms of Middle Earth. Eowyn, the king's niece, develops a special liking for Aragorn. However, as we understand from the first film, there is still a deep love between Aragorn and the elf Arwen. Along with the rest of the elfs of Middle Earth, Arwen is persuaded to leave for another world entirely. She does have reservations leaving her true love Aragorn, though mortal and she is not, for distant lands and never see him again.<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam are introduced to the mysterious Gollum, who attempts to attack the hobbits in their sleep to regain the ring. Instead, Gollum and Frodo kindle a special relationship since they both harbor a certain addiction to the ring's power. Frodo's Elijah Wood is the most effective actor in 'Two Towers' as he is gradually taken more and more over by the ring and it's awesome strength. Gollum becomes Frodo and Sam's guide to Mordor, as he has been there before. Gollum's intentions, though, are never clear to the hobbits - neither are they to Gollum.<br/><br/>These three strands of story form a massive, thoroughly effective, epic tale of nature vs. machine, creature vs. creature and, through Frodo, man vs. himself. The encompassing story leads to a heroic battle sequence fought on two fronts, while all the time we wonder how long Frodo can hold on to his sanity as the ring slowly takes power over him.<br/><br/>The pacing, which was an issue with 'Fellowship,' is not problematic at all the second time around. The three stories are told in a manner that flows right through the three hour+ tale. One problem that persists is that 'Two Towers' is largely unaffected by the humanity other than Frodo's saga. There is love between Aragorn and Arwen, Eowyn also shows up as a romantic character. Her father, Theoden, is a courageous man but flawed psychologically. There exists connections between these many characters and more but they all feel half baked and cast aside to make more room for fighting.<br/><br/>Still, 'The Two Towers' is enormously successful as a narrative and even more ambitious than 'Fellowship' visually. The score, by Howard Shore, is among the very best ever composed. The evil orcs and uruk-hai never look fake and evoke terror in the characters and in the audience. I still yearn for a more personal story, but in other realms of film-making, Peter Jackson and those under his command have outdone themselves. ***.5 out of ****"
"Person555","9","6","8","13 February 2005"," An excellent addition to the series
","Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better."
"j30bell","7","16","28","20 December 2004"," The story - and the heightism - continues
","In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.<br/><br/>Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.<br/><br/>Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.<br/><br/>The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.<br/><br/>So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.<br/><br/>Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10."

","If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"". Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve. Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil."
"lasse-uk","10","8","12","6 November 2004"," The worst of what is ultimately the best trilogy of all time
","This film is one of the best films ever made. This film is almost as breathtaking as the first film but in the end the minor flaws it has makes it worse than the first film. What I consider to be the biggest flaw of this film is the character of Gimli. John-Rhys Davies is a wonderful actor and I do not blame him for the way the character turned out. I blame it on the directing (shame on you Jackson). Being that Merry and Pippin are not as much in the second films they were in the first they could not act as comic relief. Thus the choice was made to make Gimli the comic relief. While the things he says are both funny and well timed it becomes to much by the end. A second flaw that pulls the film down a bit is the fact that they deviated too much from the original book. The Theoden character is very different in the book as is Faramir. These flaws were probably necessary to make the film but the hard core Tolkien fans such as myself were disappointed to see Faramir drag poor Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath which is only mentioned in the book but never seen. This far I have only focused on the bad things in the film but there are very great film historic moments as well. E.g. the battle for Helms Deep is aside from the battle on Pelleanor Fields the greatest film battle ever conceived on screen. The acting in the film is generally on a very high level. Especially Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen do very well in the film but also John-Rhys Davies and Elijah Wood are very good. Aside from the fact that their roles were not as well written as they could have been Bernard Hill and David Wenham do very well. The effects in the film are flawless and on a higher scale than in the first film and the attention to detail is overwhelming. All in all a worthy sequel but ultimately the worst out of the three."
"TxMike","Null","8","12","18 May 2004"," Second installment, great DVD, story a bit muddled, a movie mainly for ""Ring"" fans.
","Almost two years ago, after I saw the first of the trilogy, I wrote in summary...<br/><br/>""As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect. However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments. ""<br/><br/>I've not seen the last installment yet, but my opinion has not changed any. First off the movie is entirely too long. Not that length itself is bad, but in an apparent attempt to follow the books faithfully, much of the story drags badly. Wise producers and directors realize that movies made from books must exclude much material, to keep the story interesting and the running time reasonable. People who read novels often do so over weeks. Movies are normally watched at one sitting. So, while this long movie may be just what the ""Ringheads"" want, for the rest of us it is simply too much of the same, and too long. Still, it has remarkable production values and is a joy to watch.  Just too long and boring in spots."
"Hairy_Lime","8","9","14","9 February 2004"," The Weakest Link - a spoiler or two
","Really, The Two Towers is the weakest of the three novels, and it is only natural that the middle volume would be a bit of a let down.  Jackson does a nice job of trying to lift the story - the battle sequence is fantastic - but to my mind the 10 I might have given for this movie went over the cliff with Aragorn.  I have nothing against Jackson deviating from the books - I was not troubled by the changes in the Faramir character, for instance, and adding the Warg riders themselves was a nice touch.  But what was the purpose of sending Aragorn over the cliff?  Creating false tension that probably fooled less than 1% of the audience?  Screen time for Liv Tyler? All it did for me was make the movie feel false for about ten minutes.  This crucial mistake is compunded now that we have the Extended Edition and see some of the scenes that were left out of the theatrical release.  the movie would have been stronger without Aragorn's fall, and with, for instance, the scene between Boromir and Faramir, or the march of the trees to the Battle of Helms Deep.<br/><br/>Well, so be it.  One or two major missteps in a ten hour movie is not unexpected.  On its merits, apart from that, this movie, like the whole trilogy, is a magnificent achievement.<br/><br/>One question: every time I look, Legolas is shooting dozens of arrows.  And every time I look, his quiver is full.  Where are the arrows coming from? Elf magic?"

","I thoroughly enjoyed 'The Fellowship' and was eagerly awaiting the release of 'two towers'. I have never read the books but was informed that the 'Two Towers' would be even better than it's predecessor as the plot thickens and action really gets going. However, on leaving the cinema after watching this film I was left somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>I have read review after review saying this is peoples favourite film. I mean come on, be serious. It takes an age to get going and if it was not for the climactic battle of Helm's Deep would have been the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first two hours of Titanic. Even in this ground breaking climax it is constantly interrupted by Treebeard, the character that personifies the slowness of the rest of the film. Also the attempted romance between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler's characters seems just to be in this film because Liv complained of lack of screen time because there certainly doesn't seem any need for her character in this instalment apart from this pointless sub-plot.<br/><br/>The creation of Gollum was simply brilliant and deserved the Oscar but I was pleased to see this film ignored in the other categories. One thing is for sure, I will not look forward to the next sequel as much as I did this one, following this film's disappointment."

Some of the changes detracted from this movie, but not terribly. <br/><br/>But the fundemental changed made to Faramire (compare him in the book to the movie - not merely changed but the opposite) seriously undermined the whole plot of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Still, I have this an 8/10.

","The only redeeming quality of this film was the epic battle sequences.  A pornography of violence is the only thing that saved this film from being terribly boring.<br/><br/>The characters were very flat.  Interaction between them was predictable (predictable, even without having read the books).  For example, the undeveloped subplot between Aragorn and that princess was cliche.  From the moment a hint of her liking him came out, I could see what was going to happen.<br/><br/>The only interesting character was Golum.  He symbolized the external battle for good and evil through an internal struggle.<br/><br/>The dialogue in this movie offered nothing.  It was mostly about one group's plans, followed by the enemies plans.<br/><br/>Well.  I don't want to think much more about this movie.  I think it was terrible.  The fighting scenes and animation were cool.  Perhaps the ""acting"" parts should be cut and the remaining scenes should be edited as cut scenes into a video game or something, because this definately doesn't stand as a film on its own."

","Understandably darker and heavier than 'The Fellowship of The Ring' while being absolutely unforgiving to its already scarred characters, 'The Two Towers' feeds off its predecessor's pure energy and glee to widen the scope of the story and drain every last piece of hope that was built. Flawless in its structure, the second installment in the Lord of the Rings saga manages, in the first 120 minutes, to wisely, although sometimes clumsily, blend multiple storylines within the same quest, only to reach its culminating point in the last hour - an event so grand and so massively epic in scale that it left me astonished, a cinematic accomplishment in the likes of few others, the very epitomy of what fantasy and adventure films should eternally strive for: the Battle of Helm's Deep. In this day and age defined by the dullness of sequels, 'The Two Towers' has a purpose, a meaning, a pulse that never stops growing through the few ups and countless downs of Frodo and Sam, of Aragorn - of Middle Earth."
"TheNabOwnzz","10","2","2","23 December 2018"," An absolutely stunning continuation of the franchise
","While The Two Towers introduces a couple of new characters, it is still not exactly on Fellowship's level due to the character development of that particular motion picture. However, it is still painfully obvious that nearly every other single movie pales in comparison to the masterpiece that is The Two Towers.<br/><br/>In another comparison to the Fellowship of the Ring, the scale is increased significantly in Two Towers, and this results in a lot more special effect shots. It is not quite as beautiful visually as Fellowship because of this, but like in that film, the CGI that is used is once again utterly fantastic. Still, director Peter Jackson seems to only use CGI on objects or creatures it HAS to be used on, because it would be near impossible to utilize practical effects on certain things, such as the Oliphaunt, or an army of ten thousand Uruk-Hai.<br/><br/>With the addition of the 'Rohan' storyline come a couple of new characters, with Bernard Hill as Theoden, Karl Urban as Eomer, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue & The motion captured but largely CGI character Gollum 'played' by Andy Serkis. All of these characters are being noteworthy in being a fantastic addition to a cast that was already near perfect.<br/><br/>The score by Howard Shore is still perfection, who uses a new 'Rohan' theme to further emphasize emotion when coupled with these scenes. The very first scene in which this sound is heard is when Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas & another individual arrive at Edoras, in which a flag of Rohan can be seen tearing itself away from the King's keep, and landing right before Aragorn, as if it symbolizes that hope is fading, and that only he can return it. The melancholy new sound of the Rohan-esque themes by Shore further fuel this emotion in the audience.<br/><br/>The dialogue is once again fantastic. Ofcourse this is once again largely thanks to Tolkien's literature, the poems recited by Theoden or the speech of Sam to Frodo ( By rights, we shouldn't even be here ) result in once again a very human story about hope, friendship and brotherhood. Which is ofcourse another thing that Jackson has succeeded as, the constant lingering fear of hopelessness, only to triumph in a great emotional climax in the end.<br/><br/>The acting in the Two Towers is near flawless, and seems to be even a notch above the first one in this aspect. Andy Serkis is absolutely brilliant as the crooked Gollum suffering from a split personality, and his voice perfectly emphasizes this feeling of 500 years of depravity and lust for the ring. Mirando Otto's facial acting when told of Aragorn's 'death' is also worthy of special notice, as the sheer genuine emotion there is almost too much to bear.<br/><br/>Once again, the Two Towers takes its time to set up the premise of the Rohan storyline, and does this with excellent characterization & character bonding. However, the build up would be worth less if it wasn't topped off with the incredible climax during the battle of Helm's Deep, which is undoubtedly one of the greatest cinematic sieges ever put to screen. From the very first shots of this massive army marching before the gates of Helm's Deep, you know this is going to be a special piece of filmmaking. Emphasized by gloomy rainy weather conditions and night-time, this siege is highly atmospheric and this does manage to capture the hopelessness of the situation even more. The story of the siege on Helm's Deep is worthy of a movie in itself, as every single new situation brings our main characters ( Who we have grown to care so much about ) in danger. The editing in this sequence, in particular the amount of widescreen shots as opposed to the closer shots of our protagonists fighting off the Uruk-Hai, is once again perfection. It is only when all hope seems lost, with only a couple handful of soldiers left, that our heroes decide to ride out and meet the adversaries, resulting in an incredible triumphant emotional climax as if we were riding besides them. However, the true climax was still yet to come, as a beautiful image of Gandalf appearing in full white with the Rohirrim behind him is seen, followed by a long charge down a very steep hill, combined with extraordinary cinematography & Shore's incredible score, resulting in one of the greatest charges ever filmed. The emotional satisfaction in this is inhumanly high, and the fact that the victory is pronounced over Sam's very human speech to Frodo makes it even more involving and emotional.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is the weakest link in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which is admittedly not saying much, since there are very few films that can possibly compete with it. Featuring superb acting, fantastic dialogue, excellent slow paced characterization, an even more impressive Howard Shore score, gorgeous cinematography & one of the greatest sieges of all-time, The Two Towers is indeed one of the all-time greats of motion pictures."

","Peter Jacksons' first major task was to make Lord of the Rings into one film. ""Impossible"", Peter Jackson said, there was no way he could fit all the information into one film. But one of the producers in New Line Cinema said why not make three films because there is three books. It was exactly what the crew making the film wanted to hear. So then the scripts were re-writ to fit three films. After the theatrical release, director Peter Jackson wanted to create an extended version for each film. This was because Peter Jackson wanted to capture it for posterity.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings was a cinematic masterpiece, the greatest book of the 20th Century was made into the greatest film trilogy of the 21st Century.<br/><br/>""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was probably the hardest to adapt,"" admitted director Peter Jackson. It was also the longest and most frustrating experience of Peter Jacksons directing career. But the two Towers is not a failure but it does not match up to the quality of the Fellowship of the Ring.The Two Towers continues the adventures of the fellowship as they separate and take their own routes; Frodo makes his way to Mordor with Sam, and his guide Gollum, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli head to find Merry and Pippin and to defend Helms Deep from Isengard. The film struggles to make an impact, although the film is good enough to keep your interest high for the concluding part in the trilogy, the Return of the King."

It is sort of the antithesis of Tolkien, who presented hobbits as admirable for their simplicity and courage. The wrong aspects of seventeen- year-old boys are being appealed to here."

But I was reminded of watching the Baski animated version - this section of the saga suffers from cutting between gripping stuff and tedious stuff, especially Merry and Pippin on bloody boring Treebeard. Loved the addition of the warg attack but it did have the effect of making Middle Earth seem tiny and, if Saruman's forces could reach Rohan so quickly then why didn't he head straight for Helm's Deep and stop them getting in? Eh?<br/><br/>Also, the battle left me cold. Compared to Boromir's last stand, all these computer-generated t**ts running about were just unconvincing. And why is Gimli nothing but clumsy comic relief? All that 'toss me' stuff - terrible.<br/><br/>But, by far the worst crime here is Legolas skateboarding down the steps.

The screenwriters, which ones I don't know, have done a poor job of translating Tolkien to the screen (and no, capturing Tolkien's spirit is difficult but not impossible in a movie so don't throw out that straw man), and contrary to what Peter Jackson stated on the special edition DVD of FoTR, they have not stayed as close to the original story as possible and HAVE thrown their own spin in.

"mstomaso","10","8","14","30 November 2007"," Part Two: An Examination of Trust, Intention, and Goodness
","The Two Towers is the second book in Tolkien's masterpiece trilogy of invented English mythology and the second film in Peter Jackson's film trilogy based on the original mid-20th century novels.<br/><br/>The Fellowship has physically disbanded, though through its bonds of purpose and friendship, remains intimately connected. Two Towers follows the members of the fellowship through their continuing, and increasingly dark and dangerous, adventures as they each do their part (whether accidental or intentionally) to try to save all that is good in Middle Earth from the power-hungry eye of Sauron, Lord of Mordor. Frodo (Wood) and Samwise (Aston) are lead by their captive Smeagol/Golem (Serkus) to Mordor, but Golem's intentions are, at best, suspicious.<br/><br/>The ring has begun to taint Frodo's mind and soul, and rage and hate make fleeting and uncharacteristic appearances in this previously innocent and light-hearted Hobbit. He has already begun to recognize that he and Golem have more in common than anybody would care to admit. His profound friendship with Sam is very nicely portrayed in this film and is as central in the film as it is in Tolkien's original work. Smeagol/Golem is also treated sympathetically and his ambiguity and the polarity of his personalities are key to his role as an unpredictable element.<br/><br/>The story also introduces three major human characters- Theodin (Hill), Eowyn (Otto), and Farromir - all of whom will play important parts in the Fellowship's mission as the story progresses. Two important, but less often present characters are also introduced  Grima Wormtongue (Dourif) and Eomer (Urban). As I discussed in my review of the Fellowship, the casting and acting are perfect, and the new additions are no exception.<br/><br/>Andy Serkus' and the animation team's Golem becomes a major character in The Two Towers. Serkus' contributions to the character are profound, and very nicely reflected in the special features for the Two Towers. I look forward to seeing more work from this performer and I sincerely hope that he does not go over-looked or remain type-cast.<br/><br/>In the first film, during a valiant and successful attempt to prevent harm from coming to Frodo, Merry and Pippin (Monaghan and Boyd) are carried off by Saruman's army, narrowly escaping into Fangorn forest when the Uruk'Hai party is slain by an exiled band of Rohirim lead by Eomer. The hobbits manage to wind up in the hands of an Ent  a wise old walking tree and steward of the forest, who they try to convince to join in the fight against Saruman and Sauron.<br/><br/>Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas continue their dogged attempt to rescue Merry and Pippin, and an old friend unexpectedly re-enters the story as several components of the Fellowship come together to devise an improbable defense of the land of Rohan against the overwhelming force of Mordor.<br/><br/>Like The Fellowship, the Two Towers manages to capture the essence of Tolkien's story and characters while rearranging portions for better cinematic continuity and emphasizing interpretive connections which are not wholly obvious in Tolkien's writing. Two elements keep Frodo from the brink of abject insanity  Sam and Smeagol. Smeagol's addiction to the ring allows Frodo to sympathize with him in a way that only an addict can understand. Sam's pure and clear-headed love for Frodo offers a sane and reliable anchor. Other members of the Fellowship help each other in similar ways as Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas prepare for battle and Gandalf works hard to repair the damaged bonds between Rohan and Gondor.<br/><br/>The darkest and most uncomfortable of the three movies, The Two Towers is also, in some ways, the most powerful. The themes are morality, sacrifice, friendship and, as always, the nature and just use of power. Many have commented on Tolkien's religious beliefs and their permeation throughout the LOTR, but it is worth noting that the great scholar uses components of many different cultures and belief systems to create the world he portrays, and  from a strict Roman Catholic perspective (Tolkien's religion of choice) - there are many more blasphemies in LOTR than there are catholic metaphors and symbols. In the Two Towers, the internal power struggle between good and evil gains momentum within the fellowship's principal protagonists. As with the fellowship, the art direction, score and soundscaping subtly add great depth to the entire experience.<br/><br/>The story and its themes are in no way subordinated to the technical merit of the film, but its methods are still very noteworthy. Golem is not an animated insertion who intrudes in every scene, but rather, a fully developed central character around whom Frodo and Sam's story arc revolves. The sets and landscapes, just like the Fellowship before it, are immersive and in every way as sensually real as if they had been built thousands of years ago and weathered by exposure to the elements of Middle Earth. The battle scenes are exciting, dramatic and believable. And the special features on the Special Edition box set explain how all of this was accomplished with lucidity."
"chaosduck","1","22","48","22 June 2003"," The movie is an insult to the book.
","The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers, simply put, is a travesty of monumental proportions. This may sound like a tired cliche but so is the production of this movie. The sheer arrogance to mess around with the greatest story put to print is unbelievable. The changes in the story and characters go far beyond interpretation and seem to suggest that Mr Jackson simply feels that Tolkien got it wrong. Peter Jackson's movie embodies all the disdain that Tolkien had for Hollywood, but I guess the money makes it easy to live with, and he claims to be a fan. Read the book, miss the film.

","The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects."
"moore031","1","13","26","19 December 2002"," Disappointed and Angry
","After the wonderful realization of ""The Fellowship of The Ring,"" I was greatly anticipating the next installment with ""The Two Towers."" As a writer I can understand that some changes need to be made to adapt a book to a film; however, I think the title given to this movie should have been ""Peter Jackson's Two Towers."" The plot changes and additional scenes with Arwen were absolutely unnecessary for translating the book to film. These changes simply represented how the director wanted the books to go and the heck with Tolkein.<br/><br/>There was much to like about the movie in terms of art direction and special effects. Unfortunately, so much attention went to creating digital characters (and I'll say that Gollum was nicely done in large part to Andy Serkis' work) that the real actors were left to stand around and watch, or react to what the virtual characters were doing, which was the downfall of ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace."" Thankfully Gollum was no Jar Jar Binks, but it still created a similar issue. The relationships between the characters in ""Fellowship of the Ring"" were beautiful and moving, and now all of a sudden everyone's emotionally disconnected with each other - except for Arwen and Strider, and Arwen never once set foot in the ""Two Towers"" book! Ugh.<br/><br/>I'm no purist where Tolkein is concerned and I would have been able to live with small changes necessary to make a movie. For example, I can understand why the film didn't end at the same place that the book did and that didn't bother me too much. Nevertheless, there were some very rich scenes in Tolkein's novel (from the growing friendship between Legolas and Gimli, to some very moving moments between Frodo and Sam, one of which awakens the best out of Gollum for a moment) that were ignored and replaced by Mr. Jackson's own ideas. This I cannot live with and makes me very angry.  I hope he gets back to Tolkein's world when he finishes the last movie because I don't like Jackson's."
"donxavier","1","15","31","26 December 2002"," What is Jackson smokin?
","Let me just say to the Tolkien fans out there that love Jackson's treatment, yet, with the same breath, blast Bakshi's version. What is wrong with you?? Yeah, Bakshi took SOME liberties but at least he kept to the story of FOTR and TT. Jackson, at points, seems to be telling a completely different tale and re-writing characters when it amuses him.<br/><br/>I didn't think it was possible to make Tolkien boring but, unhappily, Jackson's TT proved me wrong. I wasn't the only one checking my watch many times during the film. I noticed several people in the audience doing the same.<br/><br/>Now, I will say I did like the Director's Cut version of FOTR. However, I hated TT so much that I doubt I will even find the DC version appealing.<br/><br/>Please, don't label me a purist, as that suggests unwillingness to accept different visions or interpretations of Mr. Tolkien's work. I do not mind changes being made to the story --- when they are good ones. However, Mr. Jackson and his gang of ink flinging scribes are not sophisticated enough writers to make these changes work or ring true.<br/><br/>The wafer-thin melodrama he adds into TT, in order to build suspense, is laughable and obvious. Aragorn getting carried over the cliff edge was nothing more than another Hollywood cliche, already seen hundreds of times in other films, meant to keep the viewing masses on the edge of their seats. Come on!!! LOTR has not been so popular for all these long years for nothing. There is already enough suspense, drama and action in this epic. PLEASE, Mr. Jackson, don't add your muck."
"joe_hill","1","26","60","21 December 2002"," Why make movies based on something you don't like?
","The problem with this movie is that Peter Jackson seem to believe that Middle- earth is somewhere in the Star Wars galaxy or on board James Camerons Titanic. Therefore he has re-written the story from the book in an attempt to make it ""bigger and better"". In the original text there where no fun side-kicks with good one-liners and there where not enough cool toys so Peter had to throw in some Orc wolf riders and dwarf jokes. Then he find Frodos meeting with Faramir to be a bit too boring in the book, so he ""spice it up"" with a ""dramatic"" scene where Frodo stands in front of a ring wraith trying to give it the ring. Yeah baby! There are also plenty of not good enough acting from the extras. Extremely theatrical lines like ""Look it's the king!"" are a bit too common. If you thought the books where boring then maybe this is a film for you. Now there are plenty of ""fun"" side-kicks in it to save you from embarrassing seconds of silence or non-action. If you actually liked the books, stay away from this movie."
"harly900","1","13","27","18 December 2002"," Why, Peter. Why?
","I am a LOTR fan, but I nearly walked out of this movie. The acting was good and the scenes were well choreographed, but the plot failed to flow. This move ignored the book it was supposed to be about. The timelines in the book were ignored; the character development for new characters (such as Faramir) was bastardised and ruined for 'dramatic purposes'; scenes were added that did not exist in the book. I can [barely] accept the whole 'Arwen as Frodo's saviour' from The Fellowship Of The Ring, but what Jackson has done this time made me feel nauseous - I actually felt the desire to vomit while watching this movie. The movie started and seemed to rush forward without any sense of coherency or sense of timing, and then they started on the action to blind the audience to the significant gaps in the plot. The action was good, but the gaps in the plot made it hard to follow. This WAS 3 hours of my life I will never be able to get back."
"grrrr97","1","11","22","18 December 2002"," Take out 5 chapters, put some made up rubbish in and you have Peter Jackson's The Two Towers
","This film isn't just missing small parts of the story; it's missing five plus chapters!!!<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Ring pleased me in that apart from small pieces it stayed, true to the original book. It was, I thought badly directed. I say this because I believe Jackson is at heart a producer. His organizational skills are amazing that at least is evident from the sheer amount of info LOTR holds within its pages. But he has no visual imagination whatsoever. Fellowship and The Two Towers are badly shot and badly edited. To put it in short I think Jackson is a second rate director who only got these films through blind enthusiasm, rather than ethical ability or quality of work.<br/><br/>The two Towers is an insult to everything Tolkien wrote, Peter Jackson for some unexplained reason has gone from following the book of FOTR pretty well to just doing what he wants in TTT. The first half of the film is more or less true to the book and I was enjoying it. Gollum especially, but about half way through just after King Theoden and his people left for Helms deep in anticipation of the attack of Sarumans army, THE STORY WENT OFF THE RAILS LIKE A SPEEDING TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! With Aragorn falling over the cliff after the fight with the Wolf riding Orcs (WHICH WASN'T IN THE BOOK) as if that wasn't laughable enough, then the plot goes off into a dreamland about Aragorn and Aowhen's (sorry if her names wrong:) love affair and the choices they must make for the greater good. Well nice try in giving the story more depth BUT STICK TO THE BOOK!!!!!! <br/><br/>I don't know about any of you but I went to see J.R.R Tolkiens The Lord of The Rings, not Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings. Ok it's still an adaptation, but FOTR was more or less the same as the book, why ON EARTH insult Tolkein's fans and Tolkien himself by taking one of the greatest works of fiction ever and changing it in any way you want. I think it was an attempt to fool everyone who haven't got the sense to read the books and make more cash on the side.<br/><br/>THERE'RE AT LEAST FIVE CHAPTERS MISSING AT THE END OF THIS FILM. Now the people who I was chatting to today about it said well you cant have it all in the film it would be about 9 hours long. GRRRRRR! I said the annoying thing is if Jackson had left out all the rubbish he made up and put in the parts of the story, which should be there, YOU COULD HAVE FITTED IT ALL IN. I am of course referring to Shelob the great spider, which bites Frodo and then Sam takes on the Ring himself and the bookends on a cliff-hanger. He's chucked that out and put it in the next film, The Return of the King, which is already the longest book anyway, without putting huge chunks of story in from the other films.<br/><br/>If you ask me Jackson has quiet literally lost the plot and in some style, instead of creating a realistic and accurate film on Tolkein's book he's done what he wants with it and I'm sorry but I think he should be slapped for even having the nerve!!!!!<br/><br/>The only people who will totally enjoy this film are the ones who haven't read the books AND SADLY THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM.<br/><br/>BUT I'M DREADING WHAT HE'S GONNA CUT OUT AND EVEN MORE SO WHAT HE INVENTS TO STUFF INTO THE NEXT ONE....A YEAR OF DREAD IS AHEAD"
"jewelthrone","5","5","8","7 November 2010"," A compromised vision.
","Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars."

","The people who vote against this movie or didn't see it, or just hate it for hatred. This is the movie that changed the movie industry and set foot for the digital actors (3D Animation). This movie is a living legend, a god, and will rule for a century in my opinion.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you have not seen this trilogy, go and see it as soon as possible, as it is not just a movie about medieval times, it has everything a real movie should: Beautiful people (not a single ugly face), amazing art, incredible places (looks like heaven with skies of many colors, water and so much more). The acting is superb, the best in the world, they really hired the BEST out there, and as far as I can see, the movie was awesome because they did not allowed the motion picture to be corrupted with ""political"" reasons, so, all the actors, Post-production, sound, effects and everything else was really the BEST, no corrupted piece!!!!<br/><br/>The story is immortal, will get you in tears no matter what you are made of. The characters... so well done!!!<br/><br/>Do you know why this movie is so good? I will tell my opinion on it: I think it is THAT good, because Peter Jackson worked on it for more than 10 years (was forced to wait 10 years because no one wanted to give him the green light to shoot), that is why, it is a good way to ensure a good quality."
"LeRoyMarko","9","5","8","21 March 2004"," My favorite of the trilogy!
","The epic saga of Middle Earth continues in this very good sequel to Fellowship. In fact, I think it's the best of the trilogy. I enjoyed it even more because I knew a bit more about the characters and the story. I must admit that I haven't read the books. <br/><br/>The special effects are once again great and the battle scenes are spectacular. I wouldn't say this is one of the 10 best movies ever made, but it's still very entertaining. And I think it really has to be seen on a big screen to be fully appreciated. I also liked the humor brought by characters like Gimli. But Gollum was a bit too present in the movie. My favorite characters: Arwen (Liv Tyler), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Too bad that the Arwen and Galadriel characters are not more important.<br/><br/>Out of 100, I gave it 88. That's good for ***½ out of ****.<br/><br/>Seen in Toronto, at the Famous Players Paramount Cinemas, on January 19th, 2003."

However, the second time I went, I went with a Lord of the Rings fan who was explaining the story to me nonstop.  It was better that time, but still not that good. The third time I understood it completely, but the fourth time I got bored of it.  I think it would have been a better movie if it was a little easier to understand.

"jimbo-53-186511","5","3","4","7 May 2016"," Jackson tries to do too much here
","I must admit that I did enjoy the first film and although it perhaps was a little slow in setting up the story it still remains a fairly compelling watch overall. Sadly I didn't get that same feeling when watching this second instalment for the following reasons...<br/><br/>Firstly, splitting all of the characters up and trying to show the story from various different perspectives is a risky strategy. If it's done wrong then it can make the film feel unfocused and not particularly interesting and sadly this second instalment falls into this very trap.<br/><br/>The film flits about from character to character, story arc to story arc without giving any particular character or story arc chance to develop or grow properly. It doesn't help that sometimes there can be long gaps from one story arc to another meaning that you may have forgotten what was going on in the previous story arc? I got the feeling that Jackson was trying to weave the stories together, but it seems that this isn't one of his strengths.<br/><br/>The second thing that bothered me slightly about this film was the character of Gollum - for some reason I felt that we were being teased in the first film that he was an interesting character that's shrouded in mystery. Whilst his character is fun for a bit, his repetitive rantings and antics do start to grate after a while.<br/><br/>I was also disappointed that Gandalf and Saruman weren't given much screen time here - the former seemed to just drift in and out of the story and the latter was only really featured towards the end. Although their absences were perhaps necessary to the story I found them to be the most compelling characters and was a bit annoyed that they both weren't in the film more often.<br/><br/>The final battle sequences are nicely staged and once again the performances from the principal cast were excellent - Bernard Hill's superb performance helped the film greatly when McKellen and Lee weren't on screen. John Rhys Davies also provided some excellent comic relief which again helped to improve my overall opinion of this film.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is still a worthy film that's relatively enjoyable, but I just felt that by splitting the characters up and in establishing separate story arcs that it felt a little disjointed and lacked the smooth and more simplistic flowing of the story in the first film."
"arussell23","7","3","4","8 June 2015"," 'Towers' works on almost every level, except one plot thread
","Welcome back to my reviews of the Middle-Earth saga. We've gone on An Unexpected Journey, visited The Desolation of Smaug, witnessed The Battle of the Five Armies, and met The Fellowship of the Ring. Today, we are going to go on our next stop of the Lord of the Rings saga. Fasten your seatbelts, it's time to get hit by a waterfall. Let's enter...<br/><br/>...The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The Two Towers follows several different plot threads: Sam and Frodo continue their quest to get to Mount Doom, as a creature named Gollum accompanies them; Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas all go in search of the Hobbits, and later head to Edoras in Rohan to assist in battle; Merry and Pippin are taken captive by Urku-hai and later meet a Ent that may help them in their quest.<br/><br/>This is probably my least favorite of the three films, let me just tell you that before we begin. Of course, that doesn't mean it's not a good film, it's a fantastic one. It's just I don't like some of the new characters we are introduced to and Merry and Pippin's story isn't that interesting to me. Anyway, let's get on with the review.<br/><br/>As usual, the best thing about the film is it's music. The music created by Howard Shore is always welcome, even in the film's most slow areas. The acting is really great too, by all members, but especially Elijah Wood and Sean Astin. Wood really portrays Frodo's desperation and slow descent into a form of madness due to him being influenced by the ring. Astin really works well with Wood, making Sam more than just a sidekick, but both a rock and friend that Frodo needs in his times of desperation.<br/><br/>The special effects are just as good as the previous films, if not better. Treebeard and Gollum are the obvious highlights, and they are created so convincingly that I couldn't really see any issues with them. I recently read that Treebeard was filmed on a green screen, and honestly, I couldn't tell, even when I watched some of the scenes in HD. Magnificent.<br/><br/>The cinematography and, well, shots of the film both are done beautifully. Every scene where groups are riding to battle and scenes where we see sweeping shots of landscapes look amazing, and you can tell that Jackson and anybody else working on that part of the film really wanted it to look good. The best example of this, in my opinion, is the first scene right before we get into what happened to Gandalf.<br/><br/>The plot works, for the most part. I found the scenes in Rohan to be the most interesting. Like Peter Jackson said, The Two Towers is mainly focused on Aragorn. It's his main story. So, obviously, that was going to be the most interesting and the most focused upon. I also liked Frodo, Sam and Gollum's story. Gollum's internal struggle is made that much harder halfway through the film, when Frodo has to do something that he didn't want to do. I have to wonder, if that hadn't have happened, would Gollum have been more accepting of not leading Frodo and Sam where they end up in Return of the King?<br/><br/>I don't know. I did think that the weakest story, and the one that I don't like to watch, is the story with Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard. I like the character of Treebeard, but it doesn't really work for me. It's just so boring, and it's usually cutting away from the more intriguing stories. Less focus on their tale would have worked for me.<br/><br/>In conclusion, overall, The Two Towers is a intriguing follow-up to The Fellowship of the Ring. While I had some issues with Merry and Pippin's storyline, the film itself is a action-packed ride and a great lead- up to the grand finale in The Return of the King.<br/><br/>10/10. Grade: A"
"Al_The_Strange","10","3","4","5 April 2014"," LOTR TTT Review
","In The Fellowship of the Ring, the film saga of the Lord of the Rings was kicked-off in an endearing and faithful way. It meticulously established the groundwork for a cast of iconic heroes, settings with palpable folklore, and a grand journey that would stagger the imagination. The adventure continues in The Two Towers, with all the same flair and attention to detail that was established before. Only now, it's a return to familiar territory, and the film uses every opportunity to expand the narrative and present an even stronger fantasy experience.<br/><br/>Picking up where the first film let off, The Two Towers wastes no time in tracking each character's tangent and showing what happens next. The film's opening, showing Gandalf confronting the monstrous Balrog, is an awe-inspiring sight as it is. Then we continue to follow Frodo and Sam on their quest to Mordor, and it is touch-and-go for them as they evade enemy forces and consort with the villainous Gollum. At the same time, the film tracks Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli as they trek into Rohan, to inevitably confront the threat of orc invasion head-on. All these plot threads build up to a magnificent climax, including the Battle of Helm's Deep (a lengthy and awesome siege), the marching of the Ents (an imaginative and inspiring sequence), and the skirmishes of Osgiliath (providing the emotional climax to accentuate the action). It is a consistently engaging film with plenty of awesome spectacle.<br/><br/>The story branches off into multiple directions with quite a lot of characters. You'd think it would be hard to keep track of everything (a complaint that made Cloud Atlas so inaccessible to audiences), but this film somehow manages to juggle everything perfectly, giving each tangent just enough time so that it never fades far from memory. It's easy to keep track of the characters and their movements across Middle-Earth, even with the addition of new characters, taut political drama, and even more folklore thrown in. The characters remain as endearing as ever, and the plot is manipulated with expert precision. Tolkein purists may be quick to point out the changes from the source material, which become more numerous in this film than in its predecessor, but the basics of the story remain intact. Most changes are made to accommodate the story's events across the three films in the most presentable way. While the film continues to utilize the classic epic-journey plot structure, it digs up some relevant themes concerning war, industrialization, and courage throughout.<br/><br/>As before, the film is crafted expertly, with excellent photography and editing. Acting continues to impress from the whole cast; Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Orlando Bloom, John Rhyes-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, and Cate Blanchett all continue to inhabit their characters aptly. Andy Serkis steals the spotlight, while Karl Urban, David Wenham, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, and Miranda Otto offer welcome additions to the cast. The writing is great. Locales are beautiful. This production continues to use top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Howard Shore's music score is still impressively magnificent.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a thrilling continuation of the events laid forth in The Fellowship of the Ring, and it builds up to one impressive climax. It's still a great story told with great style, and with good attention to depth and detail. As strong of an experience as it is, it's still only building up to an even grander experience...<br/><br/>The Extended Cut of this film includes about 45 minutes of new scenes. Some of it includes extended action and battle scenes, which are cool. There's also a great flashback scene involving Faramir and Boromir. There are also a bunch of really neat smaller scenes, many of which adapt specific scenes from the book, or offer more to the characters. It is a really cool cut of the movie that's well worth seeing.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"

","Peter Jackson has done it again, with the second movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Two Towers"". An excellent film, but it is my least favourite in the trilogy.<br/><br/>Sam and Frodo continue their journey towards Mordor to rid Middle Earth of the One Ring, while Aragon, Gimli and Legolas prepare to do battle with the armies of the dark. Also, we get to see Gollum for the first time in this film, in all of his CG glory! Pure screen magic. Amazing special effects, a great storyline continuing the tale, this is a film that should definitely not be missed! The end battle is pure CG magic! Peter Jackson has done it once again! I recommend the extended edition, which shows us more in this wonderful tale.<br/><br/>I say that this is my least favourite in the trilogy for the simple reason that it jumps from Sam and Frodo, to Aragon and Legolas, to Merry and Pippen, and back and forth. It can get somewhat confusing and hard to follow if you have not read the books.<br/><br/>Despite this one minor flaw, the film is eye-poppingly beautiful, from the beautiful scenes, to the amazing special effects. Definitely not a film to be missed!"

","In this trilogy there is a beginning that sets up the audience for the characters and the plot, then there is a sequel where the characters continue on from where the first leaves off, certain things happen throughout the second one that prepare everyone for the third, and in the third everything comes to an awesome and amazing ending.<br/><br/>The Two Towers picks up from where The Fellowship Of The Ring left off. (Spoilers ahead) In the end of the fellowship: Gandalf fell off a ledge after defeating the balrog, Boromir was shot by orc arrows, Merry and Pippin were captured by orcs, Frodo and Sam left and continued on their quest to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli decided to follow the orcs and rescue Merry and Pippin. The two towers basically follows their adventures and shows how Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are all reunited, Merry and Pippin are rescued by the ents after their captors are attacked, and Frodo and Sam encounter the creature Gollum and ask him for help in getting to Mordor.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a much more complicated story, as there is a subplot involving a falling kingdom and their struggle to survive as orcs are trying to destroy them all. The Two towers is another feast to the eyes and imagination just like The Fellowship of the ring. There is a great battle scene in this at the climax of the story, but the battles in Return Of The King make the battle in this movie seem like a brief sprawl."
"kintopf432","6","3","4","24 November 2003"," Competent but dull, or dull but competent?
","There are some tremendously exciting fight scenes in `The Two Towers'; in fact, it's probably Peter Jackson's most excitingly choreographed work since `Braindead.'  Most of the cast reiterate the fine performances they gave in the first film, and there are some nice additions, particularly Brad Dourif's hammily rotten Grima Wormtongue.  The production as a whole is as focused and thorough and poker-faced as we've come to expect from this team.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, we find that much of the fun we had in the first film has drained away.  `The Fellowship of Ring,' for all its critical overpraise, worked in the same way a BBC children's miniseries would--the plot was simple and episodic, but it was always on the move, with our young heroes and their British-character-actor friends and foes tumbling from one scrape to another.  It was good childlike fantasy fun from beginning to end. `The Two Towers,' on the other hand, is adult in the least fun sense of the term; it's dominated by its Rohan/Theoden storyline, and as such bogs down too much in the simplistic, boring propaganda of Tolkienian politics.  Like the people of Rohan, this subplot pushes itself into a hole from which it is very difficult to get out.  This provides opportunity for some grand battles, as I said, but between the flying arrows and battering rams and severed orc heads, not much happens.<br/><br/>The two other storylines are a mixed bag.  Frodo and Sam's road trip to Mordor is by far the best part of the film, even if the slippery CGI Gollum distracts too much from the hobbits' character development.  This Gollum isn't quite the revelation he's been made out to be; there's a bit too much of a cartoon to him.  Andy Serkis's Donald-Duck voice is part of the problem, yes, but most of the fault isn't the actor's.  Rather, the CGI animators, for all their technical brilliance, have been allowed to run away with themselves, and the combination of a hyper-expressive CGI face and hyper-chaotic CGI body language makes for a performance that's hammier than it should have been, and could have been.  I would much rather have seen a `Dark Crystal'-esque puppet in the role, personally.  Still, the interpretation is a well-conceived, respectable take on Tolkien's most human character, and there are times when the animators actually do hold themselves back, and the character finally becomes convincing.  Sean Astin and Elijah Wood offer nice, subtle performances, but as I said, it's hard to notice them when that little bug-eyed fellow is mugging for the back row the whole time.<br/><br/>As for the Ent storyline, well, it's a complete wash, as plodding and obvious as the big tree-people characters themselves.  It's not so much that there's anything wrong with the look of the Treebeard character or with John Rhys-Davies's voice acting, but Jackson's managing of Tolkien's triptych structure (which split the three storylines into completely different books) doesn't really work here.  It's one thing to jump back and forth between the Frodo/Sam and Aragorn/Theoden plots, because things are actually happening in them to move the plot along.  (They're not always interesting things, but you take what you can get.)  But literally NOTHING happens in the Ent storyline until the very end of the film, and jumping back to it every twenty minutes or so stalls the action terribly.  Not only that, it confuses the three subplots' temporal arc--come on, the people of Rohan have debated on what to do, fled Edoras, made an exodus to Helm's Deep, fought battle after battle after battle . . . and Merry and Pippin are STILL riding that miserable tree across the forest?<br/><br/>Yet, for all its drawbacks, the film as a whole may be better than the sum of its parts, and fanboys, as always, will be less concerned with how entertaining the film is than with its minor digressions from the book. Non-fanboys will find it competent, certainly, but also a bit dull.  6.5 out of 10."

Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity. <br/><br/>
The Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell.  J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision.  Every character is a prototype.  <br/><br/>Frodo is the hero on a great quest.  Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero.  Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth.  Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same.  Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale.  The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed.  Computer animation works wonderfully with the Ents and Gollum.<br/><br/>I am thrilled that Two Towers had been so popular and has made money.<br/><br/>Bring on The Return of The King."

He has a vision of Middle Earth, that none of us could've imagined.<br/><br/>On one hand this is a fantasy, and it's totally not real.  That's why I think it's unbeliveable.  How could this happen?

"zorea","Null","3","4","13 September 2003"," Jackson should have called it ""Middle Earth Stories"" - It has nothing to do with Tolkien except the names and places
","After watching the Two Towers, I was so disappointed that I left the theater resolved not to buy the DVD and to sell my current copy the Fellowship (which I bought in the hope that it would be redeemed by the later movies.) To be fair, my frame of reference for the movie was based entirely on the books, which I have been reading (over and over again) since I was nine. It seems as though Peter Jackson takes some perverse pleasure it making the characters do exactly the opposite of what they did in the books.  I understand it is difficult to transport any book to the screen, but Jackson's changes were not even remotely consistent.  This... of course... is the heart of my disappointment.  Tolkien wrote a story that seemed to peer into another world - not just of fantasy, but a worldview that is in essence pre-modern.  Tom Shippey (Journey into Middle Earth) explains it as a reconstruction of the Middle Ages and its psychology - with priorities, duties, and responsibilities appropriate to that era.  C.S. Lewis talked about it as a ""Discarded Image"" that we once knew, but now no longer fully understand.  The Lord of the Rings is a fascinating glimpse into a world where honor and virtue (the immaterial world) stands always higher than the temptations of the material world (such as greed, selfishness, pettiness, etc.)  Peter Jackson captures none of that.  More importantly, his free reconstructions not only confuse the story on the surface level, but also run completely counter to the spirit of the book.  Jackson's characters have no concept of higher duties or responsibilities - they are portrayed as weak creatures constantly at struggle with their base emotions (with no room for higher ideals).  In fact, this movie was especially dark and pessimistic. True... this may reflect the modern mindset - in fact, it probably mimics it perfectly.  The problem is that I love Tolkien precisely because it does not pander to the modern mindset.  It speaks of higher things.  I have friends who have never read the books who liked the movie, and I suspect that my love of the books has significantly shaded my perspective.  Indeed, if viewed completely on its own terms, the movie is probable fine.  But... what I find continually disturbing is Jackson's repeated claims that he has remained true to the book - that is an outright lie!  I know he does not want to offend the Tolkien fan base (like me), but I find his pleas of innocence to have exactly the opposite effect.  He did not stay true to the book, in either its letter or its spirit.  It would have been less startling to me if he had simply called it by another name and made no pretense of turning the book into a movie.<br/><br/>On an altogether separate, more technical, note; I found the movie to suffer generally from poor direction.  I realize this goes against the grain of almost of the critics, but honestly, I have a problem with Jackson's style of directing - this is completely apart from his editorial abuses. Specifically, he does not give the characters time to consider or reflect on the events; the cuts are too quick and unsatisfying.  And this is not just a problem with too much material in too short a time - he could have lost the entire sequence with Aragon and Arwen freeing up 30 minutes or more (without any loss to the story).  Also, Jackson so desperately wants this to be epics that he throws in giant panoramic scenes - unfortunately, he does so with the frenetic energy he puts into the scene cuts, which means that the scenes are constantly in dizzying movement.  A sustained shot would be nice, and might give the viewer a moment or two to take in the context of the events. But alas, Jackson's sweep do not allow you to catch in any details, or even any of the magnitude.  This leads me to the final technical complaint; for all the buzz surrounding the special effects, Jackson's team seems unfit for the job.  I suspect he is constantly moving the panoramic shots because the scenes would not hold up to closer examinations.  Elsewhere, the CGI characters (with the exception of Gollum, who was created and performed very well) were shallow fascimilies.  There were several places during the final battle sequences, where I could almost see the blue/green screen overlays. If Jackson wants to create a competitor to ILM, he will be disappointed. The special effects were both unsubtle and immature - they did not blend well into the story, and were, occasionally, simply distracting.<br/><br/>Of course, if you have not read the books, these problems are minor and you may well love the movie.  If you have read the books - but only so long ago that you can't remember the storyline, then you might like the reunion with old (albeit completely different) characters.  If you love the books, their stories, and their message - this movie is probably not for you."

"fernandoschiavi","10","4","6","11 March 2015"," A film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King
","A year after the release of The Fellowship of the Ring, all moviegoers were more than eager to continue the first masterpiece of the XXI century. The Two Towers comes with the huge responsibility of maintaining the fascination left by the first movie, introduce more characters and various others having to be even grander. And he does this goal perfectly. Battles unthinkable, many new important events happening, new characters emerge, and even better effects finalized and dramas more pronounced, are just some of what The Two Towers has to offer. In The Two Towers, the journey continues to seek the destruction of the One Ring. <br/><br/>Since the outline of the scripts, Peter Jackson knew that adjustments would be interconnected but would own souls. The Two Towers is not exactly a sequel, but the second chapter in the saga of the ring. The main difference we noticed right away when compared to the Company, is the tone of the narrative. The first contained dark environments of Middle-earth, but was predominantly magical, charming and fantastic weather. This is due to a specific reason: it was necessary to introduce the spectator races of beings that inhabit the world created by Tokien, being required to show their worlds that have nothing to dark as the Shire and Rivendell. From gloomy just quick passage in the Prancing Pony inn and of course the long sequences in the mines of Moira. However, the story is not as dark and the main concern is to tell the origin of the ring, to make clear the importance of its destruction, and setting the villains and heroes in the public mind, especially the uninitiated in the original work. <br/><br/>Unlike the first in which all of the Company are together and will slowly separating, in The Two Towers director Peter Jackson wisely alternates between the three parallel stories in completely opposite places in the geography of Middle-earth. Still, changes of pace and scenery are beneficial contributing to the advancement of events. Amid the three stories, we enjoying new characters, scenarios filled with visually stunning scenes. The movie starts directly in chapter two of the book since the first chapter of The Two Towers became the last of The Fellowship of the Ring to the first end with a climax better resolved in the script. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas go after the hobbits Merry and Pippin, who had been captured by orcs, and is meeting with Éomer, the Third Marshal of Rohan and nephew of Theoden, King of Rohan. Eomer gives them horses and says that a group of Rohirrim had attacked and destroyed that group of Orcs two days before, and had not found any hobbit among them.<br/><br/>Certainly this second chapter is less detailed and faithful in The Fellowship of the Ring. The main changes are in the final stages of the book, but the criticisms lose some strength as some missing parts were filmed, but inserted in the next movie. In The Two Towers, despite the good progress the issue to join in an interesting three parallel stories (Merry and Pippin with the Ents, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf in Rohan; Frodo, Sam and Gollum toward Mordor). Some important parts of the book are missing for insertion into The Return of the King For the sake of pace, high duration and other factors, these choices director Peter Jackson and editor Michael Horton are fully justifiable. <br/><br/>Peter Jackson performs over exuberant work. The battle scenes are epic and a pleasure for the eyes. The director uses open shots to show the scale of the epic battle at Helm's Deep, but gives close ups and shows creative camera movements to further enhance the scenes. The momentum built from preparing for battle works fine. It is noticeable tension, hopelessness in the eyes of citizens not warriors, mostly women and children. A desperate struggle for life chances seemingly against thousands of enemies, which is modified until the arrival of Gandalf and its reinforcement of troops. The scene of Gandalf leading warriors gorge below toward the enemy carried out with slow motion is one of the most dazzling film of recent times. The talented director can be seen also at the bottom where the Ents help fight the orcs of Isengard Srauman in, so as the scene of the Marshes and developing the relationship of Sam, Frodo and Gollum.<br/><br/>The Two Towers fortunately surpasses the legend that the sequence never surpasses the original, staying here at the same level. The film appealed to critics and audiences, grossing over $ 920 million worldwide, with $ 341 million in the U.S. alone. Some complained that The Fellowship of the Ring had no end, but Jackson was right to leave Boromir's death to the end increasing the emotional side. It would be very strange, a year later, the opening scene is the death that hung from the previous film. At the same time, Jackson gives interim order in this second part, knowing leave everything open for the grand conclusion of the saga in the next chapter. The Two Towers is one of the great films with content and technical working together perfectly, and it serves not only to prepare for the final chapter of the series. It is a film that has a lot to tell and is a key part of the plot which will conclude in Return of the King."
"jjlord","8","4","6","25 January 2005"," A very very good film! Perhaps not as good as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King
","Spoilers perhaps<br/><br/>First of all I'd like to say I love the trilogy as a whole and I don't think it deserves some of the stick it's getting. I mean just because it's popular people get worried that is going to ""rise above"" or become a supposedly better film among viewers. What a load of rubbish. I hate to break it to you but just because something is new doesn't mean it isn't a classic. These films are as close to a classic as any modern films at the moment. It's not an order to like these films, it's just very annoying that trolls and LOTR ""bashers"" just give it abuse just because it has a very high rating, won eleven Oscars etc. If you don't like these films you could at least give a reason.<br/><br/>Secondly I'd like to say that I feel this was weaker than FOTR and ROTK and it is #12 on my top movie list whereas FOTR is #5 and ROTK is #1. I have many old classics on my list such as The Godfather, Casablanca and Citizen Kane but for overall enjoyment this trilogy is top. I find this not as emotional as the other two. I mean the elf Haldir dies, there is a brief lovely thing with Sam near the end but apart from that not really. The main qualities about these films are that they are emotionally grabbing and feel like real life, which I feel The Two Towers didn't have, but enough of my moaning. Time for the best bits.<br/><br/>The Special Effects were absolutely awesome and 10/10 in quality and no I don't think they wrecked the film. People say also that the acting was poor however Ian Mckellen as Gandalf was superb, Sean Astin as always the Sam I imagined and as for Andy Serkis, well he was superb as Gollum. PJ and the team did terrifically well in making the creature Gollum/Smeagol. It was very interesting to see the emotional struggles he has in it. The Costume Design was good too. You always imagined an orc would look like it did. Elijah Wood as Frodo was impressive again, he's going to be a good actor! Orlando Bloom as Legolas has had so much criticism which is underserved as he isn't just a pretty boy. I can't say he deserved an Oscar as he had a smaller part than perhaps Aragorn and Frodo and Gandalf etc. Cinematography was good, the music stunning. The Sound and score superb. I highly recommend you see this film! Although I see the second and third LOTR not really as sequels, this is somewhat a very good sequel when you consider how many poor sequels there are nowadays. <br/><br/>There also many Christian Themes and good messages but I won't go into that as it is explained in a book called ""A closer look at Lord of the Rings"" which I recommend you read.<br/><br/>Overall rating-VERY GOOD GO AND SEE AND BE IN FOR A CRACKER OF A FILM!"
"jerripalmer","Null","4","6","18 October 2003"," When did Frodo and Sam go to Gondor? (Spoiler Warning!!!)
","Although I enjoyed this movie I have a few gripes. Why did they decide to stray from a good thing. I have noticed alot of the ""excellent"" & ""best movie ever"" comments are from people who have not read the books.<br/><br/>As far as I recall Frodo and Sam did not go to Gondor. EVER. Please correct me if I am wrong.<br/><br/>Also what is going on with Aragorn's storyline? It also seems to have been creatively altered from the original storyline.<br/><br/>And when did Faramir turn evil. He was not like his brother. He didn't want to use the Ring as they portray in the movie.<br/><br/>I realize that the fight scenes were important to the creators of the movie. However did they need to be quite so long? With just a few minutes of cutting and leaving out the ""never actually happened"" Gondor trip. I believe they could have actually fit in the entire book. I now wonder how long the third movie will be. Not only do they have to fit in the entire third book, but also the end of the second book.<br/><br/>For those of you who thought this was the best movie ever I just suggest you read the book. I too liked the movie, but it is not the best ever. It would have been in contention if they had stuck to the original plot as it was written. Like they did in the first movie. However they didn't and that is that. I just hope they stay truer to the storyline in The Return of the King. We shall soon see."
"Koncorde","Null","4","6","29 August 2003"," Good - but far from perfect.
","Problem with LOTR films is that they are always going to be compared to the books and peoples imaginations - and those of us with better imaginations than others often think of cooler things they'd rather have seen in the movie than others, or shown in different ways.<br/><br/>Getting away from that what you have isn't worth a film.  It's a slice of a slice of a slice of a greater whole that was never going to be perfectly encapsulated into 12 movies - let alone 3 and let alone 3 with sum total of 3 years planning taking place prior to making the first film and then a continuous sequence of production.  That doesn't lend kindly to perfection by any stretch of the imagination - and it shows.  Because it's only a slice if you watch it and haven't got the background to fill in the gaps then all you have is a mediocre story, mediocre emotional value and very little that you can actually get your teeth into.  You never get any kind of attachment to the characters - Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are getting on my nerves already and I was banking on Jackson straying completely from the book and bumping those two off - meanwhile Frodo and Sam look destined to lead a clandestine homosexual arrangement, because that's what it is - a big boys book of camping in woods and fending off mystical beasties.<br/><br/>Maybe if you watch all 3 films end to end it'd make sense - but right now the first film stands alone as an excellent piece of work, almost worthy of Tolkiens words whilst the second film goes back on the principle of 'enlightenment' and filling in background gaps by throwing everything in quickly and with little or no care for the people who haven't read the book. It sooooooo desperately needed a voice over, a few more historical flashbacks, a little more time introducing and attention paid to rather important characters such as Boromirs brother etc.<br/><br/>Anyway.  CGI scenery is 'good' so long as you ignore the glaring wobbly bits (such as the Big Gate scene closing on the ranks of filed evil men) dodgy editing and inability (Still!) to get shadows and depth right.  Sometimes matte paintings are the way to go if you can't realistically do it using a computer.  I know that doesn't allow for big panning motions across mighty castles on hilltops etc but quite frankly I don't care much for this scenic extravaganza, I'd rather them cut the wasteful 15 or so minutes of watching people run, or horses slowly ride etc and have some background info - or at least give us a voice over with some pointers in the meantime.  CGI creatures are on the whole well done, but again look like plastecine (or is plastacine?).  Gollum stands apart in this respect as he is actually surprisingly well done.  However, the artists could have done with actually ""looking"" at the effects the lighting in the scene had on the actors. Too often you'd see Sam or Frodo with their face half in shadow, then Gollum sticking out like a sore thumb because his 'shadow' doesn't come from any source within the scene.<br/><br/>Oh - and with all this CGI going on, nobody thought of fixing Legolas eyes. If we're going to see them so often in the film as he stares off into the middle distance and makes some profoundly obvious statement - then the least they can do is make them the same colour throughout.<br/><br/>Despite all this - it ranks as probably the greatest Sword+Fantasy type film.  Unfortunately considering it's only up against B-Movie Conan and the hit'n'miss Legend and the lacklustre Dungeons&Dragons this isn't much to brag about.  However, it does go an awful long way towards making Sword+Fantasy movies respectable.  Hopefully someone will now be brave enough to take on the far more movie friendly ""Dragonlance Chronicles"" (Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Winter Night, Spring Dawning etc) and do them proper justice.<br/><br/>It's an 8.  But only because I have an odd taste in movies admittedly, which would put Spaceballs as a 10.  I apologise in advance for this travesty of judgement."
"redline-1","Null","4","6","26 April 2003"," Poorly scripted, painful to watch and quite a letdown
","I'll keep my comments short and sweet:<br/><br/>1) Terrible dialouge. I lost count of how many times I cringed as lines were spewed forth. See the King of Rohan and the burial mound scene.<br/><br/>2) One dimensional characters. See Gimli's painful and never ending ""jokes."" Jar Jar Binks was given better material and more dignity.<br/><br/>3) Schizo order of the scenes. The best example of this mistake takes place during the final battle at Helms Deep. Highly intense moments of fighting would suddenly shift away to Merry and Pippin. Disconcerting and as it was done throughout the film, the pacing was tarnished.<br/><br/>4) Plot holes. One glaringly obvious one was when Frodo almost gives up the ring to a Nazgrul and THEN Faramir, who up till then had had the hobbits in chains, lets them go. That and the many others lead one to wonder where the script supervisor was.<br/><br/>5) While a bit harder to point out, this film didn't seem to have any ""magic."" It seemed flat,coarse and underwhelming. For example one thing I rememember while watching ""Fellowship"" was not wanting the film to end as it was so enthralling. In TT I couldn't wait for the film to FINISH!<br/><br/>To sum up, if you're still in Jr. High I'm sure this film will fit your view as being ""the best movie of all time"" as previous comments have indicated. For the rest of us however this film was pretty wretched. Note - I'm quite a big fan of JR.R. Tolkein's works so my distaste for TT was not due to ignorance. At the same time let me remark that I had no problem with the foreknowledge that a film of the LOTR would necessitate some changes from the books. My criticisms are focused on how shoddily done the film itself was."

Then we watch Sam and Frodo have the same conversation over and over and over again: 'Oh, Sam, I can't go on.' 'It's the ring, Mr Frodo, I know!' Oh, and now they have this creepy character called Gollum that follows them around and is supposed to be entertaining, but comes across as irritating. For some reason Sam still calls Frodo 'Mr'. Oh, then some boring talking trees show up and bore to death even the characters themselves. What chance does the audience stand? Finally we get to the climax and the grand battle. Except Jackson doesn't know how to direct it. The tone wavers. It goes between terror (women and children expecting to be slaughtered) to comedy with Gimli and Legolas. And then he keeps interrupting the battle in order to cut to those boring bits with the talking trees. He even adds slow motion in the battle scenes for no good reason. The end result is that there is no rhythm to the battle and the emotion is dissipated. There you have it. Lots of noise and CGI, and no emotion - apart from boredom."
"Hareb-Serap","3","7","13","3 April 2003"," Not as good as they want you to think...
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Since I have read the books once, my review will of course be weighted somewhat by that.<br/><br/>First, let me try to see the movie as a new film, no preferences, just another movie. It is nearly 3 hours long, a format very hard to master. You have to keep the viewer interested at all time not to let him/her fall asleep. This is mainly done by effects in this movie, which I think is not enough. The plot does not contain the sufficient amount of suspense, nor does the music. The plot vanishes in monumental 20 minutes scenes just saying: ""There was a fight"" or ""He is the bad guy"". Scenes like that are just there to restate something that was even too obvious the first time it was shown. Accompanied by an equally monumental musical score this constant insulting of your intelligence just makes your mind go numb. Peter Jackson could have said all this movie says in one hour instead of three, if he was a good director. A film is only as good as it's story.<br/><br/>Some things are of course good. The casting is great (with some exceptions), the acting is as good as one can expect, the scenery is good (OK, the barren waste since a thousand years is a lush forest, but who cares? I don't) and the special effects are marvelous and incredible. Sadly, that's all there is to it. I really wanted this trilogy to be the best, the greatest films ever created. I hoped that the second part would be better than the far from perfect first movie, but I got brutally let down. Beneath the crust of pure eye candy this is a hollow void.<br/><br/>The conclusion is: Go see this movie, but don't expect anything but a nice computer demo. The animators deserve the credits, the ""director"" should be ashamed.<br/><br/>Corrolary: Since Peter Jackson has written his own plot I would like to state some of the major differences. People saying that the books are just good vs. evil have probably never read them.<br/><br/>Warning, some plot spoiling ahead!!! (I think someone else already spoiled it, but ok)<br/><br/>An example of polarization of good-evil: The ambitious fellow Saruman believes he can beat Sauron and thus save Middleearth if he gets hold of the one ring (and he probably could). He is not evil, he has his own way of seeing things.<br/><br/>This is reduced to him being the all evil lackey of the all evil Sauron.<br/><br/>An example of how the importance of CHANCE is ripped away:<br/><br/>Pippin (I think) by curiosity uses the palantir when it is by chance aimed at Mordor and sees Sauron who ask: ""Who are you?"" Pippin answers: ""A hobbit"" before he is interrupted by his friends. This event leads Sauron to the (erroneous) conclusion that Saruman has the ring. Why? Since it is very painful to use the palantir, none of the good guys would do it to a hobbit, ergo Saruman made him do it. Ergo, Saruman wants to show Sauron that he has the hobbit i. e. the ringbearer and the ring. Sauron thinks Saruman has the ring and acts according to that, which is the only reason he empties Mordor of troops. If the alliance has the ring an attack is possible. Aragorn is also using the palantir in a somewhat taunting way to enhance this. In doing this Sauron opened the only possibility for Frodo and Sam to reach mt. Doom without getting caught by patrols. When he realize that the ring is in Mordor, it is too late. All this due to a little hobbits curiosity, a factor Sauron didn't and couldn't take into account.<br/><br/>In the films this simply isn't. Everything is deterministic. Everything is planned and thought of, thus actually making it impossible for Sauron to lose.<br/><br/>More examples could easily be stated. However, I only considered things that are greatly contradictory to the spirit of the books, not actual plot misses which are numerous.<br/><br/>/The disappointed storyliner"

"a666333","6","6","11","15 September 2005"," a definite step down from part 1
","People often worship this part of the trilogy but it was effectively ruined by the grossly unrealistic portrayal of the battles. A bit of rudimentary research could have prevented that up but Peter Jackson, who otherwise has a great eye for detail, clearly didn't respect his material or his audience enough to do his work properly, or, he was badly advised.<br/><br/>spoilers follow<br/><br/>For example; One does not launch mass cavalry charges down steep slopes. Anyone who has ever rode on a horse would know this. Historically, people have not been so crazy as it inevitably would lead to a mass pile up at the bottom and a complete disaster. One also does not charge cavalry directly into a well formed pike formation even on flat terrain, let alone down a slope. It is suicidal and skilled, experienced soldiers would avoid such tactics as a matter of routine.<br/><br/>There were other very badly handled scenes but I won't start listing them all but they are there for anyone to see. <br/><br/>It is really disappointing to create such wonderful costumes, bring in lots of motivated extras and state of the art SGI effects and then neglect to do even the most rudimentary research on the simple physics of battles (let alone intelligent tactics). It is also disappointing that the viewing public accepts such incompetence as justifiable ""artistic license"".<br/><br/>As an analogy, think of an otherwise well produced WW2 movie that portrayed soldiers and equipment doing things that were physically impossible or downright crazy. Wouldn't that hurt any film that set itself up to be an epic?"

","The quest of the ring continues with the fellowship broken up.  Aragon, Gimil and Legolas pursue the orcs who took Merry and Pippin.  However they lose the hobbits when the orcs are attacked and killed by Eomer, nephew of King Theoden.  Merry and Pippin escape into the forest, meeting the keeper of the forest, Treebeard.  Aragon et al follow their trail into the forest to meet Gandalf the White who leads them to defend Rohan where Saruman's forces are preparing to attack and wipe out man.  Meanwhile Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, addicted to the ring and corrupted by it's power. They reluctantly allow Gollum to lead them to Mordor despite Sam's mistrust. Gandalf frees King Theoden from Saruman's spell and the King takes his people to the fortress at Helm's Deep where the armies of man and orc will collide.<br/><br/>The plot sounds plain confusing.  And looking in the film magazines at the various maps and family trees that they published I did fear that the film would be even more demanding than the first and would almost require me to start ploughing through the book's appendices to follow it.  But no, that's the first thing Jackson has done well.  He has stripped down the detail and has made the relationship easy to see and the characters easy to understand. I'm sure much of the text has been lost but it works better.  On top of this the film's pace is much more even.<br/><br/>In my review of the first film I disliked the stop/start nature of the talking/running plot and found it tiring and hard to enjoy.  Here the film manages perfectly with a good level of action and story that is consistent and builds to the battle for Helm's Deep as it's climax.  It makes for an enjoyable film rather than the pacing of the first.  Even the fragmented story line is dealt with well - it could easily have pulled the plot in 3 different ways and affected how the film hangs together but it really worked out well.  All three stories are told but none is lingered on longer than needed (with the possible exception of flashbacks of Aragon's love).<br/><br/>This made it much more enjoyable to me - that the film was fun to watch and not hard work.  Also the comedy was inserted nicely.  Again the first film felt like it would be rude to enjoy this sacred story - but here we have nice laughs that don't cheapen the story or the characters.  The action is less chaotic than before and only the odd scene is a blur.  The special effects are excellent despite looking computer generated beside real things. The riskiest effect is Gollum - he could easily have been another Jar-Jar Binks in the way he didn't work well as a real character.  However the animation is superb.  Sure he doesn't always LOOK real beside Frodo and Sam but that's cause he's not!<br/><br/>In terms of character Gollum was the best addition to the cast.  He is a real character - pathetic yet dangerous, funny yet treacherous.  After a few minutes I forgot that he was an effect and was as involved with him as with any of the others.  In fact the extent to which Serkis made Gollum watchable was shown by how held I was by his scenes with Frodo.  I found Wood to be too serious and worthy and hard to watch - Serkis' Gollum changed that and I was gripped.  The other good character is Astin's Sam who appears minor but is really the honest heart of the fellowship thus far, he is well acted and not allowed to be just a clumsy sidekick.  Pippin and Merry have minimised time which is good but their scenes are better this time round. Mortensen, Bloom and Rhys-Davis are all great and any scene they are in holds the attention effortlessly.  Mortensen is especially good and I can't understand why people prefer Bloom over him!?  Generally the acting is very good.  In the first film everything felt very tight, like the actors were afraid of upsetting anyone and read every line like it was gospel. Here they fit their characters better and seem to enjoy it which in turn helped me.<br/><br/>Overall I pretty much enjoyed the first film but had big reservations about it - having to work to enjoy it and finding the pace tiring and ill-judged. In this outing all my reservations had been dealt with.  Sure it's not perfect but it is a very, very good film.  Epic in every sense but yet enjoyable and (thank God) fun to watch.  Just like Lucas improved Star Wars with Empire, so too has Jackson done much better second time around.  Lets just pray that The Return of the King doesn't turn out to be his `Return of the Jedi' - nope! It's unlikely - I can't wait!"
"bobboman","4","5","9","18 January 2003"," Jackson vs. Tolkien 0-2
","Peter Jackson has taken one of the greatest stories ever written and turned it into mindless action. First off, the script is horrid. Where did the genius of Tolkien disappear? The dialogue is cut down and resembles one-liners. The directing is unbelievably bad with constant camera movement making character development impossible. Fast cut scenes are at all times jumping at you from the screen so you never get the time to fully absorb the story, forget about the time to think. And you're not supposed to, there are no layers (they are magically gone, thanks to the decisions of Peter Jackson), what you see is what you get. Continuity and development are sacrificed to create a pill more easily swallowed. It's like a restaurant where they feed you, and if they do it fast enough then maybe you won't notice that the food isn't cooked. This might work with traditional action (because let's face it, we like them because they give us a 90 minute vacation from our brain), but in the case of LOTR it only goes to diminish and destroy a work of art. Probably the worst thing about this movie is the music score (still it's much better than FOTR, as it's less titanic). Anyone with any understanding of music will see how shallow the composition is. It reminds me of composed music used in computer games, poorly directed and lacking depth. Also it keeps blowing what little suspense it has by frequently changing to custom fit each and every scene. Really nice touch this considering that the scenes change without logic. From the midst of the battle of Helmsdeep to Merry and Pippin in a quiet forest. Somebody please explain to Peter how suspense is built. Besides this, the music has nothing to do with ""the lord of the rings"", it doesn't capture the right atmosphere and it keeps repeating itself. It's just there and it's there all the time, every scene (another poor directing decision. It didn't give FOTR an epic feel and it failed again in TT). Wouldn't it have been nice if the music featured in the television trailer was actually in the movie?<br/><br/>In the storyline Jackson has made some unforgivable alterations. Tolkien would weep if he knew. The lord of the rings is mainly about the journey of Frodo, because if he fails then all is lost. This is also the most interesting part of the story because it is symbolic, dark and a psychological struggle. This is why two thirds of the books are about Frodo. In this second movie Jackson has devoted minimum screen time to this most important, atmospheric and perilous journey. In stead he has used countless minutes, not polishing the rest of the actual story (it often feels like it's on fast-forward and in many scenes the emphasis is on all the wrong things), but adding loads of new scenes which have nothing to do with anything. Apart from changing the story he has also changed some of the the characters (why?). Peter Jackson tries so hard to entertain us, deadly afraid that we'll get bored for even a second thus insulting our intelligence. He sets his own trap and blindly walks into it.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** The book is supposed to be dark, hope is supposed to fade and ""the two towers"" is supposed to end in the mountains of mordor with Frodo poisoned and taken captive by the orcs and Sam stuck in some dark underground maze with the ring and nowhere to go. Instead the movie ends with Sam giving an inspiring speech about those ""favorite stories where all seems lost but where you know that the good guys will win in the end"", in some idyllic forest far from mordor with a lot of light and sappy music. This sums up what injustice Jackson has done to the LOTR pretty good. **SPOILERS END**<br/><br/>But why? Because Peter Jackson isn't the greatest director in the world. And because they wanted to make money and ""the lord of the rings"" as it is today is making buckets of it. They wanted a brainless action adventure that followed mainstream traditions that even children could pay to see. They wanted to sell Aragorn rangers and Arwen barbies. This I can understand, and if it weren't so the movie would never have been made. Work and a lot of money went into creating the visuals. What I can't understand is independent critics praising it, when clearly the movie is lacking. There's more to an epic than visuals. A darker, more true and intelligent tale would make a great movie, but it wouldn't make a sure box office income. In the end, FOTR and TT aren't that bad if you just look at them as action-adventure movies (specially FOTR). And one very good thing is that more people will now read the books. But they're just not Tolkien. And don't tell me that it doesn't matter, because it does. I was disappointed with both The fellowship of the ring and [specially] The two towers, not because they're so bad, but because they could have been so much better."

","I'm not sure how this film could have gone so wrong but it did.  All the power and heart of the first film (The Fellowship of the Ring) is completely gone.  It's like Peter Jackson took a few weeks off while George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came in and took over direction for him.  These two directors can be good and even excellent at times but have the habit of pleasing the masses too much.  The great thing about The Fellowship was that it was original and not full of Hollywood clichés.  With The Two Towers Peter Jackson seemed hell bent on filling it with nothing but Hollywood clichés and wiping away the integrity of The Fellowship.<br/><br/>The only thing interesting in this film were the trees that walked and talked, but even they got a little tiresome especially since one of them had R2-D2 and C3-PO (Yes, I'm aware that's not their names.  It's sarcasm - see George Lucas reference above.) in it's branches for a majority of the film.<br/><br/>This film was a real disappointment, but I have hope that the Return of the King will be better.  A part of me hopes Return is just as bad because if it's good then when it comes time to buy the movies I'll be left without a middle.  If Return is bad then I can just buy The Fellowship and just use my imagination to fill in the rest."

","Oh, merciful heavens, what a horrid film!  I had serious problems with Fellowship, but I was able to overcome it eventually, and enjoy the movie on it's own terms.  But this...   this....!  To begin with, this should have had a disclaimer that the film was ""Inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's the Two Towers,"" so that geeks such as myself could've saved the $10.00 that I'll never see again, and preserved a fond childhood memory of spending time discovering a literary masterpiece.  I thought I had been scarred by the first film's brilliant dialogue, e.g.,""Let's hunt some Orc!""  (And many people who apparently love this film think George Lucas writes clunky lines!)  but this entire installment left me wanting to pluck out my eyes in a vain effort to cleanse myself.  Of course I see the need to condense a long novel to run within an alloted time, but that's not what happened here, they apparently felt that they could improve upon something that was already nearly perfect.  That was mistake number one.  Mistake number two was devoting a good portion of the film to Liv Tyler, for reasons unkown to me, since nowhere does her character appear in the book.  Other gripes: Turning the land of Rohan into a shanty hippie commune. Then feeling the need to show some hippie kids fleeing, in order to stir up some sympathy in the audience, is my only guess.  Suddenly finding myself in the middle wondering if the movie had stopped, and I was now watching a New Age music video (see Liv Tyler above), Enya, Enigma, something like that.  Half expecting Gandalf to turn into Max Von Sydow when King Theoden is ""possessed"" by Saruman, and begin bellowing, ""The power of Christ compels you!""  Aragorn dying, to be healed by Arwen (more Liv Tyler), and then awakened when the horsey starts kissing him.  Then there's the time that... Ugh!  I give up!  It's a shame too, because I've really liked Peter Jackson's work before this.   I just can't fathom his need to turn Tolkien's work into his own.  Sheesh, even Kubrick wasn't this bad!"

The dwarf is now just comic relief in the tradition of jar jar binks. I had to shut my eyes every time Peter thrust the camera in Aragorn's face. Golumn was horribly unrealistic.

But I'm not here to talk about what is to come, I am here to tell you about what is now...and that, my dear friends, is The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Everything that was good about Fellowship of the Ring and everything that made it one of the best films of all time is right here in The Two Towers.

Yes, the 3 hour (actually 2 hrs and 59 min) seems a bit daunting, but believe me that by the time the film is over you will be wishing for more.  You will not be bored a single minute of the film.

"billreynolds","5","6","13","13 February 2004"," too much of a ""good"" thing
","I have to say, up front, that I really liked Fellowship of the Ring a lot.  But that movie was three hours long, as is Two Towers.   Return of the King is three and a half hours.  I understand Peter Jackson considers this to be ""one"" movie broken up into three parts -- that is, one nine and a half (or eleven, with the extended ""special"" editions) hour movie.  That is simply excessive, IMHO.  Anytime a movie goes much over two hours it better be for a very, very good reason.  When you start talking about a three hour sequel to a three hour original movie, you've got problems -- I don't care how good the original was.  Maybe Godfathers 1 and 2 are the exception. But FOTR and TTT are not that good.<br/><br/>FOTR had a more captivating story line.  It was about a small band of brothers on a difficult and daring quest -- to destroy the dangerous ring of power.  TTT doesn't have as good of a story line.  There is a fundamental problem from the start.  It makes no sense that Frodo and Sam would be left to go to Mordor on their own.  Why would all three of the fellowship's best warriors -- Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli -- go off to save Pippin and Merry, and not one of them stay with Frodo and Sam?  This makes NO SENSE, and the fact that Tolkien wrote it that way is no excuse.  Isn't the destruction of the ring more important, in the scheme of things, than saving Merry and Pippin?  Why not send at least Aragorn with Frodo and Sam -- or send Aragorn alone after Merry and Pippin and send Legolas and Gimli with Frodo and Sam? What on earth were Frodo and Sam supposed to do when they got to Mordor on their own?<br/><br/>Where FOTR was a story about a quest, a mission, TTT quickly becomes a tiresome story about a ""war"" between ""good"" and ""evil.""  There are so many endless, repetitious, humorless pronouncements in this movie about the stakes of this battle that the theme gets very old very quickly.  If I had been the editor I would have excised every line by Theoden, Aragorn, Treebeard, Sam, et al. about all that nonsense, cut the movie down to two hours and made it almost pure action.<br/><br/>The forces of Saruman are presented as so relentlessly, unmitigatingly evil that they are hard to hate.  The orcs (or uruk-hai, I assume that's the same thing) are slimy creatures like Jim Cameron's Aliens.  They ride CG beasts that look like dinos from Jurassic Park.  Sauron is some weird flaming eye on top of a black tower.  The only human villain is Saruman himself, who has about two lines in the whole three-hour flick.  I don't need a lot of motivation for the villains, but I'd like to get at least some idea of why they act as they do.  Why do they fight?  Why are they so evil? What's the point?  Meanwhile, the good guys are all white, the men do all the fighting -- in fact boys of as young as ten or eleven are thrown into battle but not a single woman is.  It's just a tiresome, cliched battle of ""good"" against a straw man ""evil.""  Why are the good guys so humorlessly good while the bad guys are so insanely, relentlessly evil?<br/><br/>I was led to believe that Smeagol/Gollum was the best CG character ever, but in fact he seemed less realistic than Jar Jar Binks and no improvement over the dinos from Jurassic Park.  The only bright spot in the movie was Miranda Otto.  I felt no tension in wondering whether Aragorn will choose her or Liv Tyler -- I assume he will choose Tyler, and think he is crazy for doing so.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot one other human bad guy -- this ""Wormtongue"" fellow. How hard is it to figure out a guy named ""Wormtongue"" is up to no good? That's as bad of a name as ""Darth Sidious."""
"unimeddesign","1","8","19","26 December 2002"," A decent film, but nothing great.
","I went to this movie with an open mind, expecting to see something great, yet throughout the whole movie I was bored and uninterested. I've read Tolkien's books two times and greatly love them, but ""The Two Towers"" does not capture the beauty and sadness that is within the books. One does not want to leave the world of Middle Earth when reading the books yet I greatly appreciated seeing the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's directing was very annoying and redundant. He sets up his 180's with no sense of space, at times completely breaking the over the shoulder shots between two characters causing the breakup in the space to occur when it should not. There were too many close-ups when there should have been medium shots and too many extreme long shots when there should have been only long shots. Landscape scenes were often framed with no characters or tiny specks of characters, it should have been filmed as many of the classic westerns were filmed, capturing landscape and characters within the same frame where we could at least feel as if we're there with them and a part of their adventure.<br/><br/>Jackson does not create feeling through images in ""The Two Towers,"" he relies more on dialogue to tell the audience what is happening. The scenes with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum I would have enjoyed better had they been shown with more images and facial expressions from the actors. You can't rely on words to describe the terrible power of the ring, it has to be displayed with images. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" comes close to doing this.<br/><br/>The screenplay should have had a major rewrite staying truer to the book with more natural dialogue. Many of the lines would be spoken and fall flat. There was no projection or passion in the lines, they were too stilted. Joking in the middle of a battle should have been crossed out by the director, and the entire love story should have been deleted. Doing this would have left room for the many scenes that were left out from the book. The ending of this movie lacks in drama and suspense, I deeply wanted to feel drawn into it and expect the next and last adventure, but the only thing I wanted was to get out of the room.<br/><br/>What I greatly saw spelled over the entire movie was ""TIRED."" The actors were tired and the director was tired, and this was just another movie to crank out. With every scene saying ""OK, that's done. Let's move on,"" with no care or artistic appreciation of the true art of filmmaking. I don't expect much from ""The Return of the King"" next year and I don't expect much from Peter Jackson as he's too soft of a director to show the true grittiness of Middle Earth. He is targetting this movie more towards females and those who haven't read the books and not true Tolkien fans like myself.<br/><br/>
Overall it was a decent action film, with your typical fight choreography, one liners, Legolas and his unlimited arrows, and the good guys always coming out unscathed. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was excellent and this movie should have stayed more along the lines of that, with some improvements. On a scale of one to ten I give it a seven, because it wasn't all that bad and it wasn't all that good and at least they tried.<br/><br/>

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","5","15 December 2013"," Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is so precious, but gees, it's a hard film to get through.
","Don't get me wrong, Director Peter Jackson's Lord of the Ring's films are all well-done films, but the pacing of these films are just way too slow. Even with Two Towers being the shortest of the three films, 179 minutes is a very long time, to sit down and watch a film. By the time, you get to the end of the film, you just witness, a lot of things happen on screen, but not much, if that make sense. A lot of things could be cut down, in the editing room, even more. It's like being in the middle of a mile run. You glad you went this far, but it's not done yet, you got another half mile and you're starting to feel a bit tired. Since, this film is the middle of the trilogy, there is no beginning nor end, for that, reason, it's hard to say if the movie is great or just OK. In my opinion, The Two Towers is just alright. The Two Towers is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings. It is preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and followed by The Return of the King. It is book III: The Treason of Isengard and IV: The Journey to Mordor AKA the Journey of the Ringbearers or The Ring Goes East in the book series. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers arguably contains the most book to film major alterations, but the movie mostly follows the books, very close, mixing the two, but unlike the book starts, the movie starts a little bit later as 2001's Fellowship took the first chapter of this book opening as its ending. Instead, we get a cool new intro with Gandalf (Ian McKellen) fighting the Balrog monster from the last movie. We come into the film, after the break down of the fellowship, with smaller groups of characters going on their own adventures and story arches intercut with each other. Frodo (Elijah Woods) & Sam (Sean Astin) continuing their journey and meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the way. Gollum is the best new character, they introduce into this film. Andy Serkis is amazing actor, and he puts out the best motion CGI capture acting, I ever saw. Since, there was a decision to leave Shelob for the third movie meant that Faramir (David Wenham) had to become an obstacle for Frodo and Sam's journey. This change was indeed different than the book. It does add conflict, but gees... it slows the plot down. Frodo is the everyman character, because he lack power, he is the best one to carry the ring throughout the film. His real challenge is to bear the ring without giving in to its temptations. This resistance is Frodo's inner journey, in which his pure heart is constantly under assault by his darker yearnings for power. It had some pretty powerful symbolism here between Faramir, Frodo, Sam and Gollum. I do have a problem with Frodo & Sam's friendship. I have nothing against gays, but there is a huge different between friendship and being in love. It's obvious Tolkien wanted to show the strength of friendship, so I don't think it was intentional, but it's still hard to ignore that it comes off as a gay relationship. While this is going on, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) find themselves fighting the Orcs invasion at Helm's Deep and helping the war-torn nation of Rohan. While in the book, Helm's Deep is a small battle. In this film, it's the big climax of the film. It's one of the best battle scenes in film, I ever witnessed. I can do without the small awful cheesy things, like the heroes mowing down hundreds of Orcs without much battle scars. I can do without Legolas being too perfect like, shield surfing and only speak in exposition. I couldn't stand Gimli being pull into too much comedy relief role. Also, glad to see Arwen (Liv Tyler) was not in the battle scenes in the final version, as they film her earlier in it fighting alongside Aragorn. I can still do without Aragorn's life is now tied to the Fate of the Ring bit. It makes little to no sense. I understand that they (the producers) were trying to make anti-ring symbol with her character as a sign of hope, but it doesn't work. The movie is more about Aragon rise to become king and presented a coming to age story for males. Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) end up encountering the giant treelike Ents and trying to stop Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army at Isengard. Environment themes are question here. Still, the whole Treebeard part were a bit boring. One thing, I hate about Lord of the Rings are the cheap fake out deaths scenes. Aragorn, Frodo, and others. As much as I love seeing Gandalf again, his death scene in the last movie was supposed to be impactful. For him, to come back makes it seem like you can cheat death here. I blame it on Tolkien. I didn't like the whole Jesus Christ metaphor with his character. Besides Boromir (Sean Bean), does any main character dies in this movie. The movie lose a bit of its sense of danger without any major deaths. Everybody seems nearly invincible. Water seems to be a symbol of rebirth in this film. Gandalf, Aragorn, and Frodo were save by large bodies of water. Similarly, Saruman's tower loses its power when its plain is flooded. Like a baptized, it's free from sin. Even the elves depart Middle-earth on a boat and sail out to a great body of water. The film has a lot of Christianity themes. The music by Howard Shore is amazing. Overall: Good visual film that can be a bit confusing. Just hard to get through all the themes, and all the characters arches."

","In a trilogy, the second part is always the most difficult to create because it loses the charm of the discovery and lacks the thrill of the conclusion. The goal is to develop the characters and conclude with a solid cliffhanger that will be resolved in the last part. Thus, it's not just passing by.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this movie is this kind. It fails to reach classics as ""Star Wars V"" or ""BTTF 2"" and it's as dull as ""Star Trek 3"". Nothing really fundamental happens here: it's just another steps in the journey. Moreover, the fluidity of the first movie is lost because the characters are now split into three groups. I dozed two times watching it: in the Rohan country and during the Helm's Deep battle.<br/><br/>But the responsibility goes to Tolkien because LOTR aren't really three stories but a huge, colossal single story divided in three parts by the editor. And a night rainy battle will be always more exciting on a paper than on screen.<br/><br/>To leave on a happier note, i must say that the extra are interesting and really help to understand all the passion that people have put in this trilogy. That's why the chain-maker is so funny: With his desperate and weary voice, he explains that armors needs thousands of rings, that rings come in three models and that in a day of work, he can chains as much as a big scarf!"

","I was brimful of excitement and expectation prior to the release of The Two Towers. After thoroughly enjoying Fellowship I was told this installment would be even better as there is more action in this book than the first (I have never read the books). However I left the cinema after this film immensely disappointed.<br/><br/> I have read review after review of Two Towers with people saying this is the best film ever. Come on, I mean seriously! Two Towers is incredibly slow and if it wasn't for the climactic Helms Deep battle would be the worst excuse for a 3 hour long film since the first 2 hours of Titanic. Even during this epic battle it is interrupted by the character which personifies the slowness of the rest of the film, Treebeard. The romance, or attempted romance, between Viggo Mortenson and Liv Tyler is so erksome and pointless I wonder if it is included because Liv complained about lack of screen time. There certainly wasn't any need for her character in this film because their romance is distinctly uncaptivating.<br/><br/>
Golum is created brilliantly and deserved the Oscar for effects but I was glad to see fhis film ignored in the other categories. I won't look forward to Return Of the King as much as this now. Disappointing"

","This movie was a travesty!  Anyone who voted above a 4 for this movie ought to peel their eyes away from the TV, become literate, pick up a book (yes, the square things with pages), and READ IT!!!  Whereas ""The Fellowship of the Rings"" held almost as true to the book as it could have, ""The Two Towers"" was nothing at all like the book!!  I don't understand how Peter Jackson can consider himself a fan of the books and still put his name with this awful movie.  He has profaned everything he claims to stand for!  I feel very sorry for Tolkien and know that he is rolling over in his grave because his name is connected with this atrocity!"
"Tweekums","10","4","8","16 July 2009"," Exciting fantasy sequel
","This film starts off where ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" leaves off; Frodo and Sam are on their own and heading to Mordor with the sinister Sméagol who has promised to guide them through the mountains, Merry and Pippin are in the hands of Saruman's Orcs as they return to Isengard and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are in pursuit until they are diverted into helping King Theoden of Rohan.<br/><br/>The film switches between the three groups so we never get chance to forget what the characters are doing. I think this is the only film that I've seen where the narrative follows different groups who never meet each other. The action is even more spectacular then the previous film, the storming of Helm's Deep is one of the most spectacular scenes that I've ever seen, also amazing are the realism of Sméagol, the CGI creature based on the movements of Andy Serkis and the Ents, huge creatures that look like walking trees.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job, especially Elijah Wood as Frodo as he approached Mordor you could almost feel the increasing weight of the ring hanging from his neck. The cast of characters here is quite a lot larger than the previous film giving us some great new characters, the most obvious is Sméagol who was only glimpsed before but there is also the wonderfully vile Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, King Theoden's niece who is smitten with Aragorn.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen any of the Lord of the Rings films I strongly recommend this but only after watching The Fellowship of the Ring, if you don't watch that it will be hard to understand what happens here."
"formala44","3","4","8","21 December 2008"," More of the same
","After falling asleep watching The Fellowship I decided to give the two towers a chance.<br/><br/>It sadly is more of the same unimaginative black and white world depiction like the Fellowship. There are only 2 kinds of people, the good guys and the bad guys in the Lord of the rings movies.<br/><br/>The good guys look nice, fresh, heroic and smart. The bad guys have hideous faces, wear old clothes, are conniving and not too bright. In the two towers Frodo continues his way to Mordor to destroy the ring. This time accompanied and guided by Gollum, some CGI created creature. Again they walk an awful lot and encounter some danger which they narrowly manage to avoid. At the end of the movie though, they still haven't managed to make it so well need a 3rd movie to find out if Frodo will succeed. I have a strange feeling that he just might.<br/><br/>The 2 captured Hobbits escape and seek refuge in a walking tree. I've been told they spend 58 hours per frame to make it look real. To me it looked straight out of Sesamestreet and i had trouble not to laugh.<br/><br/>Suddenly Gandalf appears out of nowhere and wasn't killed after all in his demon battling in film number 1. Ahh, what a shame. You really cant believe anything in this movie. After some bickering in the land of horsemen we see a huge battle between the (300) good guys and the (10000) bad guys. Off course, the good guys win. How surprising. By then I finally dozed off into a deep sleep whilst knowing this is a perfect film for children aged 3 to 10. It wasn't as bad as The Fellowship but it was still waaaaaaaaaaaaay too predictable and simplistic. I didn't give it a 1 but a 3 because I did like the cinematography and the locations where nicely chosen."

The characters were boring, the dialogue unremarkable, and the plot -- well, what plot? Mostly it consisted of people running from one spot to another, badly in need of showers and shampoo. My concern isn't with what they left out, it's with what they put in! A lot of herky jerky camera shots of impossible to follow battle scenes and boring scenes with boring characters. I spent most of the movie asking my poor husband what time it was. We would've walked out, but  thought the couple we were with wanted to stay, and they thought we wanted to stay, so instead all four of us ended us wasting three hours -- a total of 12 --  and $32.!

","Best of the trilogy! I can watch this one over and over. I read the books at a young age and the two towers was the page turner for me. I feel the same about the movie. The hardest part for me to get through is the Frodo/Samewise scenes. They tend to drag on and on, however the Arogon scenes are great. A lot of emotional scenes, like when he returns to the castle. My father and I argued about the Ents in the film but I explained to him they are a vital part of the story. He never read the books so he had a hard time understanding the concept. I would recommend seeing the film. Some people may have issues but I believe Peter Jackson did a great job with the story. Many series and movies today owe him for allowing these fantastic stories to be on the big screen."

","There is no need to spend words for this movie. It belongs to the serial that has become one of the best serial, but probably best serial of all the times. Absolutely astonishing. It has won 17 Oscars,this movie just 2, but anyhow it is one of the most known movies in the world and it belongs to the most known series in the world, along with the Star Wars. Acting, picture, music, everything is perfect. Not a single thing is missing from any of this movies. Peter Jackson transfered the plot from the books perfectly, and Tolkien created something unique,and we can only thank him for his imagination. There are so many actors who became so famous because of this movies."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","3","14 September 2015"," Magnificent second part
","The Fellowship has been broken, Frodo and Sam travel towards Mordor alone, Merry and Pippin have been taken by orcs, Gandalf and Boromir have fallen and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must make haste to save at least some of their comrades. And at the same time the threat of Mordor grows as war comes to Rohan, the land of the horselords.<br/><br/>It is an epic in the every meaning of the word, and possibly one of the best second parts of a trilogy in the history of cinema. Sure, all three of the movies were shot back to back, but the fact still remains that middle parts of any kind of story are often the hardest. You have already established the setting, introduced the main characters, yet you still have to hold back until the end finale.<br/><br/>The Two Towers solves this by giving us one amazing opening battle in the War of the Rings. The Battle of Helm's Deep, still considered to be one of the greatest battles put on film, and for a good reason. It is cinema at its finest. The huge scale of it, the special effects, the practical effects, the pacing, the score, the fury and the stages.<br/><br/>But we also have other good stuff to tide us until the end of the film. The movie jumps around quite a bit, juggling various plot lines, and they all work very well. And, most importantly, this movie introduces some great new characters. Bernard Hill plays the role of Theoden, King of Rohan, and he is a very fitting counterpoint to Aragorn. He's an aged monarch, a warrior past his prime, and thus frailer, but also possessing pride in his status as a ruler. Very good performance, one of my personal favourites. But it's Gollum (Andy Serkis) that everyone always mention, and for a good reason. In many ways he's the most important character in the whole story. He's the tragedy under all the heroics, noble sacrifices and great deeds. He's the dark shadow, the weakness of mortals made flesh. Without him Frodo's struggles wouldn't mean half as much. And Serkis plays him perfectly. He's a marvel of special effects and man's ability to slip into a role. Especially considering that he's essentially two characters molded into one.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a great film on all levels. It transitions us from the origin stories of The Fellowship towards the grand battles of the Return of the King, all the while keeping the story flowing smoothly and keeping us firmly in the mood for Middle-Earth. Masterfully done, Mr. Jackson."
"hadganraend","4","2","3","14 August 2015"," The quest to destroy the One Ring continues.
","The party has split, with Frodo and Sam continuing on to Mount Doom. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are chasing the orcs that captured Merry and Pippin. Gandalf is flying around naked on a giant eagle (thankfully not shown in the movie) and Boromir's moldering corpse is floating down the Anduin River. From here, the movie follows three story lines; Frodo and Sam capturing Gollum, Aragorn and company allying with Rohan against the forces of Saruman and Merry and Pippin meeting tree-like giants in Fangorn Forest.<br/><br/>I'll be the Negative Nancy here and say this movie sucked. The acting took a nose dive, the sense of desperation that was repeatedly said to be there just didn't click and a major character was all but completely rewritten for some unfathomable reason.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood (Frodo) developed a forced, annoying accent, a bad thing when he is supposed to be carrying half the movie. Sean Astin's (Sam) demeanor shifts toward his two traveling companions were jarring and forced, making Sam seem somewhat bipolar.<br/><br/>As for the writing, there was just way too much going on with far too much attention being paid to the Battle of Helm's Deep and Frodo's encounter with Faramir, leaving Merry and Pippin's time with the Ents seem ironically hasty.<br/><br/>This movie does have good points though. The cinematography was again, beautiful and the acting from several of the cast helped to somewhat mitigate the awfulness of Wood and Astin. While there was a hell of a lot going on, it flows by quickly and is paced well, though it doesn't seem especially urgent...like everyone keeps insisting on reminding us."
"dylan-waechter","10","2","3","7 November 2014"," It was just great
","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while."

","The Lord of the Rings does not fail to impress. I loved it all. I don't have as much to say for this one as the last one, because it's a continuation of the same story, but I will try. The acting, once again, was phenomenal. The comic relief, even though it appears in the midst of serious dilemmas, is still really funny, and well done. The tension comes and goes when it is needed, and when it is necessary. The camera work is great, and the final battle scene is just super epic! You know a battle scene is good when it lasts half an hour and you don't get bored of it. I can't wait to watch the final movie of this trilogy, but I'm also shocked at the fact that it's four hours long! It's really impressive how a single trilogy can be eleven whole hours long."
"GaborAlexandru","10","2","3","12 March 2014"," great movie!
","With ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" it's clear that director Peter Jackson has tilted the balance decisively against the hobbits and in favor of the traditional action heroes of the Tolkien trilogy. The star is now clearly Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and the hobbits spend much of the movie away from the action. The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien. The task of the critic is to decide whether this shift damages the movie. It does not. ""The Two Towers"" is one of the most spectacular swashbucklers ever made, and, given current audience tastes in violence, may well be more popular than the first installment, ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" It is not faithful to the spirit of Tolkien and misplaces much of the charm and whimsy of the books, but it stands on its own as a visionary thriller. I complained in my review of the first film that the hobbits had been short-changed, but with this second film I must accept that as a given, and go on from there."
"alindsay-al","10","2","3","9 March 2014"," The second is just as good as the first
","The word epic doesn't really do justice to what the Lord Of The The Rings are but it is as close as you are going to get to perfection in film and The Two Towers are no different. The story sees The Fellowship broken and Frodo and Sam are still heading to Mordor this time with the help of the creature Gollum. While Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli searching for Merry and Pippin who are still in the possession of the Urk-Hai. The acting in the film once again is superb with Elijah Wood doing a great job as the ring becomes more of a burden to him as the film progresses and adds to the film. Viggo Mortensen really shines in this film as Aragorn as he becomes more of a leader and his character really truly shines. Ian Mckellen returns as Gandalf and for the scenes that he is in he shines as the mentor he is. Also the rest of the assembled cast were great with Orlando Bloom and John Rhys Davies chemistry really shining. But a huge mention has to go to Andy Serkis as Gollum who with his motion capture performance really changed the world of film as we know it and I think was robbed of a supporting actor Oscar nomination. There are 3 stories in the film and for the most part the Aragorn and Frodo stories are great with Merry and Pippins story dull but by the end it feels great also. So overall the stories in this film are top notch and really raise the level of stakes in the film. The script is great with a great variety or heart and comedy and the dialogue is fantastic between everybody and it looked like they were all having fun. The style of the film is breathtaking and just like the story raises the stakes especially with the Helms Deep battle that is utterly great. Overall this is one of the best sequels ever made and I absolutely love it."

","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the second installment in Peter Jackson's fabled adaptations of Tolkien's novels. Once again the costumes, scenes, sets, models, effects and epic score of Howard Shore work together to create a great atmosphere.<br/><br/>The core cast from the first film is back and once again proves adept. Several new characters appear in this film and are once again well-cast. Bernard Hill is authoritative and inspiring as King Theoden of Rohan. Miranda Otto is notable as Eowyn, though her best moments would come in the third film. Brad Dourif was a perfect choice for the conniving Grima Wormtongue. David Wenham and Karl Urban are effective as the warriors Faramir and Eomer. John Rhys-Davies, in addition to playing Gimli, is memorable for providing the voice for Treebeard.<br/><br/>Like with the first film, this film streamlines Tolkien's work but largely remains faithful to it to create a well-paced film. The conflict at Helm's Deep is spectacular and the second best fantasy battle ever filmed next to the battle in ""Return of the King"" (2003). My only complaint with this film is the alterations to Faramir's character. The ""Two Towers"" book made a clear distinction between Faramir and Boromir's personalities, but in this film they are homogenized. However, this is a minor blemish in what is otherwise an outstanding film. As with the last film, I found that the added scenes for the extended edition were interesting but didn't add much above and beyond the theatre cut."

However, in order to completely understand the plot in its entirety, it is almost necessary to view these movies in complete succession.

","It is freaking hard to make a movie out of a book,. The main problem is that the book inspires as many visions of the story as there are readers reading it. Now if one guy (in this case three) writes a script it will by all means not satisfy everybody. It can't. Remember when you read the books I mean it was your story it was your vision it was your world. Now there's someone stepping in here and telling you it's different from what you thought it was. Well of course it's not gonna work. I think Peter Jackson has created a film that reflects a book as good as possible, especially an epic story like TLOTR, which at one point can be looked at as a mythology of England. So do the Nibelungenlied or homer's Odyssey with an equal amount of success. I don't think so! It is art and not everybody is an artist. Sorry but Peter Jackson is the one and only who ever brought justification to a book."

","Following on from The Fellowship Of The Ring, JRR Tolkien's The Lord Of The Rings saga continues as hobbits Frodo and Sam, in the company of the devious Gollum, continue their quest to destroy the One Ring, Aragorn and his friends fight to protect the people of Rohan from the evil Saruman's vast army of orcs and kidnapees Merry and Pippin escape from their captors and befriend the Ents of Fangorn Forest.<br/><br/>This beautiful and breathtaking fantasy film's only flaw is that being the middle book of a trilogy it doesn't have a beginning or an end. That aside, it maintains the stunning high quality of the previous film in every aspect of production and keeps the epic story sweeping along at a magnificent pace. The performances are uniformly excellent but three actors new for this movie in particular distinguish themselves. Hill as the proud but miserably oppressed King Theoden. Dourif as the slimy Grima Wormtongue. There's a wonderful moment where he says to Lee, ""But we'd need an enormous army for that !!"", to which Lee strides to a balcony and looks down at a colossal orc army amassed outside. And in particular Serkis, who never appears on screen (Gollum is computer-generated) but performed on set, motion-captured the character's moves and provided his incredible voice. For me, Gollum is the key character in the movie and he is brilliantly realised, bursting with pathos, rancorous bile and schizophrenic nuttiness (""We hates Bagginses !! We hates them forever !!""). Howard Shore's excellent score and the outstanding effects work by Richard Taylor, Jim Rygiel and Randy Cook (the battle for Helm's Deep setpiece especially is a stunning composite of live-action and effects) serve to make this film even more spectacular than its predecessor. This is a movie with too many great scenes to mention, and tells a classic story with incredible visual splendour."
"ryan_kuhn","7","2","3","13 February 2005"," ""Stupid, fat hobbit.""
","I may be committing cinema heresy here, but I have complaints about the second Lord of the Rings film, The Two Towers. Number One: It is excessively long. I know the books that the movie is based on is really really long, and for a book, that's a good thing. When someone is reading a good book, they never want to put it down, they want to be with Frodo and Sam forever as they dodge ring raiders and enter Mordor, the home of Mt. Doom where the ring must finally end up. However, for a movie, it's tough to sit through a 3 hour plus movie, especially one that consists of nearly one hour of fighting between the good guys and the bad guys. What I personally find fascinating with the Lord of the Rings, the mythology of the ring and how the different characters are allowed to act within the rules of the Middle Earth universe, is there, but is pushed aside in favor of a dark, muddy fight. That leads to Complaint Number Two: There are too many characters for non-die hards to keep track of. Perhaps these two complaints come from the fact that my attention span is not as good as it used to be. Now the good: Gollum makes Jar-Jar Binks looks like a Simpsons' cartoon character. The combination of stop-action and CGI animation, Gollum the whithered hobbit looks totally believable and is the most interesting character in the saga, I think. What happened to him? Will the same thing happen to Frodo? These are questions I had that were spurred on by watching the Two Towers. The walking, talking trees are also a triumph in technology, something like this could not happen just a few years ago. The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the 3 Star Wars films, I think The Two Towers is the weakest of the Lord of the Rings films, so there is no definitive word on whether the middle chapter of trilogy suffers or gains compared to the surrounding chapters. It is not a bad film, again it looks great, has interesting characters, but I just wish some fat was trimmed off the film. I know die-hards would have a fit, but the length does keep some casual movie go-ers away, and there is plenty, especially in the end fight scene, to be taken away. But Peter Jackson has a houseful of Oscars, and I don't, so what do I know?"
"peace_out420","10","2","3","6 January 2005"," LOTR was not only great, but it was inspirational....
","To me, I personally think that this movie is inspirational. It shows how far someone can/has to go to achieve there goals. It shows that you have to fight for what you believe in, and make a commitment. Also, friendship is a big factor in this movie. Sam is willing to risk his life to help Frodo, and expects nothing in return. For me, that was very devoting. LOTR shows that once you start, you can't just give up. You have to work to get what you want, and you have to embrace your future. And to me that is very inspiring. It also teaches you to be happy with what you have....don't be selfish. This movie has changed my outlook on life, and I think it had changed me as a person.<br/><br/>Not to mention that pretty much everone in the movie is a total stud! That helps a little."
"chot","8","2","3","5 April 2004"," confusing but enjoyable
","I would give the film a 8.5/10 but it comes with a warning of advice.  For people that have not read the book the viewing can be a very challenging task that demands careful attention and repeated viewings.  I personally found it hard to remember the characters names, the places, and even to figure out which hobbit is which, or even which wizard is which.  I also found it hard to understand the thick ""Middle Earth"" accent.  Why does everyone's name sound the same? Sadly, I don't think that this movie can be enjoyed if you were just a casual fan who saw the first film a year ago.  In order to fully understand this film, it is necessary to watch perhaps 2 or 3 times or with the captions on, and have a ring guru nearby so you can ask lots of questions.  ""Who's that? What did he just say?""  There is simply too much going on for our ADD/ADHD society to engulf, or even me and I consider myself an intelligent college educated person. However, after working really hard, I eventually did understand and appreciate this as a spectacular film and story.  I just don't think it classifies so much as a movie - it really is in its own category.  A movie you should be able to go to without knowing anything about it, sit down and let the movie take you to its world and let you leave 2- 2.5 hours later with some token impact.  A movie should be able to give you all you need such that you can take whatever you need from it in one sitting.  The ring ""films"" don't do that with me.  That is my caution."
"perfectbond","7","2","3","12 March 2004"," Excellent sequel in the definitive fantasy film trilogy
","Even after seeing Fellowship, I still haven't read the books but after just seeing Two Towers on the beautiful extended edition DVD I am now motivated to see the end of the trilogy before it ends its theatrical run. The story progresses nicely in this the second chapter which is in my opinion the most difficult of the three to execute. Once again director Jackson impressively conveyed the scope and grandeur of Middle Earth mostly through state of the art computer animation and special effects. Speaking of that, Gollum the CGI character, while a technical marvel, became extremely annoying. That's just my individual opinion. By the way, I think Jar Jar Binks is brilliant comic relief in The Phantom Menace (I'm not prejudiced against CGI characters!) The acting from the cast was also spot on though frankly I don't think the material was that challenging (ie. no one deserved an Oscar nomination). The costumes, props, and beautiful location photography were also uniformly excellent as befits a production of this magnitude. 8/10. I should note that I haven't seen the original theatrical cut of the film so I don't know what else besides background on the Boromir (?) character was added. I look forward to the conclusion of the trilogy!"

","In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Two Towers was my favorite, but it is as good as the prequel. Peter Jackson won his major triumph again! The thing about the Two Towers is that, it makes everyone wondered what was going to happen, the fellowship was broken and the dark lord is winning over middle-earth.<br/><br/>The Two Towers explained the path of the hobbits and the king. The film follows its prequel as did the book as Frodo and Sam make their way towards Mount Doom to destroy the ring of evil. They encounter a new creature called Gollum that is bound to the ring, and claims he knows the route into Mordor. Is he a friend or foe?<br/><br/>it then shifts to Merry and Pippin who are held captive by a band of Uruk-hai. the Uruk-hair get destroyed in a battle against humans, and Merry and Pippin flee into the forest of fangorn. There they meet the most beloved character in The lord of the Rings books, treebeard, a creature that is a walking, talking tree that must gather the other trees for an inevitable battle against Saruman. <br/><br/>And lastly, there's Aragorn, and his two friends Gimili, a dwarf, and Legolas, an elf. They follow the Uruk-hai, till the damned creatures meet their miserable fate. The trio encounter a band of human riders from a country called Rohan, which tell them the direction of the uruk slaughter, which leads the trio into Fnagorn forest, where they meet an unexpected friend, and learn that the folk of Rohan are being attacked by Saruman, and must make a stand against an army of 10,000! Can these three gatherers change the fate of middle-earth in the little time they have? <br/><br/>Peter Jackson has proved himself of filming great battle sequences, unique special effects, a great storyline of an unforgettable tale, and moral lessons all people must learn. 5/5"

","When I first saw The Fellowship of the Ring, I got really disappointed. But, The two Towers is completely different. The plot of the movie is interesting and their characters are really complex. Besides, the special effects of the movie are unbelievable, specially in the battles. In my opinion, the best actor of the movie was Sir Ian McKellen, who played Gandalf the Wizard. The soundtrack of the film was also great, especially the one that is used in the Kingdom of Rohan.

","I have to say that without a doubt, this movie is my personal favorite of the 3 movies in the trilogy.  Why?  I love the tension and overall sense of gloom the actors, and more noteably, the score portray for us.  Rohan seems like it would normally be a beautiful, bright, happy place, but a dark shadow has fallen over it.  Very well done in this sense.  Sometimes, it is just dreadfully quiet as the actors deliver their lines with just a hint of music in the background.  When Eomer delivers the line....""Do not trust to hope, it has forsaken these lands."" it still gives me goose bumps.  Same with Theoden as he conveys his sense of being alone in this fight at Helm's Deep to Aragorn...""Yes, my Lord Aragorn, we ARE alone."" Awesome....<br/><br/>Some other awesome things I loved about this movie:<br/><br/>-Gimli is hilarious...him and Legolas also interact well -The Uruks are just some bad mothers...I love them and hate them -The Battle of Helm's Deep is so tense and nervy...not to mention great action -Boromir flashback by Faramir was incredible, and necessary -Gollum......enough said -PO-TA-TOES!!!  I love that scene...still cracks me up. -The Nazgul on the fell beasts are scary! -The dead marshes totally creep me out...well done -The Ents attacking Isengard was one of the coolest things to watch<br/><br/>-Even though totally fabricated...I love the warg scene -Every scene in Rohan was great, I can't say enough about the score and awesome actng by Theoden, Eomer, Aragorn, and Gandalf -LOVE the cliff hanger ending and the closing credits music -The EE adds SO MUCH to this movie...every extra scene works for me -this movie has GREAT comic relief (Eowyn's stew comes to mind, and everything out of Gimli's mouth)<br/><br/>I think I'll watch it again tonight"
"had-6","8","2","3","29 December 2003"," after the Fellowship, this was a bit of a disappointment
","This could have been as good as the first part, if Jackson had more respect for Tolkien. Those scenes of Aragorn dreaming of Arwen or utterances that may appear good in script but sound stupid on the screen (running heavy breathing Legolas speaks to himself: red sun rises, blood has been spilt this night) have pretty much harmed this otherwise good film into something that one can't watch without a very unpleasant shivering sensation down one's spine. Fortunately, there are still more good parts than those bad ones, so this is more or less a fine movie. Hope that the Return of the King ends up better."
"Leonymous","10","2","3","14 December 2003"," A staggering achievement in cinema.
","Quite simply, this is one of the most incredible pieces of cinema ever committed to film.  From the very first moment the direction and action grab you by the throat and refuse to let go until long after you've left the cinema.  The film's epic proportions and feel as well as it's intense emotion are perfectly controlled by one of the greatest director's that cinema has ever seen.  As an adaptation it's not without it's flaws, leaving many of us -who've read Tolkien's novel- with questions still unanswered, even having watched the special extended edition.  Yet, over all, the changes made and omissions from the book are used to good effect in the exciting retelling of this chapter of the classic tale.<br/><br/>
Superlative acting from a perfectly cast body of actors adds to the magic of this already classic film.  A score to die for and Jackson's sweeping direction create a world that is utterly involving and even believable. 'The Two Towers' is unparalleled in cinema history -except, of course, by it's predecessor 'The Fellowship Of The Ring'- and sets new standards in film effects and story telling.  The film is a cinematic journey of rich emotion and spectacular action which can not be praised highly enough.  Of course, it does have it's faults in storytelling and even the odd CGI shot, but these pale in comparison to the depth and magnitude of the overall picture.<br/><br/>Unlike some recent film successes, 'The Two Towers' rightly deserves it's place among any list or collection of cinema's greatest films.   Only the most threatened critic or hardened cynic could fail to be moved by this stunning movie creation.  Sheer brilliance."

"nankipoo","10","2","3","29 August 2003"," Great on several levels
","""The Two Towers"" is every bit as engrossing and well-developed as its predecessor, plus I believe its new characters (those not introduced in ""Fellowship"") are some of the most intriguing ever conceived and put on film. You have Gollum, King Theoden, Eowen, Faramir, Grima, Treebeard and many others. Peter Jackson chose the absolute best actors for his trilogy, I'll give no ground on that point. One might argue about Gollum and Treebeard's categorization as ""actors"", but I say that whether they're CG or human, someone had to write the script and imagine the expressions. The existing characters are developed even more deeply in TT. Sam's humanity, Frodo's compassion, Aragorn's evolving kingship, Arwen's deep love, Gandalf's new transcendent presence, all add richly to the middle chapter of the trilogy. For epic ""sweep"", you'll have to go far to match TT. The scenes at Helm's Deep, with all of the defenders bunkered in as the numberless forces of Sauron converge on them, is the very picture of desperation, and Jackson masterfully gives us both breadth and detail. Gollum's split-personality conflicts as ""Smeagol/Gollum"" are nothing short of perfect, and unlike mainstream movies, we aren't spoonfed the reasoning behind his condition, we just get to puzzle it out for ourselves, like intelligent humans! What a relief. Howard Shore's score is again one I'd buy for myself.<br/><br/>I think that the main criticism of TT on this board is that the movie is dull, or that it relies too heavily on special effects. On the ""dullness"" comment, I'd say that what's one viewer's ""dullness"" is another's character development, dialogue, and foreshadowing. It's called ""filmmaking"", along the lines of Kubrick and the Merchant/Ivory team. On the special effects comments, I'd counter that if special effects add to the plot and don't distract, then I'm perfectly OK with them. Now, I wouldn't be drawn to a film totally comprised of special effects, but TT is nothing like that. It's employment of them is only for the sake of plot and believeability. Would you want some guy playing Gollum, heavily made up, and totally false? No thanks. I bought the general release DVD yesterday, instead of waiting for the extended version, which I will purchase also. I only hope that TT's extended version is as fantastic as Fellowship's turned out to be."

"jaesboxer","10","2","3","24 May 2003"," A true masterpiece, despite what Tolkien purists may say
","Reading over some of the IMDb comments on this film, I am truly appalled by the number of people who rant and whine about the films deviations from the book.  Film and literature are two different mediums, not to be confused, and very rarely are they entirely compatible.  Tolkien's book, while brilliant, is not the 'perfect series' as I have heard it proclaimed, and cannot be expected, even by the most adamant of fans to be portrayed to utter perfection in the movie.  Jackson's film is an utter masterpiece, giving the audience what they want, entertainment, emotion and raw pure spectacle.  Almost all of the most brilliant films of all time are not entirely faithful to the book, including 'The Godfather', in which rather large sections were left out, 'Gone With The Wind', 'The Silence Of The Lambs', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'A Clockwork Orange', 'The Bridge On The River Kwai', 'Apocalypse Now', 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest', 'Amadeus', 'Raging Bull' and 2001.  And yes, I have read all these books so don't doubt me when I say it.  Literary structure is different from the structure of movies.  And any good screenwriter will tell you more often than not it is necessary to take liberties with a book in order to create the aesthetic of a good movie.  So the ending was changed. It will be in the next one.  So Arwen's appearance was an invention of Jackson's.  It created a bridge in her character between the first and third films.  Okay, I can understand the argument about Gimli being made into comic relief, that annoyed me too, but it did not mar my impression of the film in any way.  In no way do the legitimate complaints of people annoy me, but when I hear such comments as 'Like Merry And Pippin would ever let Frodo go to the boats, he should have snuck to them through the shadowland like in the books', I get really bothered.  Menial arguments such as this are the product of disgruntled Tolkien purists, many of whom I feel would not be satisfied even if the book followed the writer's vision perfectly.  The smallest flaws are made into an ignominious nuisance by those who, even if those flaws were not there, would still complain about something else.  I myself have read 'The Lord Of The Rings' about 6 or 7 times, and I agree it is a great book.  Yet no book is so perfect that it should not be changed in any way.  And I apologize to any Tolkien fans I am offending, but speaking from the view point of a huge literary afficionado I must say that 'The Lord Of The Rings' is not the greatest book ever written, nor is Tolkien the greatest writer.  His mammoth fantasy epic is by no means the standard for literary style, nor for characterization or meaning.  I shake my head when I hear 'The Lord Of The Rings' referred to as the quintessential novel. Despite being the greatest masterpieceo of fantasy ever written, it still does not measure up to Joyce's 'Ulysses', Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov', or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'.  I love Dostoyevsky, yet if a movie were made of 'The Brothers Karamazov', and 'The Grand Inquisitor', perhaps one of the most incredible sections in all literature were removed, I would not damn the director, and insult the film, for I realize the scene, though essential to the writer's purpose, is not essential to the story the film is trying to portray.  If I may parody a line from 'Inherit The Wind', The Lord Of The Rings is a great book, but it is not the only book, and its brilliance as a film may not match its brilliance as a book (though in my opinion it does) but it cannot be insulted merely because it deviates from its source."
"stensson","4","2","3","3 January 2003"," Can we have some humour please
","Well, here we go again with the second part. Hopefully the creators make as much money as they have expected, because that's what it's all about here.<br/><br/>Most figures in computer games act better than the people in this film. The effects are also to be found in computer games and even better made there. There are in fact a little more humour in this part (in the first one there was almost none of it) and that comes from John Rhys-Davies who tries to make something artistic of his dwarf behind the beard.<br/><br/>We don't see that much of the four boys or what they are supposed to be. This is far from Tolkien's intentions and one wonders indeed why grown-up people are that interested. If you are 11 years old or younger you might be entertained, but most people aren't."
"MikeG-1221","5","2","3","21 December 2002"," I feel like I'm missing something here...
","SPOILERS COMIN' UP! BE YE WARNED!<br/><br/>I agree with everyone here who says that the book and movie are separate entities. It is unfair to expect the same exact plot regurgitated onscreen. That's not what a movie should do. But...<br/><br/>The Two Towers is visually stunning and scored wonderfully. If nothing else, Peter Jackson is a near-perfect director from a technical standpoint. His shots of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli running and then riding across Middle Earth are beautiful and awe-inspiring. The battle at Helms Deep is also a tremendous accomplishment in terms of the reality of a medieval battle as one might imagine it.<br/><br/>Jackson also does make the three plots from the book work in the movie. Abandoning Frodo and Sam for the first half of the movie would have failed miserably. He does a very good job of mixing up the three stories enough so that you're not wondering what the heck happened to any set of characters (a suspense tactic that works well in the book that wouldn't work in the movie).<br/><br/>However, there are problems that keep this movie far from epic status. The two glaring holes in ""The Two Towers"" are a) a lack of explanation of what certain characters or places are and b) little or no characterization (character traits or actions that wouldn't make sense unless you read the book).<br/><br/>The transition from ""Fellowship"" to ""Towers"" is great...but then it gets a little disjointed. There's no explanation of what Rohan is, and what it has to do with the destruction of the Ring. As the movie goes on, the plot diverges so far away from the Ring that it almost becomes forgotten, except for the obligatory scenes where Frodo gets moody or angry or violent. By the end of the movie, the story has moved so far away from the significance of the ring, and so near the ""battle for Middle Earth"" that it's almost a mystery what these people are fighting for.<br/><br/>But my biggest problem with both movies is the lack of characterization, for the most part. What little characterization there was in the first movie is almost completely lost here. Frodo's character - probably the strongest in Fellowship - disappears here, with Jackson giving Elijah Wood little to do but stare with those big blue eyes into the camera and go through mood swings. Gimli becomes an even bigger joke, Aragorn is a mystery (why is he such a leader? Never truly explained.) and everyone is swept away by events without ever really participating in them. This would be fine if the events were built up to, but they never really are. Things just happen in Jackson's version of ""Rings,"" and the reasons are seldom satisfactory.<br/><br/>One of the greatest scenes in the Star Wars Trilogy (and perhaps one of the greatest movie scenes of all time) is when Luke Skywalker decides to leave Dagobah to save his friends from Darth Vader. He's torn by the decision, but he knows that he has to be true to who he is. It's a human decision made in a supernatural world. At that moment, we feel for him, and admire and care for him because we probably would've done the same thing if placed in his position.<br/><br/>Tolkien also had his characters make these kinds of decisions. In ""Fellowship"" the book, the Fellowship decides to go through the mines of Moria by vote, whereas in the movie they have no choice. This lack of choice is even starker in ""Towers"". Saruman influences Theoden's character in the book, but Theoden falls under the wizard's spell in part because he is willing to do so, not because he's literally possessed. In the book, Aragorn gives up the search for Merry and Pippen because he decides that it is more important to help Rohan, even though the decision tears him apart. In the movie, Peter Jackson takes these decisions away from the characters and, by doing so, nullifies what makes them seem real. Without this strength of character, ""The Two Towers"" becomes a movie where fate overwhelms the human strength that makes characters - and movies - worth remembering.<br/><br/>And the dialogue - what little there is - is slightly below average, at best. Theoden, in particular, has two clunky speeches, and the one about ""the father outliving the son"" was extremely cringeworthy.<br/><br/>
""The Two Towers"" falls short of epic by a long shot. It definitely doesn't belong in the Best Picture/Greatest Film of all Time realms either. Bascially, this is a nice looking film that has its moments, but fails to cohesively bring them together. It's clear that Peter Jackson has a love of these books, but the screenwriters' working on this film don't have the ability to pull it all together. It's as if the expectation is, ""well, you've seen enough of these types of movies by now to know that Aragorn is the strong hero, and Saruman the bad guy, and Frodo the classic underdog."" Apparently, the majority of comments on this movie put me in the microscopic minority, but I just don't get why everyone is drooling over this film. I'm not sure if it's because of a love of the books and seeing the characters come to life or a feeling that, ""well, now our generation has our Star Wars Trilogy."" I give this movie a 5/10, and hope that if Oscar feels the need to give a nom to a mainstream movie, that they give one to ""Minority Report"" or ""The Road to Perdition"" - two films with better performances, better characters and superior stories."
"paulo20","1","8","21","22 December 2002"," Needless ommissions and inclusions spoil an otherwise highly entertaining film (contains spoilers)
","Two Towers would have been a very good picture, if not a great one, if not for a few needless ommissions and intrusions.  <br/><br/>The Arwen sequence was included for no other reason than to give the highly overrated Liv Tyler screen time.  There just doesn't seem to be enough of a reason to beef up her role. Yeah, sure, the reason commonly given is that it's supposed to give the female viewers something to watch, but it's not like the gals are bored with everything else that's going on.  I'm not saying the romantic angle should go unplayed, just that it should be lavished with such loving detail.<br/><br/>Aragorn's fake death was played for dramatic purposes, as if there wasn't enough drama in the story to go around and if there hasn't been enough fake deaths in the first film.  <br/><br/>Both of these sequences/occurrences squandered screen time that could have been used to include the Huorns (basically the reason the Ents were called Treeherders) and Shelob, the giant spider.  The Huorns are instrumental in routing the Orcs at Helm's Deep; they are an important element in the story. In the film, the defeat of the Orcs wasn't terribly convincing since there were still hordes of them.  There didn't seem enough of a reason for them to just turn and flee.  A burst of sunlight wouldn't seem to be enough, especially since these Orcs were the Uruk-hai, specially bred to move about in sunlight.  In the book, the Orcs were crushed between Gandalf's contigent and the Huorns, which make a lot more sense and would have made a much better movie.  There was plenty of time to establish the Huorns if not for unnecessary dream sequences.<br/><br/>Shelob, the spider, was also ommitted for no clearly good reason. Presumably, Shelob will be featured in the the third movie (won't there be enough to take care of in the third movie?).  In the book, Frodo seems to be mortally wounded by her and goes into a sort of coma, yet one more time the fake character death card will have to be played (making Aragorn's fake death seem all the more excessive) but at least with Shelob and Frodo, it's warranted and would have made an astounding finish to the film, as it did the second book of Lord of the Rings.  (It probably inspired the less-than-happy ending in The Empire Strikes Back and look how good a film that was).  It also would have given Samwise (and thus, the Hobbits, who have thus far been little other than ""the little people) his moment to shine, as he takes on and defeats Shelob.  I disagree there wasn't enough time.  For one, as I said before, I don't think the time was spent wisely in telling the story; for another, an extra half an hour to 45 minutes would have been sufficient.  Judging from audience reaction to the film, very few would have minded an extended film.  Oh well, it will have to wait till the third film.  But imagine the anticipation for Return of the King that would have been created if Shelob was included in Towers.  Instead, it will just be something that happens in the third film that's quickly resolved (it will have to, I imagine, if the rest of the story is to be told with any sort of efficiency).<br/><br/>Also, the whole Faramir plot was a total, total, hack job that I don't even have the heart to comment on right now.  Overall, a severe disappointment. The major bright spot was the performance of Andy Serkis/Gollum, truly an astonishing development in the world of CGI; he makes the severe disappointments of this film almost bearable."

His friend picked up the Supreme Lord of the Rings while fishing. He killed his friend in order to snatch the Lord of the Rings, and he may have been bewitched by the Lord of the Rings from the beginning. In the next 500 years, he was continuously poisoned by the Lord of the Rings. Half of the soul had its own original shadow, and half of it was completely dark thinking. He was controlled by the Lord of the Rings and severely tortured by Sauron to reveal the whereabouts of the Lord of the Rings, making Shire and Baggins dangerous. He took Frodo, who had the Lord of the Rings, as his master, and when he was unable to snatch, he would guide them to the magic capital. On the way, he provoked Frodo and Sam's relationship, and introduced Frodo into the spider hole, in danger. When Frodo planned to destroy the Supreme Lord of the Rings, he stepped forward and snatched it. Finally, with the heart of the heart, the Lord of the Rings merged into the magma.<br/><br/>This is a very unique character. By portraying such an image and deeds that have been in close contact with the Supreme Ring for 500 years, people can feel the horror influence of the ring. Make a good footnote for the main line of destruction of the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>The film is rich in imagination, tree spirits, monsters of various races, elf queen, king, princess, dwarf kingdom, dragon.<br/><br/>Very good movie."

Because no matter how great the opening or closing part may be, if this vital act isn't handled well, the overall experience of the entire story will unfortunately amount to nothing. And that's true for whether you are writing a book or a play or a movie.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga. And because, just like the novel, The Lord of the Rings is meant to be viewed as a single film edited into three parts of which The Two Towers is the second part, there is no definite beginning or ending to this film. Plus, what's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike the first film, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple storylines & has to make each one work efficiently in order to accomplish its goal. Nevertheless, the great news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel's story as faithfully as The Fellowship of the Ring did, it still succeeds as one rare sequel that improves upon the original and, just like its predecessor, is one of the greatest films of its genre.<br/><br/>Picking up right from where The Fellowship of the Ring signed off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three storylines. The first plot line concerns Frodo & Sam, who are continuing their journey to Mordor to destroy the One Ring but soon their peril deepens as there is another who hunts the ring. The second plot line deals with Merry & Pippin, who were captured by Uruk-Hai in the last film but manage to escape, meet Treebeard the Ent & help to plan an attack on Isengard, where Saruman is breeding a massive army. The third plot line covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, while pursuing the flock of Uruk-Hai that took Merry & Pippin hostage, meet an unexpected ally and then make their way to Rohan where Saruman has King Theoden under his spell while an impending war looms upon those free lands. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad-dûr, fortress of the Dark Lord Sauron & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.<br/><br/>The direction by Peter Jackson doesn't lose any of its potency for this sequel as The Two Towers manages to live up to all hype & expectations, which was even more this time considering the massive critical & financial success of the first film. And not only it delivers everything it promised but also shows major improvements in almost all filmmaking departments. The three story lines are extremely well written & narrated and enough time is given to develop every single one of its new characters, without interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast. Also, the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers and the decision to conclude this film at a different event from the novel makes sense for it sets a perfect stage for the finale. Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but Peter Jackson has done it again & what's even more admirable is that he gave equal importance & value to all three storylines.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress as the miniatures used to represent Rohan, Helm's Deep & Osgiliath are meticulously detailed down to the smallest of things, thus making art direction & set decoration a winning aspect, once again. Still, what makes these sets look even more appealing is their ideal fusion with the beautifully photographed landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography immerses the viewers into Middle-Earth just like its predecessor, and the camerawork is at its absolute best when it comes to the film's action sequences. Make-up & Costume Design stay true to the timeline it depicts. Sound feels more authentic this time & is spot-on where it matters most. Editing trims the film down to 179 minutes & although it's very effective in that 3 hours of runtime, I recommend the extended version instead as it adds 45 minutes of new & extended scenes and further develops the film's characters, adds greater depth to its plot & enriches the overall experience of The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Weta Digital made history with The Fellowship of the Ring when it brought alive Middle-Earth in breathtaking detail but the enhancements it brings in the visual effects of The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely computer-generated & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Another scene where visuals really shine, but doesn't get as much credit as it deserves, is the Flooding of Isengard sequence, which undeniably is one hell of an eye-opener you don't see in cinema very often. Finally, the background score by Howard Shore introduces new tracks for Rohan, Gollum & many more sequences while the music heard in the first chapter further develops & expands into new realms. Splendid where it is meant to be, touching where it needs to be & magnificently pleasing to the viewers' senses, the soundtrack of The Two Towers is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor and continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, The Two Towers doesn't disappoint in this aspect & adds even more strength to its ensemble cast. The new cast is no let down but another right step in the right direction while the reprising cast continues to evolve with their respective characters. Everyone from Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin to Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli has a stronger sense of their characters in comparison to the last film. However, Ian McKellen, who plays Gandalf, gets a fresh makeover in this film & has a new dimension to explore. Amongst the new cast, making their presence felt are Bernard Hill as Théoden; King of Rohan, Miranda Otto as Éowyn; Théoden's niece, David Wenham as Faramir; Boromir's younger brother, Brad Dourif as Gríma Wormtongue; Saruman's agent at Rohan, Karl Urban as Éomer; Théoden's nephew & John Rhys-Davies as voice of the Treebeard; Leader of the Ents. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum / Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & show-stealing performance that it's impossible to not love as well as pity this wretched character. Easily the finest performance of the saga, so far.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson & his crew, in spite of deviating greatly from the film's source material, not only succeed in making the middle part of The Lord of the Rings a smooth continuation of The Fellowship of the Ring but also a worthy expansion & evolution of Middle-Earth. The artistic license taken by Jackson, Walsh & Boyens does alter the overall tone & style of the film but they still manage to keep everything very much within the realms of Tolkien's world & true to its spirits. Also, if one envisions this second chapter as an adaptation of the middle act of Tolkien's complete novel rather than conceiving it as an adaptation of only the second volume, then the writers' decisions start to make much more sense. And honestly, apart from few purists, most won't even mind this tweaking because, in spite of all the modifications, The Two Towers makes up for another successful, spellbinding & engrossing epic that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering masterpiece. On an overall scale, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is another landmark film of its genre that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor, breaks many filmmaking barriers of its genre with its revolutionary production and signs off as an extremely satisfying sequel which sets an even higher benchmark for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium."

","This is my favourite set of movies, return of the king (3rd lord of the rings movie) being my absolute favourite movie I've ever seen. The CGI and special effects are brilliant for something of this time, the cast couldn't have been better. Elijah Wood was absolutely superb, along with Sean Astin, Ian Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, John Rhys Davis and Dominic Monaghan. They were all absolutely excellent, start to finish. They are like the books in so many ways and really managed to take the books and put it onto a screen in such a wonderful way. The storyline was very strong and advanced. The way the turned Andy Circus into Gollum was epic for something that came out at that time. It, by far, had the best battle scene in the whole franchise and better than the majority of films I've seen. Those who've seen the film will know which battle I'm talking about but I don't want to give spoilers. I've lost count of how many times I've seen these films. The dialogue was awesome and there wasn't a scene where I spotted a huge mistake that ruined the film. I think there was the odd CGI error but it wasn't major. The make up was extremely believable, especially the orcs and the hobbits' feet. The whole world was just so great. Overall, this was my least favourite out of the three but it is very close. Peter Jackson did a great job and I have no idea how many times I've rewatched these films! I hope the Amazon Series is going to be really good but I don't think it's even remotely possible to live up to these standards."

","This was too an excellent part though a little short that the 1st part. This shows the dark forces gathering while the good are attempting to defeat the army of Saruman in their own ways all realizing that it's not in their individual capacity to do so. The crucial task of the Ent army added colours and adventure to the story. The return of Gandalf as the White Witch was interesting (none could be thought without him). The differing roles of the four hobbits and cunning games played by Gollum are worthy of mentioning. 
Also the entry of Gandalf at the crucial moment in the war of Helm's deep and the Ent destroying the setup of Saruman and Sauron are main events of the movie. Overall this ends on the disturbed sides wherein all the forces are not united while the Orcs are preparing for the big war."

"grantbullert","10","1","1","3 May 2018"," A Magnificent Achievement
","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" refuses to be overshadowed by its groundbreaking predecessor. It achieved the near impossible. Jackson's trilogy shows no signs of slowing down in the epic second installment.<br/><br/>-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Story/Directing: As the Fellowship heads in different directions, one would assume that things will start to get messy. Not so, the story stays well structured and strong. We delve deeper into the emotions of the characters, and we are introduced to more characters as well. All of which add to the plot and bring their own power to this legendary tale. Jackson meets the challenge head on and proves he is no fluke success story. He has an absolute command of the story, and brings us on a journey unlike any other. A true visionary, he brings to the screen what many thought was not possible. *Cinematography/Editing: Once again, Andrew Lesnie helps bring Middle-earth to life in an absolutely stunning manner. His movement of the camera and realistic lighting draws us into the action. The color palette is beautifully washed out, adding to the tone of hopelessness that our Fellowship faces. One could pause on almost any frame, and it would appear to be iconic. Few cinematographers have managed to achieve what Lesnie has mastered. The film editing is superb. The film moves effortlessly from story line to story line. The Helm's Deep sequences are some of the greatest battle scenes ever to be brought to screen, thanks to some of the best pacing of all time. *Dialogue/Acting: From epic monologues to intimate conversations, the dialogue is gripping in every scene. The story is propelled forward, and tension is heightened with each scene. So many characters are given so much power due to their commanding words they issue forth. The performances from all actors create such realism that it is easy to get lost in the world of Middle-earth and to think that these events are an actual part of history. Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, and others continue their strong roles in the series. Newcomers David Wenham, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and more make fantastic additions to this legendary story. *Music/Sound: Once again, Howard Shore's work on the soundtrack makes it easy to get lost in Middle-earth. The music feels as if it came directly out of Tolkien's world. The addition of Rohan's theme is unforgettable. The sound design is a marvel once again. Never before has a battle on such a massive scale as that of Helm's Deep felt so real. We are again treated to original sounds created specifically for the world of Middle-earth. Most memorable are that of the Ent voices, Wargs, and Fell Beasts, as well as the return of the Nazgúl scream. *Production Design/Special Effects: The costume design and new set pieces match the prowess of those in ""Fellowship."" Helm's Deep, Fangorn, and Edoras are a marvel to behold. The costumes of the Rohirrim, Lothlórien Elves, and Uruk-hai are outstanding. Each has its own personal flair that gives itself an easily identifiable style. The make-up and hair-styling is also a major achievement. The visual effects are way ahead of its time. Never before has there been such a large and authentic looking army. The Ents are a technical masterpiece. The mixture of CGI and miniatures has never been used so effectively. *Conclusion: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is simply too massive to properly analyze every aspect of it. What can be said, however, is that it is both a technical and narrative masterpiece, and one of the finest films ever made."
"zkonedog","9","1","1","10 March 2017"," Even Better Than The Book (Because Of The Battles)
","I have read the LOTR trilogy on a couple of different occasions. Each time, I struggled to get through ""The Two Towers"". Was it because it is a bad book? Certainly not. However, Tolkien's tales of Middle Earth battles are better ""seen than imagined"", so to speak, and that is where Peter Jackson comes in.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Two Towers"" is split into three separate narratives:<br/><br/>-Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest for the fires of Mordor. As they approach the black city, they are formerly introduced to Gollum (or is it Smeagle?!), the former owner of the Ring who has as many different motives in his mixed-up brain as one can imagine.<br/><br/>-As Sauron and Saruman (Christopher Lee) unleash their armies onto the land of Middle Earth, the fellowship of Gandalf (Ian McKellen), now White instead of Grey, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must begin their stand in Rohan with the Battle of Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>-Finally, wayward hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have quite an eventful film, eventually meeting up with the Ents (giant tree-people) and leading a motion to storm Saruman's fortress at Isengard.<br/><br/>Whereas ""Fellowship"" was all about adventure and laying the groundwork of an incredible story, ""Towers"" takes a bit of a different tact but still manages to enthrall viewers for the full three hour run-time. While the battles fought in Tolkien's Middle Earth are indeed epic even in the novel, there is just something about seeing the seething Orcs & steadfast resistance that makes it all the more incredible. Though it has been nearly ten years since the film was released in theaters, very few (if any) movies since have created better battle-action scenes.<br/><br/>Almost worth the price of admission alone, however, is the character of Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis). When Tolkien first created the character in his book ""The Hobbit"", he painted a very horrifying picture of the sort of abominable creature Gollum must be. View computer animation and incredible voice acting, this film perfectly captures that creepiness and provides perhaps the best moments of the entire movie. Gollum is even given a sort of sympathetic turn, as only Frodo can understand how corrupting the power of ""The Precious"" can be.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Two Towers"" is not a letdown whatsoever from the first installment. The quest to destroy the One Ring continues to take new twists/turns, while viewers are also given an inside glimpse into what all the fighting is truly for...to save the great land of Middle Earth and all its inhabitants/creatures. There are very few films that can sustain my interest for a full three hours with no waning, but this is certainly one of them."
"abrafocus","10","1","1","27 February 2006"," Second movie of Great Trliogy!
","I love this movie! It's even better than the first one. I actually saw this for th first time just weeks after I saw the first movie for the first time.<br/><br/>This has so many graphics and special effects, it's hard to know where to begin.<br/><br/>**Minor spoiler ahead.** <br/><br/>I like the part when you see a flashback, to when before Boromir was killed. You see that Boromir and Faramir were the best of friends, and their father, who wasn't very nice to Faramir, seemed to only love Boromir. After Boromir is killed, Dethomir blames Faramir. But Faramir only does what he feels is right. (Except for the time where he took Frodo and Sam to Gondor.) Not only is this a terrific movie, but it could not have been better. It may be too long for some people, but it it not too long to me.<br/><br/>I think it is amazing that the two actors who played Boromir and Faramir have a certain resemblance.<br/><br/>It is only 3 hours and 43 minutes long, and there's at least a half hour alone on the credits.<br/><br/>If you like the first movie, you won't be disappointed in this movie.<br/><br/>My Score: 10/10."

","Well Lord of the Rings Trilogy is the best movies ever. Lord of the Rings the Two Towers is amazing, with the Ents and the battle of the Ents. The flooding of Isengard. It's amazing stuff to see, honestly. Special affects are so well done. The extended one is obviously better. Fangorn Forest is real beautiful place,so old n mysterious looking, I mean it. The braking of the Fellowshiphas happened, separated in three parts; Frodo and Sam on the road to Mordor, Merry and Pippin captured by the Orcs and Urak-Kais,Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on the pursuit to get Merry and Pippin back. A good thing that Gandalf is back, he's a real help to the Fellowship. Also the kingdom of Rohan is so beautiful, very viking looking.Honestly Fangorn Forest is the best part of the movie. It's just so funny and emotional. Treebeard is so amazing, he just so slow moving, and he takes his time to do everything. It's quite awesome. The parts are also very well played(the hobbits are the best). It's amazing, anybody who has not seen it should watch it. PETER JACKSON IS THE BEST DIRECTOR EVER!!!!!"

","Although the expedition was in parts, the march was not over. Kind Frodo accepted bad Gollum without hearing the opinion of Sam. In fact without Sam, the task could not be finished. From the ending part of the first film, we could see Sam was realizing his promise.<br/><br/>The ring began torturing Frodo. His flesh and soul suffered double strike. But he still persisted in it. That was the hardest moment for Frodo in the journey. Insisting is just the victory. So does it in reality.<br/><br/>Although Saruman and Sauron were defeated, the dark lord Sauron still had the ability to reorganize the dark army and attack the mankind again. The peace for Middle-earth had not come yet.<br/><br/>The hardship in the journey deepened the friendship between Frodo and Sam, Merry and Pippin. They endured the test, though the victory had not come yet. A friend in need is a friend indeed.<br/><br/>As the second film of TLOTR trilogy, it is necessary and satisfying. 9/10"
"a2jcforever","Null","1","1","24 May 2005"," The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers
","As the penultimate film representation of J.R.R. Tolkien's book series ""The Lord of the Rings,"" ""The Two Towers"" was a blockbuster hit in theaters worldwide. Besides the fact that it was the film that would tie ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to ""The Return of the King, ""The Two Towers"" closely and effectively portrayed the text of Tolkien's book ""The Two Towers"" which helped to rake in a large audience - particularly those who knew Tolkien and his story of the Ring from his books. In terms of the film, Peter Jackson's excellent directing as well as the award-winning performances delivered by the star-studded cast allowed for the attraction of millions of viewers. Also, ""The Two Towers'"" epic battle scenes and constant sequences of action contributed to the film's overall attractiveness. Perhaps one very important characteristic of the film to note, however, is its special effects. Through the use of special effects, Jackson generated a film that stimulated the imagination of the audience, especially those who had read the book series, and brought them into a place where they could easily imagine themselves in Middle Earth, watching Frodo's quest omnisciently. The quality of the film combined with its accurate representation of Tolkien's book series both contribute to the epic nature of ""The Two Towers"" and also leave fans with an incredible story to remember."
"tomimt","10","1","1","22 May 2005"," The middle
","The Two Towers continues almost straight from where Fellowship ended: the companions are scattered, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are going towards Mordor, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) are hunting down the orcs who captured Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).<br/><br/>I was amazed by the special effects of the Fellowship and was in false impression, that there wouldn't be anything as stunning in The Two Towers. I was gravely mistaken. In the first moments of the film we are shown, because introduced would be wrong word, as we did see a glimpse of him in The Fellowship, Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, a fully computer generated character, who is as believable as the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Small skirmishes of the Fellowship turn into a full scale siege war in The Two Towers, when orc army of Saruman attacks towards Rohan, a land of brave horseback warriors, led by king Theoden (Bernard Hill), who is mislead by his councillor Wormtongue (chilling Brad Dourif), while his niece Eowyn (Miranda Otto) tries her best to make her uncle to see the truth.<br/><br/>Theatrical version of The Two Towers always felt a bit fast for my taste, everything happened too quickly and there was always something missing. All this was fixed beautifully in the Extended Edition and fast pacing of the film was toned down, which in my opinion led in more enjoyable experience. I personally enjoyed all of the extended and added Ent sequences. Also EE introduces us one new character, Denethor (John Noble), father of Faramir (David Fenham) and Boromir (Sean Bean).<br/><br/>The battle of Helms Deep is dominating part of the movie, as it was in the books. Fall of Isengard, home of Saruman, is shown as Tolkien described it in the book: fast and neat.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson and his companions have taken more liberties with some aspects of the story, adding in scenes, attack of the Warg riders, that weren't in the book, or adding new aspects, like Elves coming to help defend Helms Deep. Some of these scenes were good, some of them weren't very original, but over all they none of them were extremely disappointing either.<br/><br/>Overall the experience leaves you hungry for more, as there is no real ending in the film, which was rather bold move. It all just shows, that The Two towers is just a middle part of a longer story."
"jmcleod_5","10","1","1","12 May 2005"," Almost equal to the first.
","I enjoyed The Two Towers almost as much as Fellowship. I liked the Helm's Deep battle and still think it is better than any of the battles in Return of the King. However as with most epic movies I find the little moments are the ones that define it as great. A tree with it's leaves on fire rushing towards an oncoming torrent of water to put it out. The obvious happiness of Smeagol as he finally rids himself of Gollum. Even Frodo's gradual slide into darkness as he spits venom every now and then at Sam. These are what make up a great story and that's what made Fellowship so great. The Two Towers are full of these as is the whole trilogy. The only disappointment in this film is the Warg attack. Very shoddy effects in an otherwise flawless movie. <br/><br/>Very well done on all accounts.( Apart from the Warg attack.)"
"cragsby_kellogs","10","1","1","7 May 2005"," Awesome sequel!
","In my view the two towers will go down as my second favourite film of all time behind (obviously) LOTR: Return of the King. The film proved to be a much better film than the fellowship of the ring mainly because of two things. Helm's Deep and Gollum.<br/><br/>Helm's Deep proved to be the most exciting siege film since The Alamo. 10,000 urik-hai against a small guard of farmers, old men and stable boys proved to be like David against three Goliaths. At the end of the battle mass audiences were stunned to witness a battle sequence as stunning as Braveheart in the part where Gandalf rides down the steep mountain with the Rohirrum as they attack the Urik-Hai to win the battle.<br/><br/>This film had a bit of funny moments such as Gimli telling Legolas that he could have picked a better spot to see the mass army. Plus the same two characters counting how many Urik-Hai they were killing during the epic battle scene.<br/><br/>New characters in The Two Towers included Miranda Otto (from War of the Worlds) playing Aragorn's secret love interest, Bernard Hill (Titanic) playing King Theardon and David Wenham (Van Helsing) playing Boromir's brother Faramir.<br/><br/>But the new character who led well was the CGI character Gollum who joined Frodo and Sam on their quest to destroy the one ring. His mutters of 'my precious' had giving cinema a new movie line to join others.<br/><br/>Also impressive where the tree ents who helped hobbits Merry and Pippin to destroy Isengaard with an exciting action sequence.<br/><br/>Overall I preferred this film to Fellowship of the Ring and would say that it is my favourite 'second film' to a trilogy! Awesome!"
"malkane316","10","1","1","12 April 2005"," Quick Reviews!!
","Continuing directly on from the events of the last film, the Fellowship has been destroyed and it seems the bad guys have the upper hand. Gandalf is gone, Boromir has been killed, and the enemy's forces are growing to vast numbers and in power. They are spreading across Middle-Earth destroying all people, all races who get in their way in their quest for Frodo and The Ring. Saruman has been seduced by the evil, adding his superior skills and seeking out the remaining Fellowship members. Frodo and Sam travel on towards Mordor, followed by a mysterious creature. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to rescue their friends Pip and Merry who were captured by the enemy, an ork army. Things are looking bleak.<br/><br/>The Two Towers, in splitting up the group becomes a more personal film for each character as we get to know them more in their individual struggles. Jackso deals with the different stories brilliantly and we never get bored of watching one group too much. There is always something new happening, a new character, a new threat or battle, and we feel part of the proceedings. Again the attention to detail is breathtaking, and the acting is just as good from both the old and new characters. We meet Faramir, brother of Boromir who also seeks the Ring as he wants to please his father and save his own city, misguidedly. We meet Gollum, once Smeagol a creature corrupted and transformed over the years by the Ring. He wants it, believing it is his and his alone, and promises to be Sam and Frodo's guide into Mordor, along secret paths. Meanwhile Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli get an army together to protect the residents of Rohan in a massive battle against the evil forces of Sauran. The enemy is marching towards Gondor to destroy the worlds of man forever, and the good guys must fight for the two towers between Mordor and Isenguard. Merry and Pip meet the Ents, an ancient race of tree like creatures with immense power but slow pace. They set out to stop Saruman.<br/><br/>It is this film which heightens the emotional impact of the series. We learn more of Aragorn's past, and his tragic romance with Arwen who must decide between her immortality or her love. The banter between Gimli and Legolas continues, Frodo and Sam begin to drift apart because of the traitorous Gollum, but not all is lost...Theoden has been saved by an old friend an uses his old courage to rally his troops to victory, his strong-willed daughter Eowyn taking an interest in Aragorn. We learn of Faramir's life which will be important in the next film. Again the effects are superb, and the battle scenes are probably the most epic and sweeping yet. They are all only there though to give Frodo and Sam a slight chance of making it to Mordor. Another truly stunning feat by all involved.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

I would go as far to say that they are the best book adaptations to film, but this is, of course, all a matter of opinion.  (And as a long time fan of the books, I'm a bit biased).<br/><br/>First of all, I highly reccomend seeing the extended editions of these films as opposed to the theatrical versions.  You may want to wait for the EE of RotK to come out on DVD before watching these films.  The Extended Editions are simply far superior versions because it more closely captures the pacing, and feel of the books.  There is also more depth of character and development introduced in the Extended Editions lacking from the shorter theatrical versions.  Whereas the theatrical versions are simple, but good action/special effect movies, the Extended Editions are grand epic adventures that have far more depth and intelligence to them.<br/><br/>Secondly, unless you are watching them for the first at a LotR buttnumbathon type party, I do not reccomend watching them all at once.  All together, these films clock in at about 12 hours not including breaks.  Your rear will probably be hating its existence by the time you get to Return of the King.<br/><br/>Instead, I reccomend watching it small doses.  The Extended DVD Editions split the films over 2 discs and are perfectly designed for 6 90-120 minute episodic viewings.  This is the length of an average film, and allow for much less of a time commitment.  Still, I reccomend you not wait too long before seeing the next part, as these films essentially are one story with many characters, place names, and plot lines that can be easily forgotten. It's best to watch one DVD per night over 6 nights.  Treat it like a really good TV mini-series that you don't want to miss each night.<br/><br/>Lastly, turn off the lights, pump up the volume, and TURN ON THE SUBTITLES. There are many strange words in these films, and it helps if you can see them written in front of you.  The films are pretty easy to follow, but the plot is also complex and deep.  You will enjoy the films more if you understand as much as you can, as one of the main appeals of Tolkien's story is its attention to detail.<br/><br/>I can guarantee you that if you give these films a chance and take my reccomendations to heart you will not be disappointed. Enjoy."
"alainenglish","Null","1","1","2 February 2004"," Excellent sequel that develops the characters (spoilers)
","In many ways, ""The Two Towers"" is the most difficult of the ""Rings"" trilogy, possessing the same problem as ""The Empire Strikes Back"" in that it contains neither a beginning nor an end.  Indeed, the story of ""Two Towers"" moves alot slower and goes through fewer events than its predecessor.  What it does do very well here is to develop the existing characters to the point where they're ready for what happens at the end.<br/><br/>The group of warriors that set out to destroy the One Ring has collapsed and the survivors have been split apart.  Merry Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan) and Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd) elude capture by the Orcs and flee into the woods where they discover Gandalf (Ian MacKellen) really survived his encounter with the Balrog dragon.  King-to-be Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) leads Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) towards the city of Rohan, which is in danger of being captured by the wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) and his army.  Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) proceed towards Mordor, intent on destroying the ring.  They're accompanied by Gollum (Andy Serkis), the Ring's former owner, a crazed, duplicitious creature hell-bent on regaining his ""Preciouuussssss""......<br/><br/>It goes without saying that viewers will have had to have seen the previous picture to understand this one.  The interpretation of the book is accurate, although the key battle at the Helm's Deep sanctuary is given more emphasis in the film, and the final hundred pages have been clipped out for inclusion in ""Return of the King"".  The script holds the story up well, and does a fine job of exploring established characters whilst at the same time introducing new ones.<br/><br/>Of the new characters, Bernard Hill is convincing as Rohan's King Theoden, conveying well the stature of an aged, embattled but natural leader. Miranda Otto makes a striking impression as his beautiful daughter Eowyn. Brad Dourif has an all-too-brief cameo as Saruman's creepy servant, Grima Wormtongue.<br/><br/>Yet is Andy Serkis as Gollum who makes the most memorable character. Although Gollum's outward appearance is digitally generated, it is Serkis who provided both his movements and his voice.  He really makes the part his own.  Gollum is a pathetic, devious, snide, disgusting yet pitiably conflicted character.  He is positively a joy to watch.<br/><br/>As for the others, Viggo Mortensen gets some good material as Aragorn, the quietly noble ruler-in-waiting caught in a love triangle between Eowyn and Arwen (Liv Tyler), his Elf lover.  John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom develop a wonderful little-and-large comic rivalry as Gimli and Legolas. Wood and Astin are both good, painstakingly depicting the agonizing hardship of the two companions.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is consistent with what has gone before. Cinematography maintains the distinctive blend of location and digital shots.  Notable scenes in this film include an eerie sequence across the Dead Marshes, the battle at Helm's Deep and the final onslaught on Saruman's lair.<br/><br/>A good follow-up, with enough it to whet the appetite for ""Return of the King""."
"Elswet","10","1","1","23 December 2003"," A Masterpiece!
","The epic saga continues, picking up right where the first left off, complete with hand sewn banners hung throughout the Golden Hall of Rohan, hand-fashioned armor and elves!<br/><br/>These works are perhaps the best I have ever seen. In the genre of fantasy, this series is seriously in danger of having replaced Star Wars as my all-time favorite movies.<br/><br/>The direction was of the very best quality. The sets, designs, props and backdrops were realistic and without flaw.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the extended edition, released in November 2003.<br/><br/>The scenes fully restored to their original glory before having some of the detail and story line left on the cutting room floor, this production is as ""epic"" as they come; far larger than life. A task this formidable requires dedication, staying focused - both on the task at hand and in the creativity department.<br/><br/>Neither were lacking here. I honestly found not one moment of wasted film, not one single element which should have been edited out or omitted, not one performance which was lacking in any way.<br/><br/>While there WERE adaptations made to Tolkien's original literary work, I stand behind the creative decisions made, allowing that there were contractual obligations to be met, and fully and thoroughly enjoyed this darkling fantasy-filled adventure.<br/><br/>This work, with its story set at the edge of the fall of Man, was dark and twisted, yet leaving us with hope for Mankind's future. I thought Jackson's work to be frightfully clever and wholly engrossing.<br/><br/>This movie (especially the extended version) is absolutely wonderful; a true credit to the whole industry. Too bad for us that Hollywood is not as bold.<br/><br/>As did the Fellowship of the Ring, the Two Towers rates a full 10/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

Like the Lothlorien thematic thread played in battle mode when the Elven archers start the battle, to the Isengard theme. Another great piece of music is when Aragorn is washed ashore after he falls in the Warg attack, and the music for the Last March of the Ents."

"coreycole","10","1","1","20 December 2003"," A good film becomes a great one
","I enjoyed The Two Towers when I first saw it in the theater.  I even went back to see it 3 or 4 more times.  Still, I didn't think it measured up to Fellowship of the Ring.  There seemed to be too much emphasis on action, and not enough on characterization and story development.  The film also felt a little rushed in places.<br/><br/>With Peter Jackson's ""extended version"" re-release of The Two Towers, it has gone from a very solid film to a truly great one.  At times I felt as though I was watching an entirely new film.  Critical story and character details have been enhanced, the timing improved, and a couple of important scenes were added.  I now rate The Two Towers slightly above Fellowship of the Ring, which I still consider one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>There is no question in my mind that Lord of the Rings, treated as a single epic film, *is* the greatest film ever made.  There are no weak points now that The Two Towers has been raised to the pinnacle.  Here, at the end of all things, I am glad the DVD is with me."
"klchu","10","1","1","11 December 2003"," Extended DVD version is excellent and better
","This is a review of the extended DVD version.<br/><br/>I will keep this short because there are so many reviews.<br/><br/>The extended DVD release of The Two Towers is a real improvement over the original theatrical release.  Note, that this version has more than just new scenes.  Almost all of the scenes have been re-edited in some way.  The overall effect is that the story moves much better and the story is easier to follow.  Even though the movie is longer, the pacing is quicker and doesn't seem to drag as much as the original.  Likewise, the additional footage both improves the characterization of the newly introduced characters and restores some plot threads so that other existing scenes now make more sense (like the horse finding Aragorn).  It's also easier to tell who is who because many of the newer characters names are now spoken more often.<br/><br/>So, just like with the ""Fellowship"" DVD, the extended version is really the only version worth owning.  I already plan on only getting the extended version of ""King"" next year."
"jonathantu","10","1","1","30 November 2003"," Amazing - the perfect gift for a boy still lost in JRRT's pages
","Absolutely fabulous. I really don't understand the spotlighted review's grudges against this movie.<br/><br/>Some points I thought I'd like to rebuke:<br/><br/><ul><li>He noted that he went to the theater thoroughly excited at the prospect of watching a JRR Tolkien film of Lord of the Rings, when in fact the director's name is Peter Jackson. If he wanted the ""true"" Tolkien experience on celluloid, I hear there's going to be a projection of the unabridged text onto a classroom screen somewhere in Oregon.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>He also noted that Return of the King is the longest of the trilogy. The Fellowship of the Ring is the longest - RotK is helped along by the hefty appendices, which we can't expect to see in the movies. Thus, Jackson's moving of Shelob to RotK is understandable when you realize that tTT actually has a ridiculous amount of stuff going on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As for his misspelling of Arwen, it looked more like Eowyn. In which case, what movie did you see?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A ""real"" Tolkien fan would have questioned the inclusion of the elves at Helm's Deep, or Faramir's sudden detour to Osgiliath. Anyway, why bother when we've been presented with this wonderful gift?</li></ul><br/><br/>And that about sums up my take on this movie. I've just recently seen the extended version of the Two Towers, and I absolutely applaud the editing that went into making this movie. While the deleted scenes are wonderful for background and such, the finished and final movie that hit theaters is the stronger for the editing. It takes a director and crew with vision and quite a bit of brass to make those decisions.<br/><br/>I will also note that one of the most compelling war scenes EVER is Aragorn and Theoden leading the charge down the ramp and into a see of enemies. In-cre-di-ble.<br/><br/>Here's to December 17th!"
"lkalliance","10","1","1","29 November 2003"," An adroit adaptation of an extremely challenging novel
","It seems impossible to write a review of this film without turning into a comparison between it and J.R.R. Tolkien's original text. The deviations from the plot of the novel have been decried and also lauded.<br/><br/>But that sometimes deflects readers from the nature of the accomplishment: Peter Jackson and company have taken a massive work (speaking of the entire trilogy), a sprawling work, and not just brought it to the screen but repurposed it to be a true film adaptation, playing to the strengths of the medium. The production team took a story that was plot-centric and made it character-centric; they took a story that in book form touched on an incredible number of areas and created a wonderful, rich universe and concentrated on the most important areas -- which makes it a less-than-perfect copy of the original source material, but a nearly perfect cinematic presentation of this story.<br/><br/>As the middle part of a three-act story, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" was the most difficult to conceptualize and the most difficult to present on its own, and some hurdles were nearly not cleared...but they all were, eventually.<br/><br/>It's important to accept the storytelling premise: this is not a standalone film. It's less about character development than ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was and it's less about closure than ""Return of the King"" will be -- though it has both of those elements. It's the second act: that part of the story where we put the characters into impossible situations, where the challenges crystallize. The REAL story isn't about the quest to destroy the Ring of Power. It's about the internal journeys that Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and the rest each face. This film does an excellent job in getting that task done.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: The awesome panoramas and physical scope of what you see on screen is ever-present, as it was in the first film and I expect will be in the last. There are a lot of characters to keep track of, but most attention is placed on the ones that need it.<br/><br/>Jackson's decision to jump right into the second film -- to actually treat it not as a ""second film"" but as a continuation of the first -- means that every moment of screen time can be devoted to fleshing out characters and themes, which means that this film will contain more messages and things to dwell on than most films will. Some will find that a negative, but I found it a positive. Certainly Tolkien provided ample source material to choose from.<br/><br/>At the same time, the film does not attempt to flesh out everything from the novels, which helps the viewer focus on the important things.<br/><br/>The action is fast-paced but not overbearing, the acting superb and the balance between the physical and the emotional is good. Everything you've heard about the performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum is true -- easily the most significant digital character ever and a crucial performance.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's score is superb.<br/><br/>THE BAD: If you are a fan of the books and unable to let go of the text and keep an open mind, you're going to be distracted. I am a many-times reader of the books and I couldn't avoid devoting much of my attention to plot comparison during my first viewing. But once that was out of the way, I found that each successive viewing was a better experience than the last one.<br/><br/>If you are not comfortable with the entire fantasy genre, the good news is that ""Lord of the Rings"" doesn't overplay the role of magic in the story. There are fantastic elements of course, but most of what you see on screen (or on page, for that matter) is different in form from reality but not so much in function. That being said, ""The Two Towers"" has the most fantastic elements of the three volumes, and will be harder for  you to swallow.<br/><br/>With the plethora of characters and with Jackson's wise choice to focus on the development of the core ones, some characters seem to get short shrift, including Gandalf, who is in the odd position of being both a key mover of events but at the same time NOT being one of the core characters in terms of development. That can be disconcerting if you're not paying attention. ""Lord of the Rings"" is not a casual movie.<br/><br/>A few of the visual effects are not up to par with the effects from the first film, though overall they are outstanding and in Gollum's case mind-blowing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Of course, ""good"" and ""bad"" are subjective. The ""bad"" parts I list above are pretty circumstancial and might not make a difference to you. They didn't for me, which is why I give ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" unabashed top marks.<br/><br/>A NOTE ON THE EXTENDED EDITION: I found the Extended Edition DVDs to have great extra scenes that Tolkien fans will love and cherish (I certainly did), and the special feature had me completely enraptured. However, I still recommend the tighter, leaner theatrical cut as the better film experience."
"tricky808","10","1","1","28 November 2003"," A fantastic MOVIE, and we must all remember this...
","This movie is so good. It gives me that feeling I used to get when I was a kid and a new Star Wars flick was coming down the pipe. All of the modern technological advances in moviemaking find raison d'etre in this saga without smothering the story in large production 'pomp and circumstance'.<br/><br/>Yeah yeah, we can all get p***y about how the story wasn't followed to the letter and how license was granted in the embellishment of certain characters but we have to see this work for what it is, a MOVIE. MOVIES are not BOOKS. Anyone who uses this argument to downplay their opinion of Jackson's (et al.) attempt needs to revisit my previous statement. You cannot compare the two works as if they were the same variety of fruit and one is lacking in bouquet or has artificial color or flavoring. This reasoning is inherently flawed. Let's all give credit where it is due. Tolkien is the master of his world. Jackson is obviously a maestro in his own arena. I am so stoked that he has accomplished this with such aplomb. If we want to get upset at modern movie adaptations of excellent stories, why not pick on the Grinch or Interview With The Vampire or the impending Alexander The Great movie(s) (I may be jumping the gun on this last one, but why anyone would highlight the sexual practices of the greatest, most accomplished leader of ALL time as if it meant something is moronic especially considering the common practices of the day (I urge Baz and Oliver to read some J.F.C. Fuller on Alexander, please!). I would venture to say that, in the distant future if movie-like entertainment exists, no one would make a big deal out of how our modern leaders conducted themselves outside of the diplomatic/political/militaristic arena.)<br/><br/>Hollywood misses the mark in so many ways. Why we would get so wrapped up in this silliness is beyond me. Three cheers for Jackson and Company!"

Violence, greed, power, lust, corruption, betrayal ... it has all the makings of a biography of a congressional lobbyist, but without the glitter.<br/><br/>The first movie was a bit ""too busy"" for my taste. I prefer to inhale every now and then. This movie seemed better balanced and even during the enormous fight scenes, there was enough pause to blink. <br/><br/>The bad guys seemed somehow more real in this version also. Maybe because you got to hear some of them talk now and then. Seeing the monsters bickering about not having enough fresh food to eat and whining about doing a five day forced march also made them (dare I say) .. more human.<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't wait for the final chapter.  I don't think I could survive the 9-hour marathon viewing of all three chapters (my friends are all ready for it), but I certainly will be in line for the first opening in my area for the final chapter.

"stanoki","10","1","1","14 November 2003"," Great adaptation, but one flaw
","At the outset, Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material.  It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.<br/><br/>I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.:  Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo & Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.<br/><br/>But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me!  In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees the `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and deliberately uses it to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring.  In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.<br/><br/>Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King."
"thomasgulch","10","1","1","13 November 2003"," Superb
","In order to make a watchable movie that is under 35 hours long, tie it together thematically, and remain faithful to the overall plot, is no easy task. Many American and some European film-goers believe Jackson should have done a word for word movie, but then again it's hard to have some studio fund one movie that would require cots. Many American film-goers (mainly American teens), are angry there were no heavy rock bands or rap in the movie, no Tarrantino type mindless gore and violence and no explicit sex. Many are angry that this, God Forbid, was a movie with European characters and that Will Smith didn't play Frodo, and it was not a movie about an invalid or a concentration camp (which seem to make up all of the Academy Award movie winners for the last ten years). In short, in modern America, we want the kind of garbage you can see in still-born crap like the newest matrix - guns blasting every five seconds, multi-cultural raves, mystical mumbo-jumbo and a movie filmed in a variety of shades of green. If, on the other hand, you read the Lord of the Rings, loved it and understand a one-to-one translation to the screen is impossible, you will love the Two Towers. I guess that is what is making alot of reviewers really angry - the Two Towers has gotten a very high score on IMDB. There's a great reason -the movie is excellent."
"nixar55","10","1","1","15 November 2003"," Extended Excellence!
","I enjoyed the theatrical Two Towers even more than the first - it was darker, more suspenseful, more action-filled, and introduced some of my favorite characters. The extended edition gives viewers even more of the same - more heart, more comedy, more action, more character development, more sorrow, and more of a conclusion. My favorite scene in the extended edition is Faramir's flashback to a time spent with his brother and father. It really shows more insight into this character, making him seem less like Boromir-lite. It also shows more insight into Boromir himself, before he left for Rivendell, and introduced viewers to their father, Denethor, who is important to the third part of the tale. There's a lot more Merry & Pippin, Treebeard, and Gollum. The DVD extras are fantastic, as we've come to expect. Watch ""Cameras in Middle Earth,"" ""Tolkien: Origins of Middle-Earth,"" ""From book to Script"" and the entire special on Gollum and music and sound in The Two Towers. (With 4 hours of extras, these are what I found to be the best) Really fascinating stuff here. The downside? The wait for ""The Return of the king"" seems even more unbearable now!"

This second installment in the trilogy makes up for FOTR's arguably slow moving sequences through use of massive battle scenes, and a lot more character development.<br/><br/>There really aren't many downers in the movie, save for the length of the movie - I can almost guarantee butt cramps and extreme tiredness. Drink some coffee before hand, and guzzle pop during.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a remarkable affair, and leaves one drooling in anticipation for the final movie."

","I am in the ""purist"" camp and find Jackson's work to be almost unwatchable. I have read the entire Lord Of The Rings sequence at least 20 or 30 times through my late childhood to adulthood, and for all it's flaws it is still a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is unfilmable, in Jackson's own words, so he has set himself up for failure.  For all his technical prowess, and the amazing achievements by his creative team, this work lacks the depth of Tolkein's vision, and instead of requiring of us some imagination, it blinds us with special effects.<br/><br/>Omissions are to be expected in a work of this scale - you can't take such a large tome and condense it, even into three movies, without losing some of the plot.  But why make up plots that aren't there?<br/><br/>In Jackson's middle earth, men are weak, prone to corruption, that is why Isildur takes the ring for himself and that is a theme that Jackson seems to catch onto and run with.  Why?  There are other themes of Tolkein's which were valid and valuable and would still speak to a modern audience.<br/><br/>I appreciate that Tolkein's work lacked strong female voices, and have no problem with Arwen's character being built upon and extrapolated to a degree - her ""rescue"" of Frodo in Fellowship is quite thrilling I suppose, but this whole dream sequence in TTT with a whinging Elf princess and her overbearing father - characters I don't recognise whatsoever from Tolkein's work - add nothing to the story.<br/><br/>The sacking of Isengard by the Ents brought a tear of joy to my eye, but otherwise I found this middle movie dull, unimaginative, and very much a victim of ""hollywood spin"".<br/><br/>Let's hope the Return Of The King offers some satisfaction."

","I give TTT a 10, not because its perfect, but because its strengths so far outweigh its weaknesses.  Like others it was disappointing to see the divergence from the Book, particularly regarding Faramir and the Frodo/Sam's trip to Gondor.  It didn't make Faramir more real to me, as the screen writer argues, only less like Tolkien saw him (its sad that some people can't believe that there are those who resist temptation).<br/><br/>     Otherwise the film is such a pleasure to watch and become immersed in. You really get to see the world of Middle-Earth and experience the magic that originates from Tolkien's Masterpiece.

I was left only wanting more and would have been willing to sit through another 3 hours to see ROTK immediately after, as I hear they are doing in some theaters the day before ROTK comes out in December.<br/><br/>     Golem was the best supporting actor ever in any film.  Yes he was CGI, but he was a compilation of many hours of human effort and expression -- brilliantly done.  His character truly earned our sympathy and admiration often in the same scene.<br/><br/>     I laughed, I cried, I'm going to watch TTT over and over again."
"senortuffy","10","1","1","15 September 2003"," Just as spectacular as the first installment of the Trilogy.
","I have to admit, I'm completely won over by the masterful work director Peter Jackson has done with Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not particularly a fan of George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" movies and thought the ""Star Trek"" films to be inconsistent, so fantasy isn't exactly my thing.  But after watching ""Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"" back to back the past few nights, I'm absolutely stunned by the magnitude of the achievement here.<br/><br/>This film picks up right where the first installment left off, with the fellowship having dissolved.  Frodo leaves with Sam as company so that he may take the ring to Mordor and destroy it in the fire from which it was created.  The others leave to fight the battle for Middle Earth as Saruman has unleashed his army from Isengard.<br/><br/>The battle scenes between the men of Rohan and their elf allies against the urik-hai, the half men, half orc creatures bred by Saruman, are amazing. Digital technology plays a major part in these scenes, but as mentioned in a previous review, it is so seamless with the real cinematography that the result is just stunning.<br/><br/>Gollum, a digitally created image, plays a major part in this installment. He's one of the classic characters in Tolkien's work, and I wondered how they could possibly portray him as I imagined, but the result is perfect. The digital artists struck just the right balance between a prowling little creature attempting to regain the ring and a pitiful figure twisted by its power.<br/><br/>Like the first movie in the trilogy, this one is long (three hours plus), but it's such an epic film and full of so many characters and so much detail, that you're sucked in anyways.  At times, you're reminded of Shakespeare, and at other times one of those Disney cartoons from before the war, like ""Snow White.""  <br/><br/>These films are a wonderful creation and I hope everyone enjoys them as much as I have.  ""The Return of the King"" should be awesome."

","Great movie. Not as good as the first, but still really good. I was surprised that it didn't win Best Picture. The Book is really boring and dark, but they changed alot in this film to make it watchable. The Battle for Helms Deep is only 15 pages in the novel, but is the center part in the movie. Watch it"
"RatBoy1323","10","1","1","7 August 2003"," And you thought the first one was good
","Man, director Peter Jackson is 2 for 2 for Lord of the Rings.  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the second part in what many are already saying is the greatest trilogy in film.  LOTR: TTT  is just as good as Fellowship if not better in some aspects.<br/><br/>New characters are introduced and they are just as interesting as the great cast of the first film.  Bernard Hill is noticeably good as King Theoden who has a powerful scene at the grave of his son. I also liked Faramir.  Yes, he is different from the book but I thought David Wenham's performance was heartfelt and real.  Miranda Otto(Eowyn), Karl Urban(Eomer), and Brad Dourif(Grima Wormtongue) round out the great new cast.<br/><br/>The special effects  are more frequent and extremely impressive.  Gollum is a great acheivement in computer effects and definitely the most believable computer generated character.  Treebeard and the ents also look fantastic. And the computer generated warriors at Helm's Deep are a sight to behold.<br/><br/>This film is filled with so many great moments that it's hard to pinpoint just one.  Gollum/Smeagol's duality, Ents storming on Isengard, The Battle of Helm's Deep, Frodo offering the Ring, Gandalf's ride to victory, and Sam's final speech are all fantastic.  See this film.  Great performances, incredible special effects and intense action make Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers the best film of 2002.  Bring on The Return of the King!"
"michaelgs","9","1","1","2 August 2003"," A film for our time.
","This franchise will, in all likelihood, become remembered as a franchise that shaped filmmaking over the next 10-20 years, and will remain a watched film while the industry lasts. The question then commonly asked becomes, ""Does this movie deserve to be remembered that long?""<br/><br/>The answer to that question is, really ""deserved"" is the wrong word.Independence Day will probably still be watched 30 years from now, not because it is necessarily all that good, but because it was hugely successful and spawned a slew of disaster-related flicks. In other words, it defined an era. And with the Harry Potter series being developed as we speak, and both the Chronicles of Narnia and His Dark Materials being made into franchises, one can easily conclude that this film will be remembered as the film that spawned the development of modern fantasy blockbusters (although the Harry Potter series being contemporary was coincidental). By now, we have come to expect that lesser films will occasionally become classics, while greater films will occasionally fall into obscurity.<br/><br/>However, I feel, and I hope you will concurr when you see it for yourself, that this is a worthy addition to those era-defining films that come along every-so-often. In fact, IMHO, this is one of the best era-defining films since Star Wars, or at least one of the most enjoyable. Several things from this franchise are truly, justifiably, memorable, such as the wholesome innocence of the Shire and the hobbits, gandalf's stand against the balrog, the preparation for the climactic battle of helms deep, the double personality of Gollum, and...well, since this review is being written in August of 2002 and the Return of the King is not out yet, I'll leave this last one blank, but I am confident that this last film will give us something that will make it worth remembering, perhaps even more than the first two. Some say that the oscar should and will go to this last film, but I say that the oscar has had mixed reactions to these era-defining franchises (the only film I would classify as an era-defining franchise that garnered an oscar since the 70s was Silence of the Lambs), and the Academy might be better off bestowing the award on another film that will fall into obscurity if not honored, rather than adding garnish to an already classic series.<br/><br/>I never garauntee that everyone will like a film. If you go to the Casablanca (my personal all-time favorite) page on this website and check the rating stats, you'll find that more than a few people have given it a ""1"" rating. But most probably will find this film at least a highly enjoyable diversion, and that is what film is all about in the first place.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Enchilada_Jones","Null","1","1","6 July 2003"," I didn't like this, but I gotta give him that.
","Okay, let me first start of by saying that I am a LotR fan, and have been since junior high. The Lord of the Rings opened my eyes to a whole new world of action, adventure, and lost ideals that was just WAITING to be tapped into. When I first heard rumors in '98 of a live action movie, I could barely believe it. When I actually saw a trailer, I had a heart attack. When the first one came out, I died, but came back to life to see the second one. And now that all of America and most of the world has seen it, what do I think.<br/><br/>Did somebody say ""creative liberties?""<br/><br/>WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br/><br/>
Okay, sure, the movie more or less followed the tale set up in the Fellowship of the Ring, with Frodo and Sam having gone into Morder alone, Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn off tracking orcs to find Merry and Pippin, and Gandalf coming back in Fangorn. What I COULDN'T understand was why everything seemed to go in hyper speed. The entire Helm's Deep sequence seemed exceedingly rushed. It was all BANG, BOOM, SLASH, ORC FALLS, TWANG! HUMAN FALLS, ELVES DIE, GIMLI, ORCS, GANDALF, BOOM, SLASH, SLASH, CHARGE, SCREAM, fin. I couldn't keep up with everything going on. I didn't know if it took two days, or a couple minutes, it was so rushed.<br/><br/>That aside, BY FAR, the most perturbing thing about The Two Towers was this: The elves marched into Helm's Deep. So aback was I taken, that, in a crowded theatre, I was inclined to, and actually did, yell ""Did they just rewrite the whole BOOK?!"" Though the audience in the theatre did find it amusing, I was genuinly disgusted. I couldn't understand why Jackson let the elves come to Helm's Deep. What prompted such a heinous and deliberate destruction of Tolkien's classic? It may have been for the continuation of the story line, but putting elves at Helm's Deep for continuity makes as much sense as keeping Boromir alive for ""character value.""<br/><br/>Now those comments were biting, and horrible, but my review isn't ALL bad. Jackson is a very gutsy fellow, taking on something as big as the Lord of the Rings, and I'll be a chicken if he hasn't done well so far. With only a few discrepencies, he's managed to, at least, keep the story and all of the characters intact. That alone is more than can be said for most attempts at any book-movie adaptation. And for what it's worth, the first movie pulled off that new, fresh feeling that can't be conveyed in a book. The story was captivating, the characters 97% accurate (damn you, Arwen!!), and the villains truly villainous. Out of general principal, everyone should go see this movie. How often do we get to see one of the best literary works of our time transposed onto film? Do it. You will not regret it."
"bigsleepj","Null","1","1","1 July 2003"," Sigh. So much for that idea.
","Without a doubt ""The Two Towers"" is a magnificent epic motion picture even that will go down into the list of Classic Movies. It's bound to pop up on several top-100 movies list and will probably end up in my DVD collection.<br/><br/>(!! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS !!)<br/><br/>There's only one problem. THIS IS NOT THE STORY TOLKIEN WROTE! The story was changed too much. What's with Aragorn falling from a cliff into a river and getting saved by Trigger, the world's smartest horse? Pah! Pooh! Ack! What about the Uruk-Hai Orc yelling ""Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys?"" Ugh! Eeek! Pooh! And let's not forget that when they made Faramir mean they made him BORING! And why wouldn't Treebeard want to fight while in the book he clearly wanted to? <br/><br/>Because Peter Jackson either does not understand the intricacies of the book or he just ignored it.<br/><br/>Not too mention some of the changes brought into the book ONE MASSIVE inconsistancy. When Faramir takes Frodo and Sam to the besieged city (which was obviously inspired by ""Saving Private Ryan"") one of the Ring Wraiths attempt to seize Frodo. The inconsistancy lies in the fact that he has been spotted. So this is how it works; if the Black-Riders Ring Wraiths know, the Sauron Knows. If Sauron knew the Ring was so close then he would have send all his forces to that spot to capture Frodo and the Ring. Since, in the movie, this didn't happen, we now have something that does not make sense. The Dark Lord would have guessed what they were up to and would have tried to stop them.<br/><br/>Another major problem is the fact that Jackson threw out all of Tolkiens subtleties and blew everything out of proportion. (Although the part where the Ents rampage through Isengard is still a great view! Ha!).<br/><br/>
Sigh. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" had it's forgivable faults. ""The Two Towers"" is almost unforgivable."

I give this movie 10/10 and if I could, I'll give it more than 10!<br/><br/>I loved it!...MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>~*!!!PEACE!!!*~"
"bburns","9","1","1","24 May 2003"," Not as good as ""Fellowship"", but still excellent.
","I think I may be the only person I know who still prefers ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to ""The Two Towers"".  That doesn't take much away from this film, it's just that truly perfect films are rare, and it's hard to make lightning strike twice.<br/><br/>I have only three real problems with this film.  The first is Gandalf.  In the first film, Gandalf the Grey was a kindly, grandfatherly figure.  In this one, Gandalf the White is cold and strangely distant (admittedly, this is a problem with the original source material, so I guess that Jackson was just being true to the book).  Also, in the first film, Ian McKellen's prosthetics looked like real hair and a real beard.  In this one, they look like the stage props they are.<br/><br/>The second problem is that it lingers for far too long on the Battle of Helms Deep.  True, I have not read the books in years, but I don't remember that much attention being paid to this battle.  I think it was just an excuse to focus on Aragorn so women would sit through the movie, and also to make sure the audience remembered the spectacular visual effects.<br/><br/>The third problem is the most pervasive.  As I recall, the book was mostly about the Frodo & his relationship with Gollum.  In the film, Elijah Wood is given little to do besides swoon under the Ring's power.  And Gollum is the most compelling character in the film.  He should have been given more screen time.<br/><br/>But all in all, this is an excellent film.  I was particularly wowed by the aforementioned special effects, and by Gollum.  I knew when I saw the effects that I was watching CGI animation.  But the only times I could truly *see* that was when Gollum made a particularly rubbery smile, or when Treebeard showed an expression other than annoyance on his face.  I also really liked the way Gollum was portrayed by Andy Serkis, and the particular attention paid to the internal battle between Good Smeagol and Wicked Gollum.<br/><br/>I think my favorite thing about the movie, though, was Treebeard and the other Ents.  In many ways they reminded me of the clay figurines come to life in ""Heavenly Creatures"" (the first Peter Jackson film to have an impact in the U.S. other than as just a cult phenomenon).<br/><br/>""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was the best film of its type to come along since ""The Empire Strikes Back"", and ""The Two Towers""--although it may not be the masterpiece that ""Fellowship"" was--proves that ""The Lord of the Rings"" (barring a truly wretched ""Return of the King"") is the best trilogy since the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy.  9 out of 10."
"frparris","Null","1","1","21 May 2003"," Jackson's Two Towers
","Spoiler How can anyone who claims to be a Tolkien fan claim that Jackson's movies have been good. Now I can understand that certain scenes have to be modify or even left out due to time limits. I also don't mind additional stuff added in that were not mentioned in the books in order to bring in additional people. But I absolutely hate when Jackson decides to rewrite one of the greatest series ever.<br/><br/>What do I mean by this? In the first movie, for the most part Jackson did do a good job. My disappointments: No Tom, I understand it was left out because of time, but No Tom. Making Merry and Pippen into clowns. Read the Books Jackson. Merry and Pippen did not steal food from Maggot after they were grown. Only as kids. The ending, Do you really think that Pippen and Merry would of let Frodo go off by himself, NOOOOOOOOOO. He should of keep to the book and had him run back to the boats in the shadow world which was a cool effect anyway.<br/><br/>As far as the second movie, Jackson really screwed up the movie. The scenes between Aragon and Arwen, I don't mind at all. Not in the book, means it could of happen we don't know. But NO WHERE IN THE BOOKS does a unit of Friggin elves come down to Helm's deep, and Aragon never comes close to dying in the books except in the appendix where he does die of old age. For those two scenes, Jackson's Director chair should be chopped up and Jackson should be chased out of the movie buiz.<br/><br/>To blantantly add stuff that never happened and never would of or could of happen just angers me to no end. So Mr. Jackson, please do us a favor and accidently destroy the third movie, because I know you are going to mess that one up also, and never do Tolkien again."

Too much American-like. Seems Jackson didn't understand the story at all. Even my friend who never read the book guessed (always correctly) what surely wasn't in the book: like that ""exorcism"" of Theoden...

","I have never read any of the LOTR books (and have no mind to), I am merely commenting on the film quality itself.  <br/><br/>Since the advancement of computer graphics, directors can now create the humungous, landmark battles that could only be hinted at in such films as ""The Empire Strikes Back"".  Other than that, there is the clunky conflicts of ""Spartacus"" and ""Ran"".  Do computers make this any better?  Having seen LOTR: The Two Towers, I will say ""yes, they do"".  The battle of Helm's Deep is undoubtedly one of the largest and most interesting set pieces ever created out of zeroes and ones.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems vapid and more focused around the big battle than in the mood for telling an engaging and developing story like ""Fellowship"" did.  Gandalf gets minimal screen time, Frodo and Sam seem totally out of place with the rest of the story, and the other Hobbits look bored for about 90% of the time.  <br/><br/>Oh well, watch this if you have time for it.

Brad Dourif was awesome as Grima Wormtongue!Cate Blanchett really wasn't in TTT very long but she was very good.Another top notch performence!Christopher Lee was great and the others like Orlando Bloom as Legolas and John Rhys-Davies as Gimli was good like before.Ian McKellan was good as Gandalf but since he is Gandalf the White his character seemed different than he was in first part of The Lord of the Rings.Bernard Hill as King Theodon was good as well. As for the other stuff I was really fascinated by Treebeard and the Ents. I honestly thought that they would be to cartoony and wouldn't fit in the film but they were great.The Gollum CGI character was good and very realistic.I loved the giant elephants and the Wargs.I couldn't believe it when I saw the Ringwraiths riding dragons and the Cave Trolls are great.As for the film itself its a wonderful film. The scenery, the battles,every thing was great!The prolog was great with Gandalf and the Balrog. The Battle at Helms Deep was very epic and the three battle scenes at different places didn't hurt.Is all I can say is that TTT is a great film and its one of the best ever.I am glad the story is continuing with The Return of the King later this year and I can't wait to see it!

","Leaving you off at the end of the Fellowship of the Ring, it continues will no background of what had happened already. It makes the movie flow better. It also gives you A reason to see the first installment. Out of all the trilogies I have seen, never have I seen the second installment better than the first one. It captures the immense detail of the book. That is why it is so grand. Tolkien's story was put together so that if it is changed, it losses its meaning. The cast and crew realized that, causing then to put in the most minute details. Of course, some things had to be changed. There are some things in books that don't work for movies. The most major mistake, that I find, is the Fact that the movie does not end when then book ends. The line in the book is, ""Frodo was alive but taken by the Enemy."" In the movie, it only foreshadows that specific line with the line, ""she will do it."" But, I understand that in movies, time is limited; and time was sparse at the time. If the movie continued, it would cause the audience to become bored. Other than that, no movie has surpassed it- for me anyway. I also find that there are hidden truths behind Lord of the Rings. I find it through my studies of Tolkien. That is what made it special; that is what made it never to be surpassed by any other book. It is a book that has become a movie that will stand for generation as one of the greatest stories of ALL TIME."
"rosscinema","7","1","1","27 January 2003"," Impressive looking
","This is definitely a very entertaining film and the special effects are terrific but I don't think its as good a film as the first one. We've come to know the characters already so the film dives right in with the action while the first film took its time setting up the story. I do have one major gripe in this film and its the part of the film with the two hobbits Merry and Pippin and those tree creatures. The film comes to a screeching halt when the scenes shift to that part. The tree creatures talk slow, walk slow and all the scenes with them crawl along like a drunk snail. Another complaint I have is Ian McKellen as Gandolf is hardly in the film at all. And Cate Blanchett has only one scene! The most exciting part of the film is the battle at Helm's Deep of course. These scenes are not only exciting but very impressive looking as far as filmmaking is concerned. This part of the film is really an achievement. Of course during the whole course of this bloody battle the character Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) never gets hurt. So while this is going on Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) are off in another direction battling Christopher Lee. So they're really is three stories going on at the same time. Where the first film took its time in its narrative this film plunges head first into action. The two films really are different. This is an extremely well made film and Peter Jackson should be proud but I don't think its a great film. Impressive looking and very entertaining but I'm hoping the third film will be better."
"cynharm","10","1","1","16 January 2003"," One of the best of 2002
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Rarely do I walk into a movie theatre with this much anticipation and expectations high as they were for THE TWO TOWERS.  Only when viewing a STAR WARS movie am I this pumped, this high on what I am about to see.  I expect an out-of-body experience and dammit, I better get it.<br/><br/>
The fact that THE TWO TOWERS delivered the goods when my expectations were so high is the biggest compliment I can give this film.  Like a STAR WARS film, there are so many incredible cinematic moments that make THE TWO TOWERS worth the price of admission; the vertigo inducing fall of Gandalf and the Balrog which opens the film,  the creation of Gollum- both as a CG benchmark and as the best new character in the film, the shot of the trolls opening The Black Gate, the battle between the Riders of Rohan on horseback and Orcs on Wargs, the fearful deep bass sound of the Nazgul on wings, the exorcism of Theoden, the arrow attack on the giant Olipants, and of course, the colossal and desperate battle of Helm's Deep.   <br/><br/>Again, as in STAR WARS, it is the characters that work so well to bring THE TWO TOWERS to life.  Just like I did when I saw ATTACK OF THE CLONES, I spent the first half hour of THE TWO TOWERS with a silly grin on my face... Simply because I was in the company of these great characters again.  The music too, is also a character.  When Howard Shore's themes first rolled through the movie theatre, I felt like I was visiting an old friend.<br/><br/>In THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, it was Frodo and Gandalf that carried the film.  In THE TWO TOWERS, Legolas, Gimli and Aragon find themselves carrying the weight of the story, with the quest of the Ringbearer playing second fiddle to the Battle for Rohan.  Gandalf, sadly, plays a small yet pivotal role, while the supporting characters are given a chance step to the forefront.  Gimli especially, who suffered from trimmed screen time in the theatrical installment of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is brought to life here with fire and brimstone by John Rhys-Davies - not to mention some much needed, and quite effortless, comic relief for this grim chapter of the story.<br/><br/>But who knew about Orlando Bloom?  Nothing in the first part of the trilogy prepared me for the charisma and confidence he brings to Legolas in THE TWO TOWERS.  Bloom displays remarkable power and grace in every aspect of his performance, from his quiet moments of pain and confusion when he believes Merry and Pippen to be slaughtered, to the fear and anger he expresses to Agagorn when he knows they are facing certain doom at Helm's Deep.  Plus Legolas is so damn cool.  When he deftly swings himself up onto a horse in slow motion, I almost screamed with delight.<br/><br/>But by far the best character in THE TWO TOWERS is Gollum.  Not only is he a masterpiece of CG, but he is wonderfully, performed, written and directed. The scenes of his split personality having heated arguments with himself are the most mesmerizing in the film.  Especially subtle is the confrontation with Faramir when he huddles in a stony alcove with his back to us, his hands gently stroking his own shoulder when Smeagol speaks, then shaking with fists of rage when Gollum possesses him.  Brilliant.<br/><br/>
Technically, Gollum's CG interaction with Frodo and Sam are seamless.  They fight, grapple, touch each other, grab at each other's clothing - all with utter believability.  The scenes at the foot of The Black Gate are especially impressive as Gollum desperately pulls at Frodo's cloak.  The CG Gollum, the CG cloak, and the real cloak worn by Elijah Wood are all completely believable in the frame.  The illusion is perfect.<br/><br/>I have but one quibble with Gollum: he looks terrible in his very first shot!  The first time we see his face when he is crawling down the rock face with the moon behind him is so CG!  It's the only shot of Gollum that looks bad and it's the very first one!<br/><br/>In terms of story, THE TWO TOWERS suffers the same unfortunately fate as the first film - there is simply too much crammed into the three hours.  The film needs to breathe and settle down. Characters need to be fleshed out and given a moment or two more to develop.  THE TWO TOWERS suffers the opposite fate of ATTACK OF THE CLONES: It needs to be longer!<br/><br/>While the Rohan plot-line works superbly and drives the bulk of the momentum, the supporting subplots sputter and falter as the film enters it's second half.  Merry and Pippen start off with all the fixings of their own fantastic little adventure, but then end up literally stuck in a tree for over an hour of screen time.  Luckily, they march off to war in spectacular fashion with the Ents to save the plot line, but for the most part they disappear from the second half of the movie.<br/><br/>Worse is the plight of the Ringbearer in his quest to find entry into Mordor.  With Gollum and Sam playing well off their mutual dislike of each other, and Frodo fearfully watching the sky for the Wraiths circling overhead, all the cards are in place for this subplot to really be spectacular.<br/><br/>It isn't.<br/><br/>A bored-looking David Wenham shows up as Boromir's brother, Faramir, and the whole quest grinds to a halt.  These scenes obviously play great importance to the fate of Gondor which will be explored in the final chapter, but here they are thrown at us quickly and with little foreshadowing.  We are pulled away from the borders of Mordor to deal with a character we know little about, and who's plight isn't particularly interesting, especially compared to the epic drama that Rohan is facing.  Worse, we don't know what Frodo, Sam, or even Aragorn think about the situation in Gondor.  All we get is some brief voice over from Cate Blancett.  It's far too expository to engage us and the drama falls flat because of it.<br/><br/>The main reason this happens is because there isn't any time for Peter Jackson an company to tell this part of the story.  Jackson, as he was with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, is fighting the clock to try and get Tolkien's four-hundred-plus pages crammed into a three hour theatrical release. Frodo's quest suffers because of it.  Faramir needs to be set up with the same drama and intrigue as King Theoden is set up, but that would mean lengthening the film by at least twenty minutes - something that Jackson doesn't have the luxury of doing.  We can only hope that when the DVD comes out that Jackson is able to work the same magic as he did with THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING - THE SPECIAL EDITION."
"taikman","7","1","1","8 January 2003"," Epic, spectacular and thrilling, but also flawed.
","In my review of 'The Chamber of Secrets' I mentioned how tough the job of Chris Columbus, director of the Harry Potter movies was. However when it comes to adapting books to film his job looks straightforward compared to Peter Jackson's. Over a thousand pages of novel had to be trimmed and shaped into six hours of film, perhaps two dozen important characters to bring to life, millions of devoted Tolkien fans and also the general filmgoing public to satisfy. I thought he did an amazing job with 'The Fellowship of the Ring', which was, aside from a few overwrought moments, probably as good an adaption as could possibly have been made. Unfortunately I can not say the same for 'The Two Towers'.<br/><br/>Oh, it is very good - Jackson again shows what a master he is at staging battle scenes and creating moments of wonder and horror, the special effects and New Zealand scenery are breathtaking and the quality cast again do a good job. But there are moments that are a bit corny and scenes that could have been more tense and exciting than they were.<br/><br/>The story consists of three seperate plot lines - Merry and Pippin journey into Fangorn Forest where they meet the Ents, the ancient Shepherds of the Trees, Frodo and Sam head closer to Mordor with Gollum, the twisted former possessor of the One Ring, and the remaining members of the Fellowship fight to save the kingdom of Rohan from the forces of Saruman, who has used magic and a treacherous advisor to enfeeble Theoden, Rohan's king.<br/><br/>While it is packed with characters and events, there is not as much in 'The Two Towers' as there was in 'Fellowship', so while it does not have quite the variety of locations events that the first film did, Jackson has been able to create a film that is not as episodic this time (which was inevitable with the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' - see the extended DVD version for a longer, better-paced cut). The three-pronged story is still which was the screenwriters and editors biggest problem, as they had to try and juggle and balance the plots so that the viewer follows what is going on while the movie's momentum is maintained. Generally I think Jackson and company did a fine job but, especially towards the end of the movie, they could have done a better one. The film cuts between the climaxes of all three plots which reduces the power of each of them, especially the epic battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is a huge, superbly choreographed sequence but the tension that it creates gets released too often as we shift to what Sam and Frodo or Merry and Pippin are doing. I think it would have been better to finish Sam and Frodo's story, except for the epilogue with Gollum, which belongs at the end, before cutting between the battle at Helm's Deep and the hobbits' dealings with the Ents.<br/><br/>Partly to provide a climax, a lot has been changed from the book. Many things that were in 'The Two Towers' will now be in the third movie (which makes me wonder how they will fit everything into 'The Return of the King') and a few things have been added. Some of the additions, such as the battle with the warg-riders and the Black Rider's sweep over the Dead Marshes, are very good. Others, such as Aragorn's near-death experience and his triumphant return, the slow-motion fall of Haldir and the reunion of a mother with her children are cliched. The screenplay is a flawed one: it does not always explain what is going on adequately and there are a disappointing number of melodramatic moments. I could have done with less shots of frightened women and children, less inspirational speeches, less beams of shining light and, though he was funny, less of Gimli the dwarf as comic relief. Sometimes, as at Helm's Deep, the atmosphere should be grim and frightening and a joke spoils the mood. As do a few cute, anachronistic moments such as when Legolas skates down stairs on a shield or when Sam talks about what it would be like to be a character in a great story. 'The Lord of the Rings' is not supposed to be postmodern - such moments just take you out of the alternative world that the movie is trying to create by reminding you that it is a movie.<br/><br/>But while it is not up to the very high standard of 'Fellowship', 'The Two Towers' is still a quality movie: spectacular, sometimes stirring and gorgious to look at and listen to. There is one other thing that would make it worth seeing: Gollum. The first CGI character to actually act well, Gollum, with his split personality, creepy voice and pale, veiny, superbly rendered body, is fascinating to watch. All his scenes are among the movie's best. If 'The Two Towers' does get an Oscar nomination for acting Andy Serkis, who did the voice and the movements that Gollum was based on, will probably be the one. I suspect though that this won't be the year that Peter Jackson gets to go up for Best Director or Best Film. Oh well, there's still 'The Return of the King.'<br/><br/>7 1/2 / 10"
"eb_redbaron","7","1","1","7 January 2003"," sadly disappointing
","as a fan of the books and a really big movie buff, i was nonetheless disappointed with TTT. maybe because the first one was so excellent, especially the extended version, which unfortunately one can only watch television-size. it seems to me that a pattern in emerging, where you leave all the quiet, but very important, scenes between actors out of the theatrical version, and instead concentrate on the action pieces. but the tenth shot of an uruk-hai bellowing or of women and children looking frightened becomes boring or pathetic pretty soon. and of course there are the story changes: most of them totally unnecessary and not helping the plot at all. i dont mind the scenes between elrond and arwen (although elrond is really painfully miscast) and the conflict of mortality that arwen faces. in fact, those dream-love scenes were a welcome respite from the action pieces. speaking of which, the whole warg-attack was so useless and stupid! it reminded me of star wars, not a good comparison in my mind. and that aragorn drops off the cliff was dramatically ridiculous. not even people who havent read the book will believe that one of the main characters would die like that in the middle of the movie. furthermore it just mirrored gandalfs fall in the first movie, but at the same time belittled that event. i could go on and analyse the whole movie like that, but whats the point? the addition of laborous action pieces seems the main intent, and not staying closer to the book in terms of story-telling. i think its wrong to consider those movies as pure action-flicks that have to cater to teenage boys. after all, the books are very much loved by men and women alike.<br/><br/>so i can only wait for the extended version, where all the really important scenes might have been put back again.... i really love the first movie, but after TTT im sadly pessismistic about part three. the filmmakers left out so many important story-elements, they will never be able to finish the story in any way that resembles tolkiens book!"

Sam is just as annoying as he is in the book. not a good thing. Frodo is a wuss, even more so the Theoden. the fact that the three most irritating charcters in the whole film share nearly all thier scenes together doesn't help. i was hoping the orcs would catch them.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler is an awful actress. i don't know why she delivers all her lines in that stupid goddamn voice but i wish Jackson had told her to knock it off. it dosen't help that she's given awful dialoge in a pointless sub-plot either.<br/><br/>some of the CGI was good, but the Wargs were crap. and what were the Nazgul riding? they looked like aborted dragon fetuses.<br/><br/>300 guys against 10,000 orcs? maybe they should have got Steven Segal to play Aragorn instead. and in the best action film tradition, the Orcs are treated as cannon fodder, thus destroying any credable threat they represent. nursery school infants could take down an army or Orcs in this film.<br/><br/>the constant onslaught of short jokes did not help. i'm convinced Jackson has something against short people, look at how he's pushed Merry and Pippin as far away from the story as he could. i'm convinced he would have written them out entirely if he thought he'd get away with it.<br/><br/>Faramirs change didn't serve any purpose. i suspect Peter Jackson was just running out of ways to make Frodos journey intresting (theres only so many shots of Frodo, Sam and Gollum walking and occasionly looking over things that you can put in one film) so used Faramir to liven it up. at least it's more worthwhile then the time-wasting romantic sub-plot.<br/><br/>i suppose i should mention things i liked; Gimli was cool, even with Jacksons best attempts to undermine him. the Elves coming to Helms-Deep. the occasional good moments with Gollum. most of the cast turned in pretty good performances (with the notable exception of Liv Tyler)<br/><br/>hey i didn't like it but you should probably go see it anyway. just don't expect anything more then a bog-standard action film."

","I read Tolkien's trilogy 2 years ago and, like millions of others, was engulfed in a new world - Middle Earth. So there was much expectation surrounding the film release. And i must say that i am impressed at what has been achieved. Critics have it that the film is heavily layered with special effects and that many of the characters are unexplored. In other words, more food for the eye than for the heart. However this is totally acceptable and expected. To incorporate most of the books' fantasies and characters is already an arduous task. Some aspects had to be cut off otherwise Jackson would have had to make 20 episodes to keep faithful to the book. If one wants to feel the whole range of emotions, then the only true bible is the written version. The film is mainly a feast for the eyes, and a damn good one too."

"stakes","7","1","1","21 December 2002"," good film, but a letdown
","The Two Towers is an enjoyable, and sometimes very good movie, but was a dissappointment to me in the wake of the sheer masterpiece that was The Fellowship Of The Ring.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson was able to fill the FOTR with a variety of well-developed characters, a sweeping cinematic landscape, a tense and intriguing storyline, and an overall depth that the book itself possessed. I am no expert on the books, but I do know that FOTR truly delivered the spirit of the book.<br/><br/>Now having said that, one could just take all the battles and action, and hordes of armies and violent characters that exist in the books, plunk them into a bunch of fighting sequences, and make great action movies.  The FOTR went beyond that, and captured the true heart of the original book, which is why it was so good, and will go down as a cinematic classic, much in the same way the books will go down as litterary classics.<br/><br/>Being Peter Jackson more or less filmed the trilogy of Lord Of The Rings films back-to-back, I figured that the sheer brilliance put forth in FOTR would be present.  That is not the case.<br/><br/>Instead, Jackson has delivered the aforementioned action movie.  There's epic battle after epic battle, swordsman after swordsman, but little else. The centerpiece of the books and the first film -- the Hobbits -- are something of an afterthought in the TT, while swashbuckling swordsman Aragorn and bow and arrow marksmen Legolas take the spotlight.  These are characters who are embody the standard action movie hero in every sense, but again, don't begin to scrape the depths of the book, which is so much more than what is on display here.<br/><br/>There's word that Jackson did a lot of re-shooting and editing to the TT in the last 12 months.  Perhaps he felt the pressure to follow up to the mammoth success of FOTR, and decided to take the safe way out.  But what he may have failed to realise is that what made FOTR so great and popular was it's depth beyond your standard action flick.  In the wake of the downward spiral of the Star Wars films, which suffer from the same condition plauging the TT, movie fans were looking to latch on to a new fantasy epic, that could provide the great effects and all of that good stuff, but also deliver the goods in terms of story, charachter, and overall depth.<br/><br/>Complaints aside, this is still a fun movie.  For starters, you know that you enjoyed a movie when it clocks in at 3 hours long, and you don't find yourself getting restless, whcih I did not.  Additionally, The CGI is ultra-impressive, there are lots of incredible visuals (though not on par with the first film), and the action sequences are truly amazing.  I just came out dissappointed because one year ago, I went into the theatre to see FOTR not knowing what to expect, and I was given a completley unexpected masterpiece.  This time, I went into the TT expect to see another classic, and instead I was delivered a big-budget action flick.  Fun movie?  Yes. Great special effects? Yes.  Another classic?  No.<br/><br/>On a closing note, I think Roger Ebert's review of this movie hits the nail right on the head, and he is able to articulate many of the thoughts I have on this film very successfully."

","It is rare to find a sequal, even in a trilogy,that is as good as the first. Not only is the Two Towers a great sequal, it is better than the first one. Definatly worthy of a few Oscars.

"Starbuck-13","10","1","1","19 December 2002"," I could go on watching forever...
","This second part of the trilogy starts right in the middle of the action and goes on for over three hours without ever lowering the excitement. It ends a little bit sooner than the second book does - probably to offer Christopher Lee a chance to appear in the third part as well - and left me with only one notion: ""What? Is it over already???""<br/><br/>I watched the movie at midnight on opening day, and at three o'clock at night I was not one little bit tired. All I wanted was the movie to continue right now - but I guess we'll have to wait another year...<br/><br/>Compared to ""The Fellowship"", this movie has fewer epic moments (as Boromirs death, the Hobbits being hunted by the Nazgul or the forming of the fellowship) but is somehow told faster without focusing too much on action scenes alone. The shifting between the three different storylines (Rohan (Aragorn), Rohan (Merry/Pippin) and Mordor) makes the movie much more interesting than the book with its very rigid way of telling the story. This way, not a hint of boredom comes up, and the huge cast of characters has a chance to be shown in equal parts. Certainly, the story in Mordor was somehow kept shorter than it could have been, but Jackson had to cut somewhere and he did right by rather highlighting the events happening in Rohan.<br/><br/>As for Gollum: I would never have imagined that technology was thus far advanced! The facial impressions of Gollum were tremendous, at first I really was appalled about how ugly he was, but Jackson really captured the essence of Gollum and made him one of the most sophisticatedly portrayed characters of the film. An Oscar for Gollum? It's an opportunity!<br/><br/>Many of the other characters were developed further like Aragorn, Sam or Gimli whose comic relief elements were just right: Not too much, but certainly right on the mark! <br/><br/>The only thing I cannot really fathom right now is the way the Arwen character goes, how Eowyn fits in the picture compared to the books and why the Rohan storyline ended right after the Helms Deep battle instead of in Isengard. <br/><br/>Oh yes: And the attack on Helms Deep was great in the beginning and in the middle, but in the end - after the Rohirrim showed up - it seemed rather hastened, it ended too suddenly for my taste.<br/><br/>Not to mention the reality check when Aragorn and Gimli are fighting alone against hundreds of Orcs - but well, they are heroes after all, so who am I to criticize :-) ?"

","Watching ""The Two Towers"" is like watching the acts of three or four Shakespearean plays (the trippy ones like ""The Tempest"" and ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", as well as the histories, come easily to mind) collide in astonishing and unexpected ways.  The film begins with a powerfully audacious image:  Gandalf tumbling into the void to vanquish a demon after boldly telling him, ""You shall not pass!""  As quickly as you are in awe over the fantastical beauty of that image, you are drawn into the commitment that director Peter Jackson makes to make it real for you.  Because of his technical wizardry, you do accept it.<br/><br/>This happens over and over in ""The Two Towers"", regardless of what we're watching with childlike fascination:  the all-CGI character Gollum (who takes more definite shape and three-dimensionality than many of his human cohorts); a tree that lives, breathes, walks, talks, and transports two wayward hobbits; dream sequences that, unlike most in film, actually fit believably into the narrative and move the story forward in a useful way; the acrobatic derring-do of Legolas (my favorite character in the series); and an army of 10,000 menacing, single-minded meanies who are out to destr oy mankind in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>Like its successful predecessor, this film nicely balances grand scenes with quiet, up-close moments.  We are drawn into a struggle between good and evil on both an emotional and visceral level.  This is superb, classic cinematic artistry that will stand the test of time.  Only 364 days until the final chapter, ""The Return of the King"", hits theaters!"

","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Starring: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Brad Dourif, Sean Astin Rating: PG-13 Runtime: 2:59<br/><br/>
There are two types of people who will watch this movie: Those who read the books and wand to see the visions brought to life, and those who saw the first movie in the trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring) but haven't read the books (and perhaps don't plan to do so).<br/><br/>The latter group will be more receptive to The Two Towers than the former, because director Peter Jackson takes some major liberties with the plot. As most people are aware, there are three books (The Return of the King is the final in the trilogy). There are scenes in the second book that will appear in the third movie, and vice versa. This is perfectly reasonable, in my opinion, as it would be difficult - and perhaps not nearly as entertaining - to present the movies in exactly the same order as the books.<br/><br/>That said, there are some major plot deviations in The Two Towers, scenes and situations that appear in none of the books. If one has read the books, this can be quite disconcerting, as one might be expecting the movie to follow the basic plot of either The Two Towers book or The Return of the King book. If one hasn't read the books (but did see the first film in the trilogy), this might not be so disconcerting - one might not even notice a problem. So this isn't a complaint, exactly, as much as it's an observation.<br/><br/>The movie picks up right where the last one left off. Now, I'm going to assume here that people reading this have seen The Fellowship of the Ring. When that movie concluded, the original Fellowship had lost two (Boromir was slain by orcs after attempting to gain The One Ring, and Gandalf fell into the abyss beneath the mines of Moria), and the remaining seven were separated. Frodo, the Ringbearer, and his servant Sam have decided to continue their quest alone and are making their way to Mordor. Their fellow Hobbits Merry and Pippin have been kidnapped by those orcs that had slain Boromir; the orcs are under orders to capture alive any Halfling, since they don't know which one has The One Ring. Aragorn the Ranger, Gimli the Dwarf, and Leglolas the Elf are now tracking the horde of orcs, hoping to rescue Merry and Pippin.<br/><br/>The first movie clearly belonged to Frodo, who unlike most of his companions is slight, timid but fun-loving, hardly the hardy adventurer. He alone is entrusted to carry the eminently corrupting Ring to its demise in Mount Doom. But the second movie shifts focus to another character, one who was seen only very briefly in the first movie: Gollum. Gollum has a long history with the Ring, and he's now a complete slave to it. He wants it, his Precious, back in his possession. He joins up with Frodo and Sam to lead them to the Black Gate, the terrible entrance to Mordor itself, home of Sauron, the maker of the Ring (who desperately wants it back). Gollum likes Frodo, but he's plagued by split personalities; one side of him wants to help the Hobbits, the other side wants to kill them and eat them - and regain The Ring. It's interesting to note that Gollum, unlike the other major characters, is completely computer generated. This isn't all that new in and of itself, but it's Gollum's emotional expressions that make you think he's as real as the actors playing Frodo and Sam. In fact, director Jackson had Andy Serkis (who voices Gollum) act in the scenes with Sam and Frodo, then had him digitally removed and replaced with a computer-generated Gollum. The result is much more seamless than your run-of-the-mill computerized character.<br/><br/>But the story's not just about Frodo and his quest. Sauron knows the Ring's out there, and that a Halfling has it, but he has other matters to attend to. His goal is to wipe out mankind forever. That might be tough in today's world, but in Middle-Earth man was just gaining a foothold; elves and the like had ruled for eons. Saruman, as seen in the last movie, has been breeding legions and legions of superfighters, mutant orcs called Uruk-hai. The Uruk-hai are sent to attack the kingdom of Rohan, which has already been attacked from the inside through a silver-tongued advisor to the king, a Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). By casting a spell on the king, Theoden, Wormtongue is able to render him invalid; his kingdom is shortly weakened. Wormtongue is working for Saruman, who's working for Sauron (even though he thinks he's working for himself). In addition, the kingdom of Rohan has been set against that of Gondor, the other remaining Man kingdom. Together, they might be trouble for the Enemy; separate, they can be picked apart.<br/><br/>One of the most prolonged scenes in the movie is the battle at Helm's Deep. After being removed from his spell, Theoden takes his people there for shelter and safety, determined to fight, aided by Aragorn, Leglolas, and Gimli. The Uruk-hai, some ten thousand strong, attack. There have been many excellently staged epic battle scenes in cinematic history, but they all seem to pale to the extravagance and sheer power of this one. It's an awe-inspiring scene, guaranteed to make one cheer.<br/><br/>Now, as I said, there are some differences between the books and this movie. I don't mind if certain scenes or sequences are left out, because you can only cram so much into a three-hour movie. But when scenes appear in the movie that never appeared in any of the books, I have a problem. These books have been around for a long time, and it just seems foolhardy to add plot that doesn't need to be added, while at the same time omitting plot that seems necessary. I won't go into details here about what ""new"" scenes are in the movie that aren't in the books, but I was scratching my head after a few of them (and I had just reread The Two Towers a month or so ago).<br/><br/>There's even less attention paid to female characters this time around. Arwen, the Elvish beauty who had a thing for Aragorn in the first movie, is seen in dream sequences only - although this is indeed an important plot point, as it explains Aragorn's motivations a bit more lucidly. There's a new female character as well: Eowyn, the daughter of the Rohan king, who (surprise, surprise) also has a thing for Aragorn.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments as well, most of them involving Gimli the Dwarf, who appears to be along for comic relief - even more so than in Fellowship. This can, however, have the unintended consequence of marginalizing Gimli's character; after all, he's a strong, steadfast, and tough Dwarf, yet he's pigeonholed into a ""comic"" character. The chemistry between him and Leglolas the Elf is excellent, however.<br/><br/>One thing that we must all be thankful for is that the movie does shift away from Frodo himself. Elijah Wood continues to prove he's a terrible actor, incapable of expressing emotion adequately. As the story wears on, Frodo is supposed to get weaker and more beaten - although at times he can rouse himself to complete his quest. But Wood always has that scared look, that deer-caught-in-headlights look, the look that says, ""Why am I here with these actors?"" The performance is flat and ineffectual. And although the focus of the movie as a whole does shift away from Frodo, because his scenes basically involve just him, Sam, and Gollum, Wood's inadequacies are that much more accentuated. Luckily, these scenes are dwarfed (pardon the pun) by the battle scenes.<br/><br/>It's never easy to make the middle movie in a trilogy - you want to build on the first movie and lead to the third. Remember Back to the Future II? Wasn't quite as charming as the first one or as action-packed as the third one. It was just kind of there. The Two Towers suffers this indignity, to an extent. Unlike the first one, there's no opening narration that gets everyone up to speed, and like the first one, this one just sort of .... ends. And not necessarily in the same manner as the second book did, either.<br/><br/>
This movie isn't as good as The Fellowsip of the Ring, but it's still very, very good. I'm giving it three-and-a-half stars out of four, but bear in mind it was a tough three and a half to get. It's not as bad as a three-star movie, but it's not quite the masterpiece of the first movie, either."
"Sinnerman","10","1","1","18 December 2002"," I'm tired. And I'm not alone.
","This is it. <br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" has just opened. One can foresee the after-viewing thoughts and debates to explode any time now. At the threshold of this taste-variant blood bath, all I can say is, let it be...<br/><br/>I have seen and since loved that seminal opening chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Like that much loved film, I do not judge ""The Two Towers"" as a stand-alone movie with flaws for nitpicking. I look upon it as a further unveiling of Peter Jackson's LOTR mythology, his visionary adaptation from book to screen. But that's just my take and my take alone...all are free to disagree with this humble reviewer as I'm not a believer in ""taste-dictatorship"". <br/><br/>Notice I stated Peter Jackson's and not Tolkien's LOTR. With all due respect for JRR Tolkien (and the wrath of his literary groupies), I think that LOTR should by now be just as much a labour of love for Jackson as it once was for Tolkien. Judged as work of art in another artistic medium (film), what Jackson has achieved, is in my humble opinion, a masterpiece in its own right. <br/><br/>Dissenters of LOTR movies, we know who you are. In an ideal world, we will respect each other for the movies we like, the faith we practice and the lives we lead. But in reality, nothing is as black and white as middle-earth. For good or evil, I have thus come to terms with the spectrum of people's reaction to this much debated film series. I will thus accept in grace the searing attacks or equally gushing compliments TTT will likely garner in the days and weeks ahead. <br/><br/>I have nothing more to add on my present state of mind. That I love the LORD OF THE RINGS movies, is but a given. That I am now taking the higher road of no more bickering is my choice. A choice which I pray I will have the strength to honour. Consider that my leap of faith. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the story is far from over. Like Gandalf's famous last words in TTT (the movie), ""The battle for Helm's Deep may be over, but the battle for Middle Earth has just begun..."" Till then, I shall breathe, while I wait for ""The Return of the King""...peace and out."

","This is a worthy sequel as I enjoyed myself as much as with part 1.  I still haven't read any of the books, but I have to say that the story and plot twists develop in a way I could never have imagined.  Some of it was even reminiscent of 'Throne of Blood' (Kurosawa, 1957) which was of course a brilliant adaptation of MacBeth.  See that film to figure out which parts I mean plz.<br/><br/>The art direction is of course still great as they shot the movie together with part 1 and 3.  Here the CGI has become fingerlicking good: Gollum puts Jar Jar Binks AND Yoda to shame!<br/><br/>Let's wait for part 3 to drop some concluding remarks about this trilogy. For now it feels great to experience the premieres of these movies and be a part of the hype as well, I might add.    The videogame should be Everquest I guess (never played it though).  WingNut rules (and Orlando Bloom can surf!): as far as I'm concerned this gets the same rating as part 1."

","I happened to be one of the luckier people out there. My school, La Salle University, was giving away passes to an advanced screening here in Philadelphia. This was free, so I can't say I got my money's worth. Instead, I was repaid GRACIOUSLY for trekking down to the theater. (A harrowing experience in the snow.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I want to keep this brief.  I have to give props to the animation department for their very accurate emulation of human movement on Gollum. He interacts with the characters and environment so fluidly, so amazingly, I forgot instantly that he was digital at all. Gollum's movements are scary and unnerving... and scarily accurate to the book's telling of Gollum's conduct.<br/><br/> You think the environments in FOTR were good? Put it aside. Helm's Deep is ridiculously beautiful. As an artist, I've come to appreciate environment, but the scenery on and around Helm's Deep are so stunning it took me forever to soak it all in. I woke up the next morning and I was still commenting to myself on the power of this scenery.<br/><br/> Talk about epic. This movie outdoes itself. If you had any quavering doubts about the direction of the series after watching FOTR, give TT a chance... the sheer power of this movie is overwhelming.<br/><br/>Legolas fans get more insane stunts, and Gimli fans get the best lines in the movie.

","I saw TTT at the world premiere on December 5, and I'm STILL excited.  If they had strung the film up again after the end credits played, I would have watched it straight through again.  I would have watched another hour of story if it had been offered.  It was just shy of 3 hours long and it never felt too long.  I've gone so far as to purchase the extended version of FotR so I can memorize it since I can't get my TTT fix until the end of this week.<br/><br/>It is fantastic.  The film escalates in action, tension, and dread, and rightly so considering it's place in the novel.<br/><br/>Several details are changed in order to compress the events of the book into the film.  Several events and details are also changed or added to develop character.  There are no gratuitous changes in this film.  Even if I don't necessarily agree with the need for such and such changes, I have to admit that they add depth to the FILM version of the story, especially for persons unfamiliar with the novel.  Characters that are a little flat and predictable in the novel are given more psychological texture and motivation.  Good guys who are 'too' good in the book are a little uneven in the film; they take some time to work out their issues instead of instantly being perfect.  This was done in FotR as well in the characterization of Aragorn, and it continues in TTT with more of the characters.<br/><br/>Do not expect this film to mirror the book precisely.  If you had a moment of shock and horror when Glorfindel was reinterpreted into Arwen, you will have similar moments with TTT.  But, trust me and just go with them.  So much happens in every scene that you'll miss something if you stop to think about divergences.  I can't wait for the extended version of this one, as certain underdeveloped details will undoubtedly be cleared up in a *gasp* longer version.<br/><br/>And, of course, it is gorgeous to look at.<br/><br/>And here is one massive (sort of) SPOILER for fans of the book.<br/><br/>If you have read the books and know where TTT ends, the film doesn't end in the same place.  It ends earlier, and we don't get to Shelob.  She is only hinted at.  Of course, if they had put her in, the film would have been an hour longer...."

","As difficult a feat as that might seem, Jackson delivers an even better film than The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is the grandest spectacle that has ever graced the screen. As near-perfect as a film can possibly get, no longer comparable to other genre pictures, but to the great classics of the art.<br/><br/>The sheer scope of The Two Towers makes its predecessor look like an idle stroll in the park. It starts with a bang and doesn't quit for the whole three hours of its duration. And like in the first part, Jackson doesn't fall victim to all the eye candy (and there's more than plenty), he injects the endeavour with a sense of humanity and gravitas that transcends fantasy film-making. <br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest surprise is Gollum, a CGI creation that is guaranteed to make your jaw drop. Acted by Andy Serkis and replaced in the final version by a marvelous computer creation by Wetta Digital (surpassing all previous digital characters by miles), he delivers the best performance in the movie. Dynamic, incredibly expressive and ultimately conveying a sense of real pity for the character. And that's no small achievement in a film filled with actors of this calibre. <br/><br/>It all concludes with what is probably the best medieval battle scene ever shown and will leave you with a hunger for more.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is what film's all about. A true masterpiece. And we still have one more film before the trilogy is completed."

In the movie, he resembles his brother, not the cool, contemplative scholar/soldier nor the shadow of Aragorn as he was well delineated as being in the book.<br/><br/>Though Gimli provides some much enriching comic relief; by the end of the film, you get the feeling that he is used solely for comic relief.<br/><br/>Sure, all the visual craft is there.

","This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10"
"fedor8","Null","3","6","6 August 2007"," Spielberg's version would have been... unbearable...
","As in the new Star Wars trilogy, I have to say: thank God no high-profile a****** actors were hired to ruin this for me. The newcomers to the trilogy vary from good to terrific; importantly, Miranda Otto is attractive if a bit flat-chested (but, okay, this isn't an erotic thriller), and Karl Urban is the stand-out in TT. This time Wood has more interesting scenes as Frodo, and as a result he gets to show more. McKellen doesn't appear much, but when he does he dominates, like in ""FOTR"". Mortenssen also shows a slight improvement. Only Tyler, our three-meter MTV airhead adds nothing to the movie. In the ""TT"" book she doesn't even appear at all, but Jackson wanted to make that extra $100 million dollars from the female movie-goers so he had some pointless romantic scenes thrown in which probably have Tolkien - if not spinning - than at least shaking his head in his grave. In fact, the non-book, added ""Hollywood scenes"" are in contrast to the rest of the movie: the dialog is weaker, the tension isn't there, etc. But these 5-10 minutes objectively constitute the sole drawback in an otherwise near-perfect movie. And to be fair - they aren't exactly dull or bad.<br/><br/>Let's not forget that had Spielberg done the trilogy there would have been incomparably more tampering with the original text, and the sentimentality and pathos would be oozing out of every pore of the movie. Spielberg the Movie Mo-Ghoul played with the idea of filming the trilogy and it gives me great satisfaction to know that he was none too happy when Jackson showed interest in it and started making the first preparations. Not to mention that Jackson actually got off his a** and actually DID this monumental saga. Spielberg was seething with jealousy. I could sense it across the ocean. There is something in the transatlantic breeze that smells of Spielberg's fuming.<br/><br/>In fact, this is how the trilogy would have been had Spielberg the Uncrowned God of Hollywood done it: 1) cast: Tom Hanks as Aragorn * Tom Cruise as Borimir * Macauley Culkin as Frodo * Culkin's fat brother (Keeran?) as Samwise * Laura Dern (with black hair) as Arwen * Denzel Washington as Gandalf (a nice PC touch, having a black man be the wisest of them all) * Paul Newman as Saruman * Kiefer Sutherland as Wormtongue * two Asian kids as Mary and Pippen (probably two of Spielberg's own adopted brood) * Danny de Vito as Gimli (without the make-up, and even more wise-cracking) * Di Crapio as an ultra feminine-looking Legolas * Laura Dern (playing two roles) as a Galadria one would want to vomit on * Christian Slater as a Faramir who can't say his ""s"" properly * Warren Beatty, looking as dumb as ever, as Theoden * John Travolta as a highly animated Lord Denethor * Drew Barrymore as Eowyn * Ashton Kutcher as Eomer. Gollum would probably be animated so as to be cute, cuddly and with big, wide Pocahontas eyes, plus a girl's voice (probably Winona Ryder's) and all evil would have been scripted out of him. Treebeard would look very little like a true; it would be Robin Williams with two vaguely treeish legs dangling at the bottom. He wouldn't talk slow, like all Ents, but quickly with plenty of one-liners.<br/><br/>There would be none of that wonderful dark-blue/green look; even Saruman's tower would be pink/red and with flowers surrounding it instead of trees. The Ents wouldn't have deep voices but would sound like a bunch of old women (like Python's pepper-pots); the ecological message would have been so exaggerated that the Ents would be shown in a brief sequence holding anti-Exxon, anti-globalism, anti-pollution banners in front of Saruman's Isengard. (Saruman would then come out on the terrace and tell the Ents that he refuses to sign the Kyoto Treaty.) Galadria would have a half-hobbit half-sister sidekick, played by Cameron Diaz, and Frodo would fall in love with her and suffer deeply when she gets captured by Orcs (in Peter Greenaway's version the Orcs would torture her, rape her, then kill her and eat her, while reciting Japanese poetry). Tom Bombadil would have been not only included in the movie but turned into a main character, singing Elton John and Phil Collins soundtrack songs while spreading thinly disguised pacifism and left-wing ideology; needless to say, he'd be played by Collins or John. One of the main characters would be homosexual. How about Boromir? No, Boromir is a bit susceptible to evil and as we all know all homosexuals are nice people and not at all the type to try to steal the Ring of Power from Frodo. Aragorn? No, for he loves Arwen and we can't have him kissing Faramir because the gay community would be offended by a ""bisexual"" gay. Bilbo, perhaps, as the childless uncle of Frodo? Right. Bilbo would have an elvish boyfriend in Edoras, which would hit two flies with one stroke: this would act both as support for gays and for interracial relationships. In fact, it would even be hinted that Bilbo had a brief romance with Elrond (in his ""Hobbit"" period) and that Arwen even encourages her father to renew his old affair with Bilbo, now that Bilbo's come back. (There would be a touching scene in which Arwen comforts her sobbing father to forgive Bilbo for breaking his heart 50 years earlier.) But for Spielberg, two love affairs wouldn't be enough; the hobbits must also have their love-interests. Merry would fall in love with a female Orc (signifying that no species/race is so evil that it is beyond redemption), named Orcana, who would aid the Fellowship in their adventures. Orcana's female cousin - Urukhaia - would fall in love with Pippen, etc."
"Subcat","1","6","16","18 December 2002"," ""Like butter stretched over too much bread""
","Yesterday, I saw ""The Two Towers"" and have to say that I am very disappointed. Even for someone who is not exactly a fan of Tolkien's world or the fantasy genre, the ""Fellowship of the Ring"" stood way beyond this sequel. A massive storyline and an excellent dramaturge concept made the first part appear smooth as silk. Chapters like ""The Treason of Isengard"" or ""The Bridge of Khazad Dum"" will always be remembered throughout the movie community and have set a new standard in this genre of film.<br/><br/>Now, ""The two Towers"" has literally NO plot, it seems that director Peter Jackson didn't have a clue about how he should start, unfold and end the story of this second part of the trilogy. Somehow, it now seems hard to believe that he was in charge of the first part... The sequence of Frodo and his fellows crossing the Marches, the exaggerated focus on the creature Gollum and tons of splatter-UrukHai-sequences are all a strange reminder of his previous movies Braindead or The Frighteners. The film reveals its entire structural weakness just by the fact that Pippin and Merry appear throughout the movie in one Neverending Story-like sequence which was mainly used as editing material.<br/><br/>The only impressive point so far is Howard Shore's incredible soundtrack on CD (even better than the first one!) and not so much in the film, where it was poorly used - amazing tracks like ""The Forbidden Pool"", ""Breath of Life"" or ""Evenstar"" are played in slapstick-like Gollum & Aragon scenes! Neither the old nor the newly introduced characters did have a chance to unfold properly. To put it in Bilbo's words: ""Like butter stretched over too much bread""."

The high rating here is baffling...until you see that there are millions of people who also think ""Attack of the Clones"" is a good film.  Fans will accept the worst if it has the name Lord of the Rings or Star Wars attached to it.  I thought the first film was weak--but the extended edition on DVD was truly beautiful.

","I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. <br/><br/>When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"Hunthor","3","5","15","22 August 2003"," More great images - more clumsy storytelling
","Review applies to both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers.<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers are visually impressive films having wonderful sets, costumes and make-up.  The computer-generated effects are generally effective and occasionally wonderful, even awe-inspiring. However both films are boring.  The vivid and well-realised images on the screen are not sufficient compensation for the very poor story-telling.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson can justly take credit for the feat of organising and being responsible for an apparently huge undertaking in getting support for three ambitious, expensive films and then making them on an apparently epic scale.  The art direction is wonderful and he has gathered some great teams about him that convincingly bring Tolkien's Middle-Earth to the cinema. Not least, it must be a feat to be entrusted with millions of dollars and keep all those film executives at bay whilst one gets on with the job.<br/><br/>That said, the storytelling is inept.  Jackson shares the writing credits with two others and they take great liberties with Tolkien's story. This might have been all right if they had made the story better or more suitable for the medium of film, but the changes are not very good and they are badly handled.  The screenplay also misses much of the wit and interest of Tolkien's work.  It also lacks the drama and tension.<br/><br/>Even when considered as a film independent of Tolkien's tale, the story-telling is very poor.  This is a director who relies on vivid imagery and hasn't much of an idea as to what makes a decent script.  Many of the exchanges between characters are extremely limited; there is nothing deep or profound.  Every now and again some of Tolkien's dialogue appears (easy to spot because they're the good bits) but Jackson and Co. appear to have cut and pasted such sections into their script without much care as to whether it comfortably fits into the stuff they have written.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is no accident therefore that the film has not attracted true film stars to play the major roles.  This is a B-movie cast to go with a B-movie script.  That's not to say that some of the actors aren't good: Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Sean Bean give good performances, but one suspects that with a decent script the film series would have been attractive to star actors to take the lead roles.  Sometimes the casting of virtually unknown actors can pay off but I'm afraid that they aren't really given much to work on and thus little chance to show what they can do.<br/><br/>I don't think that Peter Jackson's direction helps his actors much.  This is not a director with a great range, and things such as subtlety lie outside it.  Nor do I think he rates the intelligence and comprehension of the audience very highly.  Everything is thrust into the viewer's face. Nothing lurks menacingly just out of sight, nothing is merely glimpsed or suspected, no tension is built up: bad things or monsters just appear - ""bam!"".  Slow motion, backlighting (at night and in the wilderness) and extreme close-ups are laid on thickly.  The lighting is artificial and the editing is very careless and disjointed.<br/><br/>(This is an occasion where the medium of DVD may really be useful.  The good thing about DVD is that people will be able to choose the sections they wish to watch and will thus be able to oogle over the wonderful set-pieces as often as they like without having to suffer the tedious parts.)<br/><br/>I shouldn't really be bothered going on about all this as it's just a film, but I think that undeserved kudos and plaudits are being heaped on Peter Jackson (not to mention tons of money).  What is more, studios will may be further encouraged to think that a decent script is unimportant for a good film.<br/><br/>The fact that quite a number of people rave about this film means that the money and effort used to make it were not entirely wasted.  (I suspect that they were so impressed by the imagery and the grand theme that they have been able to overlook the films' serious shortcomings.)  The sad thing is that a first-rate production was let down by a bad script and clumsy direction.  It deserved better."

","OK - since the movie is definately NOT the Two Towers (outside of the same character names and the fact there is a ring involved), the movie really needs to be seen without the Tolkien fanatics with rose-colour glasses. The movie STUNK! The acting was sub-standard (Gandalf 'fighting' with Saruman through Theoden was hysterically bad!). The plot was only loosely put together - actions of characters seem to come from nowhere (Merry standing up to Fangorn, Samwise's preaching, Aragorn's 'issues'). The actions of the characters were just bad, the fighting scenes - although spectacular in vision, were just sadly portrayed (Aragorn and Gimli 'jumping' into the middle of dozens of orcs and not getting scratched, horses ridding into the middle of 10,000 orcs and not one of the orcs seems capable of killing the horses, horses riding into 'swiss pikes' and not getting a scratch?????)<br/><br/>on the good side - the cinematography was PHENOMINAL; the CGI is some of the best in movies today (you could barely tell gollum was not real); the orcs siege warfare was historically accurate (the use of ladders with people on them; the breaching of the walls; the use of the rams and it's security - very well done).<br/><br/>Overall - movie 1/10; visual and historical 10/10 (but final rating must still be 1/10 - just a poorly done story)."
"Tyson14","10","2","4","27 December 2014"," something worth fighting for
","Peter Jackson has done what could not be done. Deemed unfilmable for decades (with the terrible cartoons as an example of why), ""The Lord of the Rings"" took the audiences by storm when ""Fellowship of the Ring"" premiered in 2001. In 2002, anticipation was even higher, dread was lower -- and ""Two Towers"" is an outstanding continuation of the epic fantasy tale. The movie picks up where ""Fellowship"" left off: Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are pursuing them. But they are sidetracked by an old friend: Gandalf, returned in a new form and with new powers, as Gandalf the White. He takes them to the kingdom of Rohan, whose king is bewitched by the evil Saruman. They barricade the people of Rohan in the fortress of Helm's Deep, for a final defiant stand against an army of Uruk-hai. Sam and Frodo have left, to venture into Mordor alone so that Frodo can destroy the Ring in Mordor's Mount Doom. When the two hobbits become lost in Emyn Muil, Frodo realizes that someone is following them: Gollum, the tormented, twisted former owner of the Ring. They capture Gollum, who swears to serve ""the master of the Precious."" But even Gollum's shaky allegiance isn't enough for them to succeed, because the Ring has started to bend Frodo to its will. While the first movie revolved around Frodo, the Ring and the Fellowship, here the focus widens. We get a better sense of the epic quality of the story and how it affects the whole world, not just our heroes. Gondor is crumbling, Rohan is beaten down by orcs, and even the forces of nature -- the tree-like ents -- are being attacked by Sauron and Saruman. It's nature versus the destructive machines, and the wild wrecking of Saruman's forges by these ancient tree shepherds is something to cheer for. Elijah Wood blossoms in this film as Frodo Baggins, the little hobbit who could. In the first movie Wood played Frodo as an innocent who loses his innocence; here he takes it a step further, showing the darkness and violence that are swallowing Frodo up. Because we saw what a bright, sweet person Frodo was before, it's all the more horrible to see him starting to slide down (even attacking his best friend -- the look on Frodo's face as he comes to his senses is stunning). Sean Astin perfectly embodies Sam Gamgee -- increasingly desperate, trying to keep Frodo from going under. He serves as a reminder of what Frodo is fighting for, and Astin has perhaps the most powerful lines of the film, near the end: ""But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer."" These simply-worded lines will bring tears to your eyes. But if Frodo is just starting to be addicted, Gollum is a junkie. Even if Andy Serkis doesn't appear in one frame in the entire movie, his motions and voice are heard and seen behind an exquisitely detailed CGI puppet. This is no Jar Jar or Dobby -- Gollum is detailed down to the last hair and wrinkle, believable in his appearance (I actually forgot he was animated for most of the movie), and has a multifaceted personality that reflects his own inner struggle -- Smeagol and Gollum, good and evil. The scene where Gollum's two halves argue is too amazing for words. The other supporting actors shine almost as brightly. Viggo Mortensen turns his reluctant hero Aragorn into a leader and a warrior. Ian McKellen manages to make Gandalf more stately and majestic, yet keeps that little grandfatherly twinkle. John Rhys-Davies provides a bit of comedy as Gimli, mostly related to Gimli's stature, but never loses his dignity; Orlando Bloom is outstanding as ethereal elf archer Legolas once again. Liv Tyler captures Arwen's fear of mortality and loneliness. Billy Boyd's Pippin and Dominic Monaghan's Merry, the well-meaning goofballs of ""Fellowship,"" are now forced to make their own decisions. And new cast members Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill also shine as the strong-willed Eowyn and tough old king Theoden, in roles that will bloom further in the third film. Peter Jackson (who makes a few cameos) once again outdoes himself with camera-work and direction. His cameras as like living things: they swoop, dive, pull back for outstanding combat shots and then zoom in for exquisite close-ups. The battle scenes are dark, bloody, explosive, and full of chaos; only near the finale does any hint of glory shine through. He adds little human touches (the family split up by the war) that give a glimpse of what the non-heroic, ordinary people are suffering. Of course ""Two Towers"" isn't as good as the book. Few movies are. But taken purely as a cinematic experience, and an adaptation, ""Two Towers"" is virtually without peer. Epic, majestic, action-packed and brimming with pathos, this is a treasure."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","2","4","30 August 2014"," The most epic story of all time lives on in a groundbreaking sequel.
","""The Lord of the Rings"" lives on and continues the story in a way that helps us understand our unique characters and Middle Earth and to better appreciate the story. ""The Two Towers"" is the second out of three ""Lord of the Rings"" masterpieces coming after ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and prior to ""The Return of the King"" the best out of the three. ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" brought us into the core story of two hobbits, Frodo and Sam who are to destroy the evil ring of Saroun and vanquish evil in Mordor. Frodo and Sam are continuing their path into Mordor to destroy the ring with the help of a very different creature named Gollum who was cursed by the ring and knows the path to Mordor. This causes tension between Frodo and Sam before they get caught up in their most challenging path yet. Arragorn, Legolas and Gimley encounter the soldiers of Rohan after searching for Pipen and Marry after they were captured by Saruman's orcs. They enter Rohan and help the poisoned King Theoden help his people from danger with the assistance of an old friend. Pipen and Marry escaped into a lush forest home to tree creatures who have been victims of Saruman as well. All these magical stories come crashing down into intense battles, heart-warming character encounters, beautiful friendhsip, bravery and more. ""The Two Towers"" is a much more entertaining film than we have seen in recent years. We already have the main plot covered from the first film, so now director Peter Jackson takes us into Middle Earth in a more uncharted and rugged way. We meet the kingdom of Rohan and see them fight in an epic battle between Saruman's menacing orcs after we already get frequent action sequences prior. There are also many new characters we meet that all provide something to the plot. They are not just there to make the story have more conflict, but rather they serve a vital purpose into this epic plot. The new creatures we see are so shocking when we finally see them. Walking and talking trees, dragons, gollum, Uruk-hai orcs and more. Peter Jackson worked extremely hard on making every element plausible and magnificent in order to bring Tolkien's pages to life. He uses vivid camera work with either extreme beauty or ominous vibes. The visual effects are the stuff film schools will look at and read about hundreds of years from now where the editing and cinematography is second to none. This isn't only a genius story brought back to life in a magnificent way but a visual phenomenon that cannot be missed. ""The Lord of the Rings"" are three stories we have to experience sometime in your life. Cinema is by far the best way to do so and with ""The Two Towers"" your able to experience an even more far side of Middle earth like you couldn't imagine."

"ebossert","4","2","4","7 June 2013"," Fellowship was good. Two Towers was not good.
","Here are my point by point thoughts on Two Towers.<br/><br/>--Right from the start, this film opens with a sequence more cartoonish than anything in Fellowship. It later provides a shoddy rationalization to bring Gandalf back from the dead. I feel that this trivializes his death in Fellowship, which was one of the more effectively dramatic moments in that film. I guess an apparent death results in one's return as a ""whiter"" version of oneself. Gandalf struts around like nothing happened. Also, when someone says that they were ""sent back"" from heaven ""until my task is completed"", I get the impression that they are borderline invincible. This diminishes any sense of danger in the storyline for this character, and also diminishes the theme of death in the film overall.<br/><br/>--Another problem I have is with Gollum, who is annoying as soon as he appears. I suppose that's a personal gripe, but his mannerisms are rather obnoxious and hammy. He's practically unwatchable. His character is also a substandard attempt at writing a character with fake complexity. Gollum shifts between evil jerk and loyal nutcase. That's about it. One understands the character completely the moment his split personalities present themselves. Unfortunately, this shift in personality is repeatedly hammered into the viewer's brain. Yes, we got it the first time it was shown. Simply shifting between two thin personalities dozens of times does not create character depth or complexity. Also, was there ever a question that his evil jerk personality would ultimately emerge as the dominant one? At no point during these films did I think that he would choose NOT to steal the ring (even for a second), and I didn't even read the books. His inner conflict feels meaningless and superfluous to me.<br/><br/>--The drab visuals make for some tedious viewing. Everything is gray. The environments are gray. The skies are gray. The bad guys are gray. Gollum is gray. The orcs are gray. The weapons are gray. The buildings are gray. The color scheme is way too monotonous and repetitive.<br/><br/>--The stifling effects of the ring were already established by the end of Fellowship. We saw the effects of the ring on a variety of characters, so it's certainly frustrating that Two Towers continues to harp on this subject without further elaboration or complexity. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum basically just walk through gray environments for 3 hours while complaining about the ring's effects. We already spent 3 hours in Fellowship explaining this issue, and Two Towers brings nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>--It's rarely mentioned, but this movie has one-dimensional, boring antagonists. We get very little time with any of them, and none of them are memorable. They're just generic caricatures to be ""fought against"" as necessary. There are standard bad guys that show up all over the place, like those big cartoon hyenas near the midpoint and the giant army near the end. A few memorable bad guys and some development would have made things a lot more engaging.<br/><br/>--That leads us to the action, which has some uninspired choreography. The flaw of generic bad guys can be partially mitigated when the protagonists break out some awesome maneuvers or strategies. Very little of this appears in this movie. We mostly get basic sword swipes, arrow shots, and riding horses directly into swarms of baddies. You'd think that Helm's Deep would have some traps and attack strategies for whittling the enemy down as they approach the fortress, but such is not the case - thereby wasting an opportunity for some creative attacks. At one point it seemingly points to Aragorn and Gimli having some kind of plan, but Aragorn just throws Gimli into a swarm of hundreds of baddies. To be fair, there are a few good moments to be had near the end (e.g., the bomb, the giant ladders, etc.), but that's not saying much when one realizes that the battle lasts over 30 minutes.<br/><br/>--The CGI is exposed more here than in Fellowship, with some particularly cartoonish moments (like the opening sequence, the big hyenas, etc.).<br/><br/>--What is it, exactly, that the characters accomplish during the first two hours of this movie? Aragorn helps Gandalf cure a king, then he sits around and talks. It's also ironic that Gandalf is brought back from the dead, then given almost nothing to do. He spends much of the film off screen as he rides his horse to find reinforcements, a task that almost any other character could have completed. Meanwhile, the elves sit around and talk, mostly about stuff we already know. The humans sit around and talk, mostly about fighting but there's no discussion regarding battle strategy other than where they want to fight. They also walk around and put on armor. Merry and Pippin talk to a tree that takes forever to form sentences. I tell you, this movie is very difficult to sit through. <br/><br/>--This movie also introduces one of the more unconvincing love triangles in cinematic history. Aragorn, Arwen, and that other chick. Why even bother having romance in this movie at all if you're not going to spend time on it, develop it, or make it important? Aragorn and Arwen have a brief discussion or two, then make-out. That's it. Also, Liv Tyler can't act.<br/><br/>--One point that is related to Galdalf's contrived resurrection is this: there are various fake deaths of characters in this movie. Pippin and Aragorn are given ""possible deaths"", but the filmmakers (and/or original novelist) obviously don't want to kill off a main character. Of course, they do kill a random elf dude in an unwarranted moment of overdramatism. I'm not sure why I'm supposed to feel sorry for a guy that had a grand total of 30 seconds of screen time before his death.<br/><br/>--Also, the wizardry in this film is not creative. There's not much in terms of spellcasting."
"Saucedafamily","10","2","4","3 October 2007"," A trilogy with performances that will always be remembered
","I remember the first day I saw the first Lord of the Rings. I was seven. I was so captivated by the performances!! I fell in love with all these new actors I've either heard of, or never knew them. I loved it so much, I watch all of them 1,2, and 3!!! I never seem to get enough, it's like every time I watch one of the Lord of the Rings movies, it's a whole knew adventure. This was the first trilogy to see with strictly my dad and brother. That was our thing, we even went to see the Harry Potter trilogy but it's not finished of course. But anyway the three of us went to see the second one, Two Towers. Once the movie started we couldn't of been more thrilled!!(Im so glad I saw all of them on the big screen!!) All of our actors were great and the theatre was so loud! All of a sudden this creature named gollom comes down this mountain above frodo and sam... I don't think I had been so creeped out by this hideous thing, I even remember leaning against my father! I cant ever forget all of them! Elijah wood (frodo) Sean Astin (sam) Viggo Mortensin (Arigon) Orlando Bloom (Leagolas) John Rhys Davies (gimli and Treebeard) Ein Mkellen (Gandalf the Grey/white) Christopher Lee (sarumon)Billy Boyd (pippen)Cate Blanchett (galadriel)Liv Tyler (Arwen) Hugo Weaving (elrond)Dominic Monaghan (Merry)Miranda Otto (Eowyn)Bernard Hill (theoden)I loved all of them but I just think... personally The One actor who blew me away with his performance and worked soo hard for the film.... the one and only Andy Serkis. I don't understand why just because it was CGI that he couldn't get an academy for best actor... it gives me chills that he came that close to getting it!!! And yet he works so hard all those expressions and body movement are his.... that voice,HIS!!!!!!!!! For those who commented that they were surprised to see him act well out of the CGI well in order to do CGI you have to be a good acter with good expressions. Smeagal was him!!! cant you see that!!? Well, everyone was brilliant, great job Peter, a trilogy that will be remembered in movie cinema forever."
"denis888","10","2","4","7 September 2007"," Smashing Second Film
","Well, many people say that the Two Towers part is the most boring or very slow. The beginning and the first 40 minutes tend to drag a bit, but then, when the Treebeard appears, it never gets dull. The bloody duel between Saruman and Theoden is the central part here, and again, we witness the visible sufferings of Frodo and Sam on their deadly mission. Well, then there is a huge, really breathtaking Helm's End battle. This siege is probably the best I ever saw or maybe will ever see. The tension is huge, and when the noble Elves die you want to cry, so sweet, so light, so sacred they seem there, among the ruins, blood, smoke and death. Aragorn, Grima, Pippin and Merry, Eowin and Eomer all appear and they all are so real, so flesh and blood that again, no doubt ever dwells in you that there might be a moment that they never existed. The scene of Isengard ruin is so grand that may overshadow many others, especially when the river starts to flow and crash the evil fortress away. It is a pity that some things were omitted in the film, but then, even 3 hours could not get all Tolkien created. Big respect goes to Mr. Lee for his absolutely precise portrayal of evil Saruman The White."
"djaiv","3","2","4","20 April 2007"," I'll review all three at once...
","I love J.R.R.Tolkien. I've read the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit...hmmm...at least 100 times. Honestly. From the time I was 7 years old, these have been my favorite books. And all his other writings. Heck, I even speak three dialects of Elvish and can write in dwarf runes and the runes of Daeron.... I'm a big Tolkien geek.<br/><br/>And I understand that these books are impossible to adapt completely to film. But c'mon! Make an effort! These are beautifully shot, though filled with lots of CGI (which I detest). Beautiful scenery, able direction and OK acting. You would think I could give it at least 5 stars. I can't, and here's why: Don't make stuff up. Really. Whoever wrote this screen play is a servant of Sauron. What's with all the invention? It's a fantasy FILLED with fabulous work. Tolkien was a master storyteller. This screenwriter (unless there were several, in which case much is made clear. Nothing good ever comes from committee) really needed to leave well enough alone."
"Miqque","10","2","4","6 August 2006"," Best of 3!
","Having followed the entire production from green-light, I was entirely pleased with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. However, I did prefer the extended versions on DVD, with the voice-over commentaries and all. The shorter theatrical version of THE TWO TOWERS holds a very special place as perhaps the most exciting film ever made. True, it is not 100% accurate to the novel. It stands on its own. Theoden's speeches, the lighting used, the great Warg battle, and of course Gollum working as well as he did all contributed to an eminently satisfying experience. Every actor has taken their role and made it completely their own. The spectacular sets, particularly those of Isengard, blend so well with the natural beauty of New Zealand to provide both eye candy and attention to the fine details of model-making. The dramatic changes of scene to the approach to Mordor are dynamic. And Brad Dourif gives yet another creepy performance, being one of the finest living actors who has carved out his own niche. Perhaps this is a bit violent for younger children, but once they turn ten or so they will likely eat this up with a spoon. Never does the gore overwhelm, nor do the spectacular effects dominate the intricate story. Great stuff!"
"Hitchcoc","9","2","4","16 March 2006"," It's the middle child of the movie.
","This is the war. This is the necessary part of the film to set up the finale. Because it's the middle child, it doesn't get the attention or respect. Once one has all three films in hand, he can begin to view them as a single entity. Still they are considered to be separate. The arising of the Gollum. The series of battles that make up this film are so incredible. Though made at the same time, the tales gain the advantage of advances in production techniques and graphics. There is not much exposition here, though new characters are made available to us. It is rather to get from point A to point B and make way for the final book. The rocky relationship between Frodo and Sam continues, Frodo fixated on the ring and all that it implies. Then there are the magnificent battle scenes with the unlikeliest of creatures forming alliances. I read reviews by people who are so into these books that they nitpick over every aberration from the original works. This is a movie. It's accessible to anyone, including those who will never make their way through the novel. The novels aren't for everyone. They are filled with long introspective meanderings and a good deal of poetry (hardly any of which is in any of the three films). Like with Trekkies, it's hard to talk with these people because of the obsessiveness about a single piece of literature--the betrayal they feel. Just enjoy what Peter Jackson was able to do. It will live forever in film history."
"MovieLoonie","2","2","4","18 October 2005"," walking and more walking
","This is about one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I suppose if you read the book, you might be able to enjoy it, referencing back to characters thoughts and emotions etc. But for those of us who didn't read the book, it was a bunch of scenes of people walking. A wide shot of people walking. A close up of people walking. and not much else happening. I'm trying to figure out why everyone in these books has two names. (As if the plot isn't complicated enough for those of us who haven't read the book.) The only redeeming thing in the whole movie is that goblin thing that calls the ring 'precious'. (even he has two names) Hence I gave it a two, instead of a one. Sure the special effects were great. But great special effects does not mean the movie is great. I liked the first LOTR movie, quite a bit more than I expected, actually. I would rate that one much higher. But as a follow up this one was a disappointment. So much so that I didn't bother to see the third one. Thats how boring I thought 'The two towers' was."
"PigeonsAreTasty","7","2","4","1 December 2003"," A great movie for the eyes, not the mind.
","TTT should be taken for what it is, a visually attractive, popcorn fun, crowd-pleaser.  In this respect, the movie does it perfect.  The action is well choreographed, and very interesting to watch.  Peter Jackson is very good at this.  He makes movies interesting.  He makes movies fun to watch. This whole movie was a big story, with really no inner message.  My mind did not go through any thought process this whole movie.  I just sat in my cushioned seat, and absorbed the action/adventure fest this movie gave me. And as I said, this movie does that well.<br/><br/>The cinematography was amazing.  You could tell that most of the time making movie was spent in a little room, on a computer, animating Golem, who felt like a real person.  Also, considering most of the background and sets were made by computers, they did a great job with that.<br/><br/>The story also was very good, mainly because it is from what is considered one of the greatest books of all time.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is very eye-catching, and you can tell Peter threw in some things just to make sure you were watching (Legolos jumping onto his horse is a perfect example).  This makes the movie feel like ""The Matrix"", which is something many directors trying to make an epic DO NOT want.<br/><br/>The love story could have been done without, as I forgot every part of the movie with that in it.  I can't even remember who was in love with Liv Tyler.  This felt like they were trying to add more meaning into the battle scenes with whoever she loved, but I could see no connection between the two.<br/><br/>Also the character development... wasn't their.  Unless you consider Gandalf becoming ""White"", or Frodo becoming woozier, character development, i felt none in the movie.<br/><br/>There are many movies that I sit and wonder after, not because of I being confusing, because that is what the director wants you to do.  The Pianist, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Chinatown, 2001, A Clockwork Orange and others all made me do this.  After seeing this in theaters, I was right out of the theater, and discussing how ""cool"" the battle scenes were.  Wow. Gripping.<br/><br/>But I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it.  Throughout the whole movie, my eyes were fixed on the screen.  I mean, almost any male, despite how ""inner"" they say they are, can't resist 25 minute battle scenes with fire and ogres.<br/><br/>But this movie was easily forgotten in the thoughtful part of my mind. But it will always be in the ""Wow!  Look at that!  Once in a lifetime!"" part.<br/><br/>I give The Two Towers:  7/10"
"funkyfry","10","2","4","3 August 2003"," One of the best fantasy films of all time
","Jackson and his team have managed to actually top their first feature (at least in its theatrical version) with this amazing, over the top, deep-running fantasy epic.  The performances are on, with Rhys-Davies and Bloom's comradery adding an element that was somewhat missing from the first film.  The action elements are well-balanced with the dialogue, the visuals are totally stunning.  But the real star of this movie, probably for all time, is the CGI creation to top all others:  Gollum, who comes to leave breathing and smacking his lips and seeming every bit as real as any actor on the set could be.  It was truly amazing to watch this effect work on an audience that could forget, in such memorable scenes as Gollum's late night conversation with himself (as Smeagol), that it was not watching an actual fantastic creature.  <br/><br/>Never has the suspension of disbelief been so complete in a fantasy movie, and never has a fantasy world been created with such care and attention to detail, as well as to the flow of the story and characters."

","Actually, it's better than the first!<br/><br/>First off, see ""Fellowship of the Ring"" or you won't be able to make heads or tails out of this.  It follows the fellowship being divided and facing evil on all sides.  There's battles galore, tons of action, incredible sets and special effects, breathtaking scenery and the usual great direction from Peter Jackson.  The acting is just so-so except for (surprisingly) Viggo Mortensen.  I wasn't impressed with him in the first movie but he improved vastly in this one--a very subtle but physical performance.  His scenes with Liv Tyler were especially moving. It runs for 3 hours but it flew by and I was never bored.  The battle at Helms Deep is easily among one of the most incredible action sequences ever caught on film.  A definite must-see.  I can't wait for ""Return of the King""!"

"epcot26-1","9","0","0","13 May 2020"," Tensions rising throughout the film...Wonderful ending.
","The Two Towers is very well directed, written (minus some quotes from Legolas as their searching for Merry and Pippin), and overall, well-acted.
The crux of the film is the country of Rohan and it's desperate situation. The entire buildup from the introduction of the Rohan characters to the exodus from their capital city of Edoras, and their journey to Helm's Deep, and the entire doom and gloom scenario surrounding the people while waiting for a merciless army to attack. This is what made The Two Towers really standout as the best of the best of the trilogy (my own opinion). The Battle of Helm's Deep was very well executed, and you could feel the emotions and tensions running high throughout. It wasn't just the visual effects that made this good, it was the actual acting through the battle that made it incredible and stay hooked until the end.
I don't care for the Academy Awards/Oscars...I think it's all just a huge waste of time, money, resources, and a big distraction. Although all three films of the trilogy were nominated for Best Picture, and the third film won the award, I think The Two Towers is the film that should've won...
But who cares. The entire trilogy was amazing!"

","The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged."
"educallejero","10","0","0","10 May 2020"," An unparalleled Epic
","Because this one was built on the foundations of the first one. And it used that advantage to show all the epicism of the Tolkien story. A non-stop story (with the only exception being a sequence to reinforce Aragorn's love story). The scenes either advanced the plot at a brisk pace or were action sequences (that also advanced the plot in one way or another). There's not a lot of character development and that's not a fault. The story and characters remain PG, therefore complexity and nuance storytelling aren't the focus (there is a tiny bit more of light politics with the realms and their conflicts though).<br/><br/>Another great thing is that stop abusing the same resources (slow motion with no music and echo voices) in the ""heart fealted moments"", either because there aren't as many or because the editing changed. There is a fair amount for a 3 hour Epic, but not more than necessary, like in the first one.<br/><br/>Last thing that makes this movie perfect is, of course, the larger role played by Gollum's Andy Serkis, which steals every second he's onscreen. The rest of the acting is equally good than in the first movie, with a special mention for the great David Wenham (Faramir), replacing the great Sean Bean (Boromir)"

","In a vacuum, this movie is maybe even better than the Fellowship of the Ring, in that it has so much more action and the cinematography and action are unique. Despite that, I think the first movie of the trilogy adapted the books better, in that it followed it carefully, except for the removal of Tom Bombadil, which was a good thing. This sequel fails to show the depth of the Ent Arc and represents Faramir and the men of Gondor as easily corrupted as Boromir. Those were the biggest misteps, for me, a book nerd."

","This is definitely my favorite movie. I have watched it over 10 times and will probably watch it 10 more times in the future. I have seen all 3 ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but this one has got to be my favorite. After watching the first ""Lord of the Rings"" film I was very eager to watch part II and I couldn't be more pleased. It was quit a long movie, but I would sit through the whole thing twice. I watched it when I was around 7-9 years old and I still watch it to this day when I am 13 years old. It is full of drama, mystery, and of course lots of adventure.
Not only was the movie breathtaking, but the actors were as well. Elijah Wood did a remarkable job portraying his character, Frodo Baggins, and I am very pleased with how he did. Samwise Gamgee (Frodo Baggins' dearest friend) played by Sean Astin also did an amazing job portraying his character, along with Elijah Wood. One of my favorite actors Viggo Mortensen, who played Aragorn, had a sensitive yet brave side which complimented his character. He, along with Orlando Bloom (Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies (Gimli/Tree beard voice), were both amazing in the film. I highly recommend you watch this movie."

"bowmanblue","9","0","0","10 January 2020"," The continuation of 'epic'
","It's unlikely that many people will decide to enter the 'Lord of the Rings' world in the 'middle' of the story. The 'Rings' books numbered three, therefore it was always known that the films would follow suit. Most people (whether fans of the book, or those just interested in the hype of the first installment 'The Fellowship of the Ring') started with 'Fellowship' and watched 'The Two Towers' to see where the story went next. For them - the majority - they wouldn't really need much of a 'recap' to the plot. For anyone else, they may be a little confused.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm a huge fan of both the books and the big screen adaptations, therefore I loved 'The Two Towers' and 'got' every reference. However, if it does have one major flaw it is that it relies on the audience knowing what's come before. It doesn't really spend much time reminding everyone of the events leading up to what's happening now.<br/><br/>It continues the tale of a fictional land known as 'Middle Earth' and a dark lord trying to retrieve his magic ring so that he can become whole again and rule all. Luckily for the free folk (such as elves, men and dwarfs) the ring has been sent to the one place it can be destroyed by two pluckly little creatures known as Hobbits.<br/><br/>Basically, if you enjoyed the first film, this one is the (almost - and I'll get to my personal gripe with this one) 'perfect' continuation with the epic Middle Earth journey. All the characters you loved from the original return for this one, even the ones who died are given their screen time due to flashbacks and minimal sub-plots, but, due to the members of the 'Fellowship' taking separate paths throughout the land, now you have three different stories to follow.<br/><br/>All of which are skilfully woven together as the characters interact with new and interesting people. All the new cast are great, but if there's one reason to watch this film it's for the computer-generated creation of the - much troubled - 'Gollum.' Andy Serkis 'plays' him thanks to his skills in a 'motion capture' suit, plus he does the voice and, if you ever wanted to see a 100% computer generated character steal every scene, then this is it.<br/><br/>Gollum is definitely the high-point for me and the special effects used to create him still hold up to this day. I criticised 'Fellowship' (mildly) for its effects looking a little 'green-screen ish' some twenty years on and the same can be said for a few scenes in 'The Two Towers,' but - again - the scale of the film and how it's all put together totally overshadows any minor gripe like that.<br/><br/>Most people (or those I've spoken to!) seem to either like the first book/film or the last the best. For some reason 'The Two Towers' was always my favourite. Which was why I was always a little annoyed to see that - in my opinion - this was the film version that had the most liberties taken with its story. There are a couple of scenes towards the end which are definitely not based on J. R. R. Tolkien's work and make absolutely no sense to me. In fact, they even go as far as to totally fly in the face of the concept of the point of the movie, i.e. keeping the ring's whereabouts a secret. These scenes still irk me to this day, but the rest of the film is so good I can hardly claim not to enjoy it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it, watch 'The Fellowship' first. I'll be surprised if it doesn't make you want to watch this one, too."

"jacobhunt6","8","0","0","26 April 2019"," The weakest of the films, but that's not saying much
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the weakest chapter of the trilogy - but that's not saying much. Peter Jackson's iconic adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's incredible fantasy universe is a milestone in cinematic history and indisputably one of the greatest film trilogies in history, and this opening statement is more of a testament to the quality of the other two films rather than a criticism of The Two Towers.
The Fellowship of the Ring can be praised for its introduction to a hefty folklore, narrowing the source material down to two and a half entertaining hours. The Return of the King, meanwhile, is a true epic, nearly three and a half hours of pure adrenaline, iconic battle sequences and incredible special effects.
The Two Towers attempts to be a middle ground between the two but finds itself stumbling upon the pitfalls of stretching a film's plot quite so thin. Still, it remains one of the most beautifully-crafted epics ever to grace Hollywood.
Along with the fantastic performances of Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and others, the cast is joined by the brilliant Andy Serkis, whose portrayal of Gollum is perfect to a tee. As a fan of the novels, I cannot imagine a better interpretation of the character for film than Serkis' brilliant portrayal.
The battle sequences are large-scale and awe-inspiring and the plot itself is engaging over the course of an abnormally lengthy runtime.
However, The Two Towers stumbles slightly whilst trying to jostle with the overarching plot requirements of the trilogy. Whilst trying to wedge itself between The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King, it sacrifices pacing and plot detail for a gratuitous induction to the battle scenes we should come to expect, and favours fan service and CGI over the natural flow of the narrative.
While some transitions felt clunky or rushed, however, there is no denying the quality of the finished product, and when considered as a chapter in the trilogy, The Two Towers more than satisfies. This was the film that originally captured my attention and made me a fan of The Lord of the Rings and while I consider it by far the weakest of the films, I by no means will ever discredit it in any way.
Peter Jackson, you sir have done something special with these adaptations, and if The Two Towers was the worst thing that came from your work on The Lord of the Rings, then you should be very proud of all you achieved."

","My theory with the Lord Of The Rings films has always been that the stuff that is good gets better with each film, but the stuff that doesn't work as well unfortunately gets worse. Whilst this means the very best moments of the franchise might still be yet to happen for film 2, there's no doubt a balancing act that is playing out as the stakes of the battles gets bigger and the adventures of the heroes get grander, whilst the sadder, darker moments start to creep into the edges of this film. Overall, for upping the grandeur of the already fantastic part one without delving into what makes much of part three an exercise in patience, this film rounds off as the best one in the series for me personally - just don't fret about the extended directors cut too much, most of that stuff whilst good in its own right, was better left on the special features disc."

","A lot better than Fellowship of the ring. This one gives the characters a personality and motivations to their actions. They finally stop being boring unidimensional characters. Alongside that, the plot starts getting epic, in the first film there were some epic scenes with great direction, but in this one, there are frigging wars and death. This gets epic to new levels, the film is just a lot of anticipation to a great battle. Great action scenes, good characters and a decent plot line. My only problem with it is Legolas, the only boring character in the film, he is just filling space and doesn't have ANY personality. There would be no difference if i replace Legolas with a tree. But overall, good film."

","Peter Jackson's epic fantasy trilogy is a landmark in the history of film-making, and its second installment is my personal favourite of the three. The Two Towers is the crucible at the heart of the quest in which anything is possible. This film is a triumph in the art of adapting material to film and its achieved through the pure love and passion the cast and crew have for the original Tolkein works. The bright and vibrant colours of the first installment are stripped away as Middle Earth becomes engulfed in the grim prospect of Sauron's return to power, with an atmosphere of sheer hopelessness in the face of insurmountable odds perfectly encapsulated in the final battle at Helm's Deep and the shadow of despair spreading across the land. All three are masterpieces, but this one is my favourite."

","""The Two Towers"" is usually referred to be the worst entry of the series. I still think the movie is great, but I can only agree. However, facing off against ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and my personal favorite part ""The Return of the King"" is almost impossible. So don't get me wrong the movie is still great, just not quite as good as the other two.<br/><br/>What probably makes ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest trilogy of all time (maybe besides the original Star Wars trilogy, but even this trilogy lacks, as ""A New Hope"" has suffered a severe drop in quality throughout the years and ""Return of the Jedi"" being the least favorite of most people, as many don't like the Ewok story line) is that they were all shot simultaneously. So even though ""The Two Towers"" is the weakest entry, it still fits in great, as the transition throughout the whole story is very smooth.<br/><br/>Just as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", the direction, the visual effects and the landscape shots are still awesome, but ""The Two Towers"" lacks the great story introduction of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and the endless climaxes of ""The Return of the King."""

","22 December 2002. I'd say 8 stars out of 10 for this movie. The scenery was spectacular and the overall appearance is of epic proportions. The were a few distractions however and perhaps the DVD (and I'm assuming even longer version will help fill in the gaps). Frodo's internal conflict as the ring-bearer doesn't come across the screen as personal to the audience, we get to see more from an observer standpoint without getting the feelings and the emotions and the actual pull to the dark side was one might get from Star Wars. The Rohan King's son is a person we never really get to know and to feel the bond between the King and his son and again we're left to see the King's emotions from outside, never getting to emote with him. Gollum is perhaps the most amazing character of all in this movie and I'd say should earn an Oscar nomination for something. Except for the ending scenes which seem to suddenly turn the Gollum in another direction from the prior scene which doesn't seem smooth and consistent in character, the Gollum and Frodo's and Sam's interaction was the highlight, brilliant, and intimate creative genius of the whole series to date. Another strange figure is the 10,000 warriors that march to defeat Helm's Deep and King Rohan. But even the Vietnam War, the American Civil War, the Russian Revolution, the numbers offered as to the size of the massed army in this epic fantasy don't seem to conform to the gigantic clash between good and evil of the massive size of Tolkien's novel - I'd think that 100,000 soldier army would be the minimum size to defeat any fortified fortress in the Lord of the Rings. The battle seemed to be awful fast and the feeling of lingering doom, the seige over days (more in line with most fantasy battle scenes) is missing in this movie. However, overall, Lord of the Rings brings to the screen images that have been waiting a long time for Fantasy fans and almost (not quite) capture the essence of Middle Earth. A great attempt, a near perfect success, but there is even better movies to come if this significant benchmark is any indication of the future of fantasy movies."

","First of all, The Lord of the Rings (L.O.T.R) trilogy should always be
appreciated as a whole rather than 3 separate movies (despite the fact that each of them, alone, is already a beautiful piece of art). It's also the reason why you will find the exact same post on each movie's topic (10/10 for each and 100/10 for the TRILOGY!).<br/><br/>
The series has everything needed to be a masterpiece :
<ul><li>Great cinematography: thanks to the exceptional common works of Andrew Lesnie and Peter Jackson, we could experience all theses monumental battle scenes throughout the series (in magnificent landscapes of Jackson's native New Zealand). Some of them are the most epic battle scenes ever made!</li><li>Great script: excellent adapted screenplay for the legendary novel of J. R. R. Tolkien.</li><li>Great ensemble cast: in one sentence, they were just perfect for the series. In such a large screenplay, each one has precisely done what is needed to develop their character, not too few nor too much, for the common great goal : the global plot development.</li><li>Great directing: respect to Jackson for putting all those great elements together so that we now could live Tolkien's splendid fantasy world on big screen. The TRILOGY has also engraved Peter Jackson's name on the wall of the Directors hall of fame alongside with Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg, Francis Ford Coppola...</li></ul><br/><br/>
I've been re-watching the whole series from time to time for the last 15 years since the release of The Return of the King, and it's kept me enjoyed every single time!

","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while."

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the sequel to the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. The movie picks up where The Fellowship of the Ring had left off. Frodo and Samwise have split off from the fellowship after Boromir's attempt to retrieve the one ring. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel to the land of the Rohirrim to save Merry and Pippin.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has the dubious honor of being the middle chapter of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. The Two Towers handles this well with having satisfying stories and building the trilogy towards the last and final movie. There are many plot threads in this move that matter.<br/><br/>The Two Towers focuses on the three groups that comprise the Fellowship of the Ring. Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee continue to bear the ring towards Mount Doom. Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-hai to be brought before Saruman. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek to rescue the pair of hobbits captured by Isengard.<br/><br/>The story with Frodo Baggins and Samwise have the pair traversing the to Mount Doom through both areas controlled by men and monsters. The pair of hobbits encounter Gollum and enlist his aid in guiding them to Mount Doom. This trip takes the trio into beautiful locations and also serves an important purpose in Frodo learning more about the realms of men and Gollum. I enjoyed this plot a lot and seeing both Frodo and Sam persevere is motivating to watch. The encounter with Faramir is also well done.<br/><br/>The story with Merry and Pippin is not the strongest in this movie. Merry and Pippin contribute a fun side plot but do not really undergo an arc like Frodo and Samwise. The pair are simply freed and convince the ents to help defeat Isengard. This arc is visually exciting to watch but is not that exciting narratively.<br/><br/>The story line with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas do not undergo and character changes. This story-line is the most visually impressive. The trio find a resurrected Gandalf and also help the Kingdom of Rohan. The trio meet King Theoden and worm tongue. These characters are fun to watch. The story-line focuses on the conflict between Rohan and Isengard. This story climaxes at Helm's Deep where an epic battle occurs.<br/><br/>The battle at Helm's Deep is incredibly cool. This battle is a mini-movie with the way it progresses and develops. The attack by the Uruk-hai is both awe-inspiring and suspenseful to watch. This battle is so fun to watch that it is worth the price of admission alone. I highly recommend watching the extended cut of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. The extended cut adds more interesting details to the movie.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching The Lords of the Rings: The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","While 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers (2002)' initially seems like an improvement upon its predecessor due to an almost instant start, to the point of totally leaving anyone not already on-board with the story behind, and constant 'in-the-moment' feel, the piece soon becomes a baggy and generally slow affair that does, in itself, seem like the so-called 'extended version' (how an actual 'extended version' exists, I'm not sure I'll ever fully understand). This middle instalment falls victim to its transitional status, which is essentially a kind way of saying that not all that much happens - at least not considering its bloated three hour run-time - while it ties the knot between the first and last part of its larger tale. It also suffers from a meandering narrative that opens up its world in a way that seems unfocused, taking away from the core - and, incidentally, most interesting - story of our protagonist and his journey to destroy that which would seek to destroy the world at every opportunity. There's still a lot to like, including a clarity of vision most prominent in the brilliant battle sequences - which are some of the largest in scale seen in cinema (only to be bested in size by its follow-up) and yet still retain a remarkably tangible quality - and smaller character moments - mainly surrounding its landmark 'motion capture' character. Indeed, this character is a groundbreaking achievement that did almost as much for the industry as the rest of the effects combined, being the premier creation of this kind essentially still to this day. He has some of the best moments in this feature, moments which are only slightly less interesting because of all the apparent 'filler' which surrounds them. It's made out to be essential perhaps because it sits in the source novel, but trimming sequences shouldn't be discouraged even in something based on a beloved book. This flick ends up perhaps the weakest of the trilogy. In the end, though, there are enough stand-out scenes and it's entertaining enough to make it more than worthwhile. 7/10"

","Lord of the Rings: Two Towers 
Why does everyone say that Lord of the Rings trilogy are one of the best movies ever made? Maybe because, they are the movies adaptation of one and only J.R.R. Tolkien, who was a magnificent fantasy novelist? Nah. Or maybe it is known, because Peter Jackson have directed entire trilogy? Possibly. 
From my point of view whole trilogy owe their popularity to amazing actors, screenplays and CGI. Whole story is placed in middle-earth and is the great journey to destroy mighty ring of Dark Lord Sauron. Frodo Baggins (played by Elijah Wood) and Samwise ""Sam"" Gamgee (played by Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor to mountain doom. Second part begin with remind of past events. The fellowship of the ring is nearing its end. Everyone is scattered by the great loss, but they must complete their quest. Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Aragon (Viggo Mortensen) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) pursue the Uruk-hai to save their fellows Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), while Frodo and Sam lost their way to Mordor. Last owner of dark ring, Gollum (Andy Serkis), who followed them, helps them find the way out. I won't say more, you must see it with your own eyes.
Briefly speaking screenplay and CGI of this movie is fantastic. There is everything you need: orcs, elves, dwarf and great wall. if you sought new thrills packed with great battles, a romance and a masterful plot, you would find a right movie. If not, you should watch it anyway. <br/><br/>P.S They have dragons."

","The Lord of the Rings is was directed by Peter Jackson and features some of cinema's most iconic, epic, and incredible story elements in film history. It's grand, spectacular, and incredibly dense when one experiments with the extended versions. Adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's incredible book might go down as one of the most ambitious film projects of all time and it sure paid off.<br/><br/>Considering the consistency in production of all three films, this review includes personal thoughts about the entire trilogy and will tackle the all three films from a more general standpoint since my opinion on all three are pretty much the same.<br/><br/>Shooting in New Zealand might've been one of the best production decisions they had to make. Landscape shots in each film completely immerse you in this fantasy world which you completely believe is nothing but middle-earth. While CGI did have immense benefits during production. It's definitely apparent practical sets, props, and costumes were utilize to feel more authentic instead of obvious and generic green screen. <br/><br/>Each film stands well alone as it's own independent story but when you watch all of them you see the entire story arc for each character from beginning to end which yields an incredibly satisfying ending for each character. Seeing how each one changes in their own and unique way is seeing how understanding of a writer Tolkien was and how genius the filmmakers were in expressing those stories and deeply thought-provoking themes explored in such an epic and thorough way. <br/><br/>Each scene feels necessary and not a moment in the stories do we feel bored or wanting something else. Each section of the story whether it be brutal war sequences or character developing dialogue scenes, they feel fascinating and satisfying enough to engage the audience no matter who they are. <br/><br/>While few can complain about minor plot flaws or changes made from the book (which are very few), no one can deny the cinematic brilliance of the Lord of the Rings trilogy or its impact on modern filmmaking. It will forever be remembered as one of the best movie trilogies of all time and a fantasy epic that will be damn near impossible to rival in scope, ambition, and appeal. If you haven't seen this marvelous trilogy yet, see it as soon as possible. The extended versions are well worth your time as well given the additional footage that provides clear context and further character motivations. This will be a long and time consuming endeavor but when it's over, it will change the viewer to some degree. Don't let these films go unseen."

","Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.<br/><br/>This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.<br/><br/>The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.<br/><br/>In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on."

","It is hard to tell the middle of a story. I've always thought that middles lack the novelty of beginnings or the satisfaction of endings. However, ""The Two Towers"" does a wonderful job of continuing the various plot threads of Middle Earth without starting or ending them. From the psychologically raw tale of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum to the heroic epic of Rohan to the Blakean ecological tragedy of the ents, Tolkein and Peter Jackson a vast story in this incarnation of his saga.<br/><br/>Gollum is a disturbing treasure, and any scene involving him is indisputably well-done. That's not to say that his mere presence doesn't disgust, but his role is indispensable. In terms of the smaller details, the design work done in Rohan is magnificent. Low-key and fitting with their lack of worldly sophistication, it is nevertheless done with pride. It would have been a great movie without the little details like that one, but it wouldn't have been as good as it is.<br/><br/>The film certainly has its flaws, many of which have since become clichÃ©s. Legolas's pre-modern AK-47 in the form of a bow and arrow is both silly and unnecessary. Many of the extended fight scenes feel redundant, and after you see the first several orcs getting decapitated, what's the added value in seeing ten more? Clearly greater than zero, at least according to Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>Note: I watched the Extended Edition, and it was an absolute delight. I haven't seen the shorter version in several years, but if you can spare the time, I would recommend the longer one."

","As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas , Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film,<br/><br/>with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unfurnished in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo;<br/><br/>Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn . Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis,<br/><br/>upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film . However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and<br/><br/>well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears. with the end tended version of 3hrs 25mins on DVD this film is a instant classic like the first he was unknown director peter Jackson but was given a treasure chest to bring magic to the big screen with 94 million budget for this it made 340million While Frodo and Sam edge closer to Mordor with the help of gollum who has a split personality who brings them on his own terms so he can get his precious back Frodo is brought through dead marshes the ring is getting uncomfortable to him as the souls reach out to him SAM is struggling with this journey as we see the orcs come under attack from Eomer who takes the gang to Osgiliath? where the last past of middle earth is stay to fight but saurian and his dragon follow the eye to nearly get Frodo isengard are readying the army with sauron ready to do battle the other hobbits find an ancients trees who find that the forest is coming alive and when Pippin tells what has happened the story in two towers has 3 or four story arcs with Gandalf the white coming to leogloas and Aragon who are on there way to rowan where the king is under a suaraon magic spell and Aragon and his friends are ambushed on the way leading to him going missing and Erwin willing him back to go to plead at rowan that it is not safe their and get them to helms deep the mid point of the battle of middle earth so as we so the stories coming together Aragorn comes back leoglas is reading the small armies at helms and Frodo on his way as see the archers the orc suicide bomber break the fortification the desperate to hold on the swashbuckling action from legolas grimly battle axing the orcs the elves and then last stand by Aragorn and elves only for Gandalf and to comes to the rescue in this civil war but the bigger battles lie ahead The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be.<br/><br/>For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers. it deserved more than 2 Oscars but as we know that last was a classic of any era. 9.5/10"

","As the middle chapter in the greatest trilogy of all time, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers successfully continues the journeys of the recently broken Fellowship by focusing on the characters' story lines: Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas travel to the aid of the troubled country of Rohan and help defend the Rohirrim against the corrupted wizard Saruman and his terrifying Uruk-hai army, Frodo and Sam encounter the mentally deranged Gollum, the former owner of the One Ring, who helps them on their path to Mordor, and Merry and Pippin meet a new ally in the tree-shepherd Treebeard. For me personally, The Two Towers is not just the best of the Lord of the Rings series, its also the best second sequel and best sequel of all time - and I've seen Terminator 2, Captain America: Winter Soldier, Aliens, The Dark Knight, Godfather 2, Toy Story 2 and Empire Strikes Back - and it's certainly better and stronger than all of them. It extends the world building from Fellowship and deepens the relationships of the characters (and does it better than Empire), it's also darker, intense, undoubtedly exciting and more involving, defying viewers expectations by taking the series to heightened emotional levels and leaving the viewers satisfied and also wanting more. Mind-blowing, stronger and the most thought-provoking of the trilogy, The Two Towers is a sequel that is better than the original and is the best sequel of all time and is a must-see for fantasy fans and film buffs.<br/><br/>Pros: It features the best battle of the entire franchise (Helm's Deep), acting, characters, a brilliant script that flawlessly handles three story lines and develops more characters, beautiful production & costume design, action scenes, fantastic special effects, amazing stunts and the gorgeous cinematography.<br/><br/>Cons: Eomer could have been more developed, the Treebeard scenes were slow-paced and interfered with the battle at Helm's Deep, Legolas jumping on top of his horse was stupid, there should have been a resolution with the Dunlendings (the Wild Men) and Eowyn's cringe-worthy singing at Theodred's funeral (extended edition)"

The third LoTR film suffers from being a wannabe Two Towers; it has like three different battles that have zero tension with zero build up. Plus those stupid green ghosts act like an easy solution to the problem. Just like the giant eagle tropism. Ironically enough, Two Towers is the only LoTR film without giant eagles. Some food for thought there for you."

I watch this movie with a never-ending interest every time. <br/><br/>The images of the main characters do not leave indifferent. The trinity of heroes overcomes all enemies, being at this moment for jokes, especially Gimli. The endless rivalry between a gnome and an elf amuses.

"tapio_hietamaki","10","0","0","28 March 2017"," Influential, larger-than-life movie that brings depth and humanity to the fantasy story
","The Two Towers is one of the biggest and most successful sequels ever. It's not really even a sequel in the sense that the word is usually used, because The Lord of the Rings movies were filmed back to back and were always intended to be a single colossal story. Other successful sequels (Terminator 2, Aliens, The Godfather Part 2, even The Empire Strikes Back) are follow-ups to self-contained stories. The Lord of the Rings was largely unprecedented in that the creators knew in advance that there would be three movies to tell their story. It isn't that uncommon nowadays but in the early 2000's it was a big deal. The Lord of the Rings functions as a 9-hour movie (or 10-hour if you watch the extended edition).<br/><br/>The Two Towers isn't recommended to be watched on its own. But if you've seen the other movies and want to revisit it, The Two Towers does have its own arc, although the story goes on the central conflicts are resolved.<br/><br/>The last part, The Return of the King, won 11 Oscars and is regarded as one of the greatest movies ever (currently sitting at the 8th spot on the IMDb Top 250 list), but I think that movie is too bloated and blinded by special effects. I prefer The Two Towers. This part introduces new characters and settings and ups the stakes, while retaining the humanity and groundedness of the first part.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is known for its exploration of the country of Rohan and its people. They have an iconic piece of theme music, you get chills just remembering it. Their people is a proud and old one, designed to be stylistically reminiscent of Old Anglo-Saxons or Celts, yet we get the sense that they live in the shadow of Gondor where the real power of Men lies. They fight the corruption of the traitorous wizard Saruman and his orc army. They bring depth to the fantastical world: good and evil both have various forms.<br/><br/>The Rohan story is really only half of the movie, the other half follows the Hobbits Frodo and Sam through abandoned Gondorian country, hindered by the noble yet struggling hero Faramir and aided by the treacherous Gollum, a wonder of CGI special effects who largely influenced future filmmakers."

","In world were things are trying to fall apart there is hope for some good things and they must fight for it with everything they have. Frodo and Sam encounter a Gollum and now are being leaded by him while Theoden, King of Rohan is set free by Gandalf the White and now leads his people away from trouble into Helm's Deep. Merry and Pippin in meantime are pursuing Treebeard to go into war with Saruman. As dark grows stronger so does power of Ring and Frodo feels consequences and loses sometimes himself in power. Another great introduction into couple of new important characters and some new great storytelling followed with many troubles that strike upon our main characters. Incredible buildup of story until the final moment of great fight for Helm's Deep that was absolutely miraculous and at it's finest. Power of dark was well shown and put hell of a fight for Men and others defending while Treebeard in his anger of lost friends unleashes power of Ent's upon Isengard. Again Gimli shines with his fun giving us a light in dark times and Aragorn once more proved to be a true leader of Men while being well respected by Legolas an incredible companion. Directing of Peter was at the same level as the first movie giving us one incredible ride with some pretty amazing scenes.

Doom and it was given to Sauron the leader of the evil forces of Middle- Earth. Then Sauron became greedy and decided to try to take control of the nineteen rings but an alliance between men, elves, and dwarfs decided to fight back and the king of Gondor Elendil was killed by Sauron and his Isildur took up his father's shattered sword and cut the ring off of Sauron's hand and the enemy of men was defeated and Isildur did not want to destroy the ring he wanted to keep the ring for himself. Then Isildur became a creature named Smeagol.<br/><br/>Once they found Gandalf they headed toward Ednew. They found the king Theoden's mind was being poisoned by Saruman and Gandal frees Theoden's mind from Saruman then Theoden decides to move everyone to the keep ing the mountains when two of Theoden's scouts get ambushed by a warg which is a wolf and a bear hybrid, then Legolas saves one of the scouts by shooting the warg then slicing the throart of the rider then he says to Aragorn who heard the fight came to see what was going "" It's a scouts"", then Legolas goes up on a hill and sees the other wargs coming towards him and he starts shooting a the wargs then Aragorn, Gimli, and Theoden and his men started charging at the wargs and Legolas jumps on with Gimli and Gimli falls of the horse and a warg and Gimli was going to hit the warg with his battle axe but Legolas kills the warg before it can attack Gimli. Before the beginning of the battle Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are not sure that they will not win the battle against the Uruk-Hai. The Ents which are trees that can wal and talk like humans and the Ents are also known as ""Shephard of the forest"". So the ENts are deciding either join the war or staying neutral. Before the Battle of Helms Deep, Haldir, a high elves' general, and his army of high elves, came to support and Theoden asked him "" how is this possible?"" and Haldir answered, "" I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell an alliance once formed between men and elves we fought and died together and we come to honor that alligiance once again."" After the army of elves were on the walls the Uruk-Hai army showed p and an elderly man of Rohan drew back his bow along with the other men of Rohan but he could not hold the arrow fully drawn as long as the other men could so by accident he released the arrow and the arrow struck a Uruk-Hai swords man in the neck.<br/><br/>If you want to see if Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Theoden, Eomer, and Gandalf make it through the Battle of Helms Deep, so I advise you to watch Lord of The Ring The Two Towers. I recommend this movie to people who like mythical creatures and mythical based movies also people who enjoy blood, gore, and war movies. <br/><br/>The special effects in the movie was really good especially the making of the Uruk-Hai's armor. Also the acting of Aragorn and Legolas was spectacular.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in the movie I think were the best parts of the movie except when Haldir got killed in the Battle of Helms Deep by the Uruk- Hai general."

","Some people prefer this second part in the Lord of the Rings trilogy to the first. I am not one of those people. Where the first movie's strength was in its exploration of a magical fantasy world, this one is – albeit necessarily – more gloomy. I would guess that it's primarily thought highly of for two main reasons. Firstly, for its epic recreation of the battle for Helm's Deep and secondly for the character Gollum. These are two pretty persuasive reasons to be honest. The battle scene is truly massive in its scale and execution, with a lot of painstaking detail; while the character of Gollum is even more revolutionary in cinematic terms. Andy Serkis famously played the character with motion-capture devices all over his body but Gollum was a fully CGI created creature. It's pretty remarkable, therefore, that this character has so much believability and empathy. It's a testament to both Serkis acting and the artists who created him that this is so.<br/><br/>Other than this, for me, The Two Towers suffers a little from neither being the start nor the end of the story. It doesn't have the variety of tones and locations of the first film, and overall it did get a little tedious at times. But this is in no way meant to be a criticism of Peter Jackson's efforts. This was after all merely a recreation of what was actually in the book; it's just that my sensibilities are not so in line with this one. But it's pretty obvious that this is another loving recreation from Jackson and his team; and, like before, it has a great ensemble of actors to do it justice."

","The Two Towers. (2002) Welcome to the second part of the trilogy. Although not as good as the first, The Two Towers is definitely worth your time. The story is great. The FX are stunning as usual. The acting is quite awesome. What can I say? This movie also has a much darker quality to it.<br/><br/>The evil nazgûls are quite the terrifying sight. The sight of the 10,000 strong Uruk-Hai at Helm's Deep is indeed something else. The battle at Helm's Deep is quite awesome. Although this movie is not as action based as it's predecessor, it's still delivers.<br/><br/>The acting here has more depth. Everyone delivers a good performance. Elijah Wood delivers a clinic. We also get to know Gollum. A very disturbed being that has been torn apart by the evil ring. His personality is shaken. Gollum is quite entertaining. His allegiance remains a mystery. At one point, Gollum gets into a argument with himself that is a very entertaining sequence of scenes here.<br/><br/>Some problems are here though. The evil forces are not as menacing here as in the Fellowship. Don't get me wrong, they were still evil. Something was missing. Some Uruk-Hai's would get trounced without as even inflicting any pain to Aragorn and his fellow warriors. As much as Gimli is fun, the comedy gets a little bit old. Gimli in The Fellowship was more serious, here he is more comedy. Sometimes, comedy needs time off.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Excellent. The Two Towers delivers well. If you liked The Fellowship of The Ring(Chapter 1 in the Trilogy), you will enjoy Chapter 2: The Two Towers. Recommended."

","Like its two counterparts i find it almost impossible to give this lower than a ten. I would say however that this is the worst of the three but worst is not a word i like to use when dealing with such an Amazing film. The two towers is unsurprisingly visually stunning in every respect and we see the first Motion capture technology put in to film using gollum. After producing a outstanding wonderfully filmed first instalment peter Jackson had to follow up with something truly stunning, he did. The two towers follows of from where the fellowship left off and brings the film to the forefront with spellbinding special effects. The film follows the split up members of the fellowship and charts their journeys through middle earth all in the hope to do the most impossible of tasks and destroy the ring. Mortensen, bloom, Mckellen , wood and Sean Austin along with all other actors involved are again nothing short of perfect in portraying their characters to tell the story. The Two towers was the one film that we anticipated for a whole year and we were not let down with something as intricate and gripping as it was. Considering everything else in the film it is Andy Serkis that steals the show for the two towers in my view presenting the character of gollum in such an amazing way that you again become lost in the story. To add to the already finely done scenes before it Jackson produces the unforgettable battle of helms deep. This is without a doubt where the two towers became most gripping, emotive and visually stunning and the way it unfolds is truly, truly brilliant helping the 2nd instalment roll into the third. The two towers may in essence not be as good as Amon hen and Moria in the fellowship or the ride of the Rohirrim in the Return of the King but i feel it is still a true masterpiece of film making and kept the trilogy as strong as ever. The Two Towers in my view deserves nothing less than 10/10."

","Part of what made the last Lord of the Rings movie so great was its presentation. The light-hearted scenes were heart-warming and the darker moments were more suspenseful. The Two Towers takes a dark turn in the Lord of the Rings and uses it to be its primary mood. For the most part, this darker atmosphere pays off and helps the battles seem more impressive.<br/><br/>The Fellowship is broken in this movie, but the journey must continue as The Two Towers continues right where the Fellowship of the Ring left off, like a true sequel. Almost instantly, Jackson introduces us to a crowd favorite character, Smeagol and Gollum. But why do we love this two part combo character? Maybe it has to do with the world-famous line ""my precious...."" Yes, that line alone makes this ugly imp-like creature one the audience can't help but love.<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam don't have much a role in this movie, instead, The Two Towers puts the major focus around Aragorn, Legolus and Gimli, which I'm pretty thankful for. It's nice to see that after getting used to the silly hobbits that we get a movie that puts as much dedication towards the more serious part of the group. Gandalf also makes a return appearance and his changed attitude makes him more or less a more credible character this time around.<br/><br/>The battle sequences in this movie are big and great. The first few battles that take place out in open fields are impressive themselves, but you won't know true battle scenes until the battle for Helms Deep. This sequence, combined with the Ents taking on Isengard is one of the most impressive epic battle combos ever seen in a movie. The CGI in The Two Towers is also incredible, no shot looks bad or ugly, with the exception of the brutal and nasty orcs and Uruk-Hai.<br/><br/>Other new characters are brought into trilogy with The Two Towers and while it's nice to see some more good guys fight against the orcs, the movie lacks a spark to make them more lovable. The connection that Jackson establishes with these new characters exists, but it isn't used to the effect that he did with Smeagol and Gollum, which is a true shame.<br/><br/>Regardless of this flaw that affects the movie more than it probably should've, The Two Towers is an great sequel. Some will say that this is the best of the Lord of the Rings movies, which in some ways is true. But compared to how great the first movie in this epic trilogy was, The Two Towers just doesn't create the same impressive feeling that Fellowship of the Ring left."

The action gets under way here, and the characters are separated and overcoming their own problems and battles as the time draws nearer when Frodo must succeed in accomplishing the huge task that he has been assigned. Along the way, friendships grow and more evolve in the most unlikely places. There is plenty of humor, sadness, action, and fantasy in this film.

","The journey to Mount Doom continues for only Sam (Sean Astin) and Frodo (Elijah Wood). The fellowship has been broken, but not entirely. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have stuck together in an attempt to regroup with the captured hobbits (Pippin and Merry). Darkness becomes stronger than ever in Middle Earth as Saruman (Christopher Lee) creates the army of Isengard and Sarun grows more powerful. The adventure grows more perilous in the 2nd part of the epic trilogy.<br/><br/>What can be said more than this is singly one of the greatest films ever created? The acting is phenomenal in this film. The Fellowship showed great supporting roles, but nothing real strong from the main characters which The Two Towers is filled with. Elijah Wood really starts to express the power that the ring posses and Viggo Mortensen gives a performance unlike any other. Gandalf may have been wonderful in the previous film as well as this one, but the other characters really just start to shine in The Two Towers. You really start to see the characters transition into the hero.<br/><br/>The story takes a whole new level in this film also. The adventurers experience Roahn, one of the kingdoms of man for the first time on film and are greeted with grief that has not been seen in the Lord of the Rings films yet. Not to mention the greatest battle scene ever put on film! The battle at Helm's Deep is the most phenomenal battle of all time. It is only a totally different league with battles from other movies like Braveheat or Gladiator. Overall, The Two Towers is one of the greatest films of all time. Enough said!! I highly recommend this film."

","""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" uses the best of contemporary and traditional movie magic for a rousing, romantic adventure tale of good vs. evil, loyalty and love. <br/><br/>From touches of Ray Harryhausen's ""Jason and the Argonauts"" that were among my favorite movie movements as a child as the Ents and a couple of the monsters are charmingly hokey, to the seamlessly multiplying armored, costumed, hairy, made-up extras to the actor/rotoscoped combined astonishment of the twisted Gollum/Smeagle, it's all at the service of the story.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson and company are wonderful at both closely hewing to the story yet skillfully cutting judiciously and adding clarifications that are in the spirit of the original, including using the appendix explanation of Aragorn's love affair with Arwen (incorrectly described as ""doomed"" by one critic -- well, if an eventual mortal life of 50 years together and four kids is ""doomed"" then many of us are doomed!)<br/><br/>The mutual attraction with Eowyn is fit nicely into the ""to be continued"" cliffhanger as I think the double X chromosome viewers are left as eagerly awaiting the conclusion of what happens to Arwen and Aragorn as what happens to the Ring.<br/><br/>David Wenham makes us almost forget Sean Bean as his late brother, and I just figured out that's Hugo Weaving with quite a hair weave as Arwen's disapproving dad. And of course excitingly heroic Viggo is absolutely hunky (and I've thought so since at least ""Walk on the Moon""). <br/><br/>I'll take this thrilling Battle of Helm's Deep over Saving Private Ryan for re-watching (with the second release of the DVD for the deleted scenes). No wonder there's now tours of the places in New Zealand the movie was shot because the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful, even if some of it is mattes.<br/><br/>That's Sheila Chandra vocalizing in the effective music. <br/><br/>(originally written 1/20/2003)"

","The Two Towers really feels like a Medieval action-movie. Though Jackson deviates a bit more from the source-material than in the last film, in some ways this manages to enhance the film. I for instance was not distracted by Gandalf exorcising Saruman out of Theoden and actually felt it was ten times a cooler moment than in the books.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen aka Aragorn now really takes charge for the first time and truly shines as the hero of this film. Gollum's addition to the movie also makes it a lot more powerful (he's so creepy). Unlike some, I have always enjoyed Gimli's excellent comic-performance.<br/><br/>This is a solid films from start to finish and in my view the best LotR film. It even manages to out-do the follow-up ""The Return of the King"".<br/><br/>Jackson has created a truly great series of films."

","Spectacular in every way! <br/><br/>The only thing I did not like was the change to Faramir (-1 point). In the movie, he too is captivated by the Ring and begins in earnest to take Frodo and the Ring to his father, unlike the book. In the book Faramir chooses to ""look the other way"", but he still senses the evil of the Ring. In part we are led to believe that his training under Mithrandir (Gandalf) may have something to do with his knowing not to let his mind linger on the Ring, but rather shun it. He does not take Frodo captive with the intention of taking the Ring to his father, but rather frees Frodo after holding him at the waterfall hideout. <br/><br/>I thought Jackson and co. could have stayed true to the book in this case without losing the effect of the Ring being seductive to everyone. Faramir's shunning of the ring also helps to effectively show the difference between he and his brother. Both having good intentions, but with Faramir being the more ""open-minded"" of the brothers he is thus able to recognize the danger of the Ring, and also know his own weakness in the face of such danger. Aragorn, too, chose to shun the ring, and he too could sense its evil. He was also something of Mithrandir's apprentice (not to mention the Elves'). So there was a logical explanation for them resisting the ring: their training alerting them to the potential danger and the need to avoid it. That could've been explained in lieu of this relatively small change in the story they chose to make."

","...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 fFangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).<br/><br/>***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.<br/><br/>Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I 've been a true lover of epic movies for my past 30 years. I watched them as a cinema- admirer, as a sociologist that I am, but mostly as a simple, middle-ranked, common in mind and ideas person.<br/><br/>What I expect from a movie is to CAPTURE me, to travel me inside its world, to have me. And this one certainly did.<br/><br/>It 's a spectacular movie worthing every inch of celluloid, every single digital bit, every second, every frame spared for it. No doubt about this. This is subjective to tell, something you can see, something that everybody agree to.<br/><br/>Here 's now my objective opinion (which of course is a subject to other objective opinions, and these are subjects to other objective opinions, and that's how -Thank God- the exchange of ideas functions):<br/><br/>First the good ones: We have here a breathtaking plot, full of agony that's keeping the viewer's interest in truly high levels. In favor of this, are the gorgeous landscape shots, the unbelievable sets, the Oscar-worthing visual effects, and some excellent performances with Mr Viggo Mortensen having the leading one. I liked also the one of Mr Mc Cellan's -and the Gollum is something that a sociologist can really stop and take a careful look at. The dramatic finale with this never-seen-before heroic battle where the trio Aragorn- Legolas-Gimli is all the money, gives an enormous boost to the whole set-up. That's the moment when you will absolutely need your pop-corns!<br/><br/>And the bad ones: The movie speaks of values like friendship, true love, dedication, courage. But there 's not once mentioned the name of God. Perhaps this is due to Tolkiens general ""spirit"", though such a movie that has been and will be seen by millions of people - especially young ones - should refer to the value of faith to God."
"kdladage","9","0","0","30 June 2005"," One of the Best Films ever Made
","In my review of the first installment in this trilogy, I wrote:<br/><br/>-----=====-----<br/><br/>It has been tossed around in Hollywood for a long time. The very idea of making a big-budget feature film of the timeless novels is intoxicating. But how do you create a film that is true to the stories (and thus not going to upset the legions of rabid fans that can practically quote the books from start to finish) and still make a film that will attract the non-rabid fan who has vaguely heard of the existence of these books by some author from World War I?<br/><br/>-----=====-----<br/><br/>Well, once again, I do not claim to be a rabid fan (I read the books, I liked the books, and have felt for a long time that they could make a good movie). I also do not claim to be some sort of insider that can give someone the secret to the process that lead to this masterpiece. Just as with the first installment, the cast, crew, writers, producers, and very talented director managed to tell a very good version of the second book's tale...<br/><br/>...as an adaptation, and as a stand-alone movie, I give this an ""8/10"" -- but as the bridge between Fellowship and Return... this movie is nearly flawless.<br/><br/>The only faults I found in the movie deal with the story of Faramir. Had the story of Boromir been actually told in the Fellowship, then this butchering of the Faramir tale would not have been needed. Still, it manages to recover in the end from this failing and tell what is an engaging (if not a bit confusing) story of the path that the ring takes...<br/><br/>Despite this one small shortcoming, the film is a fantastic piece of work that I highly recommend to anyone and everyone. But: I recommend that you watch the extended cut DVD version, and that you plan to sit down for all three films -- because this is not (technically) a stand-alone film. It is just Act 2 of a 3 Act screenplay."

","The one thing Jackson did here that was a HUGE move away from the norm ... notice that none of these DVD's have any trailers for other movies in the beginning of the DVD or any other BS that you have to go through before getting to the actual menu - these three are the only ones out of 200+ DVD's that I own that I can just put in the DVD player and actually be able to watch them without a 5 minute BS runaround of having to try to fast forward through all of the ads and trailers - most of the DVD's out won't even let you access the menu until you watch these forced advertisements ..... I am sure Jackson lost a TON of money by boycotting these things that everyone hates - it is just another example of how he made these excellent movies not for himself or a production company, but for the people that love watching them ... it is very unlikely, but it sure would be nice if others would take a few lessons on philosophy from Pete Jackson - bravo for looking after the people that pay the bills instead of the ones that make all the money from them"

","This was obviously going to be the more ""boring"" of the three movies, since it was only a midway step between the beginning and the end of the quest. It was therefore good of Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh to give the very significant speech of truth to Sam, who states the purpose of the journey right at the end. <br/><br/>I have not given this movie a 10/10. In my mind, The Two Towers was a better movie than the first one, although further away from the Tolkienian idea of it, but it lacked a general ""something"", thus it did not deserve top marks. What I did notice in this movie was a general improvement in the actors. Even Orlando Bloom and Elijah Wood - from various reasons unconvincing in the first movie from my point of view, put up a much better performance and a much more credible one. The ""sliding down the stairs of Helm's deep on a shield"" scene that Orlando had was still unconvincing and funny in a moment which should have been everything but that, but generally he did better.<br/><br/>The Uruk Hai were probably one of the highlights of the movie in my opinion and obviously throwing Aragorn off the cliff was a good move for those people who have not yet read Tolkien - like for instance my brother. With two characters resurrected from the Dead - Gandalf and Aragorn and the clever alternative pictures of Eowyn and Arwen in Aragorn's mind, the plot already gains significantly.<br/><br/>Again, from the point of view of the special effects - they were good because they did not show as special effects - even Gollum was very realistic! To answer the critics who believe that these CGI techniques should have been replaced by models - well, Peter Jackson did try to make everything that he could real life and scale model, but some things are simply undoable!<br/><br/>I generally do not enjoy very much the Frodo-Sam-Gollum scenes because, while Sean Astin probably played his best there, Elijah Wood is still incomplete from my point of view. Faramir, although he was a disappointment for me as a person who read the books, is made more realistic, which fits the general description of the movies. I do understand why Mr. Jackson wanted this fate in store for him, but I still want to see Faramir as a younger and less important copy of Aragorn - a Numenorian.<br/><br/>Since I judge this from the perspective of movie making, I will give it a 9/10 for the small defficiencies it had. Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen and Sean Astin however deserve 10s for their own performances."

","Fellowship of the ring was a great start to the trilogy and Return of the King is the greatest film of its kind ever to be made so where does that leave The Two Towers. To run the story on nice and smoothly and keep everyone on the edge of their seat for The Return of the King it was important that The Two Towers made that happen and it did with flashing results. The most important thing about The Two towers was how much it was different to the Fellowship. More characterization is what makes this film a great one as we finally get to know more of Legolas, Merry and pippin and more of Aragon who is closer to becoming the King. The photography here is the most impressive out of the entire trilogy which leaves it for a great story which leads them to Helms Deep for probably the great battle ever to be screened on the big Screen.<br/><br/>What will remember most for The Two Towers is that this is the film that introduced Gollum. We see a snippet of him in the Fellowship but here he comes out into the light like never before. Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mount Doom to destroy the one ring, Aragon, Legolas and Gimili follow the path to where Merry and pippin have been kidnapped as well as seeing some new characters thrown into the mix. Faramir who's brother is none other than Boromir from The fellowship continues his quest and of course the re-introduction to Gandalf the grey who has now become Gandalf the white. Together they join together to fight off the evil Saurman who intends on Sauron's orders to destroy middle earth and bring him the one ring to bring Sauron to complete strength.<br/><br/>The Two Towers has everything you could probably want in a fantasy film and has more battle sequences than any of the films. Even though it's not a sequel, more a second chapter, it still exceeds it's critics but if I was to say which of the three films was the least watch able then it like asking a father who's his best child out of his family, you cannot simply ask a question, all I can say is that Lord of the Ring has brought a new way at looking at films which makes it a masterpiece in its own right."

","The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers succeeds over the theatrical version of 'Fellowship' but to a certain degree.<br/><br/>Now the Fellowship has been split apart, Aragorn, Gimli and Elf Boy are off doing their own thing with Rohan against Saruman. Merry and Pippin are off with the Ents (or talking trees), and Frodo and Sam must entrust their lives to Gollum in order to make it to Mordor.<br/><br/>First thing I must talk of is the downs of this film. While the extended edition fleshes the characters out better, the theatrical film for 'The Two Towers' does not do that as best as possible. Some people, like Faramir are left mostly undeveloped. Don't worry, the extended cut takes care of this problem.<br/><br/>While many people complain about Faramir's decision in the film, I actually kind of like that idea (since Frodo and Sam end up in close to that place anyway). The only problem with this change (or really addition) is that it seems like an idea that wasn't fully developed before filming it.<br/><br/>Only several other things left me a bit mift with the film. One, was the fact that PJ didn't have the scenes in chronological order like I was hoping he would. That, in the end, doesn't matter really, since the inserting of different timeframes adds to the drama here.<br/><br/>I hadn't read the book yet when I saw this movie, but I did know there was a showdown with Saruman at the end. Unfortunately, that has been saved until the Return of the King extended edition. I was also expecting from the film a sort of blueish - gray overtone, especially a rainy battle throughout the Helm's Deep sequence.<br/><br/>While this is definitely the weakest of the trilogy, that is not to say its a bad movie. Its actually very good. Gollum is done with utmost perfection, getting even better in part 3. The acting is solid (though Legolas and Gimli need to stop the annoying puns. This takes away from the drama).<br/><br/>As for the conclusion to the Helm's Deep sequence, simply breathtaking. It's an almost Biblical kind of ending, seeing Gandalf the White ride down with the army against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>This film is my 5th favorite movie."

Instead of focusing on the Hobbits and what these characters have to go threw to believe that they can destroy evil.

","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a worthy sequel to the outstanding The Fellowship of the Ring.  It is much darker than its predecessor in both mood and in the very coloration of the film itself.  The initial scenes as the audience falls through the inky blackness of the mines of Moria, following the epic duel between Gandalf and the inferno that is the Balrog, sets the tone for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the first film has splintered into three groups  Merry and Pippin have been captured by Uruk-hai, and are now being tracked by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  Frodo and Sam are slowly edging nearer to the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor where they can destroy the terrible burden that is the ring.  In their quest they are aided by the wonderfully dichotomous character that is Gollum/Smeagol.  And The Two Towers really is Gollum's film.  He is a triumph of digital wizardry that the audience will both loathe and wish redemption for.<br/><br/>The other major computer-generated characters  Treebeard and his ilk  are perhaps not so successfully believable; although few viewers could fail to be moved by the `last march of the Ents'.  The settings are simply stunning; both the natural scenery of windswept plains and craggy mountains, and the built sets, such as the Kingdom of Rohan that echoes the Viking settlements of old.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of the Battle of Helm's Deep, where (despite being a supposedly purpose-bred fighting force) the Uruk-hai are massacred by a handful of men, Gandalf prophesies that `the battle for Middle Earth is about to begin'.  The audience is left to ponder what further horrors, heartbreaks and triumphs are in store for the adventurers."

","It was inevitable that the crew behind this trilogy would take some liberties with Tolkien's work and here they are.<br/><br/>I was frustrated with the movies journey into the appendices of Tolkien and slower pace than the first. A few elements were also seemingly unnecessary like Legolas's efficiency with the bow seems to change just for the sake of one scene. I mean, sure, war is unpredictable, but it could definitely been set up better. The story of Aragorn and Arwen is a prominent part of the film which is in the written trilogy's appendices and it seems to slow the movie down. Elrond speaks to Arwen for a long time in one scene, but his point can be reduced to one sentence. Also the movie doesn't catch up with the book, due to all the extra content, and ends well before the source.<br/><br/>But despite this, and a few other things, the movie is very well made. And it can be looked as not an adaptation of the books, but as an adaptation of Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth. That way, all the extra anecdotes don't seem so out of place. 8/10"

It really gave a sense of the fear, and that's what makes a great movie: allowing the audience to feel the scene rather than just see it.<br/><br/>Another favorite scene is from the extended edition, the scene with Boromir and Faramir.

"ghart27","10","0","0","29 May 2004"," Excellent presentation, but rewritten by orcs. Garh!
","We must be very happy that such a monumental effort was put into a (fairly) faithful presentation of the written version. However, there are some aspects which cause discontent. First, the ""rewriting"" of a classic, especially this one which was so masterfully told in the first place by J.R.R.Tolkien, is the work of orcs. Related to this is a diminishing of the character of Aragorn. He is presented as somebody who rises to leadership more by accident than by anything else. His faithfulness, and the dominance of his character, are dragged in the dirt by the limpness of his presentation in the movie. It isn't because of Viggo Mortensen's acting - that is first-rate. Rather, those who prepared the script for the movie caused awkward damage to a masterpiece of creation. Did they not believe that a character like Aragorn could be believed by innocent moviegoers? Halbarad of the Dunedain has also become the captain of a troop of elvan archers (and an Elf himself), which doesn't arise from the conditions of Middle Earth presented by Tolkien - the Elves all had work enough to defend their own homes! In short, many of the scenes of the movie have been ""written down"" to a limper, less-interesting and less-inspiring story which contains inconsistencies that the book does not. However, in spite of that, I enjoy the chance to SEE Middle-Earth and some of its stories."
"rapt0r_claw-1","10","0","0","31 May 2004"," The second installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy proves itself as an amazing feat.
","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a movie which, surprisingly, took together the countless elements that made its predecessor so great, trimmed and added, and came up with a result better than the first movie. The epic tale of the Fellowship of the Ring continues, though the Company be broken. The One Ring must be destroyed.<br/><br/>The second part of JRR Tolkien's gigantic novel (""Six books, three parts, one novel,"" in his own words) is less true to the source material than the first movie. This is because the details and facts in the Two Towers are more difficult to translate onto film. <br/><br/>The emotional impact of the film really hits you. There are epic scenes of huge battles, some in slow-motion, and the music helps a lot. Besides that, there are the tearful scenes, and the nightmarish mood swings of Gollum under cover of darkness. All are spellbinding, and all viewers are powerless to resist.<br/><br/>The acting is as good as it gets. Elijah Wood plays the Ringbearer Frodo very well, though the character himself I find a bit annoying. Nonetheless, Frodo is meant to be courageous and reluctant to carry on with the quest, and that is what Wood portrays as well as is possible.<br/><br/>
Viggo Mortensen is still the worn Ranger Aragorn, although he is halfway changed in preparation for the final movie. He is essentially the same character, and the audience hangs on his every word and every action.<br/><br/>
Ian McKellen will always be Gandalf in my memory. Reading the book, I can imagine McKellen as Gandalf and no one else will fit. But this time around he is Gandalf the White. His acting is flawless, and conveys a sense of unlimited wisdom and compels trust, and you think ""Gandalf will find a way to fix it,"" with every obstacle that the characters face, and the characters who look up to him think the same way.<br/><br/>The special effects are even better than in the previous movie, either that or they have a better chance to shine. Certainly the addition of Ents and more Orcs will be a better showcase for the technology than a few orcs and a Balrog from the first. Regardless, the effects are mindblowing. The highlight is Gollum, who is just perfect. His expressions are swift to change, but there is no flaw to mar those changes. The voice is superb, and Gollum is my personal pick for the star of the movie.<br/><br/>The only problem that might be present in the Two Towers is the switching from location to location. It is a bit annoying at certain points, more so than the other two movies. But it's just a small flaw amongst a sea of success, so many will not notice. <br/><br/>The Two Towers is an amazing movie. The Lord of the Rings trilogy gets better and better with each movie. The Two Towers is true to the book, and a thrilling tale of action and emotion. But the One Ring remains in Middle-earth, waiting to be found. But Sauron will have to wait for the Return of the King to get another chance."

","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>It's difficult to imagine what these posts would have looked like had I written them when I first viewed these films.  Now, I'm writing them having seen the extended editions of FOTR and TT and the advantage of having seen ROTK more times than I care to admit.  I know that some of the issues I had with TT were resolved in ROTK - the main one being the apparent character assassination of Faramir.  In the book he rejects the ring utterly, yet in the film he comes close to falling under it's spell.  However, the extended edition and ROTK highlights the nature of his relationship with Denethor and things start to make much more sense.<br/><br/>TT also sees the introduction of my favourite character in the books - Eowyn.  Although I enjoyed Arwens extended pony ride with Frodo, I'm not sure why Jackson felt he needed another feisty female when Eowyn was waiting in the wings.  Fortunately he came to his senses and Arwen went back to hanging around looking pretty and pale.  I've never understood how Aragorn can choose Arwen over Eowyn, but hey, his loss is Faramir's gain.<br/><br/>Miranda Otto was absolutely superb as Eowyn.  She was strong, yet vulnerable, beautiful and cold, everything she should have been.  Her scenes with Wormtongue really stood out for me, and the dialogue that belonged to Aragorn in the text fitted well in the scene over Theodred's death bed.  And I can't talk about Eowyn without mentioning Theoden.  Bernard Hill broke my heart completely in both this and ROTK.  His rejuvenation by Gandalf, his love for his niece, his internal conflicts, and above all, his grief for his son.  Bernard made Theoden a better man than he was in the book - where he comes across as a reflection of Denethor without the rings corrupting influence.  His tendency to doom and self destruction is still there, but Aragorn's influence tempers that.<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin continued to delight me as faithful portrayals of their characters from the book.  They make a refreshing contrast from the heavier stuff with Sam and Frodo.  And of course, Gollum.  Watching Smeagol struggle to overcome his demons and ultimately failing is gut wrenching.  And considering that he's a CGI character that's incredible.  Unlike the awful Jar-Jar, one completely accepts Gollum as a real person.  Even though he doesn't like po-tay-toes."
"georgie0207","Null","0","0","5 May 2004"," The Lord of The Rings: The Film and the Fantasy
","Since hitting our screens three years ago, the phenomenon that is The Lord Of The Rings has brought an enchanting tale of magic, wizardry, elves, dwarfs and hobbits to life.  Four years ago, a virtually unknown Kiwi director was on the brink of something wonderful.  Peter Jackson had been concentrating his efforts on The Lord Of The Rings for years and desperately needed a blessing from a major studio.  That blessing came with New Line Cinema, a studio that invested $270 million as a budget for Jackson.  With this budget, Jackson began a mammoth 15-month shoot in order to get the filming for all three films done in one go.  The amount of editing and special effects put into the film after filming was enormous.  The trilogy contains approximately 1200 special effect shots, more than any other film in history.        Jackson and his co-writers, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens were aware they were making films for the hard-core Tolkein fans and tried to stay true to the books, but eventually due to timing, some scenes had to be cut considerably in order for the films pace to keep moving and the story to keep flowing.  They have done an excellent job of condensing more than 500 pages of text into a script that doesn't feel choppy, uneven or rushed. The Two Towers' vast scope ranges from the snowy unspoiled peaks of Middle-earth, which was shot entirely in New Zealand, to the city of Isengard, a combination of models and computer-generated imagery.  Our hero, Frodo (Elijah Wood) continues his quest in destroying the evil One Ring that his uncle passed on to him.  Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) departs on his quest across the plains of Middle-earth to salvage what's left of mankind; he embarks on this with Legolas the elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies). Jackson makes a relatively small part of Tolkein's book into the centrepiece of his film; the battle of Helm's Deep.  A thirty-minute spectacle, where even a bit of comedy creeps in.  While an impressive use of special effects gives the battle a distinct charm, Jackson does not let the computer graphics overpower the human element of what's going on.  The sheer size of the sequence is awe-inspiring in particular the Orcs' raising their spears, which seem to go on for miles.  Jackson has managed to stage and shoot this scene with extreme clarity.  It's not that Jackson is succeeding on an epic scale here, it's that he's working on a scale most directors wouldn't dare do. Tolkein purists who didn't like the changes made in The Fellowship of the Ring will most likely be outraged at the amount of changes made in the second instalment.  The Two Towers differs much more than Fellowship purely because it's stuck in the 'middle chapter' section of the trilogy. Jackson has managed, however, to keep the tone and spirit of Tolkein's The Lord of the Rings throughout the second film. Jackson has used The Lord Of The Rings to re-invent fantasy for the cinema and with The Two Towers it seems very clear that we are in the midst of one of the great achievements in fantasy filmmaking and in epic filmmaking."

","The Two Towers proceeds from where FOTR left us. It starts with a flashback of Gandalf's fall in Moria and exactly what happened. Then the movie goes on...three hours of absolute movie magic. The Two Towers, contrary to my fears (that it might not live up to my expectations after watching the trailer) turned out to be brilliant. PJ, again at his best! I went to watch this movie at a theatre twice and I wanted to watch it over and over again. Man, again LOTR on the top! I cried so many times (I cried less in FOTR and much more in ROTK). And what was the most inspiring was Sam's dialogue towards the end of the movie in Osgiliath.<br/><br/>The movie again is pure greatness...it was so brilliant. It was a long wait from FOTR to TTT though. But worth the wait. I loved every bit of the movie so much.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with the Oscars. I thought this time it was really unfair that the Two Towers did not get recognition for its brilliance. And Chicago (that crappy movie) won Best Picture! I was really shocked.<br/><br/>

"rosalee_adams","Null","0","0","26 March 2004"," Amazing in many ways.......
","I very reluctantly came to view the first installment, Lord of the Rings, Fellowshp of the Rings, and during the first hour it immediately picked up my interest for a number of reasons. At the end of the first film, Frodo Baggins packs up his companion, Samwise Gamgee, and they are off in a boat. I realized then that it was not enough to leave them on their own, but I wanted to find out what would happen not only to these two Hobbits but the rest of the characters who I had come to like very much. Yesterday I rented Twin Towers and was going to watch an hour only, but LOR is very much like eating popcorn..... once you start it is hard to stop.<br/><br/>I am writing not so much to speak of what happened and about the way it was directed and the actors who were involved, but the way the story affected me personally. Let me give you just two examples. In the scene where Gandalf the White comes into the grand hall to try to resurrect Theoden, the king of Rohan. When he is finally able and Theoden comes out of this spell and is restored, I cried. My mother, for the final four years of her life was robbed like the king.........only hers was not a spell it was Parkinsons...... How I wish I could have had someone come in and do that for her.......to restore her...... In the scene where the stronghold is being overrun by the forces of evil, the character Haldir, is fatally wounded and Aragorn comes to him in his dying moments, to try to bring some comfort. I was reminded of how many are dying just like that in Iraq and the many others who have in the past suffered the same consequences as a result of war. My sister placed a perspective this morning on the emotions I felt, as I watched Twin Towers, by saying that Tolkien envisioned this when he wrote this epic.....of the many struggles, the sacrifice, the nobility that is shown in the face of overwhelming odds. I am hopeful to see the final installment this weekend.<br/><br/>I believe this is in fact the greatest epic that has ever been done on film."
"BadWebDiver","8","0","0","22 March 2004"," ""Fish & Chips"" scene brilliant
","I just want to say that the ""fish & chips"" argument between Gollum and Samwise in this film is one of my favorite pieces of dramatization.<br/><br/>It works because the scene reveals so much about the characters and the underlying themes of the story, without the whole thing sounding like a self-conscious English Literature essay. With Gollum having total spasms about the way Sam's ""ruining"" the food, and Sam stuck in the traditional ways of Hobbit cooking, the interaction between the conflicting character points of view is brilliantly realized in a novel and interesting way. It's in scenes like this where dramatization really works best.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I have to say in contrast that the big ""important stories"" speech in both the white city scene and at the end when the two hobbits are walking off is one of the worst pieces of heavy-handed moralizing I've ever heard. It sound really labored and forced and really doesn't fit the context of the situation too well at all.<br/><br/>The Helms Deep battle is certainly a highlight of the movie - in fact the whole trilogy! It's very well set-up and executed (pardon the pun!); while providing some great character interaction. I personally enjoyed the comic relief moments with the rivalry between Gimli and Legolas. Legolas' style at mounting his transport was very impressive. <br/><br/>Some of the best character moments in this movie is when Frodo defends Gollum to Samwise, and also Merry and Pippin play off each other very well while being held by the Orcs, then running and meeting Treebeard. And the final battle of the Ents with Sauroman is a great climactic moment."
"bnl771","Null","0","0","4 March 2004"," Second part of the best trilogy ever made
","The movie opens with a return to Moria where Gandalf and the Balrog are at a standoff. This familiar scene, however, takes a new twist and instead of following the remainder of the fellowship to their grief, we follow Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellan) into the forgotten chasms below even Moria. Before we can learn his ultimate fate, we are brought back to where we left off in The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) have made little progress on their trek towards Mordor where they must return the one ring to the fiery pits from whence it came. Frodo is falling more and more under the control of the ring and the spirits of both of the hobbits is waning in light of the incredible length of the journey thus far and the unknown distance they must still travel. It is not long, though, before they run into the ring's owner prior to Bilbo- Gollum.<br/><br/>Gollum is a wonder to behold. Every bit of hype about the complexity, believability and dramatic effect of this digital character is deserved. As in the books, Gollum is an immensely important character to the movies and there was no room for error when presenting him onscreen. As he continues on the journey with Frodo and Sam, Gollum continues to be a dramatic entity like none other and his motives are never entirely clear.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are hot on the trail of Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd). As you may recall, the two hobbits were captured and whisked away by the evil Uruk-Hai. The trail leads the three into the land of Rohan which is in turmoil under the weak leader ship of King Theoden. Theoden is a thin shadow of his previous self, we learn, and we discover this situation is not what it seems. Through the help of the malicious Grima Wormtounge (Brad Dourif), Saruman (Christopher Lee) has gained control of Theoden in order to weaken the kingdom of Rohan to insure its defeat in the war waged by Sauron.<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin, it turns out, have escaped the Uruk-Hai but have come under the control of another, less malicious force- an ent by the name of Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davis). Treebeard is a walking, talking tree that, at first, mistakes the hobbits for orcs. This storyline is the weakest and was the most cut up of the plot lines. It will be restored in the upcoming extended edition however.<br/><br/>This movie is an epic in itself and the plot outlined above all unfolds in the first 45 minutes of the three hour film. Needless to say, you should not, under any circumstances, attempt to watch this film without seeing The Fellowship of the Ring. Peter Jackson made the genius decision to pickup in this film where the first left off and spends absolutely no time recapping the previous adventures of these characters. Instead, he fills the entire three hours with new plot, more character driven story and epic adventure and action. The whole film culminates in the most viscerally engaging and technically detailed on-screen battle ever witness. The battle of Helm's Deep will most likely leave you breathless.<br/><br/>Jackson and his crew have crafted a living universe here. Every costume, every weapon, every plant and every creature looks as if it belongs. This is Middle-earth. The cinematography is darker in this film (due to the obvious shift in tone) and the direction and camera work is just as gorgeous as in the first film. There are no weak links in the chain of actors that have been asked to bring the characters of Middle-earth alive. Each and everyone lives and breathes their characters.<br/><br/>What The Lord of the Rings series comes down to is a masterfully epic story about a hobbit. While these movies could have been overwhelmed by special effects and CGI, Jackson understands the soul of the books were not in the creatures and the battles, but in the characters that have to do things that go against their very nature in order to bring harmony back into their world. The Two Towers is a perfect middle section to this trilogy and, like The Fellowship of the Ring, leaves us with a cliff-hanger and a good reason to go see the next film. When all is said and done, these three films will forever be discussed as part of film history."

I was not so keen on the constant fighting in the movie and preferred the first sequel because it had more adventurous scenes and introduced you to some fascinating creatures, such as the elfs and of course the hobbits.  I loved the hobbits and thought they were so funny, their jokes and fun sense of humour can make anyone feel cheerful again. <br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed that the women in the movie didn't play such a big part.

I say this because it is the second of the movies and has to live upto the first one, it clearly doesn't follow the movie legend that sequels aren't as good as their originals. The other thing I love about the two towers is that it has to bridge a gap between the first and the third, it has to establish more new characters,that is not an easy feat. For example Faramir, Gollum, Eowyn, Eomer and Theoden all have to be established to be carried on to the third movie. Sure it isn't action packed like Return of the King but it was definetly the hardest to pull off."

","Finally!  The wait to see Gollum is over, after merely a snippet appearance in the first film.  And I have to admit, they did him justice.  These films are so far fetched (the whole wizards and warriors thing) that if the level of effects drop for just a second, the entire story can eat itself because the viewer is pulled out of that world.  Bad effects can make or break a film like this.<br/><br/>Luckily for Peter Jackson, the verdict is in, and his team did an EXCELLENT job every frame of this movie.  This is done better than my imagination when reading the book!  Every frame belongs in a museum, as true works of art. Effects are amazing - character work rivaling Yoda and other digital characters we've seen, and pushing the envelope.  Every setting is pristine. Every facet was done properly, and the viewer is immersed the whole time.

What about the strong Eomer, who protects his beloved Rohan even if exiled? What about his sister Eowyn, so thin, so pale, but also so determined?<br/><br/>I am not saying that ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Return of the King"" are less visually and emotionally powerful. I mean, the first lacks many of my favourite characters -- Theoden, Eomer, Faramir, Aldir (!!), whereas the third is mostly about Frodo: my poor Legolas just says three or four lines. I admit that maybe my delusion is due to the great expectations I had about the third episode. However, ""The Two Towers"" never betrays Tolkien's fans, even if they could look at it endlessly. I love ""The Lord of the Rings"", and I love the second film more than the others. It is just a personal opinion, but who will forget the battle of Helm's Deep?"

I've already gone on about it to anyone that will listen for hours on end.<br/><br/>So all I will say is that you have to see this film.

","""The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring"" started a craze within Hollywood over the buzz the series created. The follow-up, ""The Two Towers"" builds up on it, but in the end leaves us wanting a real ending. The film improves on it's action content, mostly within it's last third act, which we are shown an army of minions battling those against them in Helm's Deep, a last resort for poor villagers surrounding it from the evil of Sarumon. The film takes us on varied journeys of the now broken up fellowship and what each of the fellowship endure to fight for what they believe in: a little hobbit by the name of Frodo, who now we see is being taken down slowly by the ring and those who were taken down as well by it, in the form of a little creature known as Gollum, a computer generated creation so lifelike and realistic, you take it as just another actor within the film. The film has stunning cinematography and takes the best of New Zealand (The location of the filming) for it's depiction of Middle-Earth. The film, however, may wow audiences with the added action but may leave them lost in a haze from the hard, fast-paced plot setting as new characters, locations, and moments are thrown in left and right. But it's not too much to worry about if you stay focused on the story and don't get overwhelmed from the action. The coordination with the film is put nicely and smoothly, except towards the end of the action where areas and scenes are disoriented and confusing, but it shouldn't matter too much. If there was one problem with the film it'd be for the ending. The film leaves you wanting more, which is a classic film gimmick, but by ""wanting more"" it's meant as wanting a more understandable ending. We're left seeing the Hobbits on their way to Mount Doom through a forest with no reasoning on the others (That is too plausible). But aside from the lackluster ending, the film leads gracefully onto act three of the series and gets you wanting more so bad it'll eat you inside...like a little ring we might know of...

","Now, after I've seen all 3 ""The Lord Of The Rings"" movies I have to say that TTT is my personal favourite. I think it's the best cuz it has the most action (I adore the battle of Helm's Deep!), a wonderful story and the greatest characters (my favs are Théodén and Gandalf). Thinking back at the Oscars 2003 I'm a bit dissappointed but they get another chance this year. I'm also very sad that TROTK is the last one cuz I've been looking forward the whole year to TLOTR and now it's over. So I'll buy the Extended DVD!"
"kingtanichi","Null","0","0","22 January 2004"," Uneven but awesome
","After my first viewing, this film left me virtually paralyzed. After a few subsequent viewings and gaining some objectivity, I'll concede it's not quite as good as The Fellowship of the Ring, but still sublime.<br/><br/>The main reason is that it's uneven. Rather than just one journey featuring nine characters, we now have three storylines, each covering the exploits of a third of the Fellowship. The Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli thread is the real meat of the film, and the most satisfying. The Merry/Pippin thread is the slightest, and while it does contain some good moments, there's also some borderline-propaganda moral grandstanding that's always grated a bit. The Ents are decently executed, but not industry-redefining. It's the Frodo/Sam segments that are always the dubious ones. They're stilted at the start, cliched at times on the way through, and veer into saccharine territory at the end.<br/><br/>However, if the treatment of the returning cast is imperfect, the new cast members are dead on. Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, Wormtongue, and Faramir all work perfectly in their parts, making the dramatic experience of this movie very different from FOTR. Sean Bean's Boromir is sorely missed, but his absence doesn't kill the movie. The one complaint about all the new blood though, is that they seem to cut into Gandalf's screen time. This is critical, as Ian Mckellen's peerless performance was one of the greatest things FOTR had going for it, and his greater amount of screen time is the deciding factor in why I still think it's the superior movie.<br/><br/>The centerpiece of The Two Towers, however, is obviously the battle at Helm's Deep. It takes up virtually the film's entire third act, and contains not only some of the best large-scale action ever filmed, but also, miraculously, a lot of the film's best dialogue. The surfeit of sword and arrow action is impressive, no doubt, but Viggo Mortensen's commanding performance elevates it, and Bernard Hill's ingeniously lit, deeply moving monologue before the battle should have netted him an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there's Gollum. Andy Serkis gives perhaps the film's best performance from beneath a layer of pixels. Despite a few scenes where the illusion is more apparent than others (never obvious, mind you), but the vast majority of the time, it's a watershed for digital characters. Gollum makes you forget Jar Jar Binks ever existed, especially in the inspired schizophrenia scene.<br/><br/>On the rare occasions when it's bad, it's mediocre at worst. When it's good -- which is most of the time -- it's masterful. In the end, The Two Towers is an excellent film."

","""The Two Towers"" is possibly the greatest since the glory days of film. This is possibly the first film ever when actors are perfectly cast as their characters.  Pippin and Merry rule!  I thought I would never see such great scene-stealing in a fantasy, let alone on film.  The battles are an example for what an action film should be: emphasizing the plot, and giving reason for the destruction.  If you want the ultimate experience, buy the extended edition DVD and see the gobs and gobs of things that wasn't there when you saw the movie or rented the previous DVD.   I'm really sad that Gollum couldn't win (let alone be nominated) for an Oscar or a Golden Globe, which would usually be a bit lenient.  Even though I haven't seen ""Return of the King"" yet, if it doesn't get its last praise, also known as Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and/or an acting prize (because they'll definitely win a Special Effects prize at the least) then I'll be angered, if not cuckoo!"

","I have to admit, I wasn't as hooked on Two Towers as I was hooked on Fellowship. For the first viewing, that is.

The battle for HELMS DEEP is one of the most intense, action packed scenes ever filmed. Therefore, sensitive young children should not see this movie. If you have young kids, leave them at home and let them watch it in a few years time. This trilogy will be the benchmark in movie making for DECADES, so it will still be here when your kids grow up.

"jantoniou","10","0","0","28 December 2003"," What can be said - slightly short of a masterpiece
","(minor interstitial spoilers) At least three-quarters of this movie is perfect - every scene, every character, every shot evenly and perfectly bears the weight of the entire movie.  Though I felt some shots and characters were, perhaps, slightly wasted, in context it seems trivial.  The ending 40-45 minutes could have been smoother--thus the one-quarter I am less confident about--and it certainly was dragging at the end.  I overheard several people leaving the theater wondering aloud when the movie was going to end.  Perhaps it was the late hour--our showing didn't let out until after midnight. <br/><br/>
Peter Jackson executes with a sure and confident hand in ROTK. His direction and editing is masterful and he brings his actors--who, frankly, were lacking in the previous films--up to the task in this final movie.  I think the length of this production and the years the cast and crew spent making these films comes together to near-flawless effect in ROTK. <br/><br/>
The previous films were substantially flat in comparison.  They were ""good"" and sometimes ""bad"" and almost never ""great.""  I really think the actors - most of whom were not especially ""great"" actors before the Ring series - with the exception of Ian McKellan and Cate Blanchett, though she was essentially a beautiful mute in all previous - and Jackson himself, a B-grade horror movie director hitherto, didn't have great dramatic footing in the first two.  Even though the story was clear, he didn't really know how to tell it in the first two films.  Whatever his vision was, it fell short.  The same cannot be said of ROTK. <br/><br/>The battle for Minas Tirith I think will be remembered as one of the great battle scenes shot on film.  The near-seamless combination of live action and CGI has set a new standard.  It is breathtaking work and a real revelation of filmmaking craftsmanship.<br/><br/>The only big dramatic ""flaw"" was the final anticlimactic battle at Mordor--even as you saw overwhelming numbers of baddies surrounding the armies of Gondor, you already knew that Mordor would be defeated.  I have never read the books but even I was aware that Frodo and Sam would succeed in tossing the ring into the volcano.  <br/><br/>I didn't get a specific sense that the final 45 minutes or so were a tacked-on tying up of loose ends.  It felt more like the dramatic energy was running thin, like everyone on the set was essentially running out of steam (and who can blame them?).  Maybe it was deliberately played down because, after all, this isn't a ""Hollywood Ending"" kind of movie that can have a flaming building smoking in the background and a spiffy little remark as the credits close like a ""Die Hard"" or ""Rambo""-type franchise.  <br/><br/>
In the final analysis--if there is such a thing--it is nearly impossible to dismiss the whole because of any part of it.  So much of it is composed and delivered so masterfully that the minor flaws are ultimately very easily excused.  I found myself very satisfied that a movie, especially such an epic one, had been done so well--so often I find parts of movies great in certain aspects but other aspects act to effectively kick the leg of a table out and destroy the whole composition.  ROTK has all its legs fully intact and strong at the end and we're very pleased to have watched it."

","I saw Two Towers on dvd and i have to day it's a huge improvement on the first part. I remember reading Tolkien many many years ago and the main thing I liked about the novels was the calm and easy manner in which he created a world where men co-existed with elves, dwarves, orcs, hobbits, and what not. This magical sweep which permeates every page of Tolkien's writing was somehow absent in the first part, for me at least. Don't know why (have seen both films only once) but maybe it was that Peter Jackson had to spend a lot of time establishing characters and premise in part one. But Two Towers suffers no such problem. It captures the magical world of middle earth beautifully, a world not unlike our own, but yet so unlike ours, in that it is far more ancient, magical and most of all, full of natural wonders. It is a world where the earth has not yet been divorced from its ancient past. ***SPOILER BEGINS*** Trees talk, huge masses go to war, men form allegiances with elves, fortresses crumble, romance blossoms and even dies, elves wander off to strange places, forests whisper, kings fall into the grasp of evil and wither away, men get saved by strange powers, ***SPOILER ENDS*** strange creatures transformed by their own consciences inhabit the periphery of evil (Gollum is completely kick ass) and more and more. I'm not from the West so at some level all this mythology (which was at the core of Tolkien's writing) is not mine. But I'm a huge fan of its charm and wisdoms. And that exactly is what has started to permeate the Lord of the Rings movies. Am eagerly awaiting Part Three now."

But, as far as humans go-the movie belongs to the precious Eowyn, who I think is gorgeous for a Shieldmaiden of Rohan and Eomer, who has loves for horses.

New Zealand is a great place to make movies.<br/><br/>The movie was very epic.  The acting was good as was the story.  There weren't really any moments you had to cringe at, as in, parts that were unintentionally funny or bad looking.  Fellowship had the battle between Gandalf and Sauruman that looked kind of cheesy with him spinning around on the floor.  But any problems the first one had are not present in the second.<br/><br/>There were only a few things I didn't really like.  First, I thought the slow motion was kind of overdone.  Second, Sean Connery shouldn't have turned down the role of Gandalf.  Whoever played him (I'm not sure) did a good job, but Sean Connery is still Sean Connery.  That one wasn't really a problem with the movie, but was a way to make the movie better.<br/><br/>The battle at the end was very good.

THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, (although this last one has always been controversial.)<br/><br/>Now TTT can be added to that list, and I daresay that RETURN OF THE KING will probably follow it. Peter Jackson and his crew have not simply brought the once-considered unfilmable bulk of J.R.R. Tolkien's world from the printed page to the big screen.

","After director Peter Jackson's exciting and emotionally affecting first chapter in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy you would think he could do no wrong. While The Two Towers continues to up the stakes in terms of action and pure escapism it does not quite live up the sheer perfection of Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>TTT starts exactly where Fellowship left off. Frodo and Sam continue on their quest to Mordor while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are on the trail of the orcs who took Merry and Pippin. The story follows three distinct threads (that of Frodo and Sam, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and Merry and Pippin), unlike FotR, which was quite linear in its storytelling.<br/><br/>
The introduction of new characters such as Gollum (a work of technical genius), Eowyn (played with perfect restraint by Miranda Otto), Faramir (David Wenham) and Grima Wormtongue helps to keep the story interesting.<br/><br/>
Though much complaint has been aimed at Faramir's out of character behaviour, in regards to the source material, and other deterrence's from the book. I wholeheartedly understand why the writers took these minor liberties with the direction that was taken with his character, as it no doubt works better for the film.<br/><br/>The majority of TTT basically foreshadows what is to come in Return of the King and also sets up the most exciting aspect of this movie, the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle is technically impressive, with ingenious cinematography from Andrew Lesnie, brilliant choreography of fight scenes and a perfect score from Howard Shore to compliment the action and heighten the tension.<br/><br/>
I do have my complaints though. The fact this is the bridging chapter is noticeable and while some of the film's weaknesses can be attributed to this, no good reason can be given for the extremely slow pacing of the first 90 minutes. This is primarily due to some extremely annoying editing and writing choices that detract from the overall movie. Arwen's scenes and the unneeded, and somewhat underwhelming, Warg Rider battle simply don't add anything worthwhile to the story. Several scenes that can now be seen on TTT Extended Edition would have been better suited to the theatrical cut.<br/><br/>
Had the omission of Arwen's plot been considered, allowing for the insertion of some truly satisfying material (such as Aragorn's revelation to Eowyn that he is 87 years old and the Entwash scene), The Two Towers, in my eyes, would have been the perfect bridging chapter between FotR and RotK. As it stands a good 30 minutes could have been edited out of the theatrical version and this movie would surely be more deserving of the praise it receives.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a slightly disappointing middle chapter to what is becoming one of the greatest movie series ever made. Quality is one thing this series will be associated with and TTT continues this trend with its meticulous attention to detail, brilliant special effects and impressive acting.<br/><br/>8 out of 10           EE - 9 out of 10"

","The Fellowship Of The Ring was an incredible film and an incredible achievement. Peter Jackson and his team got so much right that the tiny flaws seem hardly worthy of mention,and some of these were even ironed out in the Extended Version of the film.<br/><br/>The Two Towers manages to be almost,but not quite,as brilliant. Once again we are immersed in a superbly detailed and convincing fantasy world that has great effects and awesome action but also strong characterisation. There are very few scenes that don't use special effects in some way,the film is packed with ""wow""-type spectacle,but we are never allowed to forget about the people at the heart of the story.<br/><br/>Another terrific film,than,but sadly several flaws make it just a bit inferior to Fellowship. The film does not flow quite as well,with Jackson never completely solving the problem of cutting back and forth from different stories. Some parts seem overly rushed while other bits are dragged out,for example Merry and Pippin's encounters with the Ents only take up about 7 or 8 mins while the lead up to the Battle of Helm's Deep takes forever.<br/><br/>Sadly,Jackson also felt a need to tamper with the source material far more than in Fellowship. This is partly because he leaves out the last few chapters of the book,and therefore has to invent a great deal,may be not a big problem for those who have not read the book,but the story seems very stretched out and some of the added occurrences,such as Aragorn's separation from his companions,and his flashbacks of Arwen,seem like padding and make the middle hour drag a bit too much. Because Frodo and Sam's encounter with Shelob is missing,there was felt a need to invent another climactic story element with Frodo and Sam,but the whole Faramir/Osgilliath subplot feels hurried,as if it was made up on the spot,which it possibly was.However,the elves arrival at Helm's Deep works superbly.<br/><br/>Still,there is so much that is great about The Two Towers. It has a commendable different feel to it then Fellowship,somewhat more realistic and a lot more humorous,this does not entirely work but kudos for trying not to give us too much of the same. A few action sequences seem rushed but the middle Warg battle is thrilling and convincing-you mostly believe that the orcs are riding those creatures,and of course the lengthy Battle Of Helm's Deep is stunning,a truly great battle to rank with the best of Kurosawa and Eisenstein. The highlight,though ,is the climatic assault on Isengard by the Ents,an amazing spectacle.<br/><br/>The cast is again superb and two potentially problematic characters,Treebeard {and the other walking trees} and the sinister but oddly moving Gollum,are brilliantly achieved. In Gollum we have the most convincing CGI character so far done on film. Howard Shore's score is even better than his work on Fellowship,providing some of the most rousing film music in years but subtle in unusual places {such as Helm's Deep}. There are problems with this film,but all in all,it's still far better than pretty much everything else that came out this year.<br/><br/>A NOTE ABOUT THE EXTENDED VERSION As with Fellowship,the extended version is superior. While there are less important scenes added than in Fellowship,the film flows a lot better and is much more evenly paced. Still not as good as Fellowship,but very close."

I usually end with the rating, but I think I'll start with this one; without a doubt, 10/10, five stars out of five, however you want to scale it, it gets the highest marks.<br/><br/>   However, I will justify these marks, because I rarely give five stars, so here's the reasons ... <br/><br/>The Good News:<br/><br/>   The whole movie ... every single part of it ... it's an epic adventure with the strongest plot push I have ever seen in a trilogy, dare I say even stronger than Empire Strikes Back ... without question, this movie makes you glad you saw the first and beyond the bounds of anticipation in desire to see the third (December 17th, get here fast!) The acting is superior, to the point where you truly feel for the characters. The script is insurmountable, catching what must be the very heart of Middle Earth and translating into picture, sight and sound. The music is awe-inspiring, and a great cheer must go out to Howard Shore and the voice talents that he found to carry this movie from stronger to strongest. And, above all, we cannot forget the power of the novel that inspired this movie and it's successor and predecessor; the unrivaled writings of J.R.R. Tolkien and his epic universe of Middle-Earth. <br/><br/>   There can be no argument to say that this movie does not deserve to be where it stands. Number 4 film (at time of writing) on the IMDB's top 250 films; it's predecessor, number eight, and should it's successor reach the same heights, it will be the highest trilogy on the list, not to mention this film being the number four film. If memory serves, the IMDB hosts 150,000 films; I dare someone to stand up and try to knock the number four film out of 150,000 ... what leg can you possibly stand on?<br/><br/>
   This movie will entertain for years to come; it will undoubtedly become one of those films that everyone has seen, and will be able to talk about for hours. And I will see you all December 17th, when the Return of the King concludes this most powerful trilogy."

","Film two in Peter Jackson's immense trilogy based on the Tolkien novel, which follows the various factions of the Fellowship following their split at the end of film one.  Frodo and Sam rely on Gollum (a superb CGI character based on the real movements and vocalisations of actor Andy Serkis) to take them on the last and most dangerous stage of their journey  to take the ring into Mordor.  The ring continues to expand its influence and drain Frodo of strength, changing his personality. <br/><br/>
Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas save the kingdom of Rohan from enchantment and destruction, culminating in the battle at Helm's Deep (itself a triumph of the work of the Weta Digital workshop, with a believable set of digitally created soldiers and miniatures).  And Pippin and Merry find themselves in trouble, first in an Orc attack and then with the weird treebound Ents in the forest of Fangorn.  Gandalf also makes a spectacular reappearance as we discover just what did happen after the Balrog snatched him from the cliff in Film one.<br/><br/>Two Towers' is faster paced than Fellowship', as makes sense as the action moves closer and closer to the evil domains and away from the comfort of the Shire.  This transition has its effect on hobbits, men, elves, dwarves, and wizards alike.  Of the actors, Elijah Wood continues to impress as Frodo, drawn ever onward by an impossible quest.  Sean Astin gives the character of Frodo's faithful friend Sam a quiet dignity, while Dominic Monahan and Billy Boyd provide much-needed comic relief in appropriate places.  Also impressive are Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen, who let Gandalf and Aragorn develop into key characters in the drama.<br/><br/>For a film that has no real beginning and no ending (but an interesting cliffhanger in the Frodo strand of the story) it holds the attention surprisingly well and sets the scene perfectly for the final instalment of the trilogy."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>When Fellowship of the Ring came out in theatres, I became gradually aware that it was the best movie I had ever seen.  I went on to watch it 16 times in the theatre.  When the extended edition was released, I was somewhat disappointed.  The extra scenes were nice, but they broke the heart-pounding pace of the movie.  It felt very long compared to the theatrical version.<br/><br/>Then Two Towers was released in theatres.  Again, there was something not quite right.  I felt compelled to see it only five times in the theatre. I desperately wanted to love it, but parts of it were unsatisfying, particularily the character of Faramir, the Ent subplot, and a few nagging plot holes.  There was something missing.<br/><br/>Then came the Extended Edition.  Praise God.  I felt the magic of watching the Fellowship for the first time seeping into my soul again.  All the meat of the Two Towers I wanted to love was there.  Faramir's character is developed, making his releasing Frodo meaningful.  We get to spend more charming and delightful time with Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard.  More time with Gollum, increasing the tragedy of his character which we know is coming.  The plot holes are filled in.<br/><br/>The theatrical version of Fellowship was wonderfully edited and essentially perfect.  But for the Two Towers, the theatrical editing process was a gutting.  I can never watch the theatrical version again.  It is a pathetic shell of a movie.<br/><br/>My eyes have been opened.  The Two Towers is truly a worthy successor of the Fellowship of the Ring.  Thank you, Peter Jackson and team, for making these wonderful movies.  I know now that Return of the King will me a triumph. May these films shine eternally as the greatest art our civilization can create."

","Extended version: 11/24/03     **** of 4 I'm very impressed with the new scenes in the EV.  I also like to say that I think there change Faramir was good idea.  They wanted to make Faramir important character and to have him have a journey.  Gollum facial features were collebarated and fantastic.  While Boromir and fAramir and denethour sequence was amazing.  This movie also runs pretty quickly.<br/><br/>
Oh yes, the funeral scene was absolutely amazing. It scared me one they pushed Theodred into the gravestone.  Boromir holding up the flag was very epic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed that they honored Tom Bombadil giving Tom's line to Treebeard at the entwash scene.<br/><br/>I like how we learn how Aragorn is 87 years old.  Also the Saurman's scene reminded of great good vs evil confrontations.<br/><br/>The opening sequence with the rocks was a beautiful scenery than Frodo and Sam walking up the mountain.  It reminded me of one movie called ""The Vertical Limit"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed the comical scenes in the film including where Gimli says ""this new gandalf more grumpier than the old gandalf.""<br/><br/>I also liked Gandalf's speech about the coming of the ents.<br/><br/>
The editing was more smoother. The music was haunting, and beautiful.  The lighting seemed more brighter and we got to see more of New Zealand.<br/><br/>One big mistake was I think the Gollum/Smeagol scene was unnecessary. It just didn't seem to fit with the story.  Other than, great movie.<br/><br/>However, I think that the extended cut should've been the theatrical cuts. The extended cut is much more different than the theatrical cut. It patches up the little things to make a story, to not put as much pressure for the filmmakers, as well as telling the viewer what's happening.<br/><br/>Anyways I'm not saying anything else about the negatives of the film. I still think that scene with Aragorn falling off the cliff was unnecessary.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see I know more about the Aragorn and Arwen and last Alliance of the Elves from Peter Jackson. I'll give him benefit of the doubt on he got this from the appendices of the book.<br/><br/>I asked myself this question, would J.R.R. Tolkien would've been happy with this edition. Probably not, but he would've accepted and I do too and I like iy."
"kevnar","Null","0","0","22 November 2003"," Brilliant, with a few forgivable flaws
","The Two Towers was an astonishing movie. I sat through most of it with my mouth open and my eyes gaping, unblinking at the screen. To be honest I haven't read the books so I was seeing the story for the first time with Fellowship and Towers. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>My only complaints would be as follows:<br/><br/>Gimli, a very cool character in Fellowship, was turned into a bumbling oaf in the Towers, the butt of jokes that I felt robbed him of his dignity in the story.<br/><br/>Arwen, who apparently was not even in the books, was tacked on to give Liv Tyler a role in the movie, perhaps to add a little more star power. It was not necessary, and I felt her scenes in Towers dragged the movie down a bit.<br/><br/>There was a certain feel to fellowship that was lacking in Towers. There was a sense of gradiose adventure in Fellowship, with the Kracken, and the trip through the mines of Moria, the various battles here and there. In Towers the closest we came to such adventure was the attack of the wargs, which seemed to be over as soon as it begun (once again with Gimli bungling about, contributing only cheap laughs to the scene).<br/><br/>There were also many very touching scenes in Fellowship that made me walk out of the theater deeply moved long after the movie was over. The death of Gandalf, the death of Boromir, Merry and Pippin taking a brave stand in his defense -against impossible odds, and finally Samwise marching into the water and almost drowning, refusing to let his friend go on without him. There were all very powerful scenes in Fellowship. Towers was lacking in any of this heart. The closest it came was the scenes where the people were preparing their hearts for the battle of helm's deep. There was Aragorn leading the elves into battle after the wall explodes. There was Gandalf leading the horsemen down the mountainside in the end of the battle. This was an amazing scene, but a little too short to be considered perfection. There was also Sam's speech about heroes at the end. These were all awesome, but not as powerful as anything in Fellowship.<br/><br/>Apparently the Special edition DVDs remedy a lot of these concerns of mine. I can't wait to see it.<br/><br/>These few flaws are all forgivable of course. They by no means ruined the movie for me. The action of Helm's deep was breath-taking and the struggle of Frodo with the ring was gut-wrenching, particularly when he attacks Sam, and I won't even get started on how cool Golem/Smeagul was. All-in-all, I'd say Two Towers is on the list of my top 5 favorites of all time.<br/><br/>
I give the Two Towers a 9, whereas Fellowship Gets a 10. I'll no doubt change this to a 10 after I've seen the Special Edition."
"xenolupa","10","0","0","23 November 2003"," Magnificent, top 10 movie of all time
","After I saw the movie in cinema, I gave it a score of 9. Yesterday I got the extended edition, 4 DVD box set, as a gift, and enjoyed the 214 minutes of film. I agree with many others that this was the version I want to have seen in cinema. I don't mind sitting 214 minutes in my chair.<br/><br/>It is a shame that so many parts were cut out in the original release, like Merry and Pippin being swallowed by Old Man Willow, the moving of the forest to help Rohan, the eating of the Orcs by this forest, the funeral of Theodred, the part where Eowyn founds out the real age of Aragorn, and much much more. This version of the movie makes more sense, more things are explained, the story is more comprehensible and logical. And above all that, the scenes that were cut out are often magnificent, in themselves better than many complete movies I've seen.<br/><br/>The characters, the special effects, the sets, the paintings, the armory, the humor, the biting similarities with the real sad history of the world, the overwhelming music and the beautiful views of New Zealand nature: this movie contains a lot of wonderful movies, more action than most action movies, more emotions than most dramas, more story developments than most fiction movies.<br/><br/>I re-voted and now gave a 10 for Two Towers. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I am certainly going to see this many times.<br/><br/>I really look forward to Return of the King. I've read somewhere that it will be over 3 hours in cinema and over 6 hours on the extended edition. Next month I will join the marathon session in my local cinema, watching all three movies in a row. This is the best thing ever happened to cinema!"

I am happy to say that I found another great movie.  The special effects were beyond amazing.  The best characters and effects were the trees.  The attack on the evil wizard made people cheer in the theater and made the hairs on my neck stand up.  Also the computer generated character Gollum/Smeagol is how a computer-generated character should look.  Director used the perfect mix of organic scenery and computer generation.  Unlike Star Wars that had fake looking scenery, LOTR 2 has beautiful mountainous scenery of New Zealand, where the film was shot.  And the digital animation was not cheesy.<br/><br/>Some complaints: The flashback love scenes between Aragon and Arwen were unnecessary, I guess it was trying to show that her love got him through tough situation, but I thought it was annoying.  Also, the movie just seemed like one big battle, but when I read the book it did not feel like that. I know a major part of the book was the impending war, but there were just too many fight scenes.  Were these fight scenes added because of complaints that there was not enough action in part I?  I don't know, but it just seemed like the movie was a constant action scene, and the book did not have that feel. 8/10"

","After seeing the extended version of this movie, I'm going to have to change my vote for this movie from a 9 to a 10 (pretty much what happened with the first one).  They fixed everything I found wrong with the first.  The theatrical was a great thrill ride.  It was fast paced, and you could really feel the doom upon all the good guys.  But the extended was an epic of biblical proportions on its own.  Jackson expands the depth of every character in the movie, often going beyond what even Tolkien depicted.  The most important thing is that Faramir's character is completely redeemed. Although still not quite the same character he was portrayed in the book, he is depicted as a much more similar character to the one in the book in the extended cut than he is depicted in the theatrical cut.  He is a much more sympathetic character, and it is now understandable why it took him so long to make the right decision.  We now know more about the ents, (and the entwives), and we get more Gandalf, which I can't get enough of.  We also get more of an end to this movie.  I always thought the theatrical version ended prematurely.  After all it left nearly half the book untold.  This one still doesn't make it to the end of the book, but it doesn't leave much left, and it ends on a much more satisfying note, although still a brilliant cliffhanger.  If you have the option and the extra 40 minutes, definitely see the Extended edition instead of the theatrical version."
"stanoki","10","0","0","16 November 2003"," Great adaptation, but one flaw
","Peter Jackson and company has done an incredible job of bringing Tolkien's vision to the screen. They have accomplished what I originally thought impossible. I first read The Lord of the Rings almost 30 years ago, and I felt the books were unfilmable with the then current technology. Even with today's state-of-the-art CGI, I still felt that the LOTR could not be filmed properly, unless the people making the film had a great understanding and love for the source material.  It is obvious from watching the films that Peter Jackson, et al, has a great awareness and compassion for Tolkien's work.<br/><br/>I realize the immense differences between the two mediums of the written page and films and the challenges adapting one from the other. So I accepted the changes in the movies weighed against the books without much grievance, i.e.:  Tom Bombadil's absence; Faramir's personality change; Frodo & Sam in Osgiliath; the presence of the elves at Helm's Deep; Arwen's expanded presence; even the silliness of Gimli's character, etc.<br/><br/>But there is one element of the movies that disturbs me. It's the films treatment of the `ring' itself. This is where I get to be a LOTR geek, so bear with me!  In the books, Sauron never had a psychic connection with the ring as it's portrayed in the films, so he's never certain who the ringbearer is. Frodo never sees an `eye' when he puts on the ring, and vice versa. This is a major plot device in the books, especially in The Return of the King, where Aragorn is in possession of Saruman's palantiri, and uses it deliberately to allow Sauron to track Aragorn's whereabouts and thereby deceiving Sauron into thinking he had the ring.  In so doing, Sauron's attention was averted from Mordor where Frodo and Sam were able to enter virtually undetected.<br/><br/>Thus far in the films, Sauron knows exactly who and where the ringbearer is, and that makes it impossible for the ringbearer to enter Mordor unnoticed. I see this as the one major flaw in Peter Jackson's visualization of LOTR and I hope this problem is resolved in The Return of the King."

","Stunning film. Graphically superb, visually impressive all round a brilliant amazing sequel to a brilliant film. And we are told that this is just a taster of what is to come, as the third part of the trilogy, The Return of the King, is supposed to be even better than both of its predecessors. It has an all star cast lead by Ian McKellan and Elijah Wood and co starring the likes of Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett and Bernard Hill. But to single out any of the actors is to do an injustice to the rest of the cast. All the performances were stunning doing justice to what is a long enduring story. J. R. R. Tolkien wrote this story  over one hundred years ago and it is still read and told to children today. My wife and I are now counting the days (well not quite but it feels like it) till The Return of the King is released. The story grips your mind from start to finish. Each time I have watched this film (twice so far) I have totally engrossed in the screen with nothing else distracting me."

","What an absolutely great movie. I really, really love the Lord of the Rings movies. This one, I thought, was just as good as ""The fellowship of the Ring"", or perhaps even better.  In the book at some points Tolkiens' writing is just to slow so that some paragrahp's are just to long. In the movie's there is just no time to go into every detail, which, in this case, is just for the good.<br/><br/>I can see that this movie is made by people who just care about the story and it's characters. Although the movie is almost black and white, the way it looks is just astonishing. Peter Jackson did take a lot of care about the way things look. It's just as the way Tolkien describes it. Watching it, it made me belief that I didn't watch actors acting not being human in New Zealand, but that I really did see hobbits, elfs, orks, ents, dwarfs and people going on a quest in Middle-earth. The acting is perfect. I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen, Liv Taylor, Bernhard Hill, Ian Mckellen, Orlando Bloom and all the others become their characters. The battle of Helms deep was amazing, very dark and violent, but it took my breath away.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie though wasn't the big battle in Helms Deep, but the journey of Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Their relationship is very complex and I'm very thankful that Peter Jackson spent a lot of screening time on their interaction. Elijah Wood and Sean Austin are really very good as Frodo and Sam, but the most noticeable actor in this case was definitely Andy Serkis as Gollum. When I read the book I already thought that Gollum was a very interesting character. The way he interacts with him self, his double feelings about Frodo (Gollum hates him, because Frodo has his precious, but Smeagol adores him), the way that the ring still has an enslaving effect on him... Although I know that in the end he wants to trick Frodo and Sam to get to the ring, I couldn't help but feeling sorry for him, just the way Frodo did. Gollum is really a pitiful and sad character, who has become a sort of monster, because of the influence of the ring, and NOT because he was born like that. I love the way Andy Serkis portrays all of this and makes him a very deep and believable.<br/><br/>Over all. If you haven't watched this movie yet, go and see it. You won't be sorry. I can't wait to see The Return of the King.of the King."

","I am so tired of reading comments about how ""awful"" this film is because it ""destroys Tolkien's vision.""  THIS ISN'T TOLKIEN'S VISION--IT'S PETER JACKSON'S!  Yes, the Two Towers strays from the literature in several key places.  Most notably, Sam and Frodo don't go to Mordor in the book, Aragorn doesn't fall off a cliff, and backstory of Arwen and Aragorn's romance isn't discussed, Shelob the spider is missing, and there are no elves fighting at Helm's Deep (speaking of which, the battle in the book is quite short--but it manages to take up the last thirty minutes of the movie.)<br/><br/>OKAY, so it's different.  But how can you say the film is ""awful?""  The movie is absolutley beautiful and breathtaking, and some scenes look like gothic, epic, biblical portraits.  The scene in which Gandalf the White comes down the hill to battle the Orcs at Helm's Deep, for example is wonderful.  His entire army backlit by his powerful white light, it's such an image of hope that it gave me chills.<br/><br/>And Gollum is terrific in this movie.  The scenes in which he argues with himself were done superbly.  His character as a whole sets up suspense and humor.  He is simply the most realistic CGI character ever created.<br/><br/>I think it is fair to say that you can feel frustrated that Peter Jackson changed some of the material and some of the characters.  But how can you hate such a powerful, beautiful film just because it's different??"

","***MILD SPOILERS*** This movie speaks of many little stories that all come together in the end. The movie is about a fantasy world with orcs, goblins, wizards, men, hobbits, dwarves, and elves.  It is about a great battle for the world. The director and author of the film are not only trying to cross the point of good and evil, but also are trying to show the prejudice working together. The survival of the kingdom requires the good of the world to unite and set aside their differences. The time of the elves is over and they wish to abandon the world and go to the undying lands where they may stay for all eternity with the Valor (Gods). If the elves stay, they can help to crush the threat which may defeat the entire world they have lived on for thousands of years.<br/><br/>
The main source of destroying the threat of evil lies with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin). Frodo has the ring of power. The ring is calling to its original master. This is a sequel to the Lord of the Rings `The Fellowship of the Ring.' The fellowship has broken. Frodo and Sam are alone and lost. They end up meeting with Gollum (voice: Andy Serkis) who used to hold the ring, and for nearly five hundred years it poisoned his mind. The ring's original master is the dark lord Sauron. If the dark lord gets the ring back, the entire world will be covered under his shadow and all life will be gone. The journey for Frodo, Sam, and Gollum is to go to Mount Doom and cast the ring into the fire; the one and only place the ring can be destroyed."

","As a Tolkien fan, and after the incredible first installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy I was really looking forward to The Two Towers. There are many epic fight scenes - my favourite being the treants versus the forces of Saruman the White at his tower in Eisengard :) It is a must to watch. However I can only hope that in the final installment, The Return Of The King, there is less of a sense of it being dragged out in parts. This could primarily be achieved by leaving all scenes involving Samwise Gamgi out of the film. His ""fondness"" for Frodo is done a bit over the top and you are left with the feeling that Sam would gladly wipe Mr. Frodo's butt-crack if need be. This minor irritation and the fact that a few scenes dragged a bit are all that prevent me giving this film a rating of 9 or 10."

The last hour is nothing short of epic and the beginning hour of it is really good too. The only minor gripe I have with it is that it starts to lag around the middle, which I expect will be spiced up when November rolls around. It's a great movie with great characters and I 'know' Return of the King will be just as great."

","`I hope this is as good as the Fellowship'. That was my initial thought when I sat down to watch The Two Towers' at the cinema on the 18th December 2002. Thankfully this lived up to my expectations as much as the first movie did. Mr Jackson, like the plot, had continued where he had left off in Fellowship'. The Two Towers looks & feels perfect. The pace is quick, but never rushed, the acting is excellent & is never allowed to become to camp or hammy' & it all looks beautiful, thanks to the use of New Zealand as Middle Earth & some of the greatest visual effects ever seen on celluloid. The plot continues where the first film left us. Frodo & Sam (Elijah Wood & Sean Astin) have gone off alone to Mordor to try to destroy the Ring & Aragorn, Gimli & Legolas (Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys Davies & Orlando Bloom) have decided to pursue the Uruk Hai who have captured Merry & Pippin (Dominic Monoghan & Billy Boyd) & are taking them to see good wizard gone bad Saruman (Christopher Lee). Along the way we are introduced to more characters, some good, King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) his niece Eowen (Miranda Otto) & her brother Eomer (Karl Urban) & Faramir of Gondor (David Wenham) who is the brother the now dead Boromir. We also meet the scheming Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) & Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis). We also meet new fantastical creatures such as Ents (giant walking trees) & fell beasts (flying lizards that the Nazgul now ride). The film has a plethora of wonderful set-pieces that take your breath away. There are the wonderfully imagined Ents, 2 fantastic skirmishes between Riders of Rohan & Orcs, one of which involved large wolf like creatures called Wargs. Then there is the battle at Helm's Deep (The fortress stronghold of the people of Gondor). This has to rank as one of the greatest battles ever seen on film. It truly does take your breath away when you see an army of 10,000 Orcs marching towards a fortress built into a mountain, manned by only 300 soldiers & 150 Elves. The battle scenes are intense, violent & fairly graphic, but thankfully the violence is never gratuitous.<br/><br/>But all of that is almost forgotten in comparison to the single greatest special effect ever to grace the silver screen. Gollum. Actually, to call Gollum a special effect is being unfair to Andy Serkis. Because, although what you see on screen is a computer generated image, Gollum is brought to life by the magnificent Serkis. His voice, movement & performance are what brought the best out of WETA when they were designing Gollum & without him they wouldn't have created this phenomenon. And this creation is so good that you forget the he is CGI. Not only this, he steals every scene he is in, whether he is the Gollum seen in the opening attack on Frodo & Sam to the cowering, snivelling subservient wretch that is Smeagol. He also provides the highlight of the film. When the personalities of Gollum & Smeagol come head to head in a moonlight confrontation, it is like being hit in the heart with a 500lb emotional sledge hammer. This is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone on the planet. My only gripe is that the magnificent Andy Serkis wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his powerhouse performance. See this film, I implore you all."
"Niv-1","6","0","0","3 October 2003"," Some Wonder Here
","The first part of The Lord of The Rings trilogy was very overrated. The action scenes were repetitive and overlong and some of the characterizations were terribly annoying (Merry, Pippin, Sam). The second installment however, overcomes it's very choppy editing (especially regarding the romance between Aragorn and Arwen) and definitely rises above Fellowship of The Ring.<br/><br/>
One of the main reasons is the presence of The Ents (the walking, talking trees.) These scenes are excellent. They stand for the all the environmental destruction that has gone on the past century, whether by war or industrialization. Merry and Pippin were seriously toned down, whether by circumstances, or the realization of the filmmakers and actors that their antics in Fellowship was very detrimental to a consistent tone for the series. These scenes were very powerful. <br/><br/>The score by Howard Shore is very good especially in the Ent scenes. Bernard Hill is excellent in the role of King Theoden. Miranda Otto as his niece Eowyn is very impressive, and I look forward to more of her in Return of The King. The widely hailed Helm's Deep climax was largely sabotaged by the dual between Legolas and Gimli as to who could kill more. <br/><br/>Another good aspect of the movie is Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis. There are a couple of good scenes involving Frodo sympathizing with Gollum because of the effect the ring had on him. <br/><br/>Overall The Two Towers was a tremendous improvement over The Fellowship of The Ring, but because of the editing problems and the incompetent acting of Sean Astin, still is wildly overrated with many flaws."

","I guess most people take the Lord of the Rings trilogy very serious.  I see this as just a good film.  The acting is fair, and the CGI is some of the best.  There is a lot of walking around and talking in The Two Towers, and it's tough for a three hour movie to still be compelling.  The battle scene in the last hour is very well done.  6/10 Good"
"Rolo-13","9","0","0","22 September 2003"," Better than the first, cross your fingers for the third.
","While some of the battle of Helm's Deep is a little far-fetched, Jackson's second effort in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is full of the stuff that makes a movie great.  Rhys-Davies is brilliant as ever as the grumbling, but ever-faithful Gimli.  Aragorn is again superbly played.  Though I am personally not an Orlando Bloom fan, he's OK in his outing as Legolas.  I wag my hand at Wood and Astin, though Astin's ever-innocent portrayal of the loyal Sam is heart-warming and sweet.  Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are fair, Brad Dourif is typecast, and Hugo Weaving, unfortunately, seemed constantly on the verge of a ""Mr. Anderson."" Andy Serkin, however, was gypped out of an Oscar nod by a technicality.  His excellent characterization of the lost soul of Smeagol/Gollum is dead-on and tears at the heart, at times.  Sir Ian McKellen is equally powerful, as usual.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong here, the acting is only the beginning of the brilliance of this movie.  The cinematography is excellent, the views lush and gorgeous, and the sets were something straight from Tolkien.  Not to mention this film includes one of the greater 5-second scenes in all of cinema - Aragorn entering the palace, slow motion, enormous doors swinging wide. Beautiful. This film flows much more easily than the first.  It rivets the audience more and utilizes a broader range of character, imagination, and design than Fellowship.  One can only hope that Peter Jackson will stun us again with Return of the King."

","Everyone who read the books over and over will most likely hate these movies. Because they do not 100% follow them nor your imagination. It is impossible for them to. This is an Epic Movie not an Epic Book. In all honesty if you never read the books and enjoy epics like Braveheart you will love these films.<br/><br/>I grew up playing Dungeon and Dragons for fun and have played many RPG PC games. No movie to date comes closer to what these experiences are then these Epic Movies. I mean people complain about LOTR? Have you people seen the crap Dungeons and Dragons movie?<br/><br/>There is a point where you can over analyize something. The LOTR book readers have done just that. I'm not one to read books over and over but I can enjoy a movie again if I am watching it with someone new or it has been along time. You guys need to Relax. This movie is beautifully shot and casted well. Peter Jackson is not known for anything but these movies and he will be known forever for these. The backdrop of New Zealand is perfect for middlearth. LOTR is scored by music that engulfes you into the scenes. But what makes these movies so great is the story by Tolkien but adapted by Jackson. It works Period.<br/><br/>I'm sure you guys are mad that page 56 of book 2 has a character pausing for breath when they forgot to show it in the movie! Oh the horror. Get over it move on you have your books read them enjoy them. I judged this movie based on it being a MOVIE. I don't even want to read the books after hearing the comments made by their fans. You guys need to ask yourself is this movie REALLY that bad? Or do movies like Excaliber and Conan do it better? I think not. Yes it is not perfect but damn is it good."

","I just bought the DVD of this movie - I will also buy the extended version, but I couldn't wait. I have just watched the first hald so far, but I have to say that seeing it again in the kind of detail a DVD allows just confirmed for me what an incredible, awe-inspiring achievement this trilogy is.<br/><br/>There is not a scene that passes during which I do not marvel at the vision and the detail that went into the scripting, sets and props in this film. The world of the Riders of Rohan is particularly impressive with the horse-head details on Eomer's helmet and the hilt of Theoden's sword. The fantastic detail of Gimli's metalwork and the faded glory of Aragorn's clothes. The grass growing on the thatch of the halls of Rohan's capital. To see the hall of the Riddermark built in that fantastic location takes my breath away. Even the minor parts like the costumes of the Southron warriors who almost catch Frodo and Sam outside the devilish Black Gate of Mordor are beautifully designed and fit in with the incredible cultural world that Jackson's designers have created. Just look at the weave of the elvish cloaks. Will we ever see another film so beautifully concieved and so adeptly executed?<br/><br/>I just wish the votes went up to 11."

"keuhkokala","9","0","0","13 September 2003"," More great characters come to life!
","(This has some SPOILERs)<br/><br/>They say this part was the most difficult to film, as it´s in the center of the trilogy. Well, it isn´t as good as the Fellowship of the Ring, but this part has still a lot of great stuff in it.<br/><br/>First, there´s Gollum. You simply can´t write a review of this movie without writing about Gollum. He is my favorite character in the book, as he is a horrible monster and an old hobbit the ring has been torturing for 500 years at the same time. I always pitied him. Gollum has been made CG on this movie, though his motions and words come from actor Andy Serkins. On screen Gollum looks quite like how I pictured him, although his ears are too big and blue eyes do not suit him, especially as his eyes were green in the previous film. Serkins also provides great acting, especially when monster Gollum and his inner hobbit Smeágol argue. Kind of reminds me of the Green Goblin and Norman Osborne in Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Another great new character is Treebeard the ent, who is also mostly computer-generated. John Rhys-Davies´s voice fits him, but it´s too bad the ents are on-screen very little. Well, it gets paid off in the end. Rhys-Davies also plays Gimli the dwarf who is now the comic relief of the movie, when Merri and Pippin are most of the time in the woods with the ents, where they have nothing to joke about. It doesn´t bother me, Gimli´s jokes are funnier, although he hasn´t got as good a comment as in the previous film; ""Nobody tosses a dwarf!""<br/><br/>Most of the running time is spend in the kingdom of Rohan, where Théoden tries to avoid war against evil wizard Saruman´s uruk-hai armies. It´s not all boring, but the second hour seems to last much longer than the first or the third. Jackson has spiced up the dullest parts of the book by adding a fight against orcs riding wargs, kind of hyena-like beasts and Aragorn and Arwen missing each other.<br/><br/>The last hour is the best of this film and the whole trilogy so far. First, there´s the massive battle of Helm´s deep. The despair of the defenders feels in the air as 100 000 uruk-hais and orcs march in front of the fort and start shouting to taunt their opponents. It´s hard to believe most of those soldiers are CG. The viewer feels like s/he´s in the battle itself and dives even deeper to despair when the enemy breaks the walls and beats the hell out of Rohan´s soldiers. But in the morning, when Gandalf rides in with the Riders of Rohan the viewer´s despair changes to joy and relief. Peter Jackson sure can create great feelings. Although the film is not as good as the first one, it doesn´t deserve anything less, than the full points.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>The best part (SPOILER): The final march of the ents. I felt very good seeing the tree people finally paying back to Saruman by coming to his fortress, Eisengard, and starting to wreck the place up! STOMP! Orcs get squashed! WHAM! Orcs get crushed under a big rock thrown by an ent! KER-SPLOOSH! The ents break the dam and the river sweeps all the smaller creatures into Saruman´s mine pit! It can´t get any better than this! Oh, I can´t wait for the third and final movie!"

","When The Two Towers was released last year, I was incensed to read respectable film critics refer to it as a sequel. Now I read that Howard Shore's soundtrack was refused consideration for an Academy Award, because it was ""A sequel"". I re-iterate, The Two Towers is NOT a sequel. Rocky 2 was, Jaws 2 also. These were films intended for a one off showing but because of their success, sequels quickly followed. This is not the case with LOTR. Tolkien's epic was so big that it required 3 books to tell. Peter Jackson realised too much would be sacrificed if he condensed the 3 books into one film. so he made his story approx 10 hours long, divided into 3 parts, not sequels. And despite what a lot of other contributors have said about TTT, i must add that they must have been watching something else, as it is a staggering achievement in cinema.

","I can only give you my opinion, but it seems like it's going to drown amongst the superlatives others just wrote about this movie. I didn't find it that good. I like the books, but I see too many similarities with the special effects of the ones that are represented in the two latest Star Wars movies, which are completely made by computers. I don't like that. Nobody has realized that models combined with computer effects still can make the special effect look better and more real. There are a lot of impressive segments in the movie, BUT those are models or partially at least! Also, since the beginning of the franchise the character development has turned into a shallow action movie, which would be OK if it was as funny as Army of Darkness, but it's so obvious that this was meant to be the action movie and this is in fact not Army of Darkness. Who can take this movie seriously? It's on the verge of an overkill in the size of the one in the movie ""Hero"".<br/><br/>The only character which gets more vivid than ever is Gollum, who sounds and looks good, that is when he's sitting still. If you can't see that he is computer animated when he's moving with the two hobbits you should get new glasses right away, maybe in the size of Gollum's eyes. as in the last movie I like almost all the actors though. The war sequences are the best thing in the movie, but what the f**k, is that the most important thing? Then also the Ents are quite funny, probably the most Bombastic episode of the Muppets show so far?<br/><br/>I found this movie very entertaining, but far too much Hollywood. I like the limy Brits, but please, less bombastically delivered lines. All these Americans on New Zealand make feel like they'll stop by the 7 eleven or Burger King in the next part for a snack, cause that's what this movie is: fast food and instant entertainment. Nothing wrong in that, but with a couple of extra strokes with the brush it wouldn't be so obvious. 6/10"

","I have read the books twice and enjoyed the experience, have seen both movies several times and enjoyed that experience too. For me neither reading a book or watching a film is necessarily a passive experience, to get the most out of some things in life you have to allow your imagination (if you have one) to immerse itself in the thing as a whole and just let it flow. This story does that, it is a grand journey to take if you allow it be, or else it is a tedious trek with stones in your shoes if you prefer things that way. The films live up to that vision and are beautifully made, well-acted and visually stunning, and capture the spirit of the books as well as is possible with film - or, if you prefer it, long poncy movies with not enough obvious entertainment value and/or (gasp shock horror} not absolutely perfect in every miniscule detail.

","I am in utter shock! After reading some of the comments on The Lord Of The Rings:The Two Towers, I am amazed to find so much criticism. The Two Towers is an absolute masterpiece from Peter Jackson, who did not have the easiest job in the world! Shooting the middle installment from a trilogy is not easy as there is no real beginning and no real end, so the final product I think is pure brilliance. From the city of Edoras which was purposefully built for this film, to the truly amazing Gollum created by special effects and a very good performance from British actor Andy Serkis, to the incredible Battle of Helms Deep, this film is stunning. Viggo Mortensen gives a fantastic performance as Aragorn, the fearless leader and future king of Gondor, and with superb performances from Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davis (Gimli), Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Bernard Hill (The King) to name a few, there is nothing to fault. Not forgetting of course the emotional return of Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the introduction of one of the most amazing characters that Tolkien invisioned, Tree Beard. Films like The Lord Of The Rings allow us to be like children again, to forget about our reality and go into a new land of mythical creatures and foreign places, even just for a few hours. To bring Tolkiens masterpiece to the big screen was a huge challenge, one that Peter Jackson agreed to and came out champion. I thoroughly look forward to the final installment."

","Though I didn't enjoy the first of the Lord of the Rings films, I was eager to see the second, because the reviews were so terrific.  I was terribly disappointed.  I'd never read the Tolkien books--maybe that would have helped, I dunno.  I do know that I found the plot hard to follow at times, and some of the dialog was hard to understand.  But what really bothered me most was how cliche-ridden the film was--characters giving each other meaningful looks out of a grade Z flick, characters whose good or evil qualities screamed out at you, music that was laughably heavy handed, etc. For me, there were only two strong points: the battle scenes gave an unusually good sense of what combat was like long ago, and the special effects were impressive, especially the computer-enhanced character of Smeagol."

","Admittedly not as emotive as Lord of the rings, Two towers though still a very good film is no equal to its predecessor. If though both films are watched back to back, then the lack of character exposition and less emphasis on character development in the second instalment is forgivable. Almost great but as a stand alone movie it doesn't work, without the context of watching integral to the whole it fails, such is the fate of epic films released in instalments. Eight of ten."
"Essex_Rider","10","0","0","29 August 2003"," An uplifting narrative that sweeps you away.
","For all its wonderful special effects, for me the most moving part of the film was the relationship between Frodo and Sam and Gollum and Frodo. Although not a verbatim copy of the book, Peter Jackson has caught the spirit of Tolkiens world and characters so completely that it left me emotionally drained.<br/><br/>From an initial reaction of disgust when first confronted by Gollum, Frodo gradually realises that the ring has almost destroyed the creature and that this process is happening to him as well. I found it profoundly moving to watch as this strange relationship builds between them. Peter Jackson has allowed Andy Serkis to express the full range of Gollums plight and the wizards behind the scenes have pulled of the greatest feat imaginable. They have given Gollum the ability to make us feel for him in creating a wonderfully and almost human schizophrenic creature.<br/><br/>The director has also pulled us headlong into a world created by Tolkien and made us believe. The breathtaking landscape 'is' Middle Earth, complete with the complex creatures that inhabit it. Those who gripe continuously about the differences between the book and the film are obviously unaware of the problems created by the different narratives. A visual narrative is very different to a literary one. Peter Jackson has very cleverly interwoven the spirit of Tolkiens world with the reality of cinematography and special effects.<br/><br/>I thought it would be difficult to better The Fellowship of the Ring, this has, and if the final episode is the best, then we're in for a truly staggering experience."
"wrayburn","Null","0","0","29 August 2003"," Fantastic, and does the book justice
","I can see the big, big fans of the books reaching for their tomes to knock me over the head for this comment! The film didn't portray books 3 and 4 exactly - in fact they went quite a way off it - but they reflected my experience of reading the books, given the difference between the two mediums.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has bought a book to film which has always been thought impossible to film, given the scale of the battles, the landscapes, and the creatures, who were bought so much to life that film-making couldn't do them justice.<br/><br/>I definately wouldn't have been in the slightest bit interested in the films if I hadn't seen the books, but as I know them pretty well, it is clear that this is a labour of love from someone who knows and appreciates them at least as much as I do.<br/><br/>Specifics - gollum is not quite as I imgined him but it is another person's vision of the books. In the first film I remembered most of the dialogue and scenes in the literary context - quite uncanny -  and in the second, this is not the case. I recognised very few quotes. Rohan was beautifully realised. Helm's Deep was again not my vision but still faithful to the books.<br/><br/>Certain things I missed - Gimli's role at Helm's Deep andhis reaction to the caves. He has been played for laughs all the way through, which is a pity as the books portray him as part of a distinct culture in Middle Earth, and here he is played as a small clown. His character has it's own concern's which are lost here.<br/><br/>The numbers defending Helm's Deep were wrong - there were more originally. The alliance with the wild men disappeared, as it was they who turned the tide of battle (elves didn't really come into it).<br/><br/>A lot of elements of the book such as the above have been dropped in Two Towers, presumable because it was thought that too many different elements and groups being introduced would confuse audiences.<br/><br/>However the effect is that Middle Earth, which is a fully-realised world in he books seems to be rather small here. As someone else has said, the books are a portrait of Middle Earth as much as anything else, and the films fall down a bit. Perhaps there are pressures form producers who want as much mass appeal as possible - hence allowing Jackson the special editions which are perhaps more as he would have wanted them, and which hold more detail than the cinema releases.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's easy to criticise, and it's an absolutely stunning film which does the books proud. I hope that P. Jackson manages to steer the third film more back towards the books though, becasue the books are great and a brilliant film doesn't need to do any more than that. Whatever, see the films in the cinema as well as on DVD, as they are a cinematic experience to end all others. Top marks."

I thought the movie dragged a little the first hour, but it's just in a class by itself. Only George Lucas' Star Wars compares to this series. Old school movie making. Peter Jackson is ok as a director but no one can knock his vision. He has a lot of it, and he did stray away from certain parts of the book, and created his own material, but hey, thats an adaptation for you. TTT continues from where FOTR left off, and the final hour of this movie will be talked about for a long time. Nothing compares to this not even the jedi battle in Attack of the clones. Peter Jackson gets knocked for his choppy direction, but he can get a lot out of his actors and that is what all great directors do. I think the other great thing about this film that also sets standards other than the final battle is the amazing ""Gollum/Speagle"" character. CGI has come a long way. One day,  an oscar will be presented to one. Gollum probably deserves one! Not only did he look so real, he stole a lot of scenes, and is amazing to see how movies have progressed.

"reporterman2000","9","0","0","26 August 2003"," Excellent, but ...
","I gave this movie a rating of 8, only two notches down from the perfect 10 score for ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" With this film, there's little doubt left that Peter Jackson has surpassed the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy in terms of passion, excitement, visual originality, and storytelling power. What a great accomplishment is ""The Two Towers."" It'll be tough waiting another three months for ""The Return of the King,"" which I'm sure will be the best of the three films. (The ""LOTR"" film cycle has one huge advantage over ""Star Wars"": Jackson won't be revisiting his original masterwork with any badly written, badly acted, unnecessary prequels.)<br/><br/>""Two Towers"" does not follow the middle book in Tolkien's epic trilogy as closely as some might like, and does take a few liberties here and there, but overall this is a fine adaptation and, let's face it, probably the greatest sequel in film history. Jackson once again successfully creates a believable yet fanciful vision of Middle Earth; his special effects, while not quite as seamless as in ""FOTR,"" are nonetheless impressive, and there's great magic in the cinematography, set design and music. The acting is also a level of magnitude above that seen in the last ""Star Wars"" picture. Each actor is able to make his or her character unique and believable within the terms of the story. This movie probably comes the closest of any to resembling a perfect marriage between art and blockbuster entertainment.<br/><br/>All of that said, ""TTT"" (as it is popularly known) isn't quite as smoothly paced as ""FOTR."" The first 15-20 minutes are a bit choppy; we're thrown from one end of the story to the other in a somewhat frantic attempt to bring us up to speed. And, more than ""FOTR,"" the second film feels like it needs footnotes -- in fact, after seeing it in a theater, I went out and read all three books, just so I could have a deeper understanding of this particular film.<br/><br/>So I look forward to the extended DVD release, which I understand contains 40 minutes of additional footage. I think ""TTT"" will benefit from the restored footage; this is one of the few epics that might actually make greater sense with a more leisurely pace.<br/><br/>""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is without a doubt the most exciting and important movie franchise of at least the last 20 years. I could give a rip about ""Spider-Man"" and ""Harry Potter"" ... what makes Jackson's films special is that they tell a complex, moral story in terms of a magnificent adventure. If the scenes dealing with Shelob in ""ROTK"" are anywhere near as good as the Balrog/Battle of Helms Deep sequences in the first two, then this beauty is only gonna get better."

","The Two Towers continues the story from the Fellowship of the Ring, but it has a lot more action. The first one took a while to get started and didn't have many epic battles. Regardless, it was a great movie. The second installment has got much more action and the end battle at Helm's deep is amazing. The cast and crew still do an excellent job with acting and special effects. I do have a couple of complaints. The movie didn't continue the story as much as it could have. Other than Gollum becoming a more important character, you probably could have skipped this one and caught up quickly in the third film, but you would have missed out on some great scenes. I also did not like the walking-talking trees. I found them boring and a little irritating as they didn't do much. Other than those forgivable flaws, this is a fantastic adventure that makes you drool in anticipation for the conclusion. 7/10"

","I've been reading the previous reviews of this movie and I was quite fascinated to find such varying comments and opinions.  But, after (buying) watching this movie, I think I understand...<br/><br/>If we ignore the fact that this movie was adapted from a book, and focus solely on it's merits as a movie - then I would say that it was excellent. The special effects, the battle scenes, the acting was all very good.  Even the story, compared to the trash that's been produced recently (American Wedding, T3, Spiderman, Dare Devil, STAR TREK NEMESIS, STAR WARS II) was good.  I would say there is very little out there in the fantasy genre that is better than this.<br/><br/>However, this movie IS based on a book - A VERY GOOD BOOK.  Changes that vary from the book ache that much more.  More importantly, many changes that were made were extremely ""Hollywood"".  A little more action, more special effects at the cost of a shallower, less fulfilling story.  The story was simplified, altered for no reason other than to try to fit in a  few more obligatory ""dramatic"" scenes that were cliche, un-original.  It cheapened the story.  And for those of us who have read the book, such departures are like a slap in the face.  And missing scenes serve to heighten our disappointment.<br/><br/>So...  a good movie but not nearly as good as it COULD'VE (should've?) been.

","If you are an avid fan of LOTR books and you understood em', than you'll love this movie. I personally thought that this movie was better in the sense that it had more fierce battle scenes, new characters,etc. Most people say Fellowship was better because it had a greater variety of places.True, but this is how the book was meant to be, no more lenghty explanations or introduction. I can see how people who've never read the books not enjoy as much as I did maybe because the film makers did not give cleaner or further explanations as to what was going on.With me, I sat down and watched it and knew exactly what was going on.My brother, who'd never read the books, didn't understand everything like smeagol's past, about saruman, ents, etc.So my advice, read the books first ( of course they are much better than the movies, which is saying a crap lot about how good these books are ) and then watch the movie. Or if you've already watched, read the books, and watch it again and then you'll understand better what's going on and enjoy it a ton more."

","I was very disappointed to see the ending of this film. The Two Towers is my favorite book of all time because of this one chapter, the very last chapter in the book (The Choices of Master Samwise). Of course, this chapter didn't make it into the movie, which only makes me want to see The Return of the King all the more.<br/><br/>I have loved the trilogy ever since I first picked it up to find out what it was about. And seeing Peter Jackson's vision of it made me wish there wasn't copyright laws for some things. Of course, I enjoyed it, but the only problem was it didn't have everything I wanted to see (i.e. Tom Bombadil).<br/><br/>
There are many things I LOVED about the movie, The Two Towers. For one, it took a step up with CGI animation. Gollum was incredible. I have never seen a CGI look more real. (To be honest, I think CGI looks so fake, I wished they would go bask to the day when creatures where made with puppets. They looked unbelievably real, compared to CGI.)<br/><br/>Now, no movie is perfect, and The Two Towers proves that. All movies do. The five chapters they didn't put in probably has a reason for it being that way, and I think I know why. The Return of the King is by far the shortest in the trilogy, so I think the production team decided that why cram everything into The Two Towers, when you could leave some out and put it in the next one. I mean, the movie is already long (some people might take it as far as unbearably long, but I have to say that I though it was short), so they didn't want people to get up and leave because they were bored (I'm talking about the mainstream audience), so they move some of the movie over to The Return of the King.<br/><br/>I can easily say that The Two Towers is one of my favorite movies of all time, but, like any other movie, it is flawed. Luckily, it's nowhere as flawed as The Hulk (I could barely sit through that movie, and it was much shorter that The Two Towers). I really think that the movie could have done better, but, then again, it could have done horribly worse....<br/><br/>As I wrap this up, I have to say that I absolutely enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The Ent's looked pretty real, compared to other things. The battle of Helm's Deep wasn't as character-driven as the book was, but it was one awesome piece of film-making. The part at Osgiliath, where Frodo realizes without Sam, he would never have got near as far as they did, touched my heart. Especially, when Sam told Frodo that the hope that they had left was that there was still some good left in the world. I even liked when they talked about the story that was going to be told about themselves (which wasn't supposed to be included until the third one. Just pause for a moment and feel the irony in that). All in all, this was an enjoyable piece of film-making that everyone, and I mean everyone (except of the little kids, I mean, it can get as gory as a PG-13 movie can get) should see this movie. ****(out of four stars)."

Andy Serkis gives Gollum such pathos that you end up feeling very, very sorry for him. Helm's Deep was breathtaking, and the movie as a whole does not suffer too much from being the middle film.

"kieferjenkins","Null","0","0","11 August 2003"," Paintbrushes Forgotten
","The Fellowship of the Ring reached magical depths that one cannot fathom how they were forgotten in this, The Two Towers. How could have the makers of such a beautiful portrait of Middle Earth as was the first movie have put their aesthetically sophisticated, spiritually dipped paintbrushes away for ones to portray this more prosaic vision of Middle Earth?<br/><br/>The first one included infinite more scenery - the vividly green and blue Shire bathed in sunshine, the dark and scary mines of Moria, the dark greens and greys of Lothlorien, the balming peace and ethereal architecture of Rivendell, the black and red terror of Barad-dur, the grey eeriness and further terror of Isengard unleashed, the silent threat of the Great River Anduin, the false safety of the cheerful Bree, and the trodding across said lands and the lands in between, like the snowy white Misty Mountains (my favorite scenes), and the lands surrounding Weathertop.<br/><br/>
The second one was little more than grey and brown terrains - beautiful, but sorely in need of others to contrast them.<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Rings was more suspenseful. Who were those Black Riders? Were they not infinitely more terrifying than any of the orcs that came out in the second film? The Ring was prominent in the first film. What could it do to that who owned it? The second film gave little time or thought to the Ring.<br/><br/>The first one was much more exciting. Being chased by Black Riders through the woods at night, listening to their chill wails? Fighting them? Being chased by orcs and a troll in the mines and by Uruk-hai above ground? How can an ""epic battle"" such as Helm's Deep stand up to such uniqueness?<br/><br/>
The exclusion of the hobbits from the majority of the film seemed also most unjust to me. Although Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn is a rich character with fathomless depths who deserves prominence in the story, this was not a reason to rob Elijah Wood's brave little protagonist Frodo of starring the major emotions and perils in this story, which after all, is mostly his, as well as the other hobbits. Frodo is a very deep character as well who represents the virtues of innocence and perseverance, virtues he could turn his back on more easily than Legolas or Aragorn perhaps, who have more ease when facing danger, but chooses not to.<br/><br/>Aragorn is a major character observed in the books, observed through the eyes of Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam, who themselves are the ones living and feeling the peril described by Tolkien. That Aragorn might seem more apt to action sequences seems a bit absurd to me; it is scads more exciting to see these tiny, little beings flee and fight the way they did in the first film (when arriving to the Brandywine Crossing).<br/><br/>And even if they did spend arduous expanses of time trudging, there was something to be said for it. Endurance, perseverance, moving forward instead of collapsing with utter fatigue...<br/><br/>The first movie allowed the audience to weep - weep with emotion when Arwen charged across woods and plains in order to save Frodo and save hope for the entire world, weep when she wept for Frodo weeping for innocence lost, weep when the noble protector Gandalf fell into the darkness of Moria, weep at the sheer beauty of the crossing of the Misty Mountains, weep sympathizing with Boromir's fright... In the second one only Theoden's grief for his son mattered much.<br/><br/>The first movie included meaningful expressions - Legolas' terrified face when encountering the Balrog, Galadriel's lust after the ring, Frodo's, Bilbo's and Gandalf's impish blue eyes sharpen when detecting Sauron's sultry whispers while discussing the Ring, Boromir's quailing before Galadriel, Gimli's shock and grief at finding his relatives killed by orcs... The second one had Merry near to tears when reproaching the Ents, and Eowyn's beautiful, anxious face, but not much else.<br/><br/>
The second movie was much like Braveheart since it focused entirely too much around the story of Helm's Deep and the people of Rohan. These scenes were fantastic, but they should have been pruned down to much shorter time, and much more time (and emotion) should have been given to the hobbits' stories (even Gollum got more time than Frodo and Pippin it seemed). I would have loved to see much more of Fangorn, Isengard and Mordor than of Rohan, which deserved a substantial but not all encompassing slice. For stories about brave humans abound and will continue to be made, but there is only one that I know of that includes hobbits and elves. I hope directors and producers will eventually learn that international audiences at large will appreciate the finer webs of which the first film was made than the obvious ones of the second.<br/><br/>A rather odd thing to be such a fan for a person who generally reads only non-fiction..."

"luckhrtday","Null","0","0","5 August 2003"," Great Visualisation...Bad Ending
","****Spoilers**** The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues where the first one left off, Frodo and Sam headed east through Emyn Muil towards Mordor to destroy the Ring while Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli follow the trail of the Uruk-hais who have capture Merry and Pippin, heading West through the vast Plains and Rohan. Along the way, they are reunited with Gandalf, who then takes them towards Edoras, where Theoden King lives. From there, Gandalf leaves to find Eomer while the other three travel with the city towards Helms Deep, where an epic battle is going to take place. While all this happens in the West, Frodo and Sam meet with Gollum, who tries to steal the Ring from them in the night. He promises to lead them towards the Black Gates and into Mordor himself, all the while, unbeknownst to the two hobbits, is battling with himself to gain control (Smeagol over Gollum, Gollum over Smeagol). When they cannot enter through the Black Gates, Smeagol/Gollum leads them another way in but the two hobbits are soon taken by Faramir, a ranger of Gondor and the deceased Boromir's brother. Near the end of the movie, they are taken to Osgiliath where Nazgul are attacking. In the end, Faramir does let them continue back towards Mordor alone instead of taking them to Minas Tirith, as was planned.<br/><br/>I think it was a very good visual of the second installment of this epic trilogy written by the great J.R.R Tolkien, which is supposed to have been the first fantasy novel which most things are faintly based on. Although the ending was...far from where it really was, it was great all-around, succeeding in a breath-taking visualisation not yet seen in any fantasy film and greatly matching the success of the first installment, The Fellowship of the Ring. Out of all of the movie, I was far from pleased with the endings of both the West and East journeys, that are separated into two parts in the book, which ended half way through the original two parts. Altogether though, even with the bad ending, it was very well made and deserves as high a praise from fans as the first installment did."

I have a feeling they will.  Also, having Frodo and Sam go to see Denethor was uncalled for, and I am not sure what that accomplished.  Definite good things--Gollum/Smeagol is the most complex, (bizzarre?) character I can think of in literature, and PJackson got it dead on.

Faramir is supposed to be the opposite of his brother, strong and not prone to the usual weaknesses of men. But Peter Jackson portrays him as being corrupted by the ring as soon as he sets eyes on it. Yes, he does eventually let Frodo go but there was no need for this alteration to have ever been made. It really spoiled the film for me.<br/><br/>The only other big thing was the ENT's. This didn't bother me as much as Faramir, but it was still an unnecessary change from the book. The ENT's are supposed to agree in the ENT Moot that they will fight in the war - not the way they do it in the film. Oh yeah - and the attack on Isengard, I know its difficult in film to show ENT's digging a new path for a river over a couple of days - but what idiot builds his fortress next to a massive, crumbling dam ???<br/><br/>Winging over.

","If one takes LOTR:TTT on it's own, without judging it against the original source, it's everything one could ever hope for. It's visually gorgeous, and the acting is simply incredible. Special points go to Brad Dourif's EXCELLENT portrayal of Grima Wormtounge, and to Christopher Lee's Saruman. Lee has just the right mix of truly awe-inspiring evil and petty villainy. Let's hope that in the next film, the twisted relationship of these characters is maintained. Viggo Mortensen is the heart and soul of this fim-- though Aragorn seems slightly out of character, this is no fault of Mortensen's...he's a truly talented actor who has made a rather static fictional character his own.<br/><br/>However...this IS an adaptation of Tolkien's work, right? So one would hope for a certain...adherence to the original. Making the ten page sequence at Helm's Deep into about half the film was a bit much, but I can handle it. Leaving out Shelbob, Saruman yelling out the window, and Pippin and the palintiri...well, okay. Moving Boromir's death to the end of FOTR...I'll get over it. But...Faramir. Oh, sweet god, Peter Jackson, what did you do to Faramir!?<br/><br/>Now, I just said I didn't mind the way Mortensen developed the character of Aragorn beyond the bare outlines in the book. This is because he maintained true to the basic things that make Aragorn ARAGORN. (Or Strider, or Elessar, or Estel, or Dunadan, or Elfstone, or whatever the heck he's calling himself now.) But Faramir--and this is no fault of David Wenham's, he did an excellent job with what he was given-- what happened to Faramir amounts to character assassination! They made him...BoromirLite, not the sensitive, completely individual character that he was intended to be. And that, I think, is the movie's biggest flaw-- turning a peaceful character like Faramir into a warrior like his brother is ignoring everything that Tolkien is trying to say...Faramir's differences from Denethor and Boromir are what make much of the plot of ROTK, but it's not set up for that now.

","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>The second film in Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien's classic trilogy The Lord of the Rings is every bit as much a triumph as the first. Wisely eschewing the `previously-on-The Lord of the Rings' type nonsense that so often wastes valuable screen time in such works, Jackson literally hurls you straight back into the plot, as Gandalf battles the Balrog in a stunning opening duel.  Some have criticised this lack of a re-cap as being insensitive to those who haven't read the book or seen the first film. However, I've no sympathy for anyone who's not done at least one of those two.  Anyone coming to The Two Towers with no previous knowledge would soon get hopelessly lost in any case.<br/><br/>The plot follows threes strands.  First and foremost, it concerns Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor as they attempt to put and end to the Ring.  They are guided by the Ring's previous owner Gollum, a twisted, demented creature coming across like a schizophrenic drug addict.  In the second plotline, Human Aragorn, Elf Legolas, and Dwarf Gimli search for the other Hobbits captured by Uruk-Hai in the previous installment.  Along the way they enter the land of Rohan and help its beleaguered King Theoden fight Saruman's evil army of Uruk-Hai.  The third plot strand follows the plight of Hobbits Pippin and Merry (whom Aragorn and his companions seek) as they escape the Uruk-Hai and befriend the mysterious Ent Treebeard, a walking talking tree.<br/><br/>Given the extreme difficulty in adapting The Two Towers as a film, Peter Jackson has done an incredible job creating a coherent film.  He wisely opted to end the film short of where the book ends (the latter chapters of the book will take place in the third film).  Certain elements of the book he has tweaked (most notably the character of Faramir, Boromir's brother) to, in my opinion, good effect.<br/><br/>Performance wise, the high standard set by the first film continues.  All the characters from the first film are just as good, if not better here. New characters Theoden (the splendid Bernard Hill), Eowyn (Mirando Otto) and Faramir (David Wenham) are all brilliantly brought to live.  Worthy of special mention is the fantastic rendering of Gollum, without doubt the best CGI character ever created.<br/><br/>The special effects continue to stun.  I always thought the army of Ents storming Isengard would be impossible to put on film - I was wrong.  Also, the battle of Helms Deep is a triumph - a stunning battle which more than lives up to its counterpart in the book.  The production design, editing, sound and cinematography are as impressive as ever.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's score is nothing less than a work of genius in its own right. From the heroic Rohan theme to the melancholic and haunting Gollum's song, this is an unparalleled work.  Less immediately showy than Fellowship's themes (some of which are briefly reprised here) this ultimately gets under one's skin more than the music of the first film (no mean feat).<br/><br/>All in all, this is another triumph.  Darker and more action packed than its predecessor, The Two Towers is a great continuation of a great story, and a wonderful, heroic epic.  It's weighty themes of immortality, betrayal, genocide, temptation and sacrifice and nicely balanced by a great sense of humour that runs throughout.  Gimli provides a lot of laughs, and one line by Treebeard (surprisingly not in Tolkien's book) offers a wonderfully bizarre but true observation - `I always like going south.  Somehow it feels like going downhill.'  Quite."

","It disappoints me that so many people thought this movie was great. Although the sets, costumes, and special effects are FANTASTIC, the movie can't stand on it's own!  There's really no excuse for this - it's perfectly possible to tell a three-part story in parts that have a storyline and plot of their own.  I found the movie to be tedious and had to continually explain what was supposed to be happening to the kids with me.<br/><br/>Also, director Peter Jackson has a sadly different vision for The Lord of the Rings (LotR) than that of author J.R.R. Tolkien.  Tolkien did not celebrate war, and while the heroic leader Aragorn practices it, it is out of necessity rather than a desire for glory.  In the book, this makes the ambitious and aggressive warrior Boromir a foil for him and the scholarly Faramir.  That is also why there are so few female leads in the book - the story is about the darkness of power-mongering and the decay of civilization - Tolkien's ideas of female characteristics were creativity, nurture, and management.  The movie, on the other hand, relies heavily on the excitement of violent conflict as a substitute for plot and character development. That may make the film unintentionally relevant in today's political climate, but at a pitiful price.  Tolkien was a scholar who had experienced the devastation of war (WWI) first hand, and returned to celebrate culture and the magic of language and history.  He had a message that our times still need to hear."

","Hey when i saw this i thought that it was great I saw it 3 times and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.  I am a huge fan and there was nothing i didn't like.This movie was the best action film i've seen the fighting looked real.  This series of the tale has more fighting, where as the first one there is alot of info to cover and we'll have to see about THE RETURN OF THE KING.  Aragorn, Legolas, Gimley are the focus of the film, with the sword fights.  Also a new love for Aragorn we shall see?<br/><br/>Movies I would reccomend:Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship, The Lord of the Rings:the Two Towers, How to Deal, Legally Blond 2, Pirates of the CArribean, League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, X-Men2, Finding Nemo, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days<br/><br/>Movies I would not reccomend: The Hulk, Bringing Down the House"

","I read the book a few years ago, note that book is singular, as Lord of the Rings is one book and one movie, divided into three volumes for the sake of making it easier to read and view.  When I read it, I was amazed at the beauty of world and characters.  Frodo I felt was one of the best heroes in literature for the simple fact that all he did was plod, on and on to save what he loved, the Shire, we all can relate to this in a smaller sense.<br/><br/>The movie I believe is the most visually asounding movie ever made.  The special effects are flawless, Gollum being the best CGI ever, sets beautiful, and the shots just add to the beuaty.  The music is amazing, and adds another level of brillance to the movie.  The first time I saw this I had the same feeling that I had watching the great epics like Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars.  I sat and admired the movie, the only times I do this is for the truely great movies like Citizen Kane, or 2001.  By the end of the movie my jaw was dropped and I had only one complant, the same one I had with Casablanca, The Godfather and other classics, it's too short."

It was fun and exciting, leaving me satisfied yet yearning for more. If the third film is as good as the first two, there will likely never be such a well done trilogy again.

","Well where to start. I have seen this film three times and look forward to seeing the extended edition and ROTK.<br/><br/>I knew the shape of events that were likly to happen, in the film but was a little disappointed at a few things. First off and most importantly was Gandalfs battle with Balrog. I was utterly gobsmaked at that opening sequence, the fall to the centre of the earth the, brave wizard striking down his enemy on the mountian, but the thing that disappointed me was the missing part of it. in the book when they reach the bootom and hit water, the balrog becomes a muddy mess and he and gandalf engage in a long battle which leads to him having to hold on to balrog as he climbs back up. the thing is i had always thought that fight would be cool to wacth, seeing the centre of the earth which might have had the same dark sense of moria, the cool choir music nd the sight of gandalf clinging for his life to balrogs ankle (King Kong ring a bell) all so dark, would have the same feel as ALIEN. the sad thing is i don't think this will be on the extended edition either.<br/><br/>now to the actors, this film belongs to Viggo Mortenson with Wood taking second place,i'm beginning to wonder which character is more important, part three is gonna be one hell of an upstageing war thats for sure. its sad that Liv Tyler is only in two scenes. Notable credit goes to Brad Dourif for his excellent portrayal of Grima Wormtouge.<br/><br/>Helms deep is superb, climaxing with the horses charging down the moutain to the choir boys voice. and some amazing fight and death scenes.<br/><br/>However i still like FOTR better, simply because the characters end up in different groups each one having to realise their destiny and go their separate ways. thats what life is for all of us."

","Millions of movie-goers were shocked when Fellowship of the Rings came out in theatres December 2001.  It was hailed as a new level of fine filmmaking and lured more fans into the popular franchise.  By December 2002, The Two towers hit the screen and most were not dissapointed.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from it's preceder is that the stakes are higher, and the danger in the characters adventures is clearer.  Merry and Pippin are captured by the Uruk-Hai and meet up with the ents, Aragorn, legolas, and Gimli are on a hunt for them, and Frodo and Sam continue their way to Mt. Doom to destroy the One ring.  Many new colorful characters such as Grima, Gollum, Eowyn, and Theoden are introduced in this film and seem to be meeting most of the Tolkien Purist's standards.  The bloody Battle of Helms deep is one of the most spectacular battles ever filmed.  The reality is so believable that many viewers might feel that they are a Rohan soldier themselves.<br/><br/>
One problem purists might have is the slight maipulation of the story. Chapters are missing, and some of the characters personalities are manipulated.  Regardless, this film has won amazing praise in both loving fans and critics as well as receiving two Acadamy Awards last March.<br/><br/>Although this film does not quite beat ""Fellowship"", it is still a spectacular, grand epic that will blow your mind.  Everyone, young or old, deserves to see this movie to enjoy its true greatness.<br/><br/>

","After seeing The Fellowship of the Ring the previous year, I was really looking forward to the second instalment. I must say that I came out of the multiplex with mixed emotions.<br/><br/>While it was an excellent movie - the acting was superb, the locations stunning, the stunts and FX quite the equal (if not superior) to its predecessor - I felt it was a little disjointed. This was no real fault of Jackson's, he remained faithful to Professor Tolkien's vision. It just seemed he was trying to be everywhere at once - following two, sometimes more, separated groups.<br/><br/>All in all, however, still oceans ahead of most other action/fantasy fare coming out these days."
"NoArrow","10","0","0","17 July 2003"," This entire three hour movie can be summed up in one word: AMAZING
","And, by amazing I don't mean 'mostly good'.  By amazing I don't mean 'could've been better'.  By amazing I mean the template for perfection. Peter Jackson's second act of the trilogy, ""The Two Towers"" is not only three hours of eye candy, but three hour of ear candy, heart candy and any other kind of candy.  As everyone knows, the second act is always the hardest, but Peter Jackson seemed to make this great film with ease.<br/><br/>The story, continuing from ""Fellowship"", focuses on two plotlines: Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) meeting Gollum (Andy Serkis), who leads them to Mordor and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) helping the Rohirrihm.  The writers did very well blending these two stories together, just like Tolkien did.<br/><br/>The star of this movie is without a doubt Gollum.  Even though he is a complete CGI character, he turns out to be the opposite of Jar-Jar Binks. He isn't comic relief, he isn't there for cute laughs, he is the same, tormented character as he was in the book.<br/><br/>Of course, the action in this movie ranks up with ""Braveheart"" for great Medieval warfare.  As most know, the last forty-five minutes of this movie is one long war scene.  Despite being so long, it never becomes boring or cheesy, and you're never getting restless in your seat.  In fact, you're on the edge of it the whole twenty-seven thousand seconds of it.<br/><br/>This film still has faults though, as all do, but they are miniscule compared to the great brilliance.  There are but two things in ""Towers"" that bugged me: the slightly overdone love story between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Gimli's (John Rhys-Davies) delve into comedy.  I'm not saying that Gimli wasn't funny, I'm saying that he wasn't as dramatic as he should have been.<br/><br/>As I said, the faults are tiny compared to the brilliance.  ""The Two Towers"" never even comes close to disappointing, 9/10."

I can only hope that the extended dvd version will change my mind a little.  Overall a great movie and I loved Gollum/Smeagol."

","Thrown in with the other movies that come out each year, Two Towers was great!  It had action, romance, and characters you can truly love.<br/><br/>Two Towers, however, was not ""just"" another movie.  It is the second part, third and fourth chapters of ""The Lord Of The Rings.""  As such, a higher standard was expected than turned out.  While I realize that some ""poetic"" license needed to be taken to make it understandable to the viewing public (plus to keep it under six hours!), I did not understand a lot of Peter Jackson's inclusions that weren't a part of the original story (such as the attack on the traveling Rohirrim), nor did I understand several of his omissions.  The ""hunky-dory""-style ending, where all was well with the world, if only for a minute, didn't strike me the right way.  Jackson could have picked a better place to end the movie, as well... leaving those who haven't read the books hanging on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>I find it hard to see how Jackson will have time to cover everything he needs to to wrap it up in the third movie... and I am disconcerted to hear rumor that he will be cutting out one of the defining parts of the story that occurs near the end.<br/><br/>Overall, I was expecting greatness, and walked away feeling a bit disappointed.

","Though it's really not necessary for someone else to add glowing comments to this already well-received movie, I've just got to add my voice. I think I liked ""The Two Towers"" more than ""The Fellowship"" (though the TTT and FOTR extended edition are neck-and-neck). It was darker than the first, more dramatic, more action-filled, and punctuated with more quiet moments of grief and beauty. <br/><br/>I've never read the books, though I will after I've seen ""Return of the King,"" so am going into these movies completely unspoiled and able to look at them as solely films. And they are great films. <br/><br/>It was a pleasure to see my old favorite characters return - especially Aragorn and Sam, who really shined here. I also enjoyed every new character I've met in TTT, Theoden, Eowyn, Faramir, and, of course Gollum. From the sun-dried plains of Rohan to the besieged Osgiliath, every set was sprawling and beautiful. The scenes in Rohan were especially wonderful because of the dialogue, which sounded very Shakespearean, with all of the power plays for Theoden's throne and the need and fear of war against evil. TTT is a very timely movie, but Peter Jackson doesn't beat that point to a pulp. I can't wait to see more of Faramir and his situation in the extended edition, as that was the only point that I felt could've been explained more. I know it has something to do with his father.<br/><br/> Anyhow, November and December seem so far away, and the wait for the next and last movie seems almost unbearable. However, I know I'll be really down when the end credits roll on ""ROTK,"" as I wish this wonderful story would never reach its conclusion."

","Better than the first. It had more adventure than the first. Aragon was the best in this movie because he was the best fighter in the movie. Legolas was great with his bow and arrow as well. The story of this movie is the same but it was had to deal with different types of characters like Golem where you actually see him as in the first movie there were only sounds and shadows of him. I liked Frodo in the first one better because he was braver in that one. Now he is all dazed and scared in this and he doesn't make the best out of his situation. I thought the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers should have had the group find each other and the fellowship would be back together. Gandalf, Aragon, Legolas and Gimlie are together, Frodo and Sam are together and Merry and Pippen are together. They are seperated into groups and I never read Return of the King so I can't really judge but I think they should be together. I thought it was a great movie and I recommend this movie to all viewers who are Lord of the Rings fans and like action adventure through out the whole movie."

","The Two Towers is one of those rare movies that can grip the audience from beginning to end.  As the middle chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved saga, Lord of the Rings, Two Towers offers vibrant characters, beautiful locations, and a truly emotional, gripping plot.  From the time we see Gandalf falling down the depths of Kazad-dum to the last sobering shots of two hobbits hiking toward the ominous Mount Doom, we become one with the majesty of Tolkien's Middle Earth.  This chapter chronicles the sundered Fellowship's adventures- Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli as they try to save lush Rohan from the forces of the two towers; Pippin and Merry as they make new alliances in haunted Fangorn, and Frodo and Sam as they make an uneasy friend of the twisted Gollum as they trek towards Mt. Doom.<br/><br/>With a top cast- Viggo Mortenson as the future king Aragorn, Christopher Lee as the treacherous Saruman the White, Andy Serkis as the complex Gollum, Elijah Wood who plays Frodo to the letter, and many more, the movie never once lags. It is further enhanced with beautiful music compliments of Howard Shore and the breathtaking views of locales such as celtic Edoras, industrial Isengard, and peaceful Rivendell. This is truly a movie that will be enjoyed for years to come."
"Rob_Taylor","9","0","0","4 July 2003"," Excellent work, but not quite as good as the first movie
","For a start, ignore the fanboys who decry Peter Jackson's efforts as ""Not Tolkien's story"" or other such comments. Of course it isn't. It's Peter Jackson's version of it. That's why, apparently missed by the rabid Tolkien-ites, all such films, somewhere in their credits, have the comment ""Based on the novel xxx by xxxx....."". So, given that it isn't intended to be a word-for-word rehash of the book, why shout it down for that?<br/><br/>What the Two Towers is, however, is solid action-fantasy cinema that picks up right where the first movie finished and runs with the ball. Personally, I didn't think it was quite as good as the first movie, but then, it would have had to be fantastic to be so. All sequels are ""more of the same"" to an extent, so it's hard to be as good as the original, but this one comes pretty close.<br/><br/>There were things I wished I could see more of in this movie, like the Ents attack on Isengard, or maybe where Gimli discovers the caves at Helm's Deep (which wasn't in there at all), but I'm hopeful that the extended DVD release will add little extras like this back into the story as the extended DVD of FOTR did.<br/><br/>I was a little puzzled to see the Elves at Helm's Deep. I don't recall that from the book, but who cares really? It seemed logical that they would come to help. Nice addition.<br/><br/>Gollum was a truly amazing piece of CGI. I don't think he looked THAT realistic, but what made him work for me was the expression that they got into his features. Amazing stuff, especially the ""Good Smeagol, Bad Gollum"" internal struggle. Incidentally, on a humorous note, there were people in the audience that didn't get that bit. I heard at least two people (adults) wondering out loud where the second Gollum came from!<br/><br/>I also think that it was a shame Shelob didn't make it into this one. T'would have made a good cliff-hanger ending for the second film to have Frodo apparently dead and Sam alone. But as it was, those of us who know the story can know anticipate the appearance of Ungoliant's spawn in much the same way as we anticipated Gollum's appearance.<br/><br/>If there was one thing that I'm not sure is a good idea, it's the increasingly acrobatic Legolas. I almost hate to think what he'll get up to in the final installment. But I'll still go and see it!<br/><br/>All in all, this is a worthy follow-up to FOTR and well worth your time. It will certainly be making an appearance in my DVD collection as soon as the extended version is released."

However, I get really nervous when I think about how *much* material still has to be covered. I'm also very concerned that some scenes in the first film that I think will be necessary to have the *last* scenes in ""Return of the King"" make sense were deleted in the theatrical release. And if we have yet another dwarf-tossing joke in ROTK, I'm probably going to throw something at the screen.<br/><br/>All that said, this is an amazing project, and even if flawed it is worth seeing.

However, I had a great time, and really enjoyed it. The flaws are still there, but because TTT is so action-based, it's more of an adrenaline rush. They minimized the comedy of Pippin and Merry, but Gollum just had to take over the obligatory western cinema comedy character who brings the ill-timed jokes, et. al. The part where he talked to himself (or his two selves) was deplorable. The last hour was strange, I kept saying ""it's going to end now"", but it kept going.

","I thought Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers was visually stunning and extremely entertaining. I mean... of course, it is. Even if you don't like the genre, you can't deny that it's an impressive piece of film making. Did I like it better than the The Fellowship of the Ring? Well I like them both, but for different reasons. The first movie seemed to have a little more character development. Mostly because we meet the characters for the first time and get to watch them start their quest. Part two is the middle. It's starts in the middle of the story and ends, still in the middle.<br/><br/>The first film also seemed to center more on the whimsical life of hobbits and elves. This one has two of the hobbits stuck in a ""tree"" for most of the movie. I would have liked to see more of Merry and Pippin, but Gimli the dwarf helped pick up the slack in the comic relief department. This story is a bit darker and focuses more on the humans. Aragorn, helping to lead the good fight alongside the people of Rohan.<br/><br/>The Two Towers certainly excels with the effects. More fighting, more creatures, more CG. Of course, ya gotta mention Gollum. He just rocks. Very creepy, yet somehow cute at the same time. Very realistic too. I know we all love Yoda, but his CG counterpart was designed to mimic a rubber puppet. Gollum breaks new ground, thanks to the performance of Andy Serkis. Apparently there was some controversy about whether or not he should be nominated for an Oscar. Sure it might seem strange to have a person win an acting award without actually being seen on screen... but he deserves it.<br/><br/>Anyway, the battle at Helm's Deep is cool... the Ents are cool... it's all cool. Whether you like it more or less than Fellowship, remember that it's basically one story, split into three parts. Can't wait for the last installment. Then I can't wait to watch all the extended edition versions on DVD, back to back to back."

","The Two Towers is a brilliant film; it is not intended to be an exact replica of Tolkien's brilliant books (which I have read and consider to be amoungst the finest ever written) but instead it is a film adaptation. However it does suffer a little from sequel-itis; with the battle of Helm's Deep being drawn out for longer than necessary to 'jazz up' the closing parts of the film. Gollum, without a doubt, is the star of the film, brilliantly brought to life by a combination of computer effects and the work of actor Andy Serkis. Yes, it will be disapointing to some of Tolkien's fans who dislike the liberties Peter Jackson as taken with this book; but my opinion is that these changes have made the Two Towers both a darker film, and a more uplifting in places as characters make decisions that have a profound impact on their world."

As being a HUGE fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, I found that his style of writing picked up immensely as the stories went on.  It took me three months to finish Fellowship, and only one to finish Two Towers.  It was much more gripping and although I enjoyed chapters like Helm's Deep, Shelob's Lair, and The Palantir.  Certainly a great middle book to the series.<br/><br/>MOVIE: Although not as faithful to the book as Fellowship, it remains true to Tolkien's world!  I easily forgave Peter Jackson's changes in Faramir and Treebeard, since they were never really changed dramatically.  It was, however, Smeagol/Gollum that takes this film over the top!  He looks so real and feels so real you could swear that you could actually have a conversation with him!  Wonderfully adapted.<br/><br/>Expanding Helm's Deep was a great idea on PJ's part!<br/><br/>Overall, it's better than Fellowship of the Ring, and makes me wish all the more that December wasn't so far away! I look forward to Return of the King, and eagerly anticipate the climactic finish in Mount Doom!"

","Amazing effects, great story, terrific acting.  The use of computer animation to assist with crowd and battle scenes was powerful and seamlessly done.  Peter Jackson did a beautiful job directing.  I saw this one on the IMAX screen and it blew my mind.  I also liked the way they set up the (apparent) differences in height between the hobbits and the ""big people"".<br/><br/>
And, it was so much as I had imagined it when I read the Lord of the Rings back in high school.  I dare to think even Tolkien (who apparently was a real techno-phobe) would have appreciated this version of his work."
"bigrab65","10","0","0","23 June 2003"," Film improves with second viewing
","When watching this for the first time I felt that the final hour was flawed. These problems however are not as important on second viewing.  The main issue is that of editing.  The battle of Helm's Deep is clearly the major set piece of the film, however it is unfortunately interrupted by other scenes, that is those involving Merry, Pippen and Frodo.  These interruptions lead to a clear loss in momentum and tension.  When you watch this film again though the problem is not that important, because on repeat viewings you are concerned less with tension anyway and focus more on the vision of the film makers.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting things about the endings is how dark it is. When first viewing the film it is easy to come away thinking that it had ended in a happy, and perhaps overly sentimental manner.  This is so if you take away the film's final five minutes.  However the scene of Gollum and Smeagol deciding to kill Frodo and Sam is at almost polar opposites to the scene involving Frodo and Sam which came before and means that we should be able to look forward to a final film which isn't just a plain action film, but relying  equally on characterisation and visual artistry."

","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers isn't a sequel to The Fellowship of the Ring, it's a direct continuation and it's every bit as brilliant, if not more. Just make sure you've seen Fellowship before seeing this movie. The fellowship established in the first film has been broken. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue to Mordor, being guided by Gollum, the first truly believable computer animated character. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and Legalos (Orlando Bloom) make new allies and launch an assault on Isengard. The Two Towers features a breathtaking atmosphere, amazing character development, and one of the most visually outstanding battle sequences in motion picture history.

I cannot wait for The Return of the King to arrive into theaters. This is the sequel of a classic that is appreciated by everyone with great taste in movies and stories. The Two Towers has plenty of war fights with weapons so strong and powerful. Again, this story seemed to have been written by a man who had seen it all.

","In fact, this is a better film then fellowship. Slightly better structured, story-wise, the film has a better pace then it's predecessor, with greater challenges facing our heroes, now split into 3 groups. The frantic last 15 minutes are amazingly well done, and the film is littered with visual delights, such as Gollum, Treebeard and, briefly, the Oliphaunt. Acting is up a notch on the first part, probably largely due to additions of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. The rousing score is put to even better use here, the final battle at the end, with the ladders, deserving special mention. Cinematography is again sensational. A significantly worthy addition to the series, in which the special effects, oddly far superior to part one, are worthy of recoginition (unlike say, something along the lines of The FAKEtrix Reloaded). 3.5/5"

","The Fellowship has been broken. Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun...<br/><br/>The above is the plot in a nutshell. This 3-hour (3.7 for the Extended version) movie has gone beyond the imaginable. Trees that talk and pick up humans, to this Gollum character who's downright annoying. What is in store for the Return of the King?<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me, I liked the film, and after seeing the original I was anxious to see this one, as I had heard that it would be coming out in the upcoming months. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. well that would be a like. I enjoyed the movie as a whole, but it was way too long. I will definitely see Return of the King in the theater next year but SOMEONE TELL PETER JACKSON TO INCLUDE AN INTERMISSION!<br/><br/>While the movie is very visually impressive, I believe that the film is not up to the hype that it was given. I should have known however that it was LOTR worshipers who gave it 26269 ratings of 10. Did it disserve a best picture award? It absolutely did not. I was glad that it got the special effects Oscar, however. But nonetheless, I was able to hold my urine for to hours, for I was intrigued to find out what happened in the end.<br/><br/>
The Battle of Helms Deep was probably one of the best battle scenes done since Braveheart and I thought it was an excellent adaptation of Tokien. However, it lingered for too long. I think Tokien would have liked these movies, but disliked at how bored you sometimes you get sitting in the chair.<br/><br/>This movie was very good. However, the American Film Institute need not revise its 100 greatest movies of all time for Fellowship or Two Towers. Like many series films, I thought that the first film, The Fellowship, was far superior.<br/><br/>MPAA Rating: PG 13<br/><br/>My Rating: 12 and up for epic battle sequences and scary images<br/><br/>My * Rating 8.8"

"LOTR_Diva08","9","0","0","14 June 2003"," A brilliant and inspiring film
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a fantastic middle chapter of the LOTR trilogy. Peter Jackson again showed his talent in directing this film. After I saw the Fellowship of the Ring, I didn't know how anything could follow up such a great movie, but the Two Towers managed to do so perfectly.<br/><br/>The Two Towers smoothly changed scenes from Frodo, Sam, and Gollum making their way to Mordor, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf in Rohan and Helm's Deep, and Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard in Fangorn Forest. The elements of the film were excellent.<br/><br/>The actors did wonderful jobs portraying their characters, especially Elijah Wood (Frodo), Sean Astin (Sam), Andy Serkis as Gollum, Ian Mckellen (Gandalf), and Viggo Mortenen (Aragorn). Elijah Wood had to portray a different attitude for Frodo than in the first, and he did this well. The actors all worked well together as an ensemble.<br/><br/>The music throughout the film fit the scenes perfectly, and the visual effects of the film were also very well done. The battle of Helms Deep was a very breath-taking part, and King Theoden's transformation was also impressive. Another extremely impressive element of the film was Gollum. Gollum was very believable as a CGI and added to the movie's greatness.<br/><br/>
Although the Two Towers was a very dramatic movie, it mixed some comic relief in as well. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates great films."

","I never read the book, for that matter I don't read any novels, and when i saw the first part, it was quite impressive for the grandeur and special effects. But there seemed to be a lack of coheshion in the movie and any thrust. I was looking at my watch for the film to be over during the final 1/2 hour. But the second one was totally awesome. Very few sequels surpass their originals, and this was one of them. The final war was the cream of the special effects. ""My Precious"" favourite.

Based on Tolkien's legendary books, the story is superior to mere scifi/fantasy trite.  The directing (by the amazing Peter Jackson) is beyond the ability of the English language to praise!  It's only too bad Peter Jackson will be snubbed by the Academy's disdain for scifi/fantasy in lieu of socialist dogma.

","When I looked up from the paper one day and realised that the greatest fantasy epic of all time was being made into a movie, I could do nothing but stare at the picture with my mouth wide open.<br/><br/>For Tolkien's epic ""The Lord of the Rings"" was indeed being made into a motion picture, separated into the three movies ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King."" A year ago, I saw the first film, and I was intrigued. Peter Jackson, director, did a wonderful job of turning the book into a movie. (Though I was a bit disappointed that he left out Tom Bombadil.) But I'm not here to talk about ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" - I'm here to talk about ""The Two Towers,"" the most amazing movie that I've probably ever laid eyes upon.<br/><br/>It started out with a flashback to the ""Fellowship,"" and I was thinking, ""All right. I know this happens...Can we move on to that sexy Elijah Wood [Frodo] now?"" But within a short fifteen seconds or so, I had forgotten about the male leads in the movie and I was biting my nails for Gandalf as he fell down the Mines of Moria clutching on to the monstrous Balrog. From then on, my eyes were glued to the screen as I watched the adventurous Hobbits trek through the lands of Middle-earth as their never-ending quest for the Ring continued.<br/><br/>
In ""The Two Towers,"" the realm of Rohan is introduced, and this makes things a whole lot more interesting. The action is extraordinary. For the first time, the real world of Men is introduced rather than the first movie's hiding within the sacredness of the Wood-elves and the sleepy Hobbits. There's literally tons of war scenes that'll make your blood run cold. Peter Jackson definitely did an extraordinary job with directing and creating this film, and I thank him for that.<br/><br/>Though some Tolkien-fans might disagree with me when I say that this is the perfect movie, and that it's not as true to the books, I really have to say that they should let things slide a bit. This is more true than Harry Potter is to its books. (And a whole lot better, if you ask me...) If you were a true Tolkien-fan you wouldn't care if it sucked, you'd care if they did everything in a way that the filmmakers actually put time into it - and they did - TWO YEARS of time!<br/><br/>Overall, I'd have to say that if I could see this movie again before it hits DVD, I definitely would, and I'd like to thank Elijah, Viggo, Ian, Andy, Dom, Billy, Orlando, John and Sean for your great roles in the movie!<br/><br/>-Ravenn Porter (MissyBaggins91)"

","Let me start out by saying I like this movie, it was engrossing and entertaining.<br/><br/>There was one big problem I had with it however...<br/><br/>(Spoilers)<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>The combat scenes are too arcadish for my taste. ""My score will be higher than yours!"" or something to that effect was actually said by Gimli at one point during the battle for Helms Deep. I realize this is somewhat true to the book, that the protagonists killed many orcs, but there was no real sense of danger. Legolas sliding down the stairs on the shield while machine gunning with his bow, then rocketing the shield into another orc defies belief. The Uruk-Hai acted more like bowling pins than heavily armored, savage warriors. When you're going to base half of a 3 hour movie on combat it really needs to be done well, and I don't think this was.<br/><br/>I also predict slower sales for the final movie of the trilogy. Despite characters in the movie assuring us there's a lot left to do, I think it's pretty obvious that The Return of the King will be a mop up operation.<br/><br/>That being said I'm still looking forward to it.<br/><br/>Rating - 8.2"
"Raleon","8","0","0","2 June 2003"," Much different than the book I remember.
","When you see a film which is based on a novel, or anything else for that matter, you must understand what you are seeing is the Director's version of the book; they're image in which the book gave them. Therefore, this is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, not Tolkiens. Whether or not Tolkien would have like this would be up for arguement.    But Jackson makes a lot of assumptions and conclusions on the history of Middle-earth and weaves his movie around that instead of drwaing what is told directly from the book. For example, Aragorn and Arwin, with one of them falling off the cliff. This is not mentioned in the book, but is an assumption which Jackson has made.     While this film does great to draw in action fans and war fans, and does well with great shakespearian style acting, (those are its high points), it fails at portraying the book from my point of view. Though he does well at portraying the competitive friendship of Gimli and Lagolas, he steals away from the portrayel of orcs as horrid and powerful beings. He does not do well at balancing the two.  He also misses out on a lot of the imagery the book conveys.       But if you haven't read the book, these things won't stop you from enjoying a pretty good movie. It's much better and much more entertaining than the first movie he did."

","What could I say? I was disappointed. Of course it's well done, of course it's filled with hyper cool action and great battles, but nontheless it IS disappointing, if you've read the book. Too many things were uselessly changed (e.g. the elves), characters were wrongly introduced and the Ents looked like as if they had been extracted from some old 50's SF movie. Altogether it's cool, but, for those who haven't read the book, read it after you've seen this."
"patbuddha","Null","0","0","25 May 2003"," I think I'm starting to come around on this series
","It took me six months before finally seeing the second installment of Peter Jackson's adaptation of Lord of the Rings. I saw the first right around the time of its release. I was one of the few who just didn't get it. Coupled with how bored I was with the first Harry Potter movie, I came to the conclusion that I was never meant to be into straight fantasy. I'm about the only one of my friends who does not get excited about Dungeons & Dragons or Magic: The Gathering. Nor have I ever read Tolkien's books.<br/><br/>
So Two Towers finally showed up at the dollar cinema (actually a buck fifty). With all of the hooha surrounding these films I figured at some point I would have to see it anyway. It's cheaper than renting it from Blockbuster AND I'm seeing it on the big screen.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed this one for the most part. It occurred to me that the problem I had with Fellowship of the Ring is probably the same problem that most people had with The Phantom Menace: it holds itself back a bit. It saves all its good ideas for later and lets itself simply be an introduction to a larger whole. <br/><br/>This middle part of the trilogy finally is swept up with all of the imaginative stuff that you expect to see in this type of movie. Gollum and the big walking tree guys really sold the whole thing for me. As impressive as the Battle of Helms Deep was, I liked watching the big tree guys putting the smackdown even more. <br/><br/>However, an observation. While most of geekdom has proclaimed the Lord of the Rings movies to be the hands-down winner as between it and the Star Wars prequels, I still stand firm on my belief that both these series are qualitatively even. The dialogue in Two Towers bears little resemblance to how real people speak or interact with one another. Most everyone speaks in succint proclamations with very little nuance. But that's okay. It's not dialogue or subtle character development that brings us to these movies. It's all about the imagination and epic scope."

","The Two Towers was an excellent follow-up to Fellowship.  It was probably more exciting, and Helm's Deep may have been the best part of the series thus far.  Also, Gollum was a delightful surprise, both CGI and otherwise. I didn't think they could make his character so real, as well as two-faced, just like he was in the book.  I think it strayed from the book a bit too much though.  The whole Aragorn-over-the-cliff thing wasn't necessary, nor was the Frodo-to-Osgiliath.  This movie was long, but they actually cut off a large part of the ending, (Saruman-Pippin with the palantir, and Frodo w/ Shelob and Cirith Ungol), so I cant see how they will make the third movie anything under 4 hours, without cutting off large chunks."

","The Two Towers was a great movie to me. It had everything in it. It had the forbidden love, action, gore (mild orc blood, not extreme that I remember), sadness, bravery, and hope. In this film of the trilogy, it shows that there is a definite hope that the ring will be destroyed. Terrifying Uruk-Hai are marching to Helm's Deep to slaughter a city, and there aren't enough men, which means it's gonna be a long night. The movie also gives you an emotion you wouldn't have expected to have. You feel sorry for Gullum, or Smeagol. He has dark side, but then he has sweet side. But what's sad about him, is that he's almost like a child who doesn't quite know as much as the rest of world, while he's fighting off the darker side of him who he can't seem to rid himself of. If you like fantasy movies with adventure in them, than there is a very good chance that you'll love ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."""

","*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers (2002) You all know the cast! **** I might as well get it out of the way - I am a purist so this review will be pretty critical. I'll start with the negatives however, so that I can finish the review with the praise this film deserves. I will also skip most of the plot detail, because I am fairly sure that most of you know the storyline.<br/><br/>At first viewing, the pacing of TTT might seem a little jerky, as we shift between the various plotlines. One of the problems noted almost instantly is a lack of scale, mainly in Frodo and Sam's story. The Dead Marshes appear too small so that Mordor, instead of being a distant blur on the horizon is constantly close and threatening, the red light of Mount Doom always showing. You lose the epic scale from the book. This shows again when after Helm's Deep, Gandalf and others ride to the top of the ridge. Mordor is strangely close again.<br/><br/>Minor changes like sending the women and children to Helm's Deep will have repurcussions in ROTK which I will not detail because they are spoilers.<br/><br/>Cutting off the end of the book is not a particularly good idea because ROTK is going to be packed with action anyway. Faramir's personality change was one of the things that got me most. Instead of appering as a complete contrast to Boromir, as a true Numenorian who would not pick up the Ring if it were lying by the wayside, he appears even darker than Boromir.<br/><br/>Osgiliath, seemingly served no more purpose than to inform us that Peter Jackson can do amazing things with computers. Well - we already knew that! Osgiliath looked perfect. But taking Frodo and Sam there not only removed the sense of urgency, it diminished the scale even further. Then there was the fact that Frodo and Sam are supposed to know absolutely nothing about the outside world.<br/><br/>Another point that was mentioned - in Osgiliath, Faramir screams, 'Nazgul!'. No one knew who the creatures on wings were until right at the end. The Black Breath etc is referenced, but the characters do not know that the Nazgul are what is spreading terror. The Fell Beasts were not threatening enough I felt.<br/><br/>The Wargs were absolutely pointless and showed the one weakness in the Special Effects. And Aragorn's near death? Death has been faked so many times in this trilogy that it is ridiculous and unbelievable when it occurs and is actually in the book. A few odd things - the Ents' faces were very good, but the rest of them was not substantial enough and Gandalf's reintroduction (to Merry and Pippin), I disliked intensely. Also, Rohan was not the flat green grasslands that it should have been.<br/><br/>The only cast member I disliked? Elrond who seems far too severe! As he is half man, he would not be so harsh on men. Finally - the Great Eye of Sauron. It just didn't fit. Dare I say it, it reminded me of the power coupling in Episode 2, just a different colour!<br/><br/>Enough of bad points, although there were more, I'll move on to the (many) positives!<br/><br/>The cast - well what can I say? New and established members alike, I was wowed.<br/><br/>Sets - especially Edoras. Exactly as I had pictured them in my own imagination. Fangorn was absolutely perfect, as was Helm's Deep. The Black Gate has got to be one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Special Effects - especially Gollum. I have never seen such a brilliant CG character. His split personality was perfect too. I felt sorry for him, I hated him, I loved him!<br/><br/>The battle sequences were brilliant. Helm's Deep did not seem too long and who can forget the trail of the Orc armies stretched across the plain?<br/><br/>The destruction of Isengard, the breaking of its dam, I was awed. The tiniest detail was observed. Just look at the detail on the Elven brooches, on armour, the pillars of Meduseld.<br/><br/>And a small thing that I would like to say is thank you to Peter Jackson and his team for their research on pronuciation. If I had had to sit through FOTR with everyone saying Sawron, I would not have gone to see TTT.<br/><br/>And I really liked the foreshadowing of Aragorn's death. It was incredibly moving, although it did not state that Arwen loses her immortality and dies shortly afterwards, which would have been another moving touch.<br/><br/>Enough from me rambling on! I am not going to review FOTR as well, because I have so much to say. From this review, you might deduce that I dislike TTT because I fear my complaints exceed my praises. I just tend to notice my dislikes more and voice them! It cannot be said I disliked this film - I've seen it 3 times and will certainly go again. I did however, prefer FOTR. That is on of the reasons why I have given this film 4 stars and not the 5 I would give to Fellowship."

","The movie ""The Two Towers"" has got some scenes that are absolutely fantastic - breathtaking (e.g. the arrival of the four heroes at Edoras, the destruction of Isengard, Gollum's monologues etc...) and some very ugly commercialised scenes that only appeal to Americans (e.g. Aragorn's and Arwen's kiss, Gimli's bad jokes and Legolas' skate). New Line must understand that the film is not only out in America but also in Europe and other countries, where the audience are demanding films of greater quality.<br/><br/>
However, this does not mean that The Two Towers is a bad movie. In fact, it's one of the best movies ever made!!! Everything in this film is brilliant: especially the perfomances, which are outstanding!

","I still cannot decide which of the two lotr films i prefer, but I don't really think that matters, as I rate them both 10/10.  The thing I loved about The Two Towers was that straight off we were back where we had left off - it felt like there was no time between me seeing this and the first one in the cinema.  Some say TTT has a lack of characterisation, but I felt you really began to see the individual traits, as the fellowship has scattered.  Viggo Mortensen dons the reluctant hero so easily as Aragorn, he is a brilliant actor and deserves to get the recognition he deserves - even if he doesn't want all the Hollywood attention. Elijah Wood continues his great portrayal of Frodo, and Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are just as good as in the previous one.  Some parts were cheesy (like Sam's little overview at the end), but even though this was a long film, I wanted it to go on.  How this differs from other films is that I feel as if I am there and living the troubles, and joys that the characters experience, rather than watching - my heart was beating so fast during the battle.  The highlight is always going to be seen as the battle of Helm's Deep, and it has been criticised that it revolves around it too much, but I think the anticipation build up is great. I loved the whole thing, minor criticism was the Ents weren't great when viewed close up, but I'm knit-picking!  I better stop blabbing, and just finish: I am counting the days to the finale of this awesome trilogy. I just hope it does not get so hyped up that it disappoints."

TTT's being the middle film in jackson's trilogy really doesn't explain the silly plot liberties, as some here have suggested.<br/><br/>despite my delight at gollum's overall depiction, i did find his modern psychoanalytic utterings a bit out of place. the ents were somewhat more disney-animatronic than i'd imagined, but this is a minor gripe.<br/><br/>despite my criticisms, i was able to enjoy TTT to a fair degree; i just won't watch it over and over again the way i did FotR, unless the extended DVD release is particularly strong.<br/><br/>what really bugged me about the films, however, was the jacked usage and grammar. to each his own peeves, i guess, but these goofs really jarred me out of middle earth more than any dwarf-tossing joke.<br/><br/>FotR: elrond says, 'blah blah blah from whence it came.' whence is an odd bird of a word, combining both a preposition and a subordinating conjunction--it means 'from where.' thus, 'from whence'='from from where.' bahh!<br/><br/>TTT: theoden says something like, 'no parent should have to bury their child.' that was a nasty pronoun-antecedent mismatch; no king should have to speak so poorly!

","If there was such thing as a sequal being better than the first one, than this is it! The Two Towers are full of everything a movie needs: action, romance,suspence, and even some comedy. Peter Jackson has totally brought Middle Earth to life as he introduces us to new characters, such as Eowyn, and re-aquaint ourselves with others, such as Gollum. We also go where no one has gone before, like Rohan, and deep into Mordor. You don't even have to read the book in order to understand what is going on. It would keep you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>However, if you actually read the book, there were a couple of things that every movie based on books has. It doesn't have every detail that was described in the book. Although it has happened before, and most likely will happen again, you just can't get over it.

"nerettyksduredro","10","0","0","17 April 2003"," Concerning Towers, Dreams and other stuff.
","I remember reading a readers letter in some film publication around Christmas time, where the question of which two towers the title was referring to, was brought up. The answer the publication gave, in which they quoted a letter from Tolkien to his publisher, was Orthanc and Cirith Ungol. They went on to write that, since the Ringbearers arrival at Cirith Ungol is delayed to the third film, the Two Towers in the film are Orthanc and Barad-dur. Which makes more sense to me, because that is where Saruman and Sauron ""live"". As for the film, I think it is one of the best ever, and one where they actually made CGI moving. The scene where Treebeard sees the destruction of the forest near Isengard, and the Ents heading for Isengard really got to me. Move over, Greenpeace! I was disappointed, though, by that they didn´t include Faramir´s vision/dream of seeing Boromir dead, and later finding the broken Horn of Gondor washed ashore. If they had included this, some more light could have been shed on the character of Faramir, he was a bit too one-note for me.<br/><br/>I mean, at least Boromir smiled a few times during FotR, but Faramir doesn´t here, well, not before he is tempted by the Ring, anyway. Not that I blame him, after all, he is the non-favourite son of the Steward of Gondor, he knows his brother is dead, but that doesn´t make him more favoured, and his country is about to be attacked by a huge army from Mordor. The dream-sequense would only have taken about a minute or so of screen time, anyway, and I know which scenes they could have cut down on, but I won´t name names. Interesting dialogue, though: Go to sleep/This is a dream etc., because the lucky members of the audience are asleep/dreaming, while those who are too eager to catch up with the movie when it ""re-starts"", are awake and presumably in pain. Enough said."
"SidHudgens","9","0","0","16 April 2003"," Better than the first, but still flawed
","*Spoilers Herein*<br/><br/>There seems to be a fundamental division between those who see this film. Everyone either says decisively that they much preferred the previous one or they much preferred this one. Personally, I preferred this one. The ending is much better than film one, and the new characters (Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, Gollum, Treebeard, Faramir and Wormtongue) make it much more interesting. However, I'm not sure all the changes to the book worked.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good changes. I think having Wormtongue banish Eomer at the start, only for him to return with Gandalf to save the day at the battle of Helm's Deep was a very good idea, and I think it makes him a more memorable character for those who haven't read the book (I've read it twice by the way).<br/><br/>The platoon of Elves arriving at Helm's Deep, and the death of Haldir was also a good idea, as I think people might be disappointed if Haldir had just faded after the first film, as he did in the books.<br/><br/>Faramir taking Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath wasn't a particularly good idea, but I can understand why Peter Jackson did it. At this point, the battle of Helm's Deep was at its climax and the Ents were wrecking Isengard. I think Jackson wanted to put in a third action sequence (ie. the Ringwraith attack) as if it had just shown Frodo and Sam walking along with Gollum it would have looked pretty silly.<br/><br/>Onto the bad changes now. Just what was the Warg attack all about? And even worse, Aragorn falling off the cliff? That scene belongs in Monty Python, not Lord of the Rings. People have said that Aragorn's fall was so that he could see the Uruk-hai army, but surely Theoden could just have sent a scout or something?<br/><br/>And of course, the most discussed flaw in the film itself: Legolas using the shield as a skateboard. Everyone mentions this, and no wonder. It completely undermines the serious implications of the battle, and simply isn't funny.<br/><br/>
I also felt that the dialogue in this film wasn't quite as good as in Fellowship. Gimli boasting about his running ability was mildly amusing, but it was out of place. However, Theoden's poem (Where is the horse and the rider/ where is the horn that was blowing...) worked very well, and to be honest I quite liked Sam's speech at the end.<br/><br/>Generally, the acting was perfectly fine, particularly from Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Brad Dourif, and Bernard Hill. Jackson's inventiveness with the camera is inspired and I know he will make a fantastic film out of The Return of the King.<br/><br/>9/10"

","In Tolkien's ""The Hobbit"", after Bilbo uses the ring to ditch Gollum and get out of the goblin caves, he tells Gandalf, Thorin, and the other dwarves that he escaped without mentioning the ring.  Later, while helping them out of another bind, he reveals to the dwarves that he can use the ring to become invisible at will, and the dwarves force him to retell the escape story with the ring included.  Like Thorin and company, I feel that Peter Jackson's first telling of the Two Towers left out far too much core material; in the extended, the character modifications make sense, and the events flow together better.<br/><br/>I wrote an earlier review expressing some mixed feelings about a few of the characters and plot elements after seeing the original, and took the opportunity to view the extended edition on screen Monday.  It is superior in every way to the first release, moreso than the extended FotR was to the original.  However, this is a disturbing trend.  I would rather have seen *only* the extended edition rather than fart around with the inferior shortened product, but I suspect New Line is raking in the DVD profits with all these second releases. <br/><br/>What can I say?  Many of the gripes I had with the film are fixed in the extended release.  It was enjoyable, heart wrenching, humourous, terrifying, and awe-inspiring.  Yet somehow, I feel cheated.

"Magnus-83","Null","0","0","5 April 2003"," Exceptionally well made movie - But somewhat ruined
","""The Two Towers"" is an exceptionally well made movie, acting, special effects and music are all at the top notch. It is probably the movie I've enjoyed watching 2003. (Yes, it I know it was released during 2002, but I always wait until there is possible to get a good seat in the theaters, and leave the camping outside the movie theaters to the geeks! ;-)) The scenery was stunning, as was the visualizations of the characters in the books, as well as the atmosphere.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm not by far as satisfied by the way Peter Jackson converted the plot of the book into a movie. There are a few changes that was made, although not all of them were bad, many of them somewhat ruined the story. Mostly these ""bad"" changes consists of scenes invented by mr Jackson himself, that have nothing to do with the plot, and was shown at the expense of some, more imporant scenes that had to be left out. As for example, the warg riders that assault the people of Rohan on their way to Helms Deep is quite out of line. I just can't figure out, did Peter Jackson wake up one morning, realizing that he thought it would be really cool to put orcs on big wolfs, and put them in a movie they didn't belong to? As those who have read the books probably know, there were no warg riders in the Lord of the Rings saga. The battle of Helms Deep were stretched from just a minor happening in the book, to the focal point of this entire movie. Quite naturally, a lot of scenes had to be left out then. And what is this with Osgiliath, were Frodo and Sam were brought? In the books, this was just the remnants of a former city, that had been abandoned when the forces of Mordor started to push against the people of Gondor. This meant that all references to Minas Morgul and Minas Tirith were left out of the movie, probably because of the lack of time or money, probably both. Thus, the audience missed the entire core of the story, as for exampe why it is named ""The Two Towers"" - Those are the citadels of Minas Tirith and Minas Morgul, towers that represent goodness and evil. Yes, that is correct, the name of this book doesn't refer to Barad-Dur and Orthanc. All these ways of showing Arwen is another way of wasting precious time; She shouldn't appear at all in TTT.<br/><br/>Another set of bad changes - Characters. Peter Jackson have by reasons unknown decided that the craracters in the book were to be changed. The most anoying to me is Gimli, who by mr Jacksons interpretation is supposed to be a kind of fool that we should all laugh at. Yes, he's short. And can't se over the battlements of a normal fortress. He is clumsy and crude beyond belief. All he lives for is drinking beer (subsequently burping, even in the presence of a king) and fighting. Well, as described by Tolkien, Gimli is one of the more majestic and adorable characters of the entire trilogy. And quite unique for being a dwarf, because of his deep with an elf (Legolas), a race otherwise despised by the dwarves. But this is obviously not good enough for Peter Jackson. King Theoden of Rohan have been degraded from the calm, wise and understanding regent of the books, to a grumpy, somewhat incompetent and violent ""don't-argue-with-me-I'm-the-king""-type of character in the movies. After being ""cured"" by Gandalf, his first thought was to slay Wormtongue, and Aragorn had to intervene. Well, in the book, a soldier wanted to slay Wormtongue, while Theoden intervened and instead told the guards to give him a horse and let him go. So, in essence, that is what happened in the movie, so why do all these changes? Treebeard, the wise ent, picked by curiosity up the two hobbits in the book, eager to learn more about them. By Peter Jacksons interpretation, he only wanted to kill them, because he thought they were orcs. Why was this change necessary? Besides this, the ents decided, by their own initiative, to assault Isengard according to the book, as Treebeard (a.k.a Fangorn, as he not only lived in this forrest, but he also was the soul of the forrest and knew about everything that happened in there) had grown mad with the ways of Saruman. But according to Jackson, it took the cunning of two little brats from the Shire to convince the oldest living being in Middle-Earth (Treebeard) that he should assault Isengaard. Faramir, the younger brother of Boromir, was according to Tolkien the opposite of his hot-headed and bad-tempered older brother. He was wise and calm, and choose the way of the mind instead of the way of the sword. Well, not according to Jackson. Instead, he behaves like a blueprint of his older brother, seizes the hobbits, and brings them to Gondor.<br/><br/>I could go on forever, but I'll think I better halt here. I always expect some changes to the plot and storyline when a movie is made with a book as the foundation. Otherwise, it would probably not be possible to make something watchable. But what disturbs me about TTT is that most of these changes are totally out of line, there is no need or reason for the director of doing them! So why were these changes made? Why removing scenes that could easily have done, and replacing them with stuff that is totally out of line and that in fact does a lot of damage to the plot? Why change the characteristics and behaviour of the characters in this story, when they have already been outlined by someone who dedicated almost his entire life to create these stories?<br/><br/>IMHO, what Peter Jackson did is unforgivable. Yes, it is a great movie and very watchable. But remember this, the author of the Lord of the Ring saga is John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, not Peter Jackson or Frances Walsh. They probably don't understand that the plot of this saga is a lot more complicated than just a bunch of orcs, humans and elves that play hack'n slash with each other.<br/><br/>Other changes that I liked is the scene were Arwen stand by Aragorns dead body in the future, and then sits by his grave for quite some time, and finally walk off into Loth-Lorien - Although the movie never explains that it is were she's heading, as well as that's were she'll die, at her own wish. I think that scene was beautiful, and quite interesting to see in this movie, since the books never states what happens to the others after the ending of the ""Return of the King"". And it also explains why Elrond is so hostile to the idea of his daughter marrying a simple human.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. But make sure you watch it before you read the book if possible, otherwise you might be disappointed."

","i read the first book before i saw the film last year, and was dissapointed with ""the fellowship of the ring"" on first viewing. Then on second viewing, i found it very good, and on third viewing i became a lover of the film. I started to read the second book but like a lot of people who have tried to read them, only managed to get half way through. The book became too hard to read, with tolkien becoming more and more descriptive, and beatifully poetic, but taking an awful long time to get the story going. So i stopped reading it.<br/><br/>Now, the film is out. And i hoped i wouldn't lose interest at the similair point in the film. Luckily i didn't. Peter Jackson intertwines each of the three different storylines well, one of which becomes a little too less focused on. And the film does take a while to gather some steam. But when it does it is damn well worth it. Yes, some of the effects are a little ""crap"" for lack of a better word. Well too be fair, only one little negative to the effects, and you'll all see it when you watch the film. And it's not gollum either. And also a scene that is unintentionally funny, which maybe us brits will only gringe at. Anyway, Gollum enters the scene, and i did groan and think oh no, it looks too fake. But after a short while, when it closes in on his character, he does look fantastic. And at times, very very funny and very very evil. And everyone is saying blah blah helms deep battle, best thing you'll ever see blah blah. It isn't the best thing you will ever see, by no means, but it is absolutely fanbloodytastic. More in the mood and the build, with the rain and the distant footsteps of the approaching army. And that is only one of three brilliantly depicted battles. All the performances are good, nothing oscar worthy, and if orlando bloom gets another nomination, i'll be so damn angry. He didn't do anything in the first film, yet ""best newcomer"", why?. Anyway, he was good, but so was everybody else. Overall, just another great part to a film that can only truly be judged when all three are on dvd."

","I'm one of those guys who read the LOTR around once a year and who compare the movies a lot to the book. I had some issues with the script of FOTR, but the DVD version satisfied me and cleared a lot of things up. I can safely say, that part one is nearly without blemish for me.<br/><br/>Well, TTT had even more plot holes and deviations from the book, which didn't work. However it also had some great elements, which made it more than memorable.<br/><br/>The whole Rohan-story didn't succeed in enthralling me. The audience is thrown into it without too much explanation and I never started to care for Theodred, Theoden, Eowyn and Eomer. Some scenes and lines were quite hollow and even embarassing. All those suffering Rohan women and children didn't help either.<br/><br/>And there are too many things left unexplained about the Ents. You never quite understand why they should go to war or why they shouldn't. Hopefully the DVD version will clear something up here.<br/><br/>So much for the bad things, now for the good ones, and there were a lot of them: The Frodo-Sam-Gollum part worked perfectly. To view Frodo falling to the ring - great. And what can I say about Gollum, which hasn't already been said? It's the greatest CGI-character ever, by a long shot. After his introduction you have already forgotten, that he is not for real. I even liked the Faramir-character and don't think, that he is so different from the book. He has his preferences and the well-being of Sam and Frodo is not one of the first on his list.<br/><br/>I also liked the intercut Elven scenes, even though they led to a conclusion I didn't like: The Elvish help at Helm's Deep. It's a 'feel good'-element, which should not have been necessary.<br/><br/>At last there is one single scene, which will make this movie forever special in my mind: The charge of the Rohirrim down the hill. This is pure cinematography and potentially the most moving scene I have ever seen. The makers of the movie worked wonders with scope, lights, camera movement and the music in this part. Just remembering it gives me the shivers.<br/><br/>The cast and the score were a notch down from FOTR, but still good. Wood and Astin got better, while I was a tad disappointed with MacKellen. Rhys-Davies was great - unfortunateley the role he was given (humorous sidekick) was not."
"TheJudge-2","10","0","0","1 April 2003"," Almost Perfect.
","Everything that can be said about Peter Jackson's Two Towers by now has been said, and I'm not one for repeating the same well-earned praise. Suffice it to say that the movie delivers entirely on the expectation levels set by the first part of the trilogy, the set pieces are spectacular on a biblical scale, the cinematography is flawless and the scenery just awesomely epic. Jackson as everyone knows filmed all three parts together, which was a very bold move, but it's clear (as if it wasn't before) that both the audience and the studio's financial investments are in good hands.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a much darker film than the Fellowship Of The Ring, and this is deliberate, matching the growing sense of dramatic pressure and impending doom in the books. Lighting, cinematography  and musical score all merge seamlessly to evoke this atmosphere, and all traces of the ""cutesey"" have vanished. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn comes to the fore, expanding the fierce nobility of his role with consummate skill. Ian McKellern continues to make the part of Gandalf his very own, Elijah Wood reprises his role as Frodo with the same accomplishment, and best yet, the remaining three hobbits are all fleshed out far better, given more on-screen time and thus made more three-dimensional and credible. Christopher Lee remains a superbly-cast Saruman, and the newcomers Brad Dourif as the venomously evil Grima Wormtongue and Bernard Hill as Theoden are both excellent.<br/><br/>I have to mention how brilliantly Gollum as a character has been handled. The CGI is flawless, and Andy Serkis' realisation of the role show a scope of perceptivity and imagination that is literally jaw-dropping. The usage CGI as a whole in the movie has been executed superbly, both in terms of character and set pieces (the attack of the warg-mounted Uruk-hai, the battle of Helm's Deep etc) and I was especially interested to see how Jackson would handle the Ents, which I suspected would be the most difficult thing to do without breaking the suspension of disbelief. Needless to say, he gets away with it.<br/><br/>A number of rabid Tolkien purists on this message board have carped about a number of chapters having been ""cut"" from the end of the original book - well, I'm sorry, but I just don't see the issue. The Fellowship ""stole"" briefly from the start of The Two Towers with the death of Boromir, because it was a more natural end-point, and The Two Towers ends with Frodo and Sam's passage to Cirith Ungol. What happens next won't be cut (and it's only two chapters) - it'll be in at the start of the next movie. You have to remember that this isn't a weekly serial - we have to wait a year for the final part - so ending The Two Towers on the same unbearable cliffhanger as the original book would not be the move of a smart director. Plus of course, the final book, The Return Of The King is much shorter. It doesn't look it on the shelf, but it's half-full of appendices and background historical information which won't be relevant to the final movie, so Jackson will have been happy to have moved the final episode into the last movie. Admittedly I don't see any real reason why Jackson should have had Faramir take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath for another albeit small set-piece (this does not occur in the book - they part company before this point), but apart from pointlessness, I have no issues with this. Maybe Jackson thought that the Ring's growing hold on Frodo needed restressing from a dramatic point of view. I'll go with his judgement on this. The same thing with the arrival of Haldor and the Elves at Helm's Deep. Not in the book, but not an issue. Maybe Jackson felt he needed to point out that the forces of Good in Middle Earth were stretched to breaking and that there no huge reserves waiting in the background.<br/><br/>So after all this praise, why ""almost perfect""? I feel almost guilty to carp after such praise but there were a few little niggles that unsettled me.<br/><br/>
Firstly, the character of Faramir. There's nothing wrong with David Wenham's acting, but the character has been radically changed. Faramir is meant to be a gentler wiser version of Boromir, not prone to unthinking rashness, but labouring under the fact that his father holds him in no value, compared to his bold foolhardy dead brother. The movie version of Faramir is far less grandiose.<br/><br/>Then there's Eomer's Rohirrim. Where are they all? There's meant to be 2,000 of them running around, but the bunch we're shown looks like a small mounted version of some Hell's Angel chapter. Not very impressive.<br/><br/>I'm still not happy with the way Gimli is portrayed. Yes in the books there is some comic relief provided in the banter between Gimli and Legolas, but Jackson still uses the character as not much more than a comedy dwarf. It's stereotypical and shallow - Gimli either fights or argues. There's no sense of the majesty of the dwarves, just as in movie #1 there was no evocation of Gimli's sense of loss at the fall of Moria, the culminating achievement of his people. Plus WHY OH WHY did they use John Rhys-Davies to voice Treebeard as well? It can't have been a matter of budget, and it's very obviously the same actor being used.<br/><br/>Finally, and this I found shocking in how much it clanged, how much a single 5 second sequence totally destroyed the grandeur and the sense of the epic, how completely it shattered my sense of disbelief - Legolas, the snow-boarding elf on the shield. I cannot believe that a director with the perception and the subtlety of touch that Jackson has demonstrated ever even filmed this scene, let alone left it in the final cut. Why oh why is it there? It's self-indulgent, utterly unnecessary, completely out of place and destroys atmosphere at a single stroke. Yes I know Orlando Bloom is an extreme sports fan, but why is it necessary to leverage this and include this scene? It's a mark of how well the rest of the movie has been executed that it survives this piece of trite ludicrousness. I think Jackson really lost the plot with this incident, and it's made to stand out even more because the rest of the movie fits together so seamlessly. Peter, you're not good with comic touches, and they're not needed, so please PLEASE stop thinking you need to hammer them in.<br/><br/>However, despite these niggles, the movie is a triumph. Roll on December 18th and The Return Of The King. A worthy 9 out of 10."

","Lord of The Rings is the greatest movie of the 21st century by anyones standards.  The two towers is not a movie it is an integral part of the ""big"" picture.  If you know your Tolkien you'll understand that The Lord of the Rings is one project and, to his eternal credit, Peter Jackson has made a fantastic effort to keep it as such and by Stretching it out over three years keeps the public interest pumped; almost begging for more of the same. This installment has the most mind blowing opening sequence that I have ever seen(perhaps this is exactly how Tolkien saw his life's work?) Peter Jackson deserves not just an Oscar for his genius, but a hell of a lot more recognition from not only his peers but from the academy. a definite  10/10"

","I commented on this film a long time ago; and while I did have a few issues with some discrepancies between the book and the film (especially Faramir), one thing I never expected to be a problem for anyone was Peter Jackson's ending THIS STAGE of his overall 3-PART FILM when he did. Folks, the relationship of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers to the Return of the King is not the same as the relationship between, say, the Raiders of the Lost Ark to the Temple of Doom to Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Tolkien himself only split up his saga of the Lord of the Rings into 3 books because his publisher told him it would never sell as one huge one. Peter Jackson simply split his large work a different 3 ways than Tolkien did, and I don't blame him. This movie is about 3 hours as it is (and I can only imagine the length of the Director's Cut, which by the way I hope they won't wait till November to issue this time). And while they could have cut some of the extraneous Aragorn/Arwen bits, the time they would have saved would never be enough time to do justice to what happens in the final 5 chapters of the book. Also, remember: The Return of the King is shorter by over a hundred pages, in terms of the story, than either of the first two. Peter Jackson is actually distributing the story more evenly than Tolkien did. The only ""unfair"" thing about what he's done, is that now the ""Return"" film will have all the best, scariest, and most awful bits to itself. Oh well. I can't wait for December.<br/><br/>(P.S. By the way, I didn't see anyone complaining when Peter Jackson tacked the first half of the first chapter of the Two Towers onto the end of the Fellowship film.)"

The first one did too (though it works better on DVD), but this one topped it.

I am one of those sad characters that reads the books on a yearly basis and having seen the film once, I need to go back and try to appreciate it in its own right. Being so well versed in the books can be a barrier to appreciating the film since all of my friends were blown away by the film. Most of them had only just read the book in preparation for the film or never read the book at all. The logical side of my brain (not outraged by some of the hefty changes to the story made by Jackson) could appreciate that it was a really powerful film, and I gradually came to see some of the reasons for the changes.

","If you're going to see this movie, please be sure to watch Fellowship of the Ring (or reading the book works too). There is no reminiscence of the first, save for the opening scene that is shown in a different perspective than in Fellowship. The movie cuts right to the action, much like the books, because of the mere fact that its just 1 big, long, continuing story. All 3 of the movies/books could fit hand in hand without interuptions and would still flow smoothly if it was shown all in 1 sitting. The mere title of The Two Towers caused a considerable ammount of commotion, with a lot of people thinking that it had a sort of reference to 9/11. Those are the kind of people who didn't know that the books were written over 50 years ago, still sporting the same title. However, the title stuck and the controversy has quieted down to maybe the avid ranter still complaining about it. If, by chance, you are that person, there's a little thing we people call 'acceptance'. Figure it out.<br/><br/>Acting: 11/10 The acting is still straight on and well depicted. The introduction of an extremely large variety of characters in 1 movie was nicely done, and didn't put a restrain on the film. That pairing of actors with their roles was superb, aside from the character change of Faramir, however, I didn't mind it much and liked the changes. Once again, to any ranter reading this, the word acceptance pops up again. The original cast still holds true to their characters. Bernard Hill did a great performance in this movie as Theoden. I'm surprised he wasn't nominated. Only a few actresses could play Eowyn, and Mirando Otto is one of them, and struck the character right on. Opposite to Eowyn is Eomer, played by Karl Urban. Despite the lack of line's and appearance in the film in comparison to the others, he still played his part well. Faramir, played by David Wenham, had some of the most well spoken lines in the film, and portrayed his role well even though it was changed from the book, but it does make sense, considering he is one of the character's brother from Fellowship. Then we get to Gollum, the tormented creature driven mad by the Ring. Gollum alone crosses over to new boundaries in both acting and computer animation. I could write a whole paragraph on Gollum, but I won't. Andy Serkis deserved Best Actor.<br/><br/>Story: 10/10 The same story as Fellowship of the Ring, seeing as how its all a continuation, but now there's a twist. The Two Towers, which the title is named after meaning the Towers of Orthanc and Barad-dur, have officialy united in Saruman's and Sauron's assault to rule Middle-Earth. The war begins in Rohan, where Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas still pursue the Uruk-Hai who captured Merry and Pippin.<br/><br/>Music: 9/10 While the movie, in a retrospective view of Fellowship, is considerably darker, the music as well ties in with this darker theme, and tends to get darker as the story progresses. There are some moments which the darkness subsides for a while and a little bit of light shines through. When the sad feeling of despare overcomes the screen, the music ties in perfectly. When the battle begins, the music is there and sounds just right. However, it doesn't end with the emotional song Fellowship ended with. Now it ends on a sad, depressing note with Gollum's Song.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 10/10 Once again, the MASSIVE program is put to full use in this. The masses upon masses of Uruk-Hai are all so real, its threatening. The Ents are amazing, however, the occasional twitchy movements of the Ents makes it seem that MASSIVE had a little glitch in it.<br/><br/>Final Score: 40/40<br/><br/>One Word Review: Amazing"

","This is the film adaptation of the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It follows the surviving characters from `The Fellowship of the Ring' as they continue their dangerous quest. The visual style, storyline, cinematography, acting and special effects all combine to create another milestone in filmmaking. I visited New Zealand shortly before the filming started there for the trilogy, and I actually read the novel `The Two Towers' while I was there. I could not help but project the landscapes I saw while I was there into to the book I was reading. Seeing these same landscapes now immortalized in the film version is just amazing. Some of the changes between the film and the book are quite drastic, but they should be accepted as they are two entirely different art forms that sometimes cannot be directly translated. The acting is very good, although there are many actors who have to share the three hour run time, so we only get a brief taste of many of them. The main characters are still engrossing, and the computer generated character `Gollum' is utterly convincing and realistic, almost heartbreaking at times. This film contains some of the most advanced special effects in any film, and part of their appeal is in the way they are used. Instead of blatantly using flashy effects in every scene like other directors, Jackson instead tries to use them discretely. During most of the battle scenes it seems entirely possible that we are witnessing thousands of extras, not computer generated effects, acting out the battle. Although I slightly preferred The Fellowship of the Ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film."

","`The Fellowship of the Ring' was simply remarkable.  And `The Two Towers' was just as great.  These two movies should be what all directors strive for, magnificent.  THE TWO TOWERS does as good of a job as the first one to get the viewer really involved in the story.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole 3 ½ hours approximately it was on.  I haven't read either of the Lord of the Rings books so I can't say if it is better or worse than the novel.  A lot of critics say that the movie left a lot of the book out of it.  That's probably a good thing in a way.  If the viewer read all the books, they're going to know what should happen next in the scene.  I'm sure Peter Jackson knew what he was doing when he left some of the scenes of the book out of the movie.  Why are the critics complaining, the movie is there to entertain you.  It doesn't have to follow the book word for word.  All the TWO TOWERS needs to do is keep your emotions and suspense going for the third installment of the movie.  It's very hard for the audience to like a sequel better than the first one, but Peter Jackson comes extremely close. It's amazing how much special effects and detail is put into these movies. The acting is excellent; I thought Elijah Wood and Sean Astin put in a better performance than in the first one.  They seemed more into their characters in the TWO TOWERS.  I can't wait tell next Christmas for the prequel to come out.  I'm sure there will be even greater and more exciting battles to come.  These movies should be ranked beside the Godfather trilogy in being the greatest films ever made.  I gave this film a 9/10 for greatness.  It better win some Academy awards."

","I went to this movie in anticipation of an intense three hours.  But I made a major miscalculation.  I thought reading the book would make me enjoy the film more.  It did not.  I found myself annoyed by what Jackson did to parts of the plot.  When I saw the first movie, I was emotionally sucked in because I had a space of a year between the reading of the book and the viewing of the film.  This time, I viewed things with an incredibly critical eye.  I didn't like what he did to Aragorn in part of the film, seeing it as unnecessary.  I thought that Arwen was portrayed in an inconsistent, unjust manner.  I remembered what was in the book about the battle scenes at Helm's Deep.  I was immediately annoyed by Jackson's frills and the overly sentimental attachment to the roles certain characters played in the battle. I also did not quite like the way he cuts back and forth between the first half of the book and the second half.  I like that he does, because it is necessary, but some skill is lacking in the methods used and the pacing, causing some parts of the film to drag and take on a dull quality.  I don't like how the end of the battle at Helm's Deep is signified in the film, thinking there was better perspective and handling of it in the book.<br/><br/>I did like the human element.  I loved how Gollum, Merry, and Pippin were turned into stars.  Merry and Pippin were given especially delightful roles. I loved their interaction the the ents.  I loved Gollum's speeches.  I love how the environmental themes Tolkein would have loved brought out were treated.  I loved the simplicity with which Wormtongue's, Theoden's, and Eowyn's starting situation and relationships to each other were treated. I liked the use of monologues by certain characters.  I disliked but found necessary the behind the scenes psychology of the battle of Helm's Deep. Somehow, sentimentality got hold of it too much.  But I greatly admired Jackson's very human treatment of all the characters in that situation, and the way he effectively shows the attitudes of those in peril.  I admired his attempt to socially and psychologically comment on what was going on.  It made a lot of sense even if I didn't find all of it artistically pleasing enough.<br/><br/>I thought some of the great strengths of the film were in the acting, monologues, and highlighting of Merry and Pippin and Gollum.  I loved how Frodo is shown in relationship to Gollum and the shots used to clearly, eeerily, and humanly compare the two.   The clear storytelling focus really worked for me.<br/><br/>And as annoyed as some people are by the ending, I found it well done and a great way to wrap up the movie, make up for flaws, and really make you want to see number three.<br/><br/>A major flaw of this movie is the forced and ineffective music, obviously intended to get you.  But it didn't get me this time.  It was as bad as the watered down root beer I was drinking.  Another annoyance is Gollum's voice. I didn't think it was quite right.<br/><br/>I have a reservation about the title.  ""The Two Towers"" as a title does not hold up well thematically for the film because of the information the viewer is not given.  It is better justified in the book, though still just barely. This has nothing to do with politics, but the fact that I feel it is too incompletely justified in the film and the book itself could have had a better title.  I have to say this, though.  The title gives nothing away.<br/><br/>Overall, by the end, this film is a lot of fun and thought-provoking, despite my reservations.  It was definitely fun for me to think about and discuss with others.  I give Jackson points for pulling off anything having to do with these long novels as well as he did."

","But it's still great. I'd like to see any other director try what Peter Jackson has done and come up with similar results.

Faramir was characterized completely wrong. He was made out to be such a jerk in the film, where in the book he is a much gentler soul. That bothered me.

If I could I'd write and thank Peter Jackson for his genious, and courage to undertake such a project--to take such classic books and recreate them in a whole different media, and to do it with such taste and class.

"jaesboxer","10","0","0","17 March 2003"," Film vs. Book: A Rationalization
","Looking over the IMDB comment board for 'The Lord Of The Rings:  The Two Towers', I see that in general, it is as beloved as the first one.  There is, however, a fairly large group of avid Tolkien fans who feel the removal of the ending to the book would have been unnecessary if Peter Jackson had simply cut out the Aragorn/Arwen scenes.  What I hope to offer here is a rationalization as to why Jackson did what he did, and the perfectly valid justification he had for doing it.  To begin with, despite many crossovers between medias of film and literature, the two rarely mix entirely. Literature is an expression of a writer's views and ideologies on the page, and film is a visual expression of the combined vision of several people. Many books are perfect fodder for adaptations, but few pieces of literature. Imagine someone trying to adapt Joyce's 'Ulysses' to the screen, or Proust's 'Remembrance Of Things Past'.  It simply could not be done.  In most works of great literature, Dostoyevsky, Joyce, Tolstoy, Flaubert etc., the artists express themselves through the writing as a style.  Tolkien, while perhaps not on par with the supreme literary brilliance of the aformentioned authors, is still the father of fantasy, and it is his book that will be remembered as the most popular and, outside of the scholarly world, influential book of the 20th century.  So how do you make it into a movie?  Up until a few years ago, no one believed it could be.  And then Peter Jackson released 'The Fellowship Of The Ring' last year, and everyone, even the most discerning Tolkien neophytes were satisfied.  With this year's installment, 'The Two Towers', Jackson has become more daring, and has taken several liberties with the story line, most notably, excluding the last 5 chapters.  Yet I want to specify something to all the Tolkien addicts who are most enraged by this blatant cut:  word-for-word adaptations rarely ever work.  In adapting a novel to the screen, something is invariably lost if the director does not have the wits to put the film in his vision rather than the author.  If the author wanted to make a film he would have instead of writing a book.  I believe, most strongly, in a dapting a book to the screen, one must take the general emotions the book generates, and do everything possible to bring them to the audience.  In Tolkien, these emotions are invariably a sense of joy and wonder, something he certainly instilled with the first volume.  Yet now, it has been a year, and many people (like me) have seen the fellowship so many times we can recite it line by line.  The wonder is no longer new, and the joy somewhat dimmed by our familiarty with the perils of Middle-earth.  In 'The Two Towers', Jackson takes our familiarty, and enhances upon it, bringing us deeper into the characters and the realm of Tolkien's universe.  It's not the same as the book, but it most certainly works."

","Smash hit sequel to 2001's ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" but is notably more fast-paced and more exciting. Director Peter Jackson restores the wonder and grandeur of Middle-earth, all while staying faithful to the book's narrative (although there is more humor and adds a interesting Eowyn/Aragorn/Arwen love triangle).<br/><br/>Newcomers Brad Dourif (best known for his voice work as Chucky in the ""Child Play"" movies) and Miranda Otto are surprisingly effective in their key roles as Grima Wormtongue and Eowyn, daughter of Theoden the king, although they play second fiddle to Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, and the rest of the stellar cast. Andy Serkis imbues computer-generated Gollum with wit and energy. <br/><br/>The movie does have its flaws. Most of the time is spent on where Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli go, while not spending ample time on Frodo and Sam's and Merry and Pippin's journey. Also, like ""Fellowship"", the movie just... ends.

From the opening scene where Gandalf is tumbling down the cave with the Balrog (amazing) you know you are in for a treat. I just could not stop smiling.<br/><br/>The battles are much bigger and the enemies are more evil, at times attacking one another in a scene near the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The work done on Gollum is just astounding, after about five minutes of trying to work out where the polygons and lines are, you kind of forget altogether that he is computer generated and feel for him as a real person.

","The Star Wars Universe is almost dead to me.  George Lucas has destroyed that world beyond repair now.  Prequels and 'Special Editions' have ruined what was once pure and good.  What hope is there now?  What do we have to fill the void?<br/><br/>Like a light in the darkness came Peter Jackson's inspiring and ambitious attempt to take the greatest piece of historical fiction of all time, and turn it into a trilogy of movies.  Fellowship of the Ring has escalated to one of my favourite movies of all time in the span of a year.  As Two Towers approached, many wondered if it was just a fluke, if Jackson had used up all his fairy dust on the first one.  Then the movie came, and all fears subsided.<br/><br/>Mostly.<br/><br/>I do love these movies, and Fellowship and Two Towers are both outstanding films.  What really got me, though, was that there were some glaring deviances from the books in the second movie.  In Fellowship, any changes that took place, or new scenes, could be explained as if they had happened during the course of their journey but hadn't been written in the books. In Two Towers, they made huge detours and character changes.  There were several differences that, for some reason, really bothered me.  Luckily these aren't the majority.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I'll just touch on the changes that bothered me most.  What happened to Faramir?  Why had his personality and 'quality' changed so much from the books?  The changes made in the films put the ring in IMPOSSIBLE peril, from which the hobbits should not have escaped.  Maybe it makes for a more exciting sequence, but it doesn't make sense based on previously established facts about the enemy or the ring.<br/><br/>Other things that bothered me:  Wouldn't Merry or Pippin have referred to Gandalf by name before he 'remembers' it later?  If there are 2000 Rohirrim, why do you only see about 50 when the party first encounters them?  What did Treebeard THINK Sauruman was burning over there in Isengard?  I won't mention anything else at risk of giving away too much.<br/><br/>The rest of the film more than makes up for these differences.  The excellent battle at Helms Deep, the Golden Hall at Edoras, Wormtongue, and the Dead Marshes are all elements that show why this movie belongs next to its excellent predecessor.<br/><br/>This movie is far and away better than most of the fare out there.  A worthy addition to an excellent series."

I think the beginning was very clever. I am glad PJ didn't do another ""recap"" of FOTR. Gandalf was the man in this movie (more like the wizard)! I was surprised when Aragorn fell off the cliff, because I am pretty sure that that didn't happen in the book. BUT--I loved the part when he opened the doors to Helm's Deep in slow-motion, and when Legolas said, ""You're late. You look terrible!"" Treebeard was done well, except his eyes looked quite fake.

"Pavel-8","10","0","0","11 March 2003"," Best film of 2002.
","**Warning!  Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>There are a handful of issues I have with this movie.  I thought the cross-cutting between stories was disjointing due to the vastly different paces of each tale.  I noticed a few blatant blue screen shots.  Some of the dialogue seemed out of place, almost hokey.  And on top of all of that, the film suffered from being the middle one in a trilogy, a film that by definition did not contain a true start or finish.<br/><br/>Having said all of that, I still choose it as my best film of 2002 for this reason.  After I saw ""Chicago,""  I sneaked across the theater hall to catch the last half hour of ""Two Towers"" again.  Not even close.  I thoroughly enjoyed ""Chicago"" (#2 or #3 of 2002), but ""Two Towers"" was simply on another level.  It completely swept me away into Middle Earth as I relished the final battle for Helm's Deep.  Gandalf and company streaking down the hill into the enemy was one of the best movie moments of the year.  The emotion seemed quite real, and even the slight melodrama didn't bother me at all.<br/><br/>
Other highlights...the opening sequence of Gandalf and the Balrog was excellent, yanking the audience back into the story as though they never left.  All the battle scenes were not only epic, but cohesive.  Some directors just don't seem to know how to put a fluid and continuous battle together (see ""Gladiator"").  But these (Helm's Deep primarily) were fantastic, ranking among the best ever on film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: The best movies pull you into their world, make you feel their emotions, and relate to their characters.  ""Two Towers"" did all that and more, which is quite remarkable given the adventurous and fantastical nature of the film."
"Sam_Mendes_Fan","3","0","0","9 March 2003"," Overrated...
","I loved the Fellowship of the Ring and was greatly anticipating this film. This film however did not have nearly the same wow effect as the first movie. Effects in this movie are defenitly top notch and it makes the movie worth seeing just for the huge scale of the battles but other than that I thought this movie had far less substance. The best part of the movie is Golem, he is spectacular and who can't love him? Unfortunately he was the only character in this movie I found myself caring about. About all you get from Gimliy and Legalos are a BOMBARDMENT of simply awful jokes. Going alongside the wall at helms deep WAS humorous when you come by Gimliy not being able to see over the wall, yet like all the good humor in this movie they immediately destroy the joke by over doing it, ""Shall I fetch you a box."" No thanks Mr. Elf I would prefer a mute button. Going back to Gimliy again, I found it very annoying that Treebeard's voice was done by the same actor, this however wont bother most of you... hopefully. The battles for the most part are epic and truelly spectacular, yet they throw in many scenes that make me cringe and want to look away, also in this movie I had trouble believing in ""the reality of the movie"". Examples include... - Legolas was taking out the Orcs and there ride (large beast creatures) with one arrow a piece... they were moving... really fast, This I am fine with but when he get's off two shots at the Orc with the torch resembling a character from The Road Warrior and doesn't put him down... something is wrong. This is also the same character that said when the Orcs were a rather far distance from Helmsdeep to aim for there Necks and Underarms. This brings me to my next and biggest complaint with our elf friend. - Legalos told them to shoot at the Necks etc. because that is where there armor is the weakest. Well there armor does absolutely nothing against shields tossed with feet. The scene that I am talking about where Legolas slides down the stairs is so awfull I don't want to see the movie again if I have to watch that. I was fine with all of legolas' other little tricks but this is completely stupid. It truelly takes away a lot of the serious atmosphere this battle had and turned it into trash. These people are defending there families and I can't take that seriously when I have elf man sliding away. - The central Characters are far to powerfull in this movie. When Aragorn and Gimliy can cover the bridge swarming with orcs by themselves something 30 some people couldn't do it's hard to accept -When the men who capture Frodo and Sam kill the back half of that large army of men, why did the front half completely ignore what was going on? -And finally... there is no was I can believe that not a single person wasn't able to spot either Sam or Frodo when they were at the Gates of Mordor. There little cloaks were not enough to have shielded them from sight and sound with how much running around they did around there.<br/><br/>I suggest when you see this movie you simply accept all of its oddness and not ""nitpick"" like me. I do think the movie is GOOD but it is far from great and IMHO not worthy of a Best Picture nomination."

"voodoo4936","7","0","0","8 March 2003"," Not bad, but not great
","Thank heavens for Peter Jackson. The out-of-the-blue Aussie auteur, previously best known for the 1996 Michael J. Fox bomb The Frighteners, has managed to deliver where so many others have failed, or feared to even attempt. He has successfully translated J.R.R. Tolkien's massive Lord of the Rings trilogy to the big screen with maximum verve and minimal crap. Last year's Fellowship of the Ring scored a bulls-eye with moviegoers and critics alike, and there was an audible sigh of relief among hardcore LOTR fanatics when the long-awaited film was finally released to smashing success.<br/><br/>So, where does Mr. Jackson go from there? He took a gamble in filming all three of the LOTR movies one after the other - what if Fellowship tanked? The whole franchise would have been up the creek. Thankfully, that fear was soon vanquished, but now Jackson has yet another roadblock to overcome: expectation. Hype. Buzz. Fellowship set the standard for Jackson and his crew - now all they can do is surpass it. That's a lot of pressure. I mean, a LOT of pressure. Thus, The Two Towers is arguably the most important film in the trilogy, simply because it has to live up to the expectations of millions of LOTR fans, AND the general movie going public, AND the critics, AND the studios that pay for the whole shebang. I'm amazed that Jackson hasn't had a stroke by now, or at least one mother of an ulcer.<br/><br/>
So when all is said and done, does The Two Towers deliver? Yes. Is it as good as Fellowship? No. Does it still kick ass? For the most part, yes. It's just not very graceful doing it.<br/><br/>Simply put, The Two Towers is an exhausting movie. By the end, I felt like I'd been through a war zone. The film is just SO LONG, and there is SO MUCH GOING ON, from epic battles to flowery speeches to zombified swamps to talking trees....the first word that came to mind when I left the theater was ""overstuffed"". I feel like I'm beating on a dead horse, though - these movies are complete adaptations of the novels, and as such, there's going to be a whole lot of stuff packed into 3 hours. But even so, those 3 hours don't have to feel like 6. I can see where Jackson and company could have trimmed a bit here, shuffled a bit there, moved around a few parts here, just to make the narrative flow more freely. TTT's plot is heaps more complex than Fellowship's, and the best way to deal with that is to tell the story in the simplest, most direct way possible. But Jackson jumps back and forth between plot lines like Quentin Tarantino on speed, and it just doesn't work. This may be Jackson's way of keeping us from getting bored, but it's ultimately distracting and unnecessary. Yes, there are a lot of plot threads to juggle - from Frodo and Sam's descent into hell, to Aragorn's crew trying to rescue Merry and Pippin, to Merry and Pippin themselves just trying to stay alive, and more subplots than you can shake a wizard's staff at - but they should be juggled, not thrown into the air and allowed to crash back to Earth. The plot itself is average at best, and when coupled with the smothering story structure, makes for a rather underwhelming experience.<br/><br/>Fortunately, there is still plenty of good here, and a whole lot of great. The performances are once again top-notch, save for some flat dialogue and a few stilted scenes. The characters still feel the need to turn every sentence into a poetic work of art, Arwen still needs a shot of caffeine, and Frodo and Sam still need to get a room already, but otherwise the acting is very good. The gorgeous scenery and cinematography are back in full force, and it's likely the best eye candy you'll taste all year. The world of Middle-Earth just comes alive on screen - it's like you're RIGHT THERE. I don't know about you, but I'm booking myself a vacation to New Zealand ASAP.<br/><br/>
But where TTT really shines is, yes, the butt kicking. The battle scenes are simply breathtaking (and cringe-inducing at some points - dammit, that sword just came right at my face!), and the final showdown at Helm's Deep is just unbelievable. There's so much buildup, and such palpable tension, that when the battle finally occurs it feels like you're going to war right alongside Aragorn and the Elves. There are so many fighters on screen, so much attention to detail, so much pure EXCITEMENT that I simply couldn't take my eyes off the spectacle, not even for a second (or a much-needed bathroom break). Oh, and Gandalf is alive. But you probably already knew that.<br/><br/>
There are certain things that work in The Two Towers, and there are things that don't. Unfortunately, the good doesn't outweigh the bad, so TTT manages to find a fairly neutral middle ground. Will The Two Towers disappoint LOTR fans? Probably not. Will it disappoint everyone else? It's hard to say. But one thing is for sure: TTT is an experience you won't forget. Just try to ignore the rampant Hobbit homoeroticism, and you'll have a blast.<br/><br/>

They were always going to be difficult, but I found their deevelopment as characters superficial and the storyline fluctuated between being true to Tolkein and expediency.<br/><br/>I will see this film again and again because I really do like it, but I suspect many attracted to the story by the fellowship will be put off by this attempt at developing the story. <br/><br/>And as for Legolas skateboarding down the stairs on shield - it just isn't needed."

","There are not enough words to describe how wonderful, imaginative, powerful, impressive, spectacular and great this film is. And believe me, this are the words from someone who has a very open mind about films. Very few films have managed to come across with such power on the screen. <br/><br/>The first film was a great achievement, and by the time I saw it I just could not believe how it could be surpassed. But it did, it really did. Maybe not on an emotional level, because by necessity, this film can't stand alone. It's only the middle chapter, it doesn't have a real beggining or a real ending. But surprisingly, it does enough with it's characters to care about the story.<br/><br/>I will not get into describing the story, because you all know what it is about. What I do want to describe it's how well it's the story told and how well the film is done. This film is certainly much darker than it's predecessor, and more violent, too. And there is also an interesting thing about it: it doesn't exactly feels like a fantasy film, precisely because it looks so real, and partly because most of the story centers in the country of Rohan, the world of men. There are not a lot of ""fantastic"" places here. But that does not harm the film, because in a way, it makes the film feel more like one of those great epics such as Braveheart.<br/><br/>The visual effects are the most impressive ones I have ever seen. At least for the last hour of the film (which centers on the now famous Helm's Deep battle scene), there are some images that I never even imagined in my dreams. There are, some really wonderful and AWE-inspiring shots that look....amazing. And...of course, there's Gollum, the most believable CGI creature I have ever seen (and a compelling character, too).<br/><br/>What I loved about 'The Two Towers', is that it's the kind of film you don't see very often. It's one of those very very few films that leave you thinking about it for a LONG time. It's great on every aspect. It's the kind of film where you'd have to write a big review for how well the story is told, how amazing the direction is, how good the acting is, how impressive the visual effects are, how dark, dramatic, violent, heroic and inspiring it is, and...how lovable it is.<br/><br/>10 / 10."

If you thought 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was the best movie you'd ever seen, you're about to change your mind! <br/><br/>As the second installment of both the books and the movies, 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is an incredible cinematic achievement. It follows the journey of the Ring-bearer, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), and his companion, Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin). They are on their way to Mordor, the only place where the one Ring can be destroyed. The ring has proceeded to take over Frodo's mind, and he is always feeling it getting heavier and wanting to slip it on.<br/><br/>As Aragorn/Strider, a ranger, Viggo Mortensen gives an amazing performance definitely deserving of an Academy Award. He, Legolas Greenleef (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli son of Gloin (John Rhys-Davies) are on a path to find two young hobbits, Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan), who have been captured by orcs.<br/><br/>For those of you who have wanted to see a girl have at least a marginal amount of combat skills in a Lord of the Rings movie, your wish has come true.

","I was greatly disappointed with this movie. It is my evaluation that it unlike movie nr-1, deviates to much from the original story. It seemes to me that the director have altered this second part, focusing on action parts, instead of following the original story. The battle at Helms deep may be incredible, but it is taking to much time of the story. Some of the new charecters (like Faramir), acts different then in the book, when he kidnaps Frodo and Sam, taking them into battle. Finally it disappointed me that we dont get to the end of the book when the film stops.<br/><br/>Its a relatively good film, but still not near as good as ""Fellowship of the ring""."

","Still a masterpiece. Though RotK will probably end up being my favorite. This movie just screams epic.<br/><br/>I guess I didn't like it as much as FotR because it was missing some quiet scenes that FotR had. Some breaks in the pacing in order to give a rest to the characters and viewer. But then again, the pacing of breaking the story up into three parts really helped the narrarative and gave more consistent flow to the movie that was missing in FotR and made it seem a tad long.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, it may be criticised for being long...but what great masterpiece isn't long? The more time you have, the more stuff you can fit in, and if the stuff you're fitting in is good...there's no problemo. Heck, Godfather, Shawshank Redemption and other top 10 IMDB movies are as long if not LONGER then FotR and TTT. I really just don't get complaints about length, because what it's really all about is consitency in the pacing. TTT went by FAST for me, while some movies like say Little Buddah are just 2 hours...yet that felt like an eternity.<br/><br/>Anyways, enough of my ranting. Great movie. Won't win best picture this year though (Chicago has the oscars wrapped up, don't ask me why, I'll never know). Though, RotK will most definitely win next year, as if to honor the series as a whole, and it'd definitly deserve it."
"johnhood","Null","0","0","1 March 2003"," Sauron's shadow
","The diluted darkness of the Star Wars prequels is eclipsed by Sauron's shadow in The Two Towers!<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson reprises the narrative cue of Irvin Kershner (The Empire Strikes Back) and, forsaking any introduction, embarks on a deeper, introspective and urgent deconstruction of the psychology that underpins the now fragmented fellowship; the Ring's seduction of Frodo, the tragedy of Gollum (a true synthespian) and the heroics of Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen a revelation), Gimli and Legolas.<br/><br/>Visually. Rivendell's redolent beauty is replaced by nightfall, ruin and decay. The Elves, in their haste to elude Sauron, accelerated the corruption of the landscape. This aesthetic is maintained throughout most of the film and recapitulates the theme of darkness falling, but light is not entirely driven into shadow.<br/><br/>The battle at Helm's Deep delivers in ways that no Clone War could ever emulate - an epic confrontation from a very human perspective.<br/><br/>In between the moments of dark reflection there are those that are life-affirming. None has more poignancy than that of Gandalf?s return.<br/><br/>If there is a fly in the ointment it is the Balrog! This ?mythical? beast appears to have escaped from a console game and should have evoked memories of the T-Rex attack from Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Despite my serious reservations surrounding this project. Peter Jackson has surprised and delighted with both Fellowship and Towers. Will it be three times the charm or will the trials of the trilogy be insurmountable even for this master of the ring?"

","I have mixed feelings for LOTR: The Two Towers. I loved FOTR. LOVED it. Sure, there were some differences from Tolkien's story here and there that I thought could have been avoided, the most obvious being Arwen at the Ford, but they didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. Two Towers is a different story. I know that this is just one man's interpretation of Tolkien's work, and that there will never be a movie version of a book that adheres completely to the book, but some of the changes Peter Jackson made here are too much in my opinion. Without a doubt, the most upsetting to me were the changes to the Frodo/Sam/Faramir arc of the story, especially the butchering of Faramir's character. Gone is the noble warrior I know and love from the book. He's replaced with, basically, a second coming of his brother Boromir. Whatever happened to the Faramir that said, ""I would not take this thing {the Ring}, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas Tirith falling in ruin and I alone could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark Lord for her good and glory.""? Jackson's Faramir is a complete contradiction of Tolkien's Faramir. I can only hope that the true Faramir is shown in Return of the King.<br/><br/>Another disappointment is the handling of Gimli's character. I have nothing against comic relief--I think comic relief is actually necessary in a movie as dark and tense as this one--but Peter Jackson pushed it a little far. Gimli was supposed to be a fierce warrior to be taken seriously, not a barrel of laughs.<br/><br/>Now that the bad stuff's out of the way, there were some things that I loved about TTT. First of all, Gollum. Brilliantly done! The CGI was excellent. Andy Serkis did a marvelous job with his voice and movements. I loved his back-and-forth conversations with himself as well. And the fish-and-chips scene was priceless! I was so glad that they included that.<br/><br/>Helm's Deep was magnificent. Not as close to the book as it could have been, but this is one place where it didn't bother me as much. I actually think that having Elves at Helm's Deep was one of the better changes Jackson made. And one of the best scenes in the movie was Gandalf's charge down the mountain towards the Uruk-hai, the Rohirrim riding behind. The music especially makes this an incredible scene, one that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.<br/><br/>Wormtongue was another highlight of the movie. I thought he was played to perfection by Brad Dourif, just creepy and sinister enough. The scene between him and Eowyn made my skin crawl.<br/><br/>The Storming of Isengard was outstanding. I didn't like the way the Ents had to be tricked into going to war, but the Storming helps to make up for it. Brilliantly done, and the look on Saruman's face was just priceless.<br/><br/>
Overall, this was not as good as FOTR, but still a good movie. There were some changes from Tolkien's story that were definite disappointments, but TTT still has enough good stuff to be worth multiple viewings. I give it 7 and a half out of 10."

","I took my mom, my cousins and a friend to see this for Christmas, and we were very pleased. Yes, it strayed somewhat from the book, but the book would have been difficult to capture any closer without ruining it.<br/><br/>
The two biggest differences are where the movie ends as opposed to the novel, and the subplot with Arwen. These were needed to make a better movie (and to further explain the events in the upcoming Return of the King)and are not very significant if you take these into consideration.

Not great, but just right to set the mood. The special affects are excellent, capturing the wonder and terror. Also, the writting is great, and there are numerous quotes that will go down in history.

More things were changed in The Two Towers than in Fellowship of the Ring, but still a great job by Peter Jackson. Though a lot of people criticize the appearance of the Elves at Helms Deep, I highly compliment it, and think that it was really cool. Helms Deep! I almost finished this review without talking about it. This, folks, may well be the greatest battle put up on the big screen. One of the many great things about it is that it is not constant action. It switches back and forth to other scenes, so you're not constantly in the massive battle, which I like. But there certainly is plenty of the battle that you can digest. (Notice Peter Jackson's cameo in Helms Deep as he throws a spear.) The main problem with this movie is that they wasted too much time with added scenes. The sequel to this movie, the Return of the King, must be at least 3:45. The Two Towers just didn't have quite enough of the real book in it, but it was still really great. And Gollum! The best CGI character put on screen. The scene in the night where Smeagol and Gollum are talking to each other is one of the best scenes in movie history.

"oldreekie546","Null","0","0","25 February 2003"," A class act thunders on
","Director Peter Jackson wastes no time with prologues or resume's in this breathless, no nonsense mid-point to his ground breaking trilogy. Apart from a brief reprise of Gandalf's fate to deliver a rousing opening, its straight on from where the original story left off as the Fellowship, now divided into three clear factions, pursue their individual fates.<br/><br/>In being denied both a begining an an end, the film  is inevitably more episodic than its predecessor and the story is less clearly defined and progressive. Indeed one of the film's few real flaws is that after three exhausting hours of spectacle the story has not really moved on in any meaningful way. Jackson compensates for this by delivering a full-blooded action adventure, more grounded in genuine fantasy than 'Fellowship' with no compromises made on the more fantastic elements of Tolkien's imagination, such as the tree-like Ents, which might have been by-passed by a less confident director. If the action and special effects are more to the forefront in this effort than the characterisation of 'Fellowship', it is a consequence of the plot and Jackson's need for some rather brutal editing to stick within three hours. It will be interesting to see if his special edition DVD restores some of the character balance lost here. For all that, the actors continue to get plenty of opportunity to show their worth, particularly Sean Astin and Viggo Mortensen, whose heroic, leading man status is cemented here. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee are dissappointingly underused this time around and even Elizah Wood becomes more marginalised (again a reflection of the book).<br/><br/>Inevitably, the real star here is Jackson himself; ceaselessly inventive, bold, uncompromising, relishing the detail and sheer mad imagination of Tolkien's text, he delivers an exhilerating spectacle. What next for the Kiwi Hobbit?"

"Danimal-7","Null","0","0","25 February 2003"," How could anyone think this one was better than the first? (Spoilers, but nothing not already revealed in the trailers)
","Don't get me wrong, I think THE TWO TOWERS is a good movie.  I suppose, if you're tolerant, you might even call it as good as THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING.  But how could Time magazine run a cover calling it *better* than its predecessor?  Its strengths are the same strengths as the first movie's. Its weaknesses, on the other hand, are pretty well its own.<br/><br/>Let's review those strengths.  Strong, charismatic performance by Ian McKellen as Gandalf?  Check.  Grand, sweeping vistas of the Middle Earth terrain?  Check.  Epic, savage battle scenes?  Check.  Dark, brooding cinematography?  Check.  Danger and the theme of struggle within oneself against the temptations of power?  Check.  Yep, we have a good movie here; it would take a lot of incompetence to ruin all those elements.<br/><br/>But by gosh, sometimes it looks like Jackson tried.  Despite sacrificing much more of the story than the first one did, this movie covers less ground; given more than a chapter's head start, it fails to make it anywhere near the final chapter.<br/><br/>I find it amazing that so many people focus on what was done to Faramir's character, when far worse was done elsewhere.  In fact, I liked what Jackson did to Faramir's character.  Tolkien's Faramir is insufferable; give me Samwise's honest humility any day over Faramir's how-noble-were-my-ancestors-before-they-bred-with-lesser-men posturing.  I like the fact that Jackson's Faramir feels the same temptation as his brother, but unlike Boromir, he is able to overcome it.  Gimli is the one who's been really let down, being completely reduced to a laughingstock. There were a few laughs at his expense in the first movie, but he was also clearly a warrior and a hero.  Now he's been made into a useless encumbrance for the sake of comic relief.<br/><br/>Both TFOTR and TTT make significant changes from the book.  But in the first movie these were well-considered changes, omitting the inessentials and in some cases improving considerably on the book.  For one instance, Jackson's Boromir is a much more sympathetic tragic hero than the boor that Tolkien gave us; for another, Jackson's choice to have Aragorn deliberately part from Frodo, afraid that his love for Gondor would tempt him to steal the Ring, is far more dramatic than the fiat of fate Tolkien used. <br/><br/>
In TTT, the changes are not nearly so well thought out.  Consider the decision to have Theoden be directly possessed by Saruman.  Okay, that could have worked.  But Jackson overlooks the fact that this possession makes Grima the Wormtongue totally superfluous.  Grima's only job, influencing the King, is no longer necessary, and his presence in the court puts Saruman's plans at risk of discovery.  Either Grima should have been edited out completely, or the possession business should have been canned.  Also, since Jackson retains the scene where Grima is expelled, he should also have retained Tolkien's far superior version of it, where Grima is given a chance to redeem himself and throws it away.<br/><br/>In the first movie, Arwen sensibly appears only when she is relevant to the action.  Her love scenes with Aragorn are well woven into the course of the story.  Here, while her scenes are quite well done in themselves, they are sometimes intrusive, and in several cases it is obvious that they should have been saved for the third movie.  Arwen's return to a desolate Lothlorien is one of the most tragic, heart-rending scenes Tolkien ever wrote, a perfect conclusion to the story of the Third Age.  To anticlimactically stick this scene into the middle of the second book is unforgivable.<br/><br/>Finally, I object to the Ents being reduced to incompetents who don't even notice what Saruman is doing to their trees until a Hobbit shoves it under their noses.<br/><br/>The only possible claim TTT has to superiority over the TFOTR is Andy Serkis' Gollum.  I was terrified of getting another Jar-Jar Binks; instead Gollum is one of the best CGI characters I've ever seen, very Hobbit-like while still being beastish.  Serkis makes Gollum menacing and pitiable at the same time.  He is probably the truest character to Tolkien's vision in either of the two movies.<br/><br/>So, take THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, slow it down, remove Sean Bean and Ian Holm, two of the best actors in it, greatly reduce Ian McKellen's role, and replace the well-judged changes from Tolkien's story with modifications that appear to have been thought up at the last minute.  You now have THE TWO TOWERS.  Is it good?  Yes.  Is it an improvement?  No.<br/><br/>Rating: **Â½ out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation:  See it in the theater, but don't set your expectations too high."

There are virtually no flaws, and to point out what tiny ones exist would come off as churlish, so I simply won't bother. The acting is uniformly solid, and that's no small praise considering there are well over a DOZEN major characters here.

","In FOTR, Jackson made all the right changes to successfully bring a complex story to the screen. In TTT, he made all the wrong changes. There are endless trivial scenes (e.g. oliphants) which do practically nothing for the plot, while major plot elements were missing. The resulting film is full of consistency errors and plot holes, so much that it utterly fails to hold together. It's like watching the video to the sound track of TTT -- lots of action, lots of cool scenery, lots of music, but no discernable plot.<br/><br/>It's also LOOOONG. That wouldn't be such a problem -- who didn't expect it to be long? -- except that it's not the plot of TTT that makes the film long. The film is long because of all the boring stuff that was added while the plot was tossed in the trash. Romance scenes go on, and on, and on, and on, and on. An added warg scene is so contrived it bored me to tears -- the danger is so utterly mismatched to the character that it is impossible to take it seriously.<br/><br/>In exchange for all this added pap, the Ents are glossed over to the point of being utterly unbelievable -- they come off as a pat, contrived resolution to the threat of Isengard that FOTR spent so much time establishing.<br/><br/>In all, it's a film of painstaking detail, stunning visual effects, and a script that completely fails -- in other words a typical Hollywood film. It's particularly disappointing after FOTR, which demonstrated very well that you can, in fact, produce a movie with a plot and still make money."

","Excited wasn't the word for this. I was giddy as a school girl (so to speak) and was looking forward to a cinematic treat. And I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>Firstly I have to say a big thanks to new line for not giving us too many spoilers. I know us fans know what happens (hey, we can read!) but we don't know how it happens (if you follow me). For example, we had tantalising glimpses of Gollum in FOTR. But he was kept carefully under wraps. And for that, new line, I salute you. In the week leading up to the original MIB I had seen trailer upon trailer, music videos, making of's and every interview and clip you can think of. I had, essentially, seen every moment of that film. So the impact had been lost and my enjoyment dulled. Not so The Two Towers.<br/><br/>As I went in blind, everything blew me away. Sure, the adverts gave us a few minutes of Helms Deep and a Bit of Eowyn here and there, but nothing major. Everything came to me fresh and kicked a lot of ass. Amazingly enough, the thrill was still there even on my second and third viewings. High praise indeed.<br/><br/>With a few viewings it becomes obvious that PJ has captured the essence of the second book, while skilfully leaving out the things he could get away with. For example, the meeting of the Ents and all their songs are, quite frankly, dull and we are well rid of them. The pacing is superb. It never seems to drag and every scene is welcome. It was a hard job following the superb Fellowship but PJ has done us proud.<br/><br/>Helms Deep, the centre piece of the film, is just enthralling. From the tear jerking scenes of young boys getting tooled up for war to the rousing sight of Gandalf leading the charge, we are assaulted by a bombastic mix of sound and sights. I can safely say, without hyperbole, that it is simply one of the most phenomenal scenes in cinematic history.  <br/><br/>A review of Two Towers wouldn't be complete without a mention of the Gollum. The character is just brilliant. Retaining all the pitiable characteristics of the book. The inner conflict scene had me close to tears!<br/><br/>The standard has now been set. The bar has been raised. Fellowship and The Two Towers stand head and shoulders above almost any film I have seen. The quality of them is awe inspiring. My problem now is waiting for the extended DVD. And Return of the King. <br/><br/>And how hard is Legolas? He is just a killing machine!"
"rrichr","Null","0","0","19 February 2003"," It has come to this...
","Even today, as a writer, having been through J.R.R. Tolkien's Ring Trilogy twice, once for the journey and the second time somewhat more analytically, I can barely comprehend how Tolkien did it; how he managed to fashion a world of such minute detail, and with scope that was at once physical, temporal and emotional. Is the Trilogy literature? Maybe not by strict definition; its concern is not so much with ideas as with pure language, English specifically, and what can be done with this amazing tool. The tale itself seems, at times, to exist only as a hanger for Tolkien's aesthetic experiments with the evocative aspect of language, how words sound, and how that quality can be made to resonate in the mind of the tuned-in reader: Galadriel, Celeborn, Umbar, Forlindon, Dimrill Dale, Withywindle, Rivendell, Mordor; words that often sound more like wind chimes or gonging bells than words, all strung together with equally melodious text.<br/><br/>When I learned that Tolkien was coming seriously to the big screen, I was stoked, although memories of David Lynch's adaptation of Frank Herbert's similarly monumental novel, Dune, had me a bit worried. One feature-length film, despite the great beauty of many of its elements, had not been enough to properly set up and display Dune's particular richness of detail and the movie tended to stumble about trying to hit a sufficient number of the book's high spots (though I still love the sequence in which House Atreides departs Caladan for Arrakis; the stately embarkation into the Guild Heighliners). It was a film that could only really work for those who had read and loved the novel. But Tolkien was to be served up in three (count 'em!) parts. Having seen the first two of the three, I have not been disappointed.<br/><br/>When the first installment bypassed Tom Bombadil and the Barrow Downs, the choices Peter Jackson had been forced to make were obvious. I'm sure they weren't always easy ones. Many of the Trilogy's more subtle elements had to be bypassed. For example, the book's spooky view of the Black Rider on the Buckleberry Ferry stage, seen by lantern light from across the river as the Hobbits flee the Shire - a favorite interlude of mine - was really more effective and evocative than the film's narrow escape of screeching hooves. But the gorgeous pursuit of Arwen and Frodo from Weathertop by the Ringwraiths, with its breathtaking overhead cut to the full-gallop chase, put everything back in balance. The Fellowship of The Rings was so good that it may not have been necessary to have read the Trilogy first. But in the case of The Two Towers, reading first is highly recommended. This done, the second film which must, to some degree, only imply its particular book, will play all the more richly.<br/><br/>In the Two Towers, both in print and on screen, the story's U-shaped arc reaches its low-point before starting its climb to the end. It is the Trilogy's most challenging phase, for both reader and viewer. There was no way that the contemporary narrative cinema, with its rather rigid constraints, could have rendered it faithfully. Peter Jackson, a director of great skill and intelligence, obviously knew this as well. He taketh away but he also giveth back: eye-candy scenery, an FX for the ages in Gollum (underpinned by actor Andy Serkis' excellent performance; he blue-suited the part in real time to optimize the digital Gollum's relationships with the living actors), great Ents, and action that makes the clashes in Braveheart seem like square dances. The battle at Helm's Deep is riveting. Staged in the rain, like Kurosawa's climatic battle in the Seven Samurai, you can almost forget to breathe as the sequence unfolds.<br/><br/>To bring a written work like the Ring Trilogy to the screen; one with which readers had already formed deep connections, took guts, not to mention great movie-making skill. Because Tolkien's characters are so vividly drawn, great sensitivity and precision in casting was also required. In that light, all main characters are spot-on, often exactly as I envisioned them in the books. Frodo is just a bit too pretty, yet still authentically portrayed by Elijah Woods, who fans out the full deck of Frodo's emotions, from grit through fright, with great clarity. But with Frodo accompanied by Sean Astin's letter-perfect Sam Gamgee, all remains well. The memory of Ian Holm's equally-perfect Bilbo makes it even better. Karl Urban's coiled, wild-eyed Julius Caesar was my favorite recurring character in the Xena: Warrior Princess TV series and I enjoyed seeing him in the Two Towers as the equally-coiled Eomer. Cate Blanchett was probably born to play Galadriel but the real, possibly unexpected, thermonuclear casting-event was Craig Parker's elf-captain Haldir. A little make up and some blonde tresses morphed the pleasant-looking Parker into a presence of  mythic nobility, as opposed to Orlando Bloom's more intense, wolf-like Legolas. Much of the innate beauty that infuses the entire Trilogy is compressed into Parker's character and I'm not alone here. Haldir websites are sprouting like mushrooms in Fangorn Forest as we speak.<br/><br/>It's hard to say anything bad about a production into which so much intelligence, sensitivity, courage, and labor has been poured. What would be the point? There's plenty of cotton candy out there to pull apart. Any film should be judged first in terms of its respective genre. Very few films are truly great across the entire spectrum. At this point, Lord of The Rings is a magnificent achievement, magically pulling together so much of what the cinema can be at this stage in its evolution. The Two Towers is a discrete film but also a necessary and difficult chapter of a larger work. Not all films will be Tolkienesque fantasies. But when such films are made, Lord of The Rings will be the absolute benchmark."

","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the standard of epic excellence established by last year's The Fellowship of the Ring. Not only is the acting noteworthy, but the cinematography and special effects make Star Wars pale in comparison. Peter Jackson is obviously a detail junkie. The musical score is grand and most satisfying to hear. The depiction of the Battle of Helms Deep defies explanation. After seeing The Fellowship, I wondered if it was possible to improve on the special effects seen there. Well, it was and is possible -- much to my surprise and delight.

","People can whine all they want that the movie ""The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers"" isnt the book ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"". It isnt, the adaptation may not be perfect, but this is a movie based on the book, not a movie that is a book. In other words, it isnt perfect in that regards, but what film is? Jurassic Park? Jaws? None are pefect. But you also have to look at the fact that part of the book the Two Towers, was included in teh end of the movie Fellowship, so could parts of the book Two Towers be in Return of the King? Possibly, but onto the movie. From Gandalf's battle with the balroc, to the battle of Helm's Deep, this movie as action, action, action. Mix that with an engrossing storyline, interesting characters, and a love for teh Lord of teh Rings, you have a near flawless film. Look at the special effects, they are so good you dont even think about them as being special effects. Rather than using staight up green screen and CGI as in Episode II, LOTR:TTT flawless mixes computer graphics, the most detailed models ever created for film, and great acting. Peter Jackson and co. used a method like the one in T2. Do it in real life it looks real and good enough, if not use puppet, animatronic, and models, if those dont work well enough, then revert to CG. And it shows, not only in the special effects, but in the gerneral care taken to make this film as fun and interesting for both LOTR freaks, and common moviegoers alike. Shame on the Academy for snubbing this film from some Oscars it deserves to win. Like make-up, the best of the year, they dont even get a nomination. Or how about Peter Jackson as Best Director? No dought they will probally give the Best Picture Award to some film like ""Chicago"", rather then the classy and undeniably breathtaking ""Two Towers"". But as for the film, I highly recommend it and give it 5 Stars. ***** out of *****. The Best Picture of the Year. Bring on ""Return of the King""!"

","I do not agree with the first comment posted on this site; I think that this movie was brilliant. I have read all of Tolkiens books many times, and I can say that Peter Jackson sticks amazingly to the story (ESPECIALLY when compared to other movies based on books) having READ THE BOOKS HIMSELF, not to mention having the help of Ian McKellen. Plus, if all of the book had been put in this movie, it would be several hours longer, those of you who complained. Hmmm... maybe Jackson's going to add those into the 3rd movie, seeing as the 3rd book is the shortest (um, duuuuuh?)! The movie was exciting, beautiful, and brilliantly done.Sexy Elijah Wood gives another splendid performance, and no, the fact that he's sexy and a god is certainly not the reason I give this movie such support.

","I feel compelled to comment on Peter Jackson's LOTR series now that we have seen 2 of 3 parts of the book. As a movie scholar and a 14-time reader of the trilogy, I hope not to have the biases exhibited by too many reviewers. The two movies so far have been as an impressive an effort in film as virtually any movie ever made. The scale of production, special effects, and ensemble acting are simply beyond the scale of any movie production in history. That does not mean that FOTR and TTT are the best movies ever made; they are both outstanding but not flawless. However, no one has (or probably ever will) attempted as enormous a task as making three movies at one time and achieving the incredible results we have seen. These movies have been almost universally loved by both audiences and critics. The only naysayers are the Tolkien nutcases who cannot take a microscopic deviation from the Trilogy. They seem to forget that books and movies are not the same art form. Upon viewing TTT for the first time, I sat there and examined the movie in detail trying to identify flaws and discrepancies from the book. My initial reaction was mixed. My second viewing was based on a less cynical attitude. When you just watch and enjoy, TTT stands on its own and is pretty incredible. The changes from Tolkien can be improvements on the book (especially the often criticized, more realistic depiction of Faramir, who is no longer perfect). The story is very slightly altered, but holds true to the concepts of the book and to the characters. The book is a collection of words which we mentally turn into images; the movie is a collection of images and words which depict a virtually identically story. After all, the movie shouldn't be a film of a narrator reading the book out loud. The battle scenes should be extended as compared with the book; that's what movies are good at. The movie is about 98% true to the book and is quite excellent. The final hour is almost breathtaking, as is the entire depiction of Gollum (who almost steals the show). For those who hate the movie, I am certain others would hate your filmed version of the book."

","In the Fellowship of the Ring, Frodo falls down over and over again in the face of overwhelming danger. After all, he is inexperienced against the perils outside the Shire. He falls down with his friends running from Farmer Maggot, onto Buckleberry Ferry after being chased by a Ringwraith, in the Prancing Pony, while being attacked by the Ringwraiths on Weathertop, on the snowy mountain, in the Mines of Moria vs. the Cave Troll, after running from Boromir when he takes off the ring. But he always gets up again and perseveres, sometimes on his own sometimes with the help of others in the fellowship. This is an important theme again in the Two Towers. Several story lines revolve and evolve simultaneously in a suspenseful tapestry of hope, courage, and strength confronting and prevailing over the Two Towers of evil: in Isengard (Saruman) and Mordor (Sauron). Frodo, Sam, and Gollum; Merry, Pippin, and Treebeard; Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Gandalph and King Theoden in Rohan; our heroes are bombarded with what appear to be impossible obstacles. Although the bonds of friendships are threatened and tested, hope ultimately overcomes despair, and our heroes continue on their journeys. The complexity of Frodo's and Sam's friendship becomes even more interesting with the arrival of Gollum. Frodo falls again, this time into the marshes, and although we expect Sam to pull him out, (similar to when Frodo saved Sam from drowning in the Fellowship of the Ring), Gollum surprisingly rescues him. Are Gollum's motives strictly driven by greed for the ring, or does he truly become attached in other ways to his new Master? Aragorn is frustrated against overwhelming odds at Helm's Deep, when he helps King Theoden against hordes of Urukhai Orcs. Aragon and Legolas even argue about whether they should involve themselves in what appears to be an impossible fight, although Legolas comes around and admits he should not have given in to despair. Ultimately, the Two Towers of evil are no match for the towers of good that develop amongst our protagonists. Hope is never lost and should never be relinquished to despair, no matter what the adversary. Ironically, I was re-reading the book of the Two Towers at a dental visit recently. The young dentist from Australia was not familiar with the Tolkien books and how long ago they were written. He pointed out the irony of the title in the wake of 9/11/01. There are themes in this excellent movie that are relevant to our present world. The movie makes me want to see more, and I am counting the days until Return of the King.

Andy Serkis is a perfect portrait of Gollum's pathos and insanity. I never would have tried to pinch the playfully intense Boromir's face (watch 'FOTR' because Sean Bean should definitely be tamed and seduced like the buck-wild little seducer he is when he's not too saucy!), but his kid brother Faramir (David Wenham reminds me of a puppy that hasn't been housebroken!)is another story because he reminds me of a puppy.

Yes, it is an adventurous epic action film but much of Tolkien's brilliance occurred when the characters spoke philosophically and with great wit. Saruman seemed more like a stick character rather than an articulate ,cunning wizard , and master of deception. Instead, Grima Wormtongue had too much to say for a lesser charactor. By the way, Grima was finely acted. In fact most of the ensemble cast did great with what little script they had to work with. Special mention needs to go to Aragorn , Eowyn, Arwen, Gimli and Legolas. I would also have liked to have only seen the top half of the ents. Their lower trunks looked silly and were the least effective of the special effects.I also felt that the Balrog scene was a bit too fantastic and SFXy. However, inclusion of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog tells a lot about middle earth and its cosmology.<br/><br/>But on the other hand this complex story was made followable and dramatic. The plot differences between the books and movies were effective and even kept Tolkien readers in suspense . But the battle of Helm's Deep and the luminous arrival of Gandalf , Eomer, and the Rohirrim was a breathtaking scene.  The camera angles and movements rendered this massive battle sequence gritty and real yet sublimely surreal.

I for one think he should not only have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor...but should have won it hands down. Once again, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has blown it. Once again a wonderful movie, both beautifuly shot and acted goes un-noticed because it is a ""genre film"", and thats really too bad. Bravo to Peter Jackson for doing what they said couldn't be done and bravo Andy Serkis for your portrayal that made me both laugh and cry. Oh and to the AMPAS....you blew it....big time."

","The well-awaited sequel to the original has come and doesn't surpass the original, but it's still a great follow-up. ""The Two Towers"" picks up where ""The Fellowship"" left off and the second chapter hardly miss a walloping beat.<br/><br/>Most of the cast returns here with the additions of Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill, and a very slimy Brad Dourif who appear here.<br/><br/>The remaining members of ""The Fellowship"" have taken different paths since the first one ended and the encounters here are even more hair-raising. Frodo and Sam are heading to Mordor with assistance of the (psychologically and physically warped) creature Gollum while Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas are searching for Merry and Pippin, who were abducted and wind up running into a few surprises - one being Gandalf, who appears here as ""Gandalf the White"" instead of Grey and the other is what happened in Rohan.<br/><br/>There's even one subplot where Aragorn (Mortenson) himself is now attracted to a king's daughter (Otto) while he still has the affection for Arwen (Liv Tyler). In a lesser movie, it might be a distraction, but here, it's not.<br/><br/>Like the original, the battle scenes are frightening especially of the last ones that takes a half an hour. That fierce battle reminded of a quote from ""Platoon"" where a soldier says ""The beast is out there and he's hungry tonight."" and to me, the fight is like ""Platoon"" with swords and axes instead of guns and gernades.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" is strong all-around as the first one was, but since it's the middle chapter. The energy isn't as high here, however; it makes up with the intensity. And maybe this time, the movie might get ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars."

","I read Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring when I was 7 years old. I was a bright kid and though it was a long, laggy story, I was fascinated by everything especially Gandalf, Balrog and Strider.  It was this whole new world that opened up to me and I was completely swept away with it.<br/><br/>Three years later I read Two Towers and it captivated me even more.  By this time I had been playing AD&D and fantasy was my best friend.  It was an escapist idea and back then things weren't nearly as bad as they are now but I loved going on that adventure.  I also found out that this story was a trilogy and so read Return of the King shortly thereafter.  In the 20+ years since I actually finsihed all 3 books for the first time, I have gone back and revisited Middle Earth 9 times.<br/><br/>Tolkien, though wordy, was an extremely brilliant writer.  The research alone that he brough to these books is astounding.  Not to mention creating multitudes of different civilizations, cultures and languages.  It is amazing when you sit back and look it from a scholarly point of view.<br/><br/>Now that film is where we find the epics of today, not so much in books, it was only a matter of time before some attempted to transform this story for the screen.  Ralph Bakshi is often criticized harshly for his rendering of the masterpiece, but I think that's wrong.  Bakshi is a master animator and has made several amazing films.  He wanted to make three 2 hour movies for each book, but lost studio backing when it was barely halfway finished.<br/><br/>Finally the technology and mentality has come to allow us a brilliant view of this incredible story.  Thankfully Peter Jackson was as enamored with these books as the regular fan and he has done the story justice.  Sure there are obvious changes to the story and some don't make sense but I'm tired of all these people moaning and griping over the tidbits.  Sit back, take a deep breath and just look at what Jackson has accomplished. Certainly I never anticipated this trilogy would be made in my lifetime.<br/><br/>Thank you to the cast, the crew and exspecially to Peter Jackson for his fascination with the story and desire to make it.  I know that Return of the King is going to be just amazing and profound as the first two and the Battle of Pelennor Field and stand at Morannon will be astounding."
"edgarallenpahl","10","0","0","10 February 2003"," The most INTENSE movie of all time!
","There are new standards of cinematography, artistic settings, and action for the movie making industry. Never before has any movie brought to the screen so visually the horrors of war and the complexity and depth of battle, with the seemingly hopeless courage of the outnumbered few. And yet fine details in settings and storyline were not lost amidst the ferocity of combat. The battle at Helm's Deep is one of the greatest achievements of all time and will be remembered as the definition of medieval war.<br/><br/>This movie from the opening scenes with Gandalf fighting the Balrog to the final scenes is captivating to the extreme, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, even if I had read the books at least 25 times and knew what was to happen next. The movie flowed seamlessly from one storyline to another.<br/><br/>Something needs to be said about the performance of Andy Serkis as Gollum. He was absolutely incredible in bringing Gollum to life as a real complex being with a dual personality. His performance should earn an oscar, but we all know that personalities and favoritism govern the choosing of oscars, not competence. Witness the choosing last year of ""A Beautiful Mind"" over ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" as best movie of the year. This was a sympathy award to Ron Howard because he never earned an oscar before. Perhaps the IMDb should start presenting awards based on the voting of participants. Then we would see awards based on actual best performances and no more sympathy awards.<br/><br/>No other movie comes close to the greatness of ""The Two Towers"" except of course ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" which itself was among the greatest of all time, but to me is only a sneak preview of what was to come. (After the ""Return of the King"" is released, I may feel the same way about ""The Two Towers""!) For now, ""The Two Towers"" is my favorite movie of all time deservedly so."

Its scenery, characters and plot are woven together to produce a masterpiece, absolutely flawless.<br/><br/>You can't do anything but marvel at the scope of the movie- $2 billion well spent.

","A reader amazed by J.R.R.Tolkien's world might say that 'The Fellowship of the Ring' makes justice to the book. Not all such readers would agree, but in my opinion, 'The Two Towers' makes something more. The first film had just to visualize the story from the first book with minor changes. The second one had to give the story a new and clearly defined structure. This task was almost perfectly accomplished. Also, it is a delight to see TT being different from FOTR. The first film often reminds of a colourful fairy-tale. The second one is more like a historical movie. Realism of one of the main storylines makes such movies like 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart' look a bit like a fantasy. Of course, there are amiable fairy-tale like moments, but character development and action are primary elements. These are perfectly balanced. There is more character development than in the book, and the performance from the actors adds a lot to it. Aragorn is perfectly depicted as firmly stepping towards his kingship. There are all aspects of Frodo's psychology, what makes me to abandon all fears about the ability of the third film to express the darkest ones. Gollum, based on astonishing performance, is alive. His big eyes make him similar to Frodo, a nice visualization of a not too explicit writer's idea. The action, especially the battle, is as capturing as 'The Matrix', while avoiding trivialization of death, so common in the movies.<br/><br/>The film is impressive on all levels. There is a digital army, which does not look as such, and there are lots of subtle details like a flag of Rohan landing under the feet of Aragorn's horse. Visual effects? There were two or three. Everything else was REAL. The cinematography is breath - catching. The score is amazing. A certain theme is enough to remind a viewer of a location or event without naming them.<br/><br/>What could one expect after FOTR and TT? The 'Return of the King' most likely will complete the seemingly impossible quest of moviemaking. 'The Lord of the Rings' as a whole will certainly be one of the best films ever made. For many people, at least."

","With Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, you have a nearly 3 hour long film that could have easily been half that long, had they trimmed down the overused ""sweeping epic countryside scenes"" that remind us time and time again that yes - our heroes really ARE out in the middle of nowhere! Seriously, after seeing our 3 protagonists look like dots in a meadow surrounded by mountains for the 17th time, I get the idea that they're on an adventure!  Enough already!<br/><br/>Just a small quibble.<br/><br/>Another issue I had with this film (because at this point enough money/fuss has been made from the LOTR franchise to use the lowly term ""movie"") was the buildup of the war between the humans and the orcs.  You get the idea that this battle is HUGE - because it is for the first 30 seconds.  After that it cuts back and forth from Aragorn and Legolas kicking arse to A GIANT FRIGGIN' TREE talking to two HOBBITS.  This really hurts the battle scene, because it takes away the focus to place it onto something that smacks a bit of some anti-pollution cartoon from the early 1990's.  (Ex: A tree telling children the dangers of pollution.)<br/><br/>Once again, a small quibble.<br/><br/>Gimli... Now there's a mixed bag if there ever was one.  His emotions, great.  His animation, great.  His voice, great.  So, you ask, what's the problem?  The problem is that he just seems out of place here.  Now, I know he ISN'T because he's an integral part of the series, but the way he's portrayed in the movie just kind of offsets the whole pace and balance of the thing.<br/><br/>Once again, a small quibble.<br/><br/>Above all else, what irritated me most about this film was the big deal everyone was making over what how great it was.  I liked the first one just fine, but after watching this I have to say that it is really, really forgettable.  Honestly, there really wasn't that much that stood out.  Or PERHAPS ALL of it stood out so much that it kind of cancelled itself out. That's the price you pay for a 3 hour epic of epics.<br/><br/>Once again, a small quibble.  Of course, all of these small quibbles add up to one BIG quibble - that being ""less yackin', more hackin'!"""

","...not THAT good...  It certainly does NOT deserve over eight stars!This film was very nicely done with beautiful sceneries, settings and photographing but did it have anything else? The plot is nothing out of ordinary (which is because of the book), characters are left pretty one dimensional except for Gollum but others are just old-friends with one or two eccentricities. Other thing that explains a bit about the lack of personality of the film is the fact this is a middle-part of a trilogy. Usually these kinds of movies are sort of shifting faces for trilogies , which means that they don't have any great meaning in the story... Don't get me wrong, the movie looked very beautiful and the mass-fights were well produced on the big screen but it was nothing more than an entertain-packed action movie with some very poor humour...<br/><br/>Gimli didn't have any other purpose in the movie tha to serve as a atmosphere lightener in contrast to Frodo scenes. Something for the mass audiences , to be blunt. I would rate it five stars out of 10. No more."

","(Some spoilers)<br/><br/>I have two words for all of you Tolkien purists who seem to think that Peter Jackson is a disrespectful glory-hungry hack: ADAPTED SCREENPLAY. The Lord of the Rings books are fantasy in its purest form: mystical lands, magical creatures, and dreadful villains. It's not an accident that movies haven't been made depicting the books until now. It would be impossible for Jackson or any other director to just lay the books onto a movie screen. Significant decisions had to be made to make a cinematic version of the story. Don't for a second think that Peter Jackson himself isn't torn up about having to cut out things like Tom Bombadil or moving the trilogy's great siege sequence from Minas Tirith to Helm's Deep. The Two Towers movie does depart from the book in several ways, but I am quite confident that everything will work out after the ROTK movie is released. For those who are dumbfounded that Shelob does not appear in the 2nd movie, shouldn't you be in even greater anticipation that she will appear in the 3rd? Everyone needs to stop crying about how Peter Jackson has ruined the books and should instead takes these films for what makes them so special: unbelievable locations (Edoras? are you serious?), fantastic CG creatures (how sweet are the Ents?), and even an extended love story for the ladies to enjoy. We are lucky to view such an outstanding portrayal of great literature. This is an incredible movie worthy of all accolades, and I can't even imagine how ridiculous the third movie will be. Wow.

I expected to see on film the exact images i had read on paper. Unfortunately this soured my movie experience and i seemed to spend most of the time looking for all the changes and debating with myself if i agreed or disagreed with them. I guess i fell into the trap and even thou i knew, i did not heed the words 'The Two Towers the Movie - based on the books by Tolkien'.<br/><br/>Anyway finally went and watched it again. Sat back, relaxed, cleared my mind and went for a ride. The amazing detail that went into all the scenes is just mind blowing. The battles were fantastic. As an fantasy / action epic this movie gives you everything you would expect and more. The downside is that some of the new characters do not get a chance to develop fully with the exception of Gollum. He was cleverly portrayed and all to entirely believable.

Technically, part II is even more impressive than the first, and there are scenes I enjoy watching over and over again, e.g. Gandalf fighting the Balrog, or the Orcs marching against Helm's Deep. However, a good deal of the original story from J.R.R. Tolkien's novel has been abandoned to make room for more ""action"". E.g. the Ents are hurried over so quickly, that they could have been left off all together.

","First I would like to say that I read the book a long time ago but I am not a rabid fan. The odd changes to the story I can live with as books and films are not the same (that is to you fanboys and fangirls).<br/><br/>This was an awesome film in every way which got even better the second time I watched it. From the initial sequence right through the climatic scenes this seemed so much more than the first film and I loved that.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me the most was Smeagol / Gollum. Not just the CGI that is used to create him (although that is as good as we were led to believe and makes that silly House Elf from the boy wizard film look like Mickey Mouse). It was Andy Serkis - the emotion and torment he filled the character with made me feel for him in much bigger way than I ever did when reading the book. The way the character kept swaying between Gollum and Smeagol kept me hooked to the screen more than any other part of the movie.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised by the look of the ents as I had been worried that these would just look stupid. This gives me hope for the final film and some of the more outlandish characters in that.<br/><br/>My only fault, although this is more with the book than the film, is that Frodo and Sam's relationship is a bit too much sometimes - I'm not sure what it is - I can see why their were rumours on the net that the two were homosexual as the book although not saying this gave them a friendship that I cannot imagine outside of a loving intimate one (maybe that is my jaded view of the world though). I have no problems with homosexual relationships on film but this sort of is nearly but not quite there.<br/><br/>See this film and then see it again but don't drink lots of soft drink before going in (like I did the first time - doh!) as it's a long film that only bladder will clue you in on."
"tributarystu","8","0","0","8 February 2003"," Quite an improvement
","Actually it was as I expected. I had heard that there would be more action in this movie, so I did believe, that if all was done well, I would enjoy it. If I look at both movies, I notice that there isn't much of a change in the actual movies, but in the action. The Fellowship of the Ring didn't achieve to amaze me. It was poorly made, without any real action, without any real feelings and without any real characters. All that was interesting was the ring, but the ring can't keep on its own the whole movie. Special effects...well, I consider they are quite enchanting, but not as enchanting as they should have been. I'll get back to these a little bit later.<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>The Two Towers is the long awaited sequel to the widely praised Fellowship of the Ring. If you read my review to that movie, which is a little bit harsh, then you will know that I did not appreciate the first movie. What makes me like this movie is the action. nothing else. I personally consider it an action movie, with a little bit of adventure. The amazing battles make up for the quite pathetic sentimental scenes. The scenes that ruined the first movie. The actors are incapable to get real feelings into the movie, so I remained kind of cold to all the dead after which they ""weeped"".<br/><br/>
The characters do not change...except Gandalf. I did not totally understand the change that took place in him, but I guess that is because I haven't read the books. Still, this is a minus point. What really makes me laugh...well, this is regarding to the best movies of the year poll. Not the fact that LoTR is at the top. That was what I expected. What I find hilarious is that Liv Tyler actually has a place in th category of supporting actresses. She barely appeared 15 minutes during the whole movie, but still she's there. This is just one of the things which prove to me how superficial such polls are. Not to mention how LoTR appears at sections such as ""Best Documentary""... <br/><br/>There is this interesting creature Gollum. Gollum who is the result of what the ring can make of something living. Smeagol is what actually remains of the former self. Smeagol is weak though, and Gollum doesn't have much of a fight to take control. This is how I saw things. There were some who said that Gollum was for LoTR as Dobby was for Harry Potter. I will not deny there aren't any similarities, but I do not think they should be compared. Gollum has a much more important role in LoTR, while Dobby barely appears for some minutes in HP and the Chamber of Secrets. I believe this is a difference which matters. Beside that, the characters definitely aren't the same ""inside"".<br/><br/>I am quite curious which part of the creature will win: Gollum or Smeagol.<br/><br/>The story itself is about war...and despite what some might be trying to do, I do not think it is really about the losses that a war brings. King Theodon is the one who says he regrets the losses, but I can barely FEEL him saying it. The battles are quite impressive...The special effects now...well, regarding the battle scenes they are very well done. But then, I didn't feel quite at peace while seeing Pippin and Merry on that big tree. They seemed not to belong to that picture. Probably is the result of unsuccessful effects. That's what I believe... The scene which I liked most was when the dam was destroyed and the water destroyed all that came in its way(except the living trees). It was a beautiful scene...as was the scene of the attack of Gandalf and his reinforcements. Unfortunately that was predictable, and it was a kind of traditional opposition.(light-dark)<br/><br/>I guess this movie will get quite a few nominations for the Academy Awards. It is not on my list of possible winners though, despite the fact that I haven't seen movies like ""The Pianist"", ""The Hours"" or ""About Schmidt"" yet. I will say that it is a good movie. Because it is. It is interesting and it keeps you awake, unlike its predecessor. It will take me a lot of time to learn why people loved that movie so much...a lot of time.<br/><br/>
As a mark...well, it is quite an improvement. I guess it would deserve an 8/10. Despite the not so impressive acting and the unsuccessful sentimentalist scenes...I'll be fair and I'll say it is worth seeing, if you want to see an action movie. Something that isn't too much of a weight for one's intellect. I say this, because I personally didn't find anything that made a deep impression on me, or that made me ponder on its meanings."

","Yeah, it's great. And yeah, I'll see it countless times on DVD, already several times in theatres. There are so many beautiful and powerful images in this movie that it's ridiculous to reel them all off. All in all it's a masterpiece, second act of a whole that will probably stand as the greatest, most fantastic film epic for many, many years to come. And still I can't help being just a tiny little bit disappointed?! Now, how's that for being ungrateful! Two major issues concerning changes from the original story follow below, plus reflections on the difference between being a movie LOTR ""virgin"" and having a score of FOTR viewings in your backpack when seeing TTT!<br/><br/>Well, I have to say I am *really* looking forward to finding out what purpose that whole scene with Frodo showing the One Ring to a Black Rider was about. Doesn't the entire plot evolve around the fact that the Fellowship was supposed to go into Mordor *unnoticed*? I'm waiting for a reason for this scene, and a bit nervous about it, at that.<br/><br/>Also, I find the screenplay's approach to the Ent-moot a tad strange: why on earth do the Ents take several days to decide on whether Merry and Pip are who they are, and decide not to fight - and then come storming out of the woods, lined up for battle, immediately after a howl from Treebeard? I guess it was done for dramatic effect, to hold the ""non-literary"" audience in suspense - but I think it was a rather pointless change from the book, and making no sense in regard to Ent psychology.<br/><br/>Some CGI blunders seem as if they are the result of Peter Jackson's five-week award tour in 2002, haste in the editing forcing some irritating errors; there are many, some obvious - just look under Goofs at this page.<br/><br/>I must admit to sometimes sighing a bit inwardly, silently wishing for the camera not to flip and flap about so much during (the many) battle sequences, so that one could dwell a bit more on all the details of the combatants. I know there's a perfectly good directing reason for it, showing how the havoc really is havoc, so that's just me.<br/><br/>The score: it's great, I play it a lot on my stereo - and it's very much like the first one. Although not as varied, I think. When the three films can be seen in a row it will be very nice with the continuity, I'm sure, but right now it feels too much like the first to get me cheering.<br/><br/>These things being said, there is no doubt that the tiny bit of disappointment mostly comes from enormous expectations. FOTR was an incredible blast: I laughed, I cried, I didn't move for three hours, I went to the theatre NINE times, I became a fanclub charter member, I bought both DVD editions. I mean, you can't have that same new feeling to it when you see TTT, or any other movie - because now you *know* how the orcs look like, how Saruman looks like etc. Of course, everything is still visually magnificent in TTT, I'm just saying - NOTHING can surpass, for me, the very first viewing at the premiere of FOTR in December 2001, because that was witnessing a new film legend.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a wonderful movie, I love it in spite of the minor flaws I see in it, and it's a definite 10 out of 10 stars from this reviewer."

","Enhancement (30 December 2012) <br/><br/>Since posting the original review (see below), I had acquired the extended DVD of the trilogy which, for EACH of the three movies, provided an extended version of the movie that is around 4 hours, as well as a few hours of background material covering just about everything you would like to know about the making of the trilogy. <br/><br/>I have since viewed this set of extended DVD a few times and, based on these viewings, posted an IMDb review under ""The return of the King on 13 January 2005. But I never looked back at my TTT review until now and I feel that a few more words are warranted. <br/><br/>In my original review, I made a comment to the effect that in covering three separate but parallel main story lines, TTT comes across as somewhat fragmented (see original review below). That was based on the first impression watching the cinema version. I've since changed my mind after watching the Extended DVD and, even more importantly, the documentary appendix where Peter Jackson and the editing crew talk about the process of editing the film. <br/><br/>The three parallel lines are each given considerable length at the beginning to let the audience move along comfortably with the stories. Then the pace quickens, with more and more frequent cross-cutting, until in the end the separately climax in blood-boiling action: Aragon, Legolas and Gimli charged out from Helms Deep with Theoden, to be greeted by Gandolf up on the gap with the glow of dawn behind his back, then charging down in full ferocity with Eomer and the reinforcement; Pippin and Merry, finally succeeded in arousing Treebeard and company, witnessed the devastating attack of Isengard; in Osgiliath, the blood-cuddling descend Nazguls finally made Faramir understand the meaning of the quest of Frodo and Sam, and release them to follow Gollum into Mordor.<br/><br/>Original review posted on 4 February 2003:<br/><br/>This is comparing TTT with Fellowship. These two are by far the best in their genre that no comparison with any other movies in this genre is even meaningful.<br/><br/>The first reason why Towers is just slightly less satisfying is the Shire, or absence of it, rather. While the grandeur of the dwarfs' caves and the bewitching charm of the elves' forests equally excite and delight me, the real magic of LOTR is rooted in the humble, simple, but most comfortable dwellings of the hobbits in the Shire, just as the ultimate strength of the fellowship of the ring is rooted in the simple, fun-loving but resilient and enduring hobbits. Therefore, while the entire movie of Fellowship is immensely satisfying, it's the very first part, when Gandalf was coming to the Shire, that I best love. And I miss it a little in Towers.<br/><br/>The other reason has to do with the difficulty of making the book into a movie. In the trilogy, each of the three volumes is sub-divided into two books. In Fellowship, the movie pretty well follows the book in a single, linear progression. In Towers, book 3 deals with what happens in Rohan while book 4 tells the story of Frodo and Sam going into Mordor. Within book 3, the chapters alternative between the stories of Aragon's trio and the two hobbits. Obviously, it wouldn't do to follow the structure of the book in making the movie, devoting the entire first half to Rohan and the second half to Mordor. The director and film editor have done their best however the movie came across as slightly too fragmented.<br/><br/>These two reasons are really personal, and not flaws of the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, just a few comments on the characters:<br/><br/><ul><li>Glad to see that Aragon is gradually coming into his own, becoming more and more like a king, the way it should be</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gollum is a masterpiece, the closest to the original among all the characters</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Treebeard is a bit of a disappointment, but it is also the most difficult, if not outright impossible, to create on screen (to faithfully reproduce his speeches in full length on screen will probably drive away even the most loyal audience, but without this aspect, it's really not the Treebeard that we know)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Eowyn is beautifully played, as is Faramir</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the Middle Earth in my own mind, Theoden is older and thinner; but I gladly accept the movie version</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Similarly, I cannot expect Legolas and Gimli to be like the ones who have lived in my Middle Earth for over 30 years; but I like the movie version too</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf's character takes on many different shades; the one I love most is when he was going into the Shire, at the very beginning.</li></ul>"

","The second installment of Lord of the rings - Two Towers-is a very good made film. But nothing special in it, absolutely!!!!!!!! I liked ""The Fellowship of ring"" very much. And then i first saw comments here at imdb.com about 2-nd part i was very exiting of course.<br/><br/>Now i saw it.But it is not better than the first part. I think it little worse. Not breathtaking for sure. There were so much words about Gollum. And yes, i think he is the best thing in a film. As for cg character he is very good, but nothing revolutionary after Atack of the clones. He maybe looks more detail than Yoda, but not so much better. I was going to see something realy staggering new in technologies of cg, but i didn't. He was a little better made than yoda or dobby but that's all. Anyway his character was best part of the film. All in all film is ok, but no magic of first part. A lot of parts are dull and a lot are fun. I like alive trees very much. The final battle was the thing which i did not like very much. I saw such things hundred times in different historical films -  siege of the fortress and e.t.c. No fantasy atmosphere in it. Remember - Evil dead 3 - Army of darkness. The siege of fortress in army of darkness was realy fun, and here in Two Towers it is not. All special effects in general give us nothing new. I saw it all in 1-st part. Only Gollum is made better in the second. It is just a tendency now to speak about this film in such a big enthusiasm. But it is just good............."

","Sure ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was a remarkable achievement, but while that film grew exhausting, attempting to squeeze almost every local in the book into three hours, ""The Two Towers"" proves that a little less can be much more, with three alternating acts and a slower pacing that successfully fleshes out the drama, carefully building to an satisfying climax. Yeah, sure there are some unnecessary bits, but for every silly thing there are at least 10 cool moments that more than compensate, including two of the most impressive CGI characters to date."
"t-h-fields","Null","0","0","6 February 2003"," One of the year's best
","No doubt about it, this is among the year's best movies.  Peter Jackson's direction is superb.  The performances are outstanding.  The battle scenes are magnificent.  And the New Zealand scenery is simply gorgeous (as good as in any movie I've ever seen).<br/><br/>Not having read the novels by J.R.R. Tolken, except The Hobbit, I cannot say how faithful the movie is to them.  But it seems shorter than its three hours.  It NEVER drags.<br/><br/>Having three of Jackson's early movies (Bad Taste, Dead Alive, and Meet the Feebles), I can attest that The Lord of the Rings is a significant departure for him.  Not only is it his first big-time production, but it is the first serious movie Jackson has made.  The others are pure camp.  And be forewarned: the earlier Jackson movies are definitely NOT for kids.  But for adults, they are great fun.<br/><br/>That leads to my final point.  The only thing missing from LOTR is Peter Jackson's twisted sense of humor.  Perhaps the subject matter does not lend itself to it.  But the film could use a bit of comic relief."

"MLDinTN","Null","0","0","2 February 2003"," Pretty good, but I expect the 3rd film to be the best
","I think Fellowship was better than TTT. And having read the books, I feel the third book will make the best transition to film, so I can't wait to see ROTK. It should be the best movie of all 3. I would have liked this movie to end as it did in the book, on a cliffhanger to add even more suspense.  I thought the addition of Frodo's encounter with the Nazgul was a good idea because it helped show how Frodo was slowly falling victim to the ring. But, like many others, I didn't like Aragorn's supposed death and dream sequence with Arwen. That was an unnecessary addition.  Of course, other changes were made from the book, such as the elves at Helms Deep and the way Treebeard and the Ents decided to bring down Isengard.  And Faramir's character was totally distorted from the book. They should have not done this because he was not as seduced by the power of the ring as his brother was.<br/><br/>
The cgi effects were awesome.  Gollum and his interactions with real people were realistic.  And I liked the way the Ents looked.  The beasts(not sure what they are) but looked like warthogs on roids were the only really fake looking special effects.  And as I recall in the book it talks of Gandalf fighting the balrog in the caves as an entensive battle.  It would have been nice for the movie to have shown the battle in the caves more.<br/><br/>
FINAL VERDICT: I liked it a lot. But, the first film and I expect the last one will be better.  Definitely a must see for all who like fantasy/adventure/sci-fi movies."

","I never thought a fantasy movie could achieve greatness after Star Wars (although Star Wars has his percentage of science-fiction, it still is a fantasy movie) but Peter Jackson seems to want me proven wrong. And he accomplished it. The Fellowship Of The Ring came pretty close to the top and The Matrix still has to pass the test of having a capable sequel, but The Two Towers can easilly be already acclaimed the best fantasy movie ever - at least until the release of Star Wars Episode III. If you are one of those die-hard book fans who can't stand when the wrong character says that favourite line of yours then you shouldn't watch this movie hoping that it is a perfect adaptation of the book. It isn't. It is based on the book, which is a great masterpiece in literature, but it can make it better and come to life. Viggo Mortensen does a great job with Aragorn and Ian McKellen is... well... Ian McKellen but the greatest of all actors in this movie is a CG character named Sméagol, or Gollum. This movie is worth paying the ticket just for watching Gollum come to life. Absolutely amazing work. If you think the CG characters in some popular movies like Star Wars or Spiderman looked real that is because you haven't seen Gollum yet. Gollum is the best actor in this movie and if it wasn't for being a CG creation then I would say give him the Oscar right away. Of course if the Academy Awards go on with the pathetic decisions they made last year The Two Towers will probably win nothing but technical awards. Go watch The Two Towers, go watch it again, and again. I'm sad that there isn't an 11 in IMDB's rating scale because this is the best fantasy movie ever. No doubts. It is fantastic, it is epic - and the soundtrack is brilliant -, it is beautiful. It is... precious. The wait for The Return Of The King is unbearable."

","First of all if you haven't seen the movie (or the commercials) here is how it goes. Frodo and Sam are off to mordor when they get lost and are found by gollem. (Andy Serkis; does an awesome job! worth the time and the money!) He shows them the way. At the same time Aragorn and company are getting ready for an attack from 10,000 orcs, and the other hobbits are trying to get the ents to go to war. put it all together you get a sweet movie. The most asked question about this movie, for me anyways, is it better then the first one. Well yes and no. There just different which makes all that much better. Personally I think that the battles in the first one were alot more suspensful, but the ones in TTT are alot more visually taking. The music in TTT is alot better. The fellowship sticks alot more to the books. The fellowship sort of drags on a little bit more, while TTT is more fast paced. The only thing I really don't like in TTT is the acting of the hobbits. Thier characters changed way to quickly. Sam went from friendly to a pain. Frodo wasn't supposed to go psycho till the next movie. Merry and pippin aren't even funny, but thats made up for by Gimli (john ryse davies), and there is a little humor from gollem.(but not much) The best parts of the movie were the ones with gollem or Gandalf, because gollem was just a sweet acting job, and gandalf does some cool stuff."

Still, I did not like this movie as much as the one before it.  It seemed to be slower, and the Hobbits, who, as I understand, are supposed to be more of the lead characters, are largely ignored as the adventures of Aragorn, Legolas (-swoons!-), and Gimli are followed.<br/><br/>I think that Smeagol/Gollum was done pretty well, but to a newbie like me, much of his turmoil and incentives fail to make much sense, rather than to get some laughs from the audience.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are pretty nice, with good special effects, but much of it is hard to follow because of the whiplash speeds the camera changes when going from shot to shot.  Some humor is put into the battle scenes, to lighten the dark mood, and in the theater I was in, it was appreciated.<br/><br/>

","Both the books which we have finally read, and the movie trilogy have been inspirational to our family even more than they have been dramatic events. We are deeply impressed both with Tolkien's world view, and with the dedication Peter Jackson showed in his treatment of the Rings.  For both movies we have been amazed at how quickly the nearly three hours passes while we are engrossed in the films.  Although our children are only nine and eleven, we believed that the depictions of good and evil, and the representation of sacrificial courage were sufficiently important to allow them to see the films in all their rawness.  They have also been a wonderful and effective antidote to the Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>Our only problem, having seen the first two films and expecting the same of the third, is that most everything else pales in comparison.  They certainly make one hunger for content in films that has generally been absent, or is so perverse as to seriously affect one's sense of worth and well-being.

She told me that Legolas was going to die.  Man through out the whole movie I was annoying my bf, when he will die.  I guessed each scene, which one, but at the end it turns out that he doesn't die.  I was so mad at her.<br/><br/>I admit that there is one thing I hated the most about this movie, when Pippin and Merry spend the whole time talking to trees, what is up with that I mean they didn't do much they just stuck to walking with trees, and not until the end do they get to do something, but they really didn't do anything, because it was the trees who did something. I like Viggo Mortensen's (Aragon) work, just knowing that he does his own stunts, makes me appreciate,  the work he did for it.  I like a man that shows not to worried about scrapping himself when he is gorgeus.  We need more actors like him. Orlando Bloom (Legolas), didn't do his own stunts, in the first movie, but my friend told me he did in the second one, which if he did man was he good, I loved the way alot of stunts did, because it shows alot of courage, for a young guy like him.<br/><br/>As for Elijah Wood(Frodo), just watching him try to fight the evil from himself makes it so woderful to watch.  Especially that he has those powerful blue eyes that makes him more spookier everytime that there is an evilness stirring inside of him. As for Andy Serkins, he does so great the voice for Golum, he makes him look funny and good and bad in different ways, it is awesome.  He was worth seeing in the whole movie.

","Finally! Part II of the Lord of the Rings trilogy is upon us. And it was well worth the wait.<br/><br/>That pretty much sums it all up... but considering you're all b*****ds who want me to waste a few more precious minutes of my life sputtering out synonyms for ""awesome"" and ""pee-your-pants-goodness"", well, here goes.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is almost everything it should be. It continues the story of the ring bearer, Mr. Frodo, his amigo in action, Samwise the Brave, and their new accomplice in sneaking into Molten Lava Land, Gollum/Smeagol. That last one being two personages in one body for the most part... And 100% CGI. Now, before you jump on Peter Jackson's back like a drugged-up howler monkey that's high on the smack, let me just tell you that there was no other possible way to create Gollum/Smeagol without computer use. No way. And, after the initial sight of him, you truly begin to believe that he is a real, big-eyed, schizophrenic mess of a thing who's interacting with his fellow halflings in all the scenes that they share. Honestly, Gollum/Smeagol is the best character in this episode. I wouldn't shit you about that. Lord knows I hate crappy CGI more than Mulder. I thought that I would have been the first to lambaste and charbroil Jackson's attempt to make us feel sorry for a bunch of moving pixels, but by gum, he made it work!<br/><br/>The Two Towers is also about Merry and Pippin and their escape from their Orcish imprisonment (that was set up at the end of the first film, The Fellowship of the Ring). We see how they bust loose and meet up with the oldest living creature in all of Middle Earth, Treebeard. He's an Ent. That means that he's a tree herder. If you have to ask any more about that then these movies aren't meant for you. Go see Harry Potter again, dweeb.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Two Towers is also more about the re-meetings of Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn and their once dead, wise wizard friend, Gandalf. And yes, for all you dickweeds out there who couldn't follow plot points if they were tattooed backwards on you forehead (so that you could see and read them when you looked in a mirror, ass), Gandalf the Grey DID die while fighting the Balrog of Moria. Then he was sent back by the powers in the West to complete his mission as Gandalf the White. C'mon! This isn't half as confusing as all that time ripple effect in Back to the Future II. Stay with me here.<br/><br/>Soon we also meet lots of secondary characters, including: Éowyn, Théoden, Éomer, Gríma Wormtongue, Faramir and a lot more characters whose names sound funny to stupid people. Stop giggling! This is serious stuff! Rohan and Gondor get their asses handed to them by the dark empire known as Mordor, Gollum/Smeagol literally wrestles with his other self in order to save/kill Master Frodo. Yessssss.... Then they would have precious... Then THEY would be master... Yessssssss.<br/><br/>Grima tries to seduce both Théoden and Éowyn (for different reasons I'm guessing, but can't really be sure. He could actually be trying to get them both in the sack for Saruman's sake), Helm's Deep is sacked and raped like Mike Tyson's last beauty-pageant date, and Faramir is heavily tempted by the one ring. All bad stuff... trust me.<br/><br/>Now to nitpick. I said before that The Two Towers is almost everything that it should be. Let me explain. Peter Jackson apparently thought that J.R.R. Tolkien's original text was lacking. He thought that there were serious lack-of-humor problems, so he made the noble dwarf, Gimli, the comic reli ef of this movie. He thought that having other wise and brave people in Middle Earth other than our original fellowship was silly, so he made the rest of the kings and noblemen retarded and hardheaded. Plus he ended the film before we even get to see Shelob, the giant spider-demon thingy. I just wanted to see her, is that so wrong? But all in all these are just minor bitchings. The special effects may seem a bit rougher around the edges than the first film, but they're still amazing in lots of scenes. The whole tone may seem a bit more drab and lifeless, but that's mostly due to the settings (mostly rocky and craggy brown landscapes). And the biggest problem with this movie is that it ends. All I want now is to see the final battle in The Return of the King. Next December seems soooooo far away. But when it gets here, I just know it'll be very precious (yes, I know that the whole ""precious"" thing has gotten old already, but it's all I got!).<br/><br/>So, what did I think of The Two Towers? I liked it alot. It could have gotten a full five, but for those itty bitty quibbles I mentioned above. But other than me, what's really perfect in this world anyway?"

","As the first installment of the Lord of the rings trilogy was released you instantly realised that this trilogy was going to be a landpost in modern filmaking. The two towers is an absolutely fantastic film, the story allready made and one of the most loved works of fiction of all times makes it hard not to like the film aswell.<br/><br/>Tolkien created a work of genius and jackson and his crew has done an fantastic job of adding and expanding to that work of genius. So well done are many of the aspects of the film that it must also be considered a work of genius. The film is dramatically different from the Fellowship of the ring. Where the Fellowship was a film of many peaks and lows the two towers brings one long builup to its immense climaxes of the battle of helms deep and the fall of sauruman.<br/><br/>This in one way make the two towers a more enjoyable movie as you feel a constant exitment as to ""what is to come"". When the end comes it simply takes your breath away. The CG is brilliantly done and gollum surpassed my expectations by a mile. Treebeard is brilliantly done also. Alltho i missed Quickbeem, you got to accept that some caracter has to be lost in the movie adaptation.<br/><br/>The fans who have read the books seem also to be delighted with the movie adaptation. I am one of the many who has the read the books, and im hugely impressed with what jackson has managed to pull of. One character i felt was short of the books is Faramir. The Changes they made to him and the ring at that stage is something i feel underminds Faramir's nobility and strength. As we know Faramir lets frodo go at his own will after a long talk with him. I totally understand Jackson's motivations for choosing to change this part as it would slow the movie down.<br/><br/>Overall the movie surpassed my expectations, even after watching the The fellowship. So its a clear cut 10/10 in my oppinion."

","Warning - SPOILERS included...<br/><br/>Magic with which middle earth came to life in Fellowship is wearing thin in The Two Towers. Its a complicated trilogy, maybe the most complicated filmmaking ever attempted. Not just adapting Tolkien's story for the screen, but the filmmaking craft itself is stressed to the limits. It must have been a nightmare to shoot, all the angles for a single scene, and I can only imagine the horror of editting it...<br/><br/>However, while technical part of the craft is well done with only minor quibbles, its the storytelling that suffers in The Two Towers. Though I am a great Tolkien fan, I am reviewing Towers as a film buff. Books aside, this is a separate creation. When Towers work, they do so splendidly, but when they dont they dwell on mediocracy. This however is not the fault of being a ""middle"" film.<br/><br/>The Ents with Merry and Pippin story is the most solid part of the Towers. It has ups and downs but it stays coherent. When it suffers it does so due to it being the shortest of the three stories. It is unfolded a bit awkwardly at times, considering what is going on in the other two. Visualising walking and talking trees is no easy task, and they are visualised perfectly. They brought tears to my eyes...<br/><br/>The main plot with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli is a mish mash. They have a task and they are at it. Sadly, it doesnt work all the time. The plight of Rohan is established well, with a small village forced to exile before an orcish onslaught. The trouble begins in Edoras. Bits were corny, purging Saruman from Theoden - the excorcism scene for example. Bigger fault by far is the retreat to Helm's Deep. I never really felt like it was something they had to do. It felt contrived, devoid of suffering. The plight of Rohan that was well established early on was not continued here.<br/><br/>Battle of Hornburg, the Helm's Deep is generally well done but is set up with mixed emotions. A few corny scenes before the battle ruin the atmosphere and despair of Rohan men, women and children is not portrayed well. The battle itself is grand, trully epic. Some heroic stunts could have been omitted though.<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam and Gollum, ah yes, the Gollum. All Kudos to Peter Jackson and the crew for the Gollum they created. They could have easily gone for a cute Gollum, E.T.esque... Instead, they brought a trully sad and tormented creature to life. The Towers shine when Gollum is on screen. The Smeagol vs Gollum dialogue is amazing. You love him and hate him at the same time.<br/><br/>The weakest part of the Towers is the story of Frodo, Sam and Gollum encountering Faramir and the army of Gondor. It is cold and uninvolved. The whole plot is too long for the little it tells. Faramir had to be introduced better... Only magical moment here is Gollum running with a fish in his mouth!<br/><br/>As a whole, three hours of The Two Towers go by in a breeze. Hopefully the extended edition will remedy some of the problems. The magic of Fellowship still lives in Towers. Except in Gollum scenes, it is most evident when Gandalf with Eomer and the riders of Rohan charge down the hill into thousands of orcs... It cuts then to the Ents tearing through Isengard... Epic, trully epic... It brought tears to my eyes."

","This is an excellent film. Its very well shot, the acting is good all round and the effects are breath taking. I just cant help feeling something is lacking. I have read the book but understand a direct translation is impossible and unfeasable. I have no quarrels with added scenes or slightly changed scenarios to aid the flow of the movie. I just feel, and saying this on a 3 hour movie sounds mad, that this movie is rushed. I get the feeling that the characters arn't fully explored and the chop and changing from one story to the next is too abrupt. I have a theory that Peter Jackson made this version for 90% of the audience who wanted a good time, and is making the version he really wanted to release in the extended version we'll no doubt see later this year. All I can say is I look forward with great enthusiasm to the extended version on dvd. That will be the film the theatrical release should have been but couldnt."

I gotta say the scope of the battle scenes were huge and awe inspiring, and the FX for Gollum was excellent, but...<br/><br/>As a story that is meant to elicit an emotional response this movie failed miserably.  Part of it must have been the hype that surrounded the movie, but alot of it was with the movies failure to be anything more than eye candy.  In defense of the director, it may not be possible to capture the scope of the epic that Tolkien created.  Maybe it is, but the way Jackson has done it has not compelled me to be interested in the fate of the characters.  Maybe its the acting.  I never really got any sense that I cared about any of the characters.<br/><br/>I could rant on about any number of other issues, but you get the gist of my opinion... didn't do it for me."

","TTT, grand, epic, touching, bold. Even though it deviates away from the book more so than FotR, it succeeded my expectations and was better than I initially feared (after FotR, how can you top that?). Helms Deep, one of the most powerful battles  have witnessed in a long time.... just imagine what the battles of RotK will be like.... The Treebeard scenes were beautiful, and a lovely moment with Merry and Pippin; There will be no more Shire. Congratulations to Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd there. Eowyn and Eomer, Couldn't have been better casting here. I do feel that both were highly under used. Miranda Otto understood Eowyn's frustration and fear of captivity, her need to fight. I look forward to the more pivotal scenes featuring her in RotK. Gollum, I don't think there is anything different to say except what has already been written on this site time and time again. Magnificent achievement by all involved. Andy Serkis' gollum rasp is terrifying and so alike what I had imagined, and the creation never once took away from the movie. Creepy and pitiful, setting a new standard for CGI. I still feel there is a little loss of something concerning Faramir. The acting from David Wenham was fine, just the twist of the character from the book, and I do understand Peter Jackson's reasonings though, it was just a shame that some wonderful moments and touches from the book had to be missed because of this change. There is one scene that I have not once seen mentioned anywhere but worked so brilliantly - Wormtongue standing by Saruman looking over the vast army of orcs, with a tear running down his cheek...Of shock and disbelief of the number of orcs... It worked so well in the context of that scene and it struck the right nerve with me. And again, thank you Peter Jackson for FotR and now TTT. Just like FotR, it reminds me how special the books are to myself and so many others, and that there are movies out there worth returning to the cinema to see again and again. RotK can't come soon enough!"

","Lord of the Rings, the epic trilogy composed originally by J.R.R. Tolkien, is in the process of becoming moviemaking history. The Fellowship of the Ring, the first novel/movie of the series, was an awe-inspiring, terrifying, and powerful film. Its post-9/11 themes of good vs. evil, hope, and faith were inspiring and heart-wrenching. The acting was superb, the special effects were amazing-nearly every aspect of that film was miles above average. Peter Jackson had done it. He had pulled off what could not be done: creating the greatest fantasy novel of all time and making into an incredible fantasy film. Now came the real question: could he do it again? Ultimately the answer is a well-affirmed ""hell yeah."" The Two Towers begins in glorious fashion: a recap of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog. However this time, we watch as he tumbles into the center of the Earth, battling the flaming, snarling creature. When the scene concludes, there are some minor problems. The first couple of scenes with Frodo and Sam feel a bit strained, almost edited too much. The terror of the Ring is gone, as well is the fear of Sauron. However we do have the introduction of the splendid Gollum, and now the story takes on a new life. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are busy hunting down a band of Uruk-Hai holding their friends captive. Blood is shed and confusion enters and now we have three separate story lines: Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, and Gandalf (in case you didn't know he's not dead), Merry, Pippin, and the Ents (a dull story until an ultimate payoff), and Frodo, Sam and Gollum. Gandalf and his three companions venture into Rohan, where lies King Theoden. After a glorious exorcism and an emotional heartbreak, Gandalf begins consulting Theoden on a plan to defend his city against Uruk-Hai that are just itching to attack. Eventually, Saruman (the creepy wizard gone bad, allied with Sauron) launches his army of 10,000 Uruk Hai against the band of 300 civilians who have retreated to Helm's Deep, a sort-of fallout refuge for Rohan. Now for the analysis: Storyline: Alright!! Things are differentc than from the books!!! GET OVER IT!! The major changes are not so bad anyway. Faramir has now become a violent power-hungry slug that is even worse than his brother Boromir, who at least evoked some emotion and humanity. This is an awkward change, however with the removal of Shelob from the end of the movie, the action in Frodo and Sam's storyline would be nonexistent. There had to be a change. And for the people upset over the elves aiding at Helm's Deep: elves rule. Overall the plot is coherent and interesting. Acting: GOLLUM!!!! Jesus that CGI is incredible. He looks unbelievably real, and the acting is phenomenal. He might not deserve the Oscar but Serkis does deserve the recognition. Viggo Mortenson gives an awesome performance as Aragorn, the wily, reluctant, romantic hero who is grappling with his destiny as the future king of Gondor. He might very well come away with a Best Actor or Best Supporing Actor nomination. Ian McKellen HAS GOT GANDALF DOWN. Too bad he's not in more of the movie, or he would be another lock on a BSA nod. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin turn in solid performances as Frodo and Sam, respectively. Astin's speech at the end is quite a 9/11 allegory. Bernard Hill is wonderful as King Theoden, and Mirando Otto is lively and Leia-ish as Eowyn. Cate Blanchett is barely in the movie, as is Hugo Weaving, but Liv Tyler still manages to impress. I never thought she could pull of Arwen but she does do it pretty well. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies give jolly, but ferocious performances as Legolas and Gimli. Gotta' love a dwarf with an axe. Wenham is average as Faramir, not nearly as human as Sean Bean's Boromir. Christopher Lee is barely in the movie, as is Brad Dourif, but they both deliver freaky performances nonetheless. Merry and Pippin and Treebeard at first seem a bit annoying, but the assault on Isengard is a spectacular, oddly moving event. Special Effects: GREAT!!! END OF STORY!! OSCAR GUARANTEED!<br/><br/>The Two Towers proves to be a great film. It's moving, glorious, and pretty in its stunningness. There are moments that will make your heart cry out in joy, and there are times where you will remember things that don't seem so distant in today's world. What a great film..."

","`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' turns out to be a mighty impressive second installment in the J.R.R. Tolkien trilogy  and this from someone who wasn't exactly the greatest fan of the first installment, `Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.'  That film, for all its visual splendor, narrative ambition and epic scope, ultimately, turned into little more than a conventional monster movie, with the characters battling one strange creature after another to the point where the film finally became a crashing bore long before its three-hour running time was up.   `The Two Towers,' though equally long (one minute shy of three hours, to be exact), doesn't fall into this monotonous narrative pattern, thereby allowing for more variety in its story and more depth in its characterizations.<br/><br/>As someone who knows next to nothing about the specifics of the trilogy, I must say that the story can be a bit hard to follow for the non-initiate. We aren't always sure who is who or just how the battle lines in the various good-vs.-evil conflicts fall out.  This has the unfortunate effect of making the early stretches of the film confusing and, at times, downright incomprehensible.  Luckily, the plot strands begin to straighten themselves out after not too long a time, and one can at least follow the unfolding action well enough to become absorbed in the spectacle on screen.  And impressive that spectacle is, with director Peter Jackson once again creating an entire fantasy world with the help of his cinematographer, Andrew Lesnie, as well as his various art directors, scenic designers and special effects wizards.<br/><br/>One of the reasons `The Two Towers' triumphs over `Fellowship of the Ring' is that this newest film provides us with more conflicted, more complex characters.  This is especially true in the case of Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who's been entrusted with the powerful ring, but who must now struggle to avoid becoming taken over by its evil power.  Similarly, Gollum, a loathsome but strangely compelling creature who befriends Frodo in an attempt to wrest the ring from him, suffers with bouts of schizophrenic near-madness as part of him wants simply to do the right thing, and, thereby, garner acceptance and companionship in the process.  These two characters bring some added depth to all the surface magnificence of eye-filling vistas and heart-pounding adventure and battle scenes.<br/><br/>Not being familiar with Tolkien's novels, I cannot say to what extent the film is or is not faithful to the original.  I will, therefore, simply state that `The Two Towers' is a powerful and moving saga that can stand on its own as a first-rate movie-going experience.  Having nodded through the first installment of the series, I was not exactly looking forward to Part Two. Now, having seen Part Two, I can't wait to see Part Three."

","The Two towers is the shorter book of the trilogy. However it started in the fourth page and finish at the middle of the book. Three hour for 150 pages it's too long. Also the second book is a too free version of Tolkien novel, especially if it's compare with the first one. The second also have the same trouble than the first one (the older characters like Arwen, Legolas or Frodo are portray by very young actors while the younger like Eowyn or Pippin are very old: that remain the golden period of Hollywood like Little Women 1949 or Romeo and Julliet 1936).  Also some important figures of the Novel like the very Cool Pippin or Farimir are reduce too mere figures decorative. The other big mistake is too killing an Elf. In the trilogy none of the elf dies- However this movie is much personal and have a nice love triangle between 70 Aragorn, 2500 Arwen and 22 Eowyn. Aragorn and Arwen love scenes are really beautiful and passionate. The Helm Abysm fight scene is one of the most gorgeous battles of cinema history. And the visual effects are much better than the first one. Even when is easy too distinguish a natural scene than a<br/><br/>This movie had four things that I like very much: the love triangle, the Helm Abysm and too digital characters: The treebeard Ent (voice by Rhys Davies) and specially Gollum. Gollum Smeagol choice of being a good or bad hobbit is the best performance I'have seen in a long time. Sometimes evil some times sweet, Peter Weir and actor Andy Serkis creates a very seducer creature, who robbed the heart and the applause from the audience. To conclude is maybe too long but fortunately is also very different from the first one, so in possible than the Return of the King will be the best of all."

","What else can be said about this fairy-story for adults? Boromir and Frodo are two diminutive human-like creatures (hobbits) from a threatened region of fantasy world. They have been entrusted to return an evil ring of power' to its source and so destroy it. The Ring has a mind and personality of its own and tries to corrupt its bearer. Line up the good guys: Gandalf, (friendly magician), The Ents (tree-creatures that can walk and talk), various human and half-human species, and CGIs that generally are wont to inhabit such tales. Then there's the baddies: Saruman (corrupt wizard), the Dark Lord Sauron, and an army of custom-bred nasties (queue more fabulous CGIs). Finally, one of the most popular characters, Gollum (Smeagal) who has been twisted body and soul and tracks after the ring bearer in the belief he is its rightful owner. (Smeagal is such a remarkable feat of special effects that he has endeared himself to many audiences who come out pining for a pet one.) The Two Towers' of evil unite against the forces of good and slug it out for another three hours. (This synopsis for the benefit of anyone who hasn't spent many hours reading the book). The good things about the film are much the same as Part One (Fellowship of the Ring) or even better  great scenery, great battles, believable acting and judicious use of special effects in a movie that respects the intelligence of the adult cinema-goer without being too horrific for a young adolescent. On the down side, you have to like this sort of stuff in the first place, or be willing to be won over, and you have to put up with built in flaws like a dodgy and seemingly random mix of accents throughout. Part two of a remarkable, brilliant, and genre-making trilogy  but more or less what you would expect if you've seen part one."

"athena13-1","10","0","0","25 January 2003"," Bad changes + parody + magnificence = quite ok.
","Making a good film of an epic the size of Tolkien's LOTR, is a difficult task. In the Fellowship Jackson pulled it off, but TTT, although quite ok as a whole, is full of questions for me.<br/><br/>First of all, when the changes in the plot of the Fellowship were justified, it is difficult for me to accept a lot of them in TTT. Rohan looked nothing like Tolkien described it, with Edoras looking like a poor village situated in not even remotely similar geographical surroundings. The jokes were sometimes a bit out of place; (Spoiler!) e.g Gimli's and Legolas' `shall I find you a box' joke - extremely poorly acted by Orlando Bloom and a joke that did not correspond to the mood of the whole scene really. Faramir had gone through a personality change - one of the most unfortunate changes of them all, as Tolkien's Faramir was quite the opposite of Boromir and as such very believable considering the family problems behind it. And ents, although quite good visually, were not interested in anything, thus resulting in a very weak story line. Was it really necessary to make such changes to make the situation look more desperate and difficult?<br/><br/>
And of course (Spoiler!), the arrival of the elves to Helm's deep?!? Come on! Of course, this story line is surrounded by more controversies than I'd like to describe. In the Fellowship they wanted to help, in the beginning of TTT they didn't and left for Valinor, but in the end showed up in Helm's Deep anyway? Where's the logic to that? Or is it just some extremely complicated and unsuccessful way to show the inner struggles of Elrond?<br/><br/>In addition to Faramir's personality change, another one that bothered me already in the Fellowship was Aragorn's indecisiveness. Reading the book, Aragorn was always aware of his role and his task, with his whole life being a preparation for the LOTR action. Although in the `original' version of the Fellowship this change is not so pronounced, the director's cut makes it even clearer. Such change, although not a very good one, adds depth to the character (as do Aragorn's conversations with Arwen and Elrond in TTT, which were good, no doubt in that) and certainly does make the movie more dramatic.<br/><br/>And of course, I'm really sorry for pointing this out and maybe it is a result of my twisted sense of humor, but some of the scenes seemed like a parody of something I've seen before. (Spoilers!) Faramir &co fighting the Southrons and oliphaunts looked like Robin Hood and his merry men. Elf troops looked like coming directly from a Star Wars movie. The orc running to the wall of Helm's Deep with the aim to blow it up and other orcs cheering along, looked like a ridiculous mix of lighting the fire during the Olympic Games and some teenagers' movie with the compulsory slow motion scene of a football game.<br/><br/>However, there were quite a lot of simply magnificent things. The landscape was absolutely breathtaking. The emotions behind actions were well justified, although for someone who has not read the book some of the things may seem coming from nowhere and thus not logical. Aragorn-Eowyn relationship was intriguing, and well played by both actors. (Spoiler: there is a wonderfully played and cut scene of the meeting of Legolas and Aragorn in Helm's Deep, when Legolas returns the jewel - look at Eowyn's face.) Gimli and Legolas were as stylish as in the Fellowship and made a wonderful duo. The cast did a very nice job indeed (with a couple of exceptional scenes) despite the `one-liners' tendency in the script. Gollum was simply brilliant - the way his split character and the inside good vs bad fights were depicted made some of the best scenes in the whole film. And the jokes, of course.<br/><br/>Well, I could go on for quite some time with this list, but in short, the movie was quite ok. Although not an improvement compared to the Fellowship, it's certainly worth seeing, and probably the more you see it the better it gets."

A person who has not read the books, will more likely enjoy the two Towers better than The Fellowship of the Ring, for it is faster-paced, comical, and action packed. The Fellowship was was long, was stuffed with too much information, and went to a lot many places with out a lot of time for the viewer to catch on. If you are like me, and have enjoyed Tolkien's works, you will most likely joy the Fellowship, for it is true to his word. The Two Towers was one of the best things $8.50 bought this year and I want it on DVD! 8/10"

","After seeing this film for the 3rd time, I feel I can now write a clear evaluation of it. I would also like to add that I have read TLOTR about 10 times, starting age 6, so I have a good knowledge of the original story.<br/><br/>I'm fully aware of the need to adapt a story to make it work on the screen, and I was always willing to accept these changes, despite my love of the original story. Like someone said, if I want the original story, I'll read the books again.<br/><br/>However, I become somewhat annoyed when I feel the plot has been changed for no great reason, and and this happened several times in this film. Most notable was the adaptation of Faramir and his decision to take Frodo to Osgiliath. Faramir is meant to display his quality and strength by letting Frodo go, something Boromir could not do. Instead, he shows himself to be as weak as every other man, rather than proving himself.<br/><br/>Another instance is the behavior of the Ents. A sudden desicion to wage war on Orthanc is really out of character of such a race, and that really jarred for me.<br/><br/>Helms Deep was good, but I felt it was overextended at the cost of other elements of the film (i.e. the relationship between Frodo and Sam) I appreciate, however, that this was a change needed to satisfy the mindless punter, and suffer it as such.<br/><br/>The film is still 100/100 for me, but a few little changes and it could have been so much better. I await the Extended Edition with anticipation."

","The plot of this movie is about Barlago from Garganda who needs to get to Margalala before the Embligs reach it and try to destroy the Ziglwigs... or something like that.  Maybe if I had immersed myself in the trilogy and attended sci-fi conventions beforehand, I could've actually understood the story.  Instead, it plays like a big, spectacular video game.  Admittedly, I kind of enjoyed it because it is visually the most amazing thing we've seen on the screen yet, especially the computer generated character with the big ears (Grogglegorf, I think).  All the names sound alike, most of the characters look alike, and there are too many of them to care about any of them.  The scene with the H.R. Puffenstuff trees was mildly humorous, although I don't think that was intentional. So the plot is probably even less penetrable to non-geeks than the first one, but it is oh so fun to watch.  If you are not a sci-fi geek, go for the visuals.  Computer graphics have reached the promised land -- it is a landmark movie in that regard. Just don't expect to be included in this little Star Trek Convention of a movie unless you've read the books."

","Wow, was this movie worth the wait. The Two towers picks up where the Fellowship ends. This movie is not better or worse because it is a continuation. Its part of one big movie that the great writer J.R.R. Tolkien fit into three books. Let me begin by saying that the cinematography and visual effects alone make the movie worth seeing.<br/><br/>The familiar characters from the first movie return and we are introduced to new ones. In this film the characters are more fleshed out.  We see how the burden of having to destroy the ring has on frodo and sam. The characters of Aragon, Gimli, and Legolas all go on their seperate ways to fight the orcs and help the people of the town of Rohan. They all must fight against the forces of Saruman and his evil soldiers called orcs. The two new characters that really blew me away were treebeard and gollum.<br/><br/>Gollum more than the former was such a rich and conflicted character. He is totally computer animated, but we feel his inner pain and conflict within to resist the ring.  We want him to be good and turn his life around. The battle of helms deep at the end is one of the best I have seen put on film. The only other battles that even rival it are in Braveheart or in the Patriot. Both of these are Mel Gibson movies which are both worth seeing.<br/><br/>
In my opinion Peter Jackson is a genius for bringing these movies to life. They will go down in history as one of the best trilogies ever made. Everyone should see this film."

","One of the most important considerations to take into account when analyzing a film like this is the issue of medium. We must realize that there is simply no way to transfer a work of art from one medium to another. Sure, we may agree that Tolkien's book are masterpieces. And we can say that an adaptation of such a great work has a better chance of being a great work in its own right. But we must not mistake one work for the other. Peter Jackson's films are not the books. Now there's no getting around the obvious connections between the two. Many of us have grown up with a vivid image of Middle Earth in our heads, and we should expect to compare this vision with what is presented on the screen. But they will not, can not, be the same vision.<br/><br/>So issues such as changes made to the plotline should be considered (as much as possible) within the context of the film. Did the omission of Shelob create a better story, or worse? Did Aragorn's little near-death excursion improve the pacing and flow of the narrative or not? Faramir? The Elf battalion? We obviously can not remove from our selves all previous conceptions of Middle Earth, but we must remember that these films are NOT actually Tolkien's LOTR. They must be considered on their own.<br/><br/>I appreciate PJ's decision to make TTT a more action-orriented film. An attempt to recreate Tolkien's TT would have made a much less interesting and beautiful film. For the most part, the casting continues to be first rate. Although she will never match my original conception, M. Otto's Eowyn was a particularly thrilling character. As with most, I was confused by Faramir's characterization. I think, however, that a fully introduced Faramir coming at the end of the film would have been awkward and would have greatly detracted from the film real hero, Aragorn. So we'll have to wait for TROTK to see Faramir in full force. The looks of the Ents was less than spectacular, but they came off fairly well as a whole. Wood's Frodo continues to descend into a frightening sort of madness and Austin's Sam continues to develop. I couldn't help but chuckle at the inclusion of Sam's story speech near the end. Insert director's tough into cheek.<br/><br/>
In the end, this is a fine film, although not quite as good as last year's Fellowship. Personal rating are subjective, but as much as I love the film with its beauty and tragedy so masterfully portrayed, this is no top ten of all time film. It is, however, a brilliant fusion of heroic drama, deep apreciation of ideals, and spectacular technique."

","I read LOTR, Silmarillion and Hobit and I was impressed, it had everything a great book should have, nice plot, well developed characters and optimism. On the other side there are films. First film was nice, but Frodo's(Elijah Wood) acting was horrible (especially the ghastly laughter at the beginning), and also the other actors didn't really live in their characters, and I felt that certain something was missing, but besides that I still bought the DVD and watched it approx. five times.<br/><br/>And then came TTT, I thought they would get it right this time. (Next lines may contain spoilers). First thing that troubled me was the part with Frodo and Sam, I know it is hard to bear the ring and that Frodo thinks he is too weak for the quest etc. but that doesn't mean that he should look and behave like he is on heavy drugs and/or is brain-dead. Also the Gollum's inner conflict shouldn't be like he has multiple personality disorder. Also there are some useless and pointless scenes (Battle for Osgiliath, Legolas jumping on the horse and Aragorn's mourning over the dead elf) in witch Jackson was showing off what he can do even if he destroys the plot-line and makes movie too long and boring. After 178 minutes of journey through the Middle earth I finally knew what was missing, THE SOUL AND THE COMMON SENSE witch unables this movie to be the true masterpiece. 7/10"

It is much more relaxed in telling the story but do not think for a moment that it is not telling it well. It has great humour, emotion, excitement and all round encompassing fantasy. You lose yourself in this one and you don't even notice the length of the film. The special effects used for this film dominate over anything that has come so far and it seamlessly integrates into the story so much that you fail to notice that it is computer generated and instead accept that it is really going on within Tolkien's world.

Obviously, this is part of a whole story, but if you compare this film with the first part you will agree with the fact that the first one had more content for thinking and/or meditation. One thing was clear to me and this was the message of peace given by the film and against those emperors always creating troubles, sometimes false ones, for provoking the wars. This happened during the Middle age, so let's hope that these events do not repeat at present in our planet Earth."

Miranda Otto did a good job of Eowyn, even though she was not in it for too long, and I liked that we saw more of Gimli.<br/><br/> ""The Two Towers"" offered more impactive and impressive scenes, such as the Black Gate Of Mordor, and the battle at Helm's Deep.<br/><br/> I strongly recommend you see this, but see the Fellowship first (if you haven't already) as there is no bit at the beginning to fill you in.<br/><br/> Great Movie, 10/10"

","I just wanted to address all those who are raging with Balrog-like fury that Peter Jackson did not follow the books to a ""T"" when he wrote the screenplays for these films (along with Walsh, Boyens, and Sinclair).  Who says he must?  YOU???  I admit I've not read the books yet, but I just finished The Hobbit and am now beginning FOTR.  I'm sure I'll be a bit disappointed also when I find things in the books that are nowhere in the films, but why must we always lash out with anger when a screenplay does not precisely mirror the book it's based on in every way?  Books are nearly always better than their movies.  Why?  Because of the power of your own imagination.  No Hollywood director past, present, or future can compete with that.  Jackson and the entire team down to those guys putting all that chain-mail together link by link (see the bonus stuff on the extended dvd edition of FOTR) are simply doing a sensational job on these films. Special kudos to Howard Shore for composing the hauntingly beautiful music that transports us to Middle-Earth.  I especially like the part in the score where Gandalf and the Balrog plunge into that monstrous cavern just before they hit the water.  In my humble opinion (and I've heard it from others, too), nearly every moment in these films is a work of art.  This is the first time I can truly call a movie a masterpiece.  Please, PLEASE, just enjoy the movies by themselves.  Don't criticize them because of their differences from the books.  You'll live a longer and happier life if you can practice less-cynical things like that!"

","Has it really been a year. With ""The Two Towers"" it certainly doesn't look so, because I was immediately thrown back into this epic adventure and even quicker reminded of its brilliance. The second installment of the Tolkien novel is shere perfection when it comes to visual and sound style, be it the special effects(which are basically flawless and have come a long way since ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"") or the beautiful photography or the amazing score and sound effects. But what it doesn't have is the essence of the first one, the atmosphere which was just too strong and great to last forever. Instead the movie relies on its final battle scenes (during which I often found my mouth wide open)and forgets about the fellowship. Aragorn is given new depth as he has much mores screen time and becomes the hero of this movie and Frodo discovers a new friend, Gollum, shere brilliance of computer animation. Despite the lack of ""fellowship"" from the first one ""The Two Towers"" provides for an unprecedented visual feast which, after ""The Matrix"" or ""Minority Report"" speaks for itself.  <br/><br/>It's is probably going to be the weakest of the Ring Trilogy because let;s face it; Peter Jackson has spoiled us rotten, but it's still damn near perfection. 8/10"

","SPOILERS ALL OVER IT<br/><br/>Seriously, how can anyone with at least one brain cell can say that this is a masterpiece? And how can anyone call Peter Jackson a genius? You want masterpieces, there are plenty of them out there... Vertigo, Barton Fink, from more recent years Gosford Park, almost all of Kubrick's filmography, Chinatown, Rosemary's baby, Otto e mezzo...<br/><br/>First of all I didn't walk in the cinema expecting a masterpiece like the ones mentioned above. I like a lot the Tolkien novels and I wanted to see a good adaptation. Having not liked the first one I thought I could spend an entertaining time watching excelent special effects. The film was so bad I couldn't even do that.<br/><br/>First of all, does any of the five (five!) screenwriters know what the word ""adaptation"" means? It's imposible to be faithful to such a long and detailed novel. You have to remember you're making cinema for people who didn't read the book and write a screenplay of your own and direct a movie of your own. That's the whole point, not just taking scenes from a book and shoot them as they are.<br/><br/>Second, the jokes. Gimli's one of my favorite characters. Why turn him into an idiotic buffon? Maybe because Jackson and his crew don't have a sense of humor? Gimli's jokes are pathetic and you want to strangle the guy sometimes. What a way of spoiling a good character.<br/><br/>Third, the direction style sucks. It has no epic notions, no drama... A lot of the scenes are completely spoiled because of Jackson's idiotic focus on the special effects, completely forgetting the means he has at his hands to make as scene exciting. This p***es me off- a guy is given such a high budget and completely spoils it. The reason? Lack of talent.<br/><br/>Finally the dream sequence with Arwen. Jackson is such a lousy filmmaker that he doesn't realize that he's shooting the dream in the same style as the rest of the scenes. This is a movie wich must be filled with an wonderful, magic atmosphere. Something that is from the beginning out of reality. How to make a dream in this context? It's an interesting question. But Jackson's answer is plain pathetic.<br/><br/>SAY NO MORE"

","This film moves the now broken fellowship further on their journey, but in the end it is as if they are no closer to Mordor. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and co. take centerstage, with Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) especially played humourously. While often good as light relief, his endless stupidity is annoying, and he really comes into his own at the battle scenes at Helm's Deep. This fight is epic - yet still only a taster of what is to come. It is perfectly planned by director Peter Jackson, and is such an improvement on the book's battle scene. There are new characters, but apart from one or two, none are lost from the first film. However, these new characters vary. All of the men of Rohan are bland and uninteresting - Theoden (Bernard Hill) is never exciting and the love possibility between Aragorn and Eowyn (Miranda Otto)barely explored. But one of the new characters is also one of the best. Brad Dourif's Wormtongue is a wonderful, slimy character who crawls between Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Theoden like the worm he is. His interest in Eowyn is also interesting, and unnerving. The special effects are truly stunning, although the first-time feeling of amazement is gone with this sequel. Highlights include the Black Gates of Mordor, pulled by trolls, and the Ents, which seem dignified as opposed to laughable, as they could have been. However the most incredible aspect of the film, by FAR, is Andy Serkis' Gollum. Far and away the most complex CG character ever, Gollum is actually one of the most human characters in the film. Every line, eye movement, hair is there, and Serkis' voice is wonderful. His movement and interaction with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) is fantastic. And we see his emotions. When he is called Smeagol, we see everything in his eyes and his voice. He jumps between hilarious, pitiful, untrustworthy and lovable. The standout scene of both LOTR films so far shows the two sides of his personality coming out and arguing - it is incredible. Gollum is absolutely amazing. The script has holes in - the director has clear favourite characters - Sam (who has a speech at the end almost identical to that in Fellowship), Gimli and Gollum among them. The dialogue sometimes seems too trivial. But TWO TOWERS IS AN EPIC. There is nothing that can change that, and it is spellbinding throughout."

But like its previous film, it will be forgotten because it is just too grand and beautiful for anyone to comprehend. It just goes to show that some people have all the luck. Peter Jackson doesn't need to make anymore films in his life because these ones will be his lasting legacy. TTT was also much more bearable to watch.

"slimjack","Null","0","0","27 January 2003"," An outstanding, if not totally enjoyable, movie
","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers continues the monumental achievement of The Fellowship of the Rings. It is an intelligent and tasteful fantasy epic. That said you might find it a movie you respect more than enjoy. Watching it can be a distant and cold experience. You seem to be viewing the romance and adventure through a frosty blue lens. <br/><br/>The Two Towers is the second chapter of a trilogy that makes little concession to those who come in late. You are thrust into the middle of the action as Frodo and Sam make their way to the cursed land of Mordor. Aragorn and his party track the Orc band that kidnapped Pippin and Merry at the end of The Fellowship of the Rings. Two and a half hours of high fantasy mayhem later you are again left dangling  but not before meeting enough characters to populate ten normal sized movies. This brings up a point: While it is not strictly necessary to read Tolkien's books or watch the first movie to enjoy The Two Towers, such preliminary preparation will help keep your Éomérs separate from your Éowyns and Éothains. <br/><br/>
The Two Towers cast is, again, led by Ian McKellen as the durable wizard Gandolf.  McKellen's exceptional performance does not steal the movie; rather he is like a star quarterback leading a winning team to victory. Most all the actors were memorable up to and including the computer generated Gollum. The exceptions were, unfortunately, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin as the heroic hobbits Frodo and Sam. Their rather bland performances and wandering accents diminished the impact of Frodo's quest to Mordor. That quest is, after all, the backbone of the trilogy. This is not a fatal flaw as the other performances and the sheer spectacle of The Two Towers is more than enough to carry you through the few dead moments.<br/><br/>
Spectacle the Two Towers has in overflowing abundance. Magical and fantasy elements seem to play more of a role here than in Fellowship of the Rings so you have swooping dragons, giant walking trees, huge armies of hell-beasts and a castle assault the likes you've never seen.  The siege of Helm's Deep could have been a movie unto itself and is the undisputed highlight of The Two Towers. The epic promise of magical fantasy is realized here but, do to the uniform strength of the cast's performances, all the blood and thunder on display is not at the expense of the characters or their story.<br/><br/>	 Director Peter Jackson does have some chinks in his style. He has yet to develop a flair for epic movie making. It sometimes seems that his sole way of showing off the size of his movie is with great swooping helicopter shots. Other times he sprints his camera through intriguing environments too quickly to get a real sense of the scene. He also indulges in some topical comedy that, while undeniably funny, is gratingly anachronistic and has the effect of momentarily rousing you from the mood the rest of the movie has carefully built.  These, however, are small problems that barely scuff the surface sheen of The Two Towers. A larger barrier to truly enjoying this movie is the afore-mentioned remoteness of its style. This may be more a matter of personal taste than anything else.  To me the cool and formal presentation was a little off-putting. To others it might strike just the right note of grandeur. There should be no argument, however, that The Two Towers is a film to be reckoned with and that the cinematic Lord of the Rings trilogy will be judged as much a classic as its literary forbearer."

Brad Dourif ""is"" Wormtongue, and Miranda Otto and Bernard Hill are also stunningly believable as Eowyn and Theoden King.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen once again stands out, taking the role of Gandalf to another level, accompanied with outstanding performances by Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Austin, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, etc...I particularly enjoyed the character development of John Rhys-Davies's character Gimli (though I see some ""critics"" of the film did not).<br/><br/>The CGI characters like Gollem, Treebeard and the ents were also extremely believable to the point you forget that they were animations. Andy Serkis (the voice of Gollem) did a fantastic job portraying Smeagol's duality.<br/><br/>Without saying too much, the battle for Helm's Deep must be seen to believe!<br/><br/>There are a lot of ""critics"" or ""Tolkien Purists"" downplaying these films. I, myself have read the books on 4 occasions and still believe whole-heartily that Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien is as close as we're ever gonna get. Simply putting it, there are some things better in the book, yet (to the horror of the ""purists"") there are some things better in the movies! I personally didn't see eye to eye with everything Jackson did, however I'll save my criticizing for the thousands of horrible films out there that lack the same passion Jackson has put into these films.<br/><br/>10/10 ...and if I could, I'd give it an 11!(""these go to 11""- SPINAL TAP)"

","Yes, the SFX and the scenery are amazing and unseen. They made me enjoy the last hour of the movie. However, the movie is just too long. Same problem as in the book: it just does not get to the point and the story is pretty boring. For part one, the film managed to undo some of the boredom i had when reading the novel, unfortunately for part 2 that was not the case. 10/10 for the art director, 5/10 for the movie."
"MercuryDrinker","Null","0","0","21 January 2003"," Excellent, slightly better than the first, but slightly overrated.
","Note: I've read the books 1.5 times (i.e. I'm half way through)so I have a fair idea of pretty much all of the changes. This also makes my opinion slightly biased. This is also my first review here at imdb.com so bear with me.<br/><br/>After waiting 8 more days than the Americans, I finally got to watch it and I wasn't disappointed (well, maybe a little). In general I think it's slightly better than the first, even though it wasn't as good as the Fellowship prior to Helm's Deep and the attack on Isengard. Although I haven't seen it enough (twice so far, I intend to see it once more) to make a complete opinion. although i think that the first one was more 'polished'.<br/><br/>I'll skip the plot summary and just go straight to my opinion.<br/><br/>Stuff I liked: *The Ent attack on Isengard, it was a bit short, but it was still great. Although I liked the flooding of Isengard, it was still obvious it was a miniature. The Ents overall were pretty well done, alot better than I expected, I expected them to look cheesy or lame.<br/><br/>*The Nazgul with wings was also well done, although shots of just the nazgul, it was obvious that they just used blue screen. *Dead Marshes and Emyn Muil were perfectly visualised...<br/><br/>*The Oliphaunts, almost exactly how I imagined them.<br/><br/>*The Warg attack on the Rohirrim. One of the few changes that enhanced the story. The only complaint is that the wargs still looked a bit CGI-ish, especially when compared to the extremely well done Gollum.<br/><br/>Stuff I loved: *Gollum/Smeagel is the best CG character ever. period. He is the first CG character that actually made me feel any emotion towards (does that sound right?). Every other CG character I have seen has been either soulless (Final Fantasy), retarded (Jar Jar, from Star Wars ""The Phantom Menace"") or not realistic enough (Jar Jar and Yoda and pretty much any other CG character that I can remember).<br/><br/>*Gollum/Smeagel also did a terrific 'acting' job and was thoroughly convincing and realistic, unlike Yoda or Jar Jar. He was also very lovable and cute in a sort of pitiful and pathetic way, and I actually felt really sorry for him, something that has never happened with anyother CG character... Peter Jackons choice of accentuating the two characters (Smeagel and Gollum) was also a welcome change, as it made the arguements between them more dramatic.<br/><br/>*Helm's Deep, completely epic and huge, although I have to admit its not quite as epic as the clone war in Star Wars ""Attack of the Clones"". I also have to admit they showed too much of the battle in the trailers, which sorta wrecked it for me. The constant cuts to Treebeard, Merry and Pippin also cut up the action in Helm's Deep, which wasn't a great editing choice.<br/><br/>
*Gandalf saving the day with Eomer, absolutely brilliant shot, even thought technically they would've been completely slaughter by the pikes that the Uruk-Hai were holdling (see: Braveheart).<br/><br/>Stuff I didn't like: *Alot of the stuff I didn't like deviated from the book, although I don't mind minor changes, and I am in no way a tolkien ""purist"", I thought that Fellowship's changes were all good or excellent, except for the lack of Galadriel's gifts (although that was remedied in the extended DVD)<br/><br/>
*Near the ending when they were winding everything down, they shortened all the battles (Isengard and Helm's Deep) and cut them off and didn't really show the closing parts of the battle, it lacked the detail that they had at the beginning of the battles.<br/><br/>*The movie seemed a bit 'all over the place' with about four plotlines to follow that weren't really edited correctly and didn't flow very well, for instance Merry and Pippin hardly get any screen time and as mentioned before they shouldn't have cut up the battle at Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>*Didn't really like Aragorn's death, it was just an excuse to tack on the romance bits with Liv Tyler, which weren't very good to begin with, although I really liked the part where Elrond explains why the relationship is doomed to failure, showing Aragorn's death and all that.<br/><br/>*The film probably focused a little too much on the plight of Rohan, rather than the ring, after all the movie is called ""The Lord of the RINGS"". They also neglected the Merry, Pippin and Treebeard story line and didn't include things that would have been of interest from the book, like Treebeards house and the Ent-wives.<br/><br/>*The part where Aragorn and Gimili take on about 50 orcs on the bridge to Hornburg, that was completely unrealistic (even though it is a 'fantasy' movie)<br/><br/>*Gimili constantly being used as comic relief. The last film used him only slightly for this purpose (""No one tosses a Dwarf!""), which was great, but this film over did it... Gimili constantly lagging behind, falling off horses, getting crushed and having his height ridiculed just weren't that funny and got tiresome very quickly. *The big eye above Baradur. It looked a bit too cartoon-ish *Legolas surfing on a shield. Complete cheese.<br/><br/>Stuff I'm undecided on: *I'm still ambivalent to the character changes of Faramir. On one hand I understand why Peter Jackson decided to change him, but on the other I liked the idea that not every human could be so easily seduced by the ring.<br/><br/>
*The ents not realizing that the Isengard orcs were burning down forests until Merry and Pippin showed them. I understand that the main reason for changing this was so that Merry and Pippin would not appear to be completely useless, but it also compromises the fact that the Ents are among the oldest and wisest creatures in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>All in all a solid 9/10, although I have to admit I am biased and probably would give it 8/10-8.5/10 if I wasn't a LOTR fan. I would also like to add, that I can't believe that the Fellowship and Towers are rated so highly, they are excellent movies, but they are also full of flaws, as mentioned above."

","I haven't read any of the Lord Of The Rings books or ""The Hobbit"" either, but these movies have gotten me interested. I really hope I do, because it's hard for me to remember all the character's names, since like most names in fantasy stories, they're hard to remember.<br/><br/>The plot has thickened more from the last movie, because it's now not just everyone in a group. They're in seperate groups, and I think its a cool concept how the scenes shift from group to group. The battle scene(s) at the end were a very worthy climax. I especially like the scenes where Gollum was ""talking to himself"". It made it seem like two separte people were talking, on how they shifted Gollum/Smeagle from scenes at different angles. Very clever. I can't wait for ""Return Of The King"".<br/><br/>Although I'm kind of curious as how they were able to kill the guys and the hamster monsters they rode with just one arrow, it was still quite memorable. 8.5 out of 10."

","### SPOILERS ###<br/><br/>I've just seen this movie for the third time, and it just keeps getting better.  I always thought TTT would be the hardest book to adapt because of it's many different plot lines and position as the middle chapter of a very strongly linked trilogy.  But Peter Jackson has done a sensational job, with the finished product far outshining any of my expectations.<br/><br/>I loved the way Jackson chose to open the film, giving us a short reminder of a key scene from the first film then following it with a brief rundown of where each major character from the first film is, with some inspired editing helping this initial part of the film to flow much better.<br/><br/>Of course with any adaptation of this magnitude some details of the story will always have to be modified, but some major alterations (e.g. Aragorn dreaming of Arwen after he's floated down the river, the distracting and unnecessary appearance of Galadriel) left me a bit confused.<br/><br/>The acting once again is impressive all round.  I particularly liked Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf the White.  His added wisdom and austerity were spot on and I loved every scene he was in, particularly the one where he drives Saruman from King Theoden.  However for me the best performance of the movie was from Sean Astin as Sam.  His genuine, heartfelt portrayal of Frodo's loyal gardener, who would risk his life to save his mate, for me provided the most touching scenes of the movie which could have become fairly tacky in the hands of a less capable actor.  The single line that defined his performance for me was after Sam has saved Frodo from the Nazgul and is thanked by having Frodo's drawn sword stuck in his neck, when Sam says ""It's your Sam!  Don't you know your own Sam?""  That scene, and Sam's subsequent monologue totally defines the relationship between Frodo and Sam and in a way helps remind why their journey is the most significant in the whole trilogy.  I think Sean Astin seriously deserves to be recognized in a few weeks when Oscar nominations are announced.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a more than worthy follow up to one of the best movies of 2001, and an honourable adaptation of an awesome book. 10/10"

","One word:  Legendary<br/><br/>(ok maybe a few more....This film is the best visual film i have ever seen and i hope the extended DVD will be better.  Hard to describe such an enjoyable film but though it has a relatively simple plot, it has enough 'eye candy' to make it amazing.  A fine piece of art from Peter Jackson supported with strong roles from Aragorn and crew.  Refreshing to see a very good blockbuster that is not centralised around 'overexaggerated action' but incorporates memorable characters moments around the battles.  In a league of its own compared with the usual mass produced high concept Hollwood trash.   Well Done to the Kiwi's!"
"Bernnard_Black","10","0","0","20 January 2003"," Not the movie it should have been
","Sigh.  Since I was a kid, I've been waiting for someone to do a really great adaptation of the Lord of the Rings.  When Fellowship of the Rings came out last year, I thought ""this is it!  Finally!""  After seeing The Fellowship, I thought I was right...the movie I'd waited for was finally here.  So, when I went to see The Two Towers, I was totally shocked and dissapointed to see such a poor adaptation...indeed, save the names of the characters and the places, it has virtually nothing in common with the story JRR Tolkein wrote.<br/><br/>Now, I know that certain liberties have to be taken with a book in order to make it a film...that's part of the territory and I accept it.  But the rampant, wholesale changes made to key characters and plot elements in this film seem the work of someone that never even read the books, and has no respect for the story.  Major characters were completely and utterly changed...not just little changes, but changes that were core to their development.  Faramir, the noble brother of Boromir, is painted as little better than his brother.  In fact, the whole capture of Frodo and Sam and the forcing of them to go to Minis Tirith is in direct contrast with his actions in the book.  His nobility is gone, and for no discernable reason. The same can be said of King Theoden, who turns out to be an indecisive, weak and fearfull old man.  Not so in the books, and again, there seems to be no real reason for the change.  Worse still, the ents were changed, only attacking Isengard after being tricked by Merry and Pippin.<br/><br/>
These changes to major characters, in my opinion, hurts the story for no apparent gain.  Tolkein fans will be dissapointed to see these changes, and will wonder ""why"" just like I did.  The movie is visually stunning, and is entertaining.  But it's typical Hollywood, glamor and glitz effects entertainment, with a weak story and less than inspried acting on most parts.<br/><br/>Now, that being said, if there is ever going to be an Oscar given to a digital character, Gollum is that character.  The Gollum in the movie is stunning...his debates with himself are the high point of the film, and truly inspired.  This fact makes it all the more depressing that the director, who was able to create Gollum in such a convincing way, botched the rest of the film so badly."
"Nos402","Null","0","0","19 January 2003"," Another classic, but with some unnecessary liberties.
","So where to start. I'll start with the conclusion; Loved it. That is not to say I have no nits to pick. I'll get to those, but I just wanted to get it out of the way up front that I loved this movie, and it is a classic that stands far above the vast majority of movies. Now to the details.<br/><br/>I thought ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was as good of a movie version of the as was possible. Every change that was made, every part that was left out, I could totally understand why it was done. I'm pretty sure I even agreed with all the changes. I can't say the same about ""The Two Towers"". It was a bit slow to get going, and the flow and pacing was not as good as it could have been. There were definitely far more liberties taken this time around than on ""Fellowship"". Again, I'm not against liberties in principle, and sometimes they're even necessary to make a story work in the film medium, but some of the changes from the book just seemed pointless and unnecessary. Never the less, I found it enthralling, and destined to be a classic. I'm sure I will go to at least a few more showings, and will buy the DVD on the day of it's release. I just hope Peter Jackson and company pull in the reigns a bit for the next movie and don't get quite so loose with it. I never questioned anything about the first movie, but this one did leave a few criticisms with me. Still highly recommended though. I wait eagerly for ""Return of the King""."

Despite those minor quirks, I loved the movie in all it´s splendor. Now that I managed to get a great TTT DVD from the oscarsjury, I could watch and scrutinize every little scene and make my new judgment.<br/><br/>Well, the movie, on the whole, faired well during the transition between the silver screen and home entertainment. Fact is, several scenes became more clearer on a smaller screen.<br/><br/>I feel that I don´t have to recapitalize the story anymore that what has already been done here. The movie is one of the best of 2002, no argue about that.

"marperra","8","0","0","20 January 2003"," Great, but slightly inferior than The Fellowship
","All in all, a great movie, IMO the best of 2002 (not a great year for films, anyway...). Jackson is a real genius because he has taken a fairy story, that could mean nothing to the average guy, and has created a visual world around it, so wonderful and surprising that you're always wondering what you will see in the next minute. It's not only the special effects: the landscapes of New Zealand provide some of the most awe-inspiring scenes. The golden rule of Jackson is: when nothing very interesting happens, give something very interesting to see.<br/><br/>This rule is broken a little in the second hour, where the story goes on details without being very involving; there, for me, The Two Towers failed the perfect performance of The Fellowship (3 hours without a look to the watch!). But the last hours, with the two battle at Helm's Deep and Isengard, is the greatest visual experience of the year.<br/><br/>In this instalment, the most psychologically-complex character is introduced: Gollum. It is funny that a CGI creature could be more human than humans (Yoda immediately comes to mind). Gollum is destroyed by the power of the ring, but a part of him still hopes that other people's love and respect can redeem him. Gollum is so convincing because a real actor played his part, and CGI is superimposed on his body. This improves also the performances of Frodo and Sam, which don't seem to speak to themselves, as Obi-Wan talking to Jar-Jar. I don't think you can win an Oscar without ever showing your face, but I hope Andy Serkis will get a special award for his peculiar and wonderful performance.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Far less interesting than the first, and this road trip is honestly getting a wee bit long and tedious. A bunch of characters try to find each other, then they battle some and that's basically it. It goes nowhere. Gollum is almost but not quite as annoying as Jar-Jar and the talking trees are plain ridiculous. The hobbits are still charisma-less and the dwarf is way too much this time around in his desperate side-kick attempts. The last hour is worth the ticket, though. The final battle is tremendous, but the two first hours are at least one too much considering nothing really happens.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"
"dbost-2","Null","0","0","26 January 2003"," Here's my least favorite question: ""Well, did you read the books?""
","Yes, yes, Peter Jackson's second installment in this troll-filled trilogy is epic, it's huge, it's masterful, it's scary at times, it's an incredible blend of special effects and New Zealand landscapes, it's better than all the new Star Wars movies put together. It also contains, however, one of the most boring hours in recent cinema history: the epic-yet-deeply-personal-for-five-or-six-characters battle preparations sequence. Warning: no one will be admitted during any of the very important `So it has come to this war!' speeches delivered by somebodyorother. In this long, long, thudding hour, scenes are repeated, dialogue is switched around and re-spoken, and actors dressed as elves clearly expect to be taken seriously. <br/><br/>So, okay, fine, the whole movie's long. I've gotta get over that, right? But when I to, I found that it didn't make a lot of sense to me. Here are a few of my questions:<br/><br/><ul><li>If Gandalf is really that powerful, why can't he do more?</li></ul><br/><br/>
<ul><li>Where the hell did Gandalf go for most of the movie and how did he show up with thousands of soldiers at the end? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What was all that stuff with Frodo being kidnapped and taken to some city under siege? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If Helm's Deep is such a great place to go when under attack by Orks, why does it look more like everybody's backed themselves into a corner?</li></ul><br/><br/>
<ul><li>If those black riders are really that scary, why is it so easy to hide from them? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If the whole schtick of the tree characters is that they take their sweet time making decisions, how come they make the sudden decision to go to war when they see their forest has been wrecked? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why were there nine black riders on horseback in the first movie but now there's only one of them, and he's riding a dragon? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>What were the Two Towers? I guess they were the volcano and the other thing, or maybe the other thing and the totem pole they put Gandalf on in the first movie, but until the last moments of this movie, I never saw them together, and didn't really understand what would be so bad about just letting Christopher Lee build his damn towers. </li></ul><br/><br/>When I ask people these questions, their response is inevitably, `Well, did you read the books?' Hell, yes, I read the books and forgot them years ago, and don't change the subject. Nobody should need a bibliography to watch these movies. <br/><br/>I admit this much: the computer-generated Golem character is great. Undeniably great, so great that you forget he's computer-generated, so great you want him to be the main character, so great that it's worth the price of admission just to see him, so great that all the scenes he's in become the best scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>So, yes, it's better than the new Star Wars movies, and George Lucas should be very jealous of Peter Jackson. But at least the first couple of Star Wars movies had some genuine laughs in them, and didn't make you sit there for three and a half hours. <br/><br/>Knowing when to let your audience leave the theater is a big part of being a genius."

Of course Gollum had a very good performance as a CGI character and Gimli makes you laugh at times, so there is heart in it.<br/><br/>The fact that it didn't follow the book i had been warned about so that didn't effect me except one HUGE thing, to me anyway: The absence of Narsil in Aragorns hands.

I overeacted and said that it was bad but it isnt its just very overrated. So I had mixed feelings about seeing The Two Towers, but after I saw it I thought it was a huge improvement over the Fellowship. Now I have never read the books I just think these movies look really interesting.<br/><br/>The Two Towers still has excellent visual effects (like Fellowship did) and they put them to good measure in the movie. The Battle of Helms Deep was brilliantly directed and was probably the best battle in a fantasy movie. The other Battles were well shot, I really like the one at Isengrad with the trees vs. The Orcs. They also used their special effects to create Gollum who is by far the best CGI character ever made. The academy should make an exception and nominate him, he definitely deserves it. This will definitely win an Oscar for Visual Effects.<br/><br/>I think everything else in the movie was excellent, the Art direction, Cinematography and Costume are top notch. The Screenplay was much better too. I think it will get a Best Picture and Best Director, but sadly it wont win.

","Until 'The Two Towers' came out, I thought 'Road to Perdition' was the best movie I had seen for the year.  'The Two Towers' blows everything else away!<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has outdone himself.  When I saw trailers for 'Towers' I had the feeling it would be more of the same.  Not so!  The plot and character development are complex and fascinating.  Woe to those who haven't seen the first film, and know nothing about Middle Earth!<br/><br/>The battle at Helm's Deep is simply the greatest battle scene in movie history!  'Star Wars II' and its massive clone armies is sterile compared to this, and all other older movies with huge battle scenes now seem out of date.  <br/><br/>The buildup to this battle is tremendous, with fights and flights, hatred and wizardy, and moments of love and humor.  Many new characters are introduced (wait until you see Gollum!).<br/><br/>The cinematography in beautiful New Zealand is outstanding.  Helm's Deep looks as real as it possibly could.<br/><br/>The special effects are perfect!  This movie could not have been made as well even five years ago.  Gollum is the pinnacle of CGI! <br/><br/>
All credit must go to Peter Jackson, who has driven himself and his cast and crew to the breaking point, and come out the other side intact with a classic trilogy in hand (there is no way that 'Return of the King' can be stinker, so I feel confident using the word 'classic').<br/><br/>Remember when you saw the gee-whiz sheen and excitement of 'Star Wars' and then when you saw 'The Empire Strikes Back' you were taken deeper, got more involved, and realized you were witnessing epic history?  Same here, and on a grander, more mythical scale.<br/><br/>If 'Fellowship of the Ring' didn't win any major Oscars, then unfortunately 'Towers' won't either.  But it will be a shame if Peter Jackson is overlooked.  This trilogy will most certainly be the pinnacle of his career, and he deserves recognition for his awe-inspiring direction commitment.<br/><br/>This is grand filmmaking at its finest, and why we go to movies.  Make sure you see this on the big screen-- twice at least!"

"swengle-1","6","0","0","19 January 2003"," A Good Movie, Ruined by Glaring Flaws
","MANY SPOILERS<br/><br/>I loved Fellowship of the Ring.  I thought it was a classic film and a faithful adaptation of the spirit of the books.  The Two Towers is beautiful, as was FOTR, but it contains several serious flaws that make this movie more frustrating than enjoyable.  People appear averse to hearing a comparison of the movie to the books, so I will stick to criticism of the film.  The most glaring flaws in the film are:<br/><br/>1.  The resolution of the battle of Helm's Deep is not credible.  This is a major problem because Mr. Jackson has chosen this battle as the climax of his film.  We see literally 10,000 orcs on the plain in front of the fortress.  As they are about to breach the last defense, Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and a handful of others ride out into the fray.  At that moment, Gandalf appears on the other side of the army of orcs and charges in with what appear to be a couple hundred soldiers.  Now here is the problem:  in this situation, there is no way that Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas will live, and it doesn't appear that Gandalf can prevail given his limited numbers. Do 10,000 orcs, including hundreds of orc archers near Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, ALL turn around and face Gandalf, forgetting completely about Aragorn and crew?  It seems much more likely that some orcs will fight Gandalf (and kill him: I didn't think he would make it past the spears set in the front line), while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are pelted with literally thousands of arrows.  Mr. Jackson, apparently unable to resolve this problem, fades the scene out.  Not good enough.  This is the climax of the movie and it is not believable.  A fatal flaw for any picture.<br/><br/>2.  Because the battle of Helm's Deep is the climax, we must endure almost an hour of people preparing for that battle.  They shuffle out of the city, shuffle along through fields, shuffle into the fortress, get some weapons, and just generally stand around.  This build-up is too long.  Though the battle itself is impressively filmed, it cannot support this much film.<br/><br/>3.  The Ents, creatures who take half a day to pronounce someone's name, who have stood silently in the forest for thousands of years, decide suddenly to wreak havoc on Isengard because they see thirty feet of burned treeline. This is not in character at all.  Perhaps it was done this way to convince us that Merry has grown since FOTR.  Character development is a wonderful thing, but not at the expense of consistency in the behavior of other characters.  This moment makes the Ents, and Merry, look silly.<br/><br/>4.  Faramir's decision to drag Frodo to Gondor does not resolve itself well. How does watching Frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convince Faramir to allow Frodo to take the ring into Mordor?  If anything, he should conclude that Frodo is near the end of his rope and the ring should be in other hands.<br/><br/>These problems make the film ultimately unsatisfying to watch.  As a side note, all of these problems were caused by Mr. Jackson's decision to deviate from the books.  Here's hoping ROTK stays closer to the writings."
"iftekhar25","10","0","0","23 January 2003"," Definitely enjoyable.
","Having never read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, I can very safely say that my rating will be as a person who is rating this as a movie, and little more than a movie.<br/><br/>In general, the movie was absolutely terrific. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. The acting was wonderful, and dialogue that would have otherwise been somewhat cheesy, simply wasn't, because I think the acting really did cover up for it.<br/><br/>The special effects were out of this world. The last Helm's Deep battle sequence was absolutely glorious, and it's a surprise I managed to stay in my seat all throughout. I felt like I wanted to join them and kill a few Uruk-Hai! Simply marvellous.<br/><br/>The revival of King Theoden, however, seemed kind of hurried... as if there was a ""fix him up and get over with it"" attitude with the writer.<br/><br/>The Ents were wonderful. Amazing CG used to make them... but underdeveloped as I hear from some other reviewers. Having not read the book, I didn't understand the gravity of their going into battle... but knowing the time constraints of cinema halls who want the maximum number of viewings in a day, I sympathize with Peter Jackson's dilemma. Maybe he saved something for us in the Extended Edition.<br/><br/>Gollum is a true work of art. Having heard that CG artists were studying anatomy to get Gollum's structure up, I was really curious to see him, and it's true. I think they truly did study anatomy. Jar-Jar, for example, seemed totally amorphous, as if he had cartilage for bones, in Star Wars: Episode 1. Dobbie (or Dobby, or whatever) from the second Harry Potter is somewhat, slightly (only slightly) comparable in CG art to Gollum, but then... Gollum was a magnificently developed character and was probably the most complex character in the entire movie. Gollum deserves an Academy Award, actually!<br/><br/>That's a nice development in the movie industry, I think. CG characters are now given... character! Before they were just there for the eye candy, like with Jar-Jar Binks, who I didn't quite find as irritating as some people would say, but he just wasn't really relevant. But Gollum... marvellous.<br/><br/>
Maybe that's where Peter Jackson missed out with the Ents? Maybe he forgot to develop them as part of the drama because he knew they were going to be all CG? Maybe not. We'll have to see in the Extended Edition. Oh my, it's going to be a long wait. It was long enough with the Fellowship.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it, though. It was a human endeavour beyond any scale yet to be attempted, and so I greet a human effort with human enthusiasm. They say Helm's Deep took three months of night-time shootings in the mountains of New Zealand? They definitely deserve the credit."

The effects are stunning, although some of the more distant people or crowd scenes were a bit noticeable; none of it takes away from the story. The grand scenes are so visually and emotionally rich, you can't help but feel affected by them, I was moved at quite a few scenes. There were internal cheers, genuine sympathy for characters, and an overwhelming emotion as the riders charge down the hill.

"timberlax","10","0","0","18 January 2003"," A continuation of a beautifully told story
","The second part of the epic The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is simply the most spectacular film I have EVER seen. I won't say that this movie surpasses its previous part The Fellowship of the Ring because both films are simply the most brilliant piece of cinema to ever hit the big screen. FOTR established the characters and story and TTT engulfs the story and develops the characters further, as well as introducing new ones and reinforcing the threat of evil. The three titles The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers and The Return of the King are one continuous story. These films are meant to be represented the same way as Star Wars are. In TTT, from the landscape to the characters, this movie is simply stunning in its own time.<br/><br/>The characters fit right into the story through their emotional and physical features. Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, the most amazing CGI creation to be put on screen. He is so real and blends into the environment so seamlessly that after a while the audience forgets that he is animation and accept him as a real, physical character that shows no signs of falsity. Andy Serkis needs some Oscar attention there. The audience feels a real fear of the Uruk-Hai that have captured Merry and Pippin. The Ents are also quite impressive. These beings are believable and very true to what I visualized in Tolkien's words. The Wargs, the winged Nazgûl, the oliphaunts and the Balrog, now viewed more in detail, are extremely breathtaking. The new characters add to the story and progress it faster than before.<br/><br/>The music of the film is also perfect. From the opening of the Misty Mountains to the Battle of Helm?s Deep and the storming of Isengard, Howard Shore unquestionably deserves another Oscar for his spectacular work. The music of any film is vital to its feel and images portrayed in screen. It simply blew me away. The tone was just right and the volume as well. I couldn't find any faults in the score, which has never happened to me except when I watched the Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>The storming of Isengard and the Battle of Helm's Deep is what really took my breath away. These had got to be the biggest and best executed battles I have EVER seen! I would rather go see the movie again for this!<br/><br/>Yes the story deviated a bit from the book, but this is CINEMA - not related to literature. Faramir's changes were done so as people would believe him to be real. In the book, he just denies even looking at the ring - which seems pretty hollow for a character to evolve from in ROTK. The last five chapters of Book III were left out for ROTK. Otherwise, there wouldn't have really been a solid climax. So I am not distracted from the changes, unlike other people who take it all too seriously. PJ didn't have any contract or obligation that told him to follow the book. It's his interpretation and he has every right to do what he wants with this movie, that is telling a massive story through the world of cinema and still representing Tolkien, which is a hard thing to do with a story this complex. It took four decades to bring this trilogy to the screen and after five years of difficult work it's finally been done. A toast to you Mr. Jackson!<br/><br/>To sum it all up, don't miss this movie at any cost! Except, maybe if you haven't seen the first one, then see it NOW and then see TTT. Otherwise the plot and/or characters might be a bit confusing for you. Other than that, it's perfect cinema work.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this movie more than 10 stars, but that's as high as it goes! Well done Peter Jackson! I just CANNOT wait for The Return of the King...11 WHOLE MONTHS! It will, no doubt, be the biggest movie to hit the silver screen. Argue as much as you want but it's inevitable. The Return of the King is the most emotional of the three and will surely affect us all...<br/><br/>10/10 for TTT"

CGI was fine except for the trees where you could almost see the outline of Merry and Pippin (I don't care if I spelled their names wrong).

Peter Jackson is making a fortune off of these movies. Supposedly he doesnt want to make anymore but you really think i believe that. With all that money id make fifty more. It could be like Star Wars with a prequel. The Hobbit would be the perfect set up. I really believe that in the near future that this book will come to life. The Samarillion is another story. Im not too familiar with this one but i believe it has something to do with Lord of the Rings. That would be a good story to bring to life as well. I would hate to see Lord of the Rings just end. Im sure because of how great the new movie did that Peter Jackson will not pass up on doing the Hobbit even though he says he wont. I always said talk is cheap. Bring on the Hobbit!"

But obviously he´s a great director. ´cause what he did here is marvelous and deserves only full respect and admiration.

"rsaunders","10","0","0","17 January 2003"," the sound and the fury
","For most of a year I waited -- hardly able to contain myself -- for the second installment of the trilogy. The first film, while not flawless looks better and better the more I see it. The characterizations are rich, sensitive and nuanced, the narrative propulsive, the scenery lovely and Tolkien's words and ideas well represented (and embodied).<br/><br/>All that waiting and for what? Director Jackson has lost his way.<br/><br/>This is not Tolkien's Two Towers -- a fable that, among other things, sets out to demonstrate that/how even the smallest among us can change the world. These are not Tolkien's characters. In particular Theoden and Faramir -- two great characters with large roles to play in the proceedings -- are inexplicably cast in a poor light. The Ents -- while visually well rendered seem mostly to stand as bookmarks to hold Merry and Pippen while the film moves forward without them. Nor is it his story line. Fans know all of the deviations. The question is this: Why'd Jackson do it?<br/><br/>The Fellowship proved that Jackson and company were up to the task. But the Two Towers falls flat. Profitable, but flat. Why?<br/><br/>My theory is that Jackson and his producers got greedy. The first feature reached number five all-time on the international box office charts. Rather than celebrating their success with a stern commitment to a faithful rendering of Tolkien's books, Jackson et al. seem to have decided to see if they could do even better -- in the box office, that is. So they trimmed away less sexy characters (Theoden, for example), added more action and special effects, simplified the plot and, along the way, ceased to be about Tolkien's Two Towers.<br/><br/>It may play to huge numbers in search of great battle scenes but great filmmaking it ain't. Lots of sound and fury signifying nothing . . ."

","(MILD SPOILERS)<br/><br/>""I found the added love story between Aragorn and the elf-girl to be pointless, as there was no kind of relationship between the two in the books.""<br/><br/>Get over yourself, and read Appendix A. Better yet, start with reading the book. 'Elf-girl' indeed.<br/><br/>As to the movie, I can only say... WOW. I've read LOTR about five or six times in the past ten years, and I've dabbled into the lore of Tolkien quite a bit, and Peter Jacksons alterations are, to the contrary of what many purists say, merely trivial in the grand scheme of things. They do not detract from the story, they just make it more dramatic. See, in condensing a 1000 page book into 9-9.5 hours of movie, you're bound to have to spice some things up, and omit others:<br/><br/>You don't have 50 pages plus 50 more in Appendix F to explain why the elves are leaving, and to justify it, hence they'd seem terribly obnoxious, if not cowardly, if they just kept heading west. Thus, they come to the humans' aid in TTT.<br/><br/>Arwen and Aragorn get married in ROTK, and the audience would be pretty surprised at her arrival if she only showed up in act 4 of movie 3.<br/><br/>Theoden King can't hurry off to Helm's Deep to bravely fight the Orc army while the Rohirrim peasants head off to Dunharrow - it's near impossible to explain on screen why the orcs don't just march past said Helm's Deep and sack Dunharrow. And you'd have even more cuts between various locations, confusing the uninitiated to great lenghts.<br/><br/>Faramir is less nice than in the book because, in the book, he's as nondramatic a character as can be. Shows up, let's Frodo go. You can't NOT have Faramir, to stay true to the book, but you can't have him act exactly the same or you'll risk people falling asleep over the lack of any drama or tension in the whole encounter.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie ends just a bit before the book ends in order to avoid overcomplicating the story, and totally destroying the pacing of the narrative. 'Yay, victory, now, before the credits, let's march to Isengard and talk to two hobbits looting Saruman's warehouse, smoking Old Toby'. 'Lest the audience thinks the film is over, we'll have Sam and Frodo meet their last great foe before getting to Mount Doom, conveniently making Return of the King a 1.5 hour documentary on two hobbits walking slowly towards a volcano'.<br/><br/>Not to mention that one of the major villains (Saruman), has to be disposed of somehow, and since the Scouring of the Shire would be the epitome of cinematic anticlimax, it's going to have to be done in Isengard, which adds even more importance to the other half of the Fellowship (who are, might I add, getting together with Merry and Pippin again) going to Orthanc, and seriously, you can't add all that to the end of a Two Towers movie, after the incredibly well done Helm's Deep siege. It just doesn't work.<br/><br/>Everyone who says they know how to make a better screen adaptation than Peter Jackson, while keeping truer to the book, please write a screenplay, act it out with the help of storyboards, and time your effort. You'll get a 5 hour movie which would make maybe 50 million worldwide, theatrically.<br/><br/>Wait for the Extended Edition, and wait for Return of the King before you pass judgement. All I can do for my own part is thank heavens for the genius of Peter Jackson et al. These movies are the greatest piece of cinema ever made, bar none."

","TTT had a different feel than FOTR. Gone was the magic which accompanied the first movie. Yet, TTT was just as good in its own way.

It didn't disappoint me in the least.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers *** Among my favorate parts were Gandalf's battle with the Balrog at the beginning, Gollum's appearance (who could forget him?), the king's transformation when Gandalf expelled the ""curse"" on him, the look of disbelief on Wormtongue's face when he found out how massive the army was that Suraman intended to launch against the people at Helm's Deep to exterminate them, the Battle at Helm's Deep, the ents' reactions then they saw the cut-down trees at Isengard, the ents' wasting of Isengard...I could go on and on.<br/><br/>Of course, there were flaws which kept this from being a perfect movie, but what movie has ever been perfect?<br/><br/>I consider this, along with the first movie, by far he best I have ever seen in the fantasy genre. Maybe not the best of all time, but very good. Peter Jackson deserves a lot of kudos for creating these movies from what was once considered an unfilmable story.<br/><br/>There's a lot to pack into the final movie, as the second movie ended at a point before the second book did. Perhaps the regulators won't allow the final movie to go beyond the length of the previous two. In view of that, PJ and New Line Cinema might benefit by breaking the final movie into two parts, each two hours or so long, in order to get everything in so as to not to rush the final part of the trilogy. One could be shown near the end of 2003, the other near the end of 2004. But, as that's unlikely to happen, I'll just wait a year in anticipation for the final movie, which should complete the trilogy. If the final movie as as good as the previous two, it will likely be the top or among the top trilogies ever to be put on film. Certainly the most popular."

","First of all, this story is a daunting task for any director to approach. Yes, there are scenes missing.  Yes, lines get switched around from character to character.  Yes, Jackson does create scenes that Tolkien never even imagined.  The stories in the movie don't even follow what's in the book at times.  But, even through all Jackson's idiosyncrasies, like many of us, he is a fan of Tolkien and his books.  All artists want to put their stamp on their creations.  If we were in the same situation, we would've done the same thing.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten that out of my system I can talk about The Two Towers.<br/><br/>We must remember that this is only the middle part of one long epic saga. Imagine yourself walking into the middle of a movie and having to leave before it is done.  That is essentially what this film is.  Peter Jackson is doing something here that has never been done in film history before.  It is a continuation of a great adventure that has long been in the imagination of many Tolkien fans for the last 50 or so years.<br/><br/>I knew even before this film opened that I was only going to get so much from The Two Towers.  Aragorn beginning to assume his kingship, Legolas and Gimli setting aside their differences and becoming great friends, Merry and Pippen, though hobbits and little folk, finding the courage to stand against the growing dark forces, the Rohirram, the Battle at Helm's Deep, the downfall of Sauruman's army, the march of the Ents, Frodo and Sam's encounter with Gollum, and Gollum leading them into Mordor.  That is what I knew I was going to get in The Two Towers.<br/><br/>To me, it is the evolution of these characters and how they all change from The Fellowship of the Ring to The Two Towers and eventually on through The Return of the King that carry this story.  As we will see, all the characters I've mentioned won't even resemble who they were to begin with. They will all have grown.  We fans, who have watched from the beginning till the end will have felt like a part of this growth. That is the beauty of this film.  That is what Peter Jackson is trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>I believe it is an injustice to judge a movie until you've seen it all. This movie is not yet finished.  It is only after The Return of the King that I feel any comments, reviews, awards, criticism, or anything of that sort, will be justified.  As for the ending of this great epic, I'd like to leave a line from the movie. ""There is always hope.""

"cymric","Null","0","0","16 January 2003"," Outstanding, with minor gripes
","Warning: contains spoilers.<br/><br/>I had made the dire mistake of leafing through the first book prior to seeing the first movie, and was determined not to repeat that mistake again. Your mind becomes so bent on following the story in your head with the aid of what you see, you only notice the alterations and not the movie, causing irritation. There are better ways to spend your money and time.<br/><br/>
So with nothing but a general idea of what happened in the second book, I went to 'The Two Towers' and enjoyed it immensely. You are less surprised by the special effects (with the exception of Gollum, who is masterfully rendered) as you've already had a taste from the first movie. Instead I found myself focusing on what I was shown, and boy, did I ever get the impression the situation was next to hopeless! The battle for Helm's Deep is magnificent. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and just when you think things couldn't have gotten any worse, they do. And again. And yet again. The atmos-fear, beautifully portrayed, is catching. You're kept on a slow boil. Good guys as well as bad guys die. My shirt was plastered to my back at the end, and it has been a long time since any movie has been able to do *that*.<br/><br/>The rendering of Gollum is incredibly lifelike. You instinctively loathe Gollum, but pity Smeagol. You wonder if there is more to Frodo's decision to trust the creature---perhaps because he sees Gollum as what he may himself become one day? The scenes where it becomes all too clear that Gollum is a text-book case of Ring-induced MPD, are chilling. And Frodo definitely isn't a happy Hobbit anymore. Oh dear ...<br/><br/>It comes as a bit of a surprise that the best human character in this movie is Theoden. The old King of Rohan, nearly defeated by Saruman and his sidekick Grima, awakens from his dark slumber, finding himself in dark times he hoped he would never see. Yet he keeps on going, hating what he sees, what he is forced to do, but doing it nonetheles. He has his life, but more importantly his people to lose; Aragorn and the others just their lives. This responsibility weighs heavily, and it is portrayed with skill and devotion.<br/><br/>Some gripes then. I found the ending of the movie to be rather hurried. The battle at Helm's Deep is over in a flash once the cavalry arrives. Treebeard sees the devastation brought onto the forest by Saruman, howls a bit, and within moments the other Ents appear as if by magic and go to battle. The cleansing of Isengard is epic if somewhat short, but absolutely spoilt by the way Saruman is prancing about on his balcony. And if I were Sauron, I'd feed a particular Nazgul to the dogs for just leaving the Ring in the hands of the enemy. These things could have been so easily avoided you cannot help but wonder what was going on during the editing stage. Minor gripes, but considering the rest of the story is woven together so masterfully...<br/><br/>Nevertheless: Go see this movie. Forget there's a book, forget there once has been a man named Tolkien. Just let yourself be immersed into the story as it is shown to you. You won't regret it."

Even if it's not in the book, I know Jackson takes a few liberties when he deems it appropriate, and its hard to imagine that his co-writing wife doesn't get frustrated sometimes.  This was definitely the most influential film of last year, beamed out to hundreds of millions of people all over the globe who seem to think the story line has contemporary relevance, yet it perpetuates an old-fashioned and helpless female image...even while chicks are on their way to the Gulf!!"

","I've now seen The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers four times.  It is the best film ever made.<br/><br/>I've read the books but liked the movies better because I do not have a Tolkien fetish.<br/><br/>These were the greatest battle scenes ever filmed.  <br/><br/>I found Two Towers very spiritual and uplifting.   The scenery was breathtaking, the music superb as was the acting.<br/><br/>I think many of the negative comments are written by people who like to knock a movie that is so popular.  Popular movies can have no merit because, according to the nitpickers, the ""masses"" can't like a really good film.<br/><br/>Don't listen to them.  Go see this and come away a better person."
"zengun","Null","0","0","16 January 2003"," it's so big let's beat up on it (for those who've seen it)
","There's no need to praise a movie that's currently #12 in the IMDB top 250 -- obviously it's a must see. You wouldn't miss it any more than you would the early Star Wars series (in it's time). So while I definitely enjoyed it, and while I agree with most of the praise re. the computer graphics (wow!) and also some improvement in the acting over FotR (especially Wood's Frodo -- but stop biting your nails, dude, that's a bad habit.) Still I did find some things disconcerting and detracting from the illusion of a sojourn to Middle Earth.<br/><br/>Vaguely in order of ascending distraction:<br/><br/>(NO PLOT GIVEAWAYS, BUT SPOILERS OF A SORT.)<br/><br/>1. Too much panning -- I started feeling like I was on a merry-go-round. The camera never stops zooming hither and thither. Every character and every setting doesn't have to be shown from all angles. This is not The Matrix. Similarly, too much slow motion. And when is slow mo EVER good? (Except in The Matrix.)<br/><br/>2. Too many long battle scenes. This was a defect of the trilogy itself also IMO. (Like many others here, I've read it twice.) Epic stories are about heroes not ""history"". They could have profited from studying Ben Hur, where battles are well meshed with story development. Anyway, to counter this impersonal aspect, they have all the main characters within shouting distance of each other in spite of the clamor, confusion and scale of the battle -- requiring another suspension of disbelief. And two wrongs don't make a right.<br/><br/>3. Regarding abridgement, the 1st half was confusing. The fact that I read the books made some things understandable, and other things more confusing. The excuse for this, oft repeated, is that there wasn't time to clarify the storyline -- yet there was plenty of time for endless battle scenes which did little to further the plot.<br/><br/>4. Re. Elven/human soft-focus face sucking, another lapse. Here, even a smooch is too much nevermind sticky lips and suspected tongue. It's not Tolkien, and it's not needed. This is about peaceful and brave little hobbits vs. monstrously evil and militaristic wizards. Females of Middle Earth are ethereal and distant and often have magic powers, or at least can weild a sword. You love them, you fear them, but you don't you-know-what them. This is supposed to be an escape from all that.<br/><br/>6. Worse than lip gobbling -- a joke about dwarf tossing! God! Serious gaff. This is magical fantasy. Anything for comic relief? Fine, but don't jar us from Middle Earth into the 70's blue collar bar scene! Note: The Dwarves of Middle Earth are an ancient and proud race of their own. The last thing you want to do is link them with human dwarfism. Jeez. Get with the FANTASY.<br/><br/>7. Explosives! I do not recall explosives in the book, though I admit it been many years since I read it. But this is Sword and Sorcery, not Sword and Chemistry. You see that thing go off? Tell me, if they knew the opposition had high explosives, would they have been yapping about their great Keep? It raises all kinds of questions. Why didn't they lob the explosives into the keep with catapults, or have the black riders drop them from 6000 feet? For that matter, why didn't Saruman just manufacture cruise missiles instead of those moronic Evil Dead part II look-alikes (and where'd they get those growling sounds -- an old Tarzan movie?)<br/><br/>End of gripes.<br/><br/>Star Wars had problems too. And of course there will only be 3 of these, so we don't have to worry about it hanging around the movie industry like a millstone for the next century -- right? Right?"
"BlackStrain","7","0","0","16 January 2003"," This movie is terrible.
","I don't understand how many users are heralding this film as the greatest of all time.  It's filled with horrible dialogue, gaping plot holes and melodrama.  This isn't a good movie, its just an expensive one.  Without the expensive special effects, there would be nothing at all to compliment this movie on.<br/><br/>Major spoilers follow:<br/><br/>The Ents:  Theres no end to the problems I had with the ents.  First off, where the hell did they all come from when Treebeard shouted.  Were there a hundred Ents waiting on the other side of the trees?  And if so, why was Treebeard so shocked when he saw how many trees had been cut down. Shouldn't news of something like that have spread amongst the ents fairly quickly?  If a large chunk of your town got blown up I'm sure the news would get around.<br/><br/>Gimli:  So how tall is Gimli exactly?  Because the movie changed its mind several times throughout.  At one point he was a head shorter than Legolas but the battlement scene had him significantly shorter than that simply for the sake of a joke.  Jokes are another problem I had with Peter Jackson's use of Gimli.  That's ALL he was used for, comic relief.  Nearly every second of screen time that Gimli had was supposed to be funny.  Why didn't they just give him a clown costume.<br/><br/>This isn't the greatest movie of the year and it certainly isn't the greatest of all time yet for some reason its fighting for first on the top 250.  Every time I ask someone why they thought it was a great movie I get mostly the same answers.  ""The special effects were great!"" Yes, they were but special effects alone dont make a good movie.  If you handed anyone three hundred million dollars I'm sure they could make a movie with good special effects but not neccesarily a good film."

","OK first things first - I've never read any of these books. I tried to read The Hobbit when I was a lot younger, but it was just too much, and that's as far as I ever got with Tolkien's work. I went to see The Fellowship of The Ring, because my boyfriend wanted to see it and I thought that as everyone was raving about it I would have a look. I was bored out of my skull and said that I wouldn't bother going to see the Two Towers and that was the end of it. Anyway, The Two Towers came out and everyone was raving about it and my boyfriend wanted to go and see it and for a long time I told him I wouldn't go with him. In the end I felt sorry for him because nobody wanted to go along with him, so off I went last night in a positive state of mind thinking it can't be worse than the first one. But it was! Frodo (Elijah Wood) only ever manages one facial expression and all the characters just sounded as though they were parrotting the story straight out of the book for the benefit of all the Tolkien anoraks. About half way through, I bundled up my coat on the arm of my seat, got comfortable and had a sleep - I'm not exaggerating.  True the film's special effects are great, but there is no feeling to this film at all to back them up. It just felt like one long cash in to me. Sorry to offend the die hards but the Lord of The Rings story does not make a good movie."

","Now I must admit, despite being an avid reader, I have never read any of the books.  These movies, especially ""The Two Towers"" have inspired me to read ""The Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and ""The Hobbit.""  Though I enjoyed the first movie, when it was over I was ready to leave the theater.  With ""The Two Towers"" I could have stayed for another three hours.  I was throughly engrossed in it and I think that the special effects were used to enhance the story rather than dominate it.  The final battle scene was incredible. Many people commented on some of the flaws of the battle scene, I won't comment on them.  I will only say that it was obvious that an incredible amount of detail went into creating a scene that is destined to become a Hollywood classic.  I can't wait to see the final movie.  Unlike Dune (by David Lynch), which was visually stunning, but difficult to follow if you hadn't read the book; this series has invested the time and the money to satisfy someone who hasn't read the them.  And I will definitely read the books."
"tux_penguin","9","0","0","15 January 2003"," Very impressive, but one frustrating change (spoilers follow)
","I was generally very impressed by this adaptation of the book. Gollum was very well done, and the character development and interactions were much better here than in the first movie.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the fact that certain changes had been made. For example, I was pleasantly surprised that Arwen was given more of a role and was generally a better developed character in the movies. Also, I thought it was a fun and interesting addition to have Elven warriors show up for the battle of Helm's Deep and it was perfectly believable within the context of the story. I was less impressed with the addition of the battle with the orc riders where Aragorn is presumed dead, but I didn't mind too much.<br/><br/>What actually really bothered me was the dramatic change in Faramir's character. In the book, even if he is momentarily tempted by the Ring, he never attempts to force Frodo to follow him to Gondor or anywhere else. He's different from his brother Boromir. I was very disappointed by this alteration. Faramir is one of my favorite characters, and I felt he was unjustly portrayed.<br/><br/>I was confused as to why the movie did not end with Frodo presumed dead in Shelob's Lair. If the added bit where Faramir goes out of character were to be removed, I'm sure there would have been space for Shelob.<br/><br/>The Ents weren't quite as I imagined them. I always thought they were much thicker. However, that's simply quibbling. The altered Ent Moot and so on was not a big deal, and it was too bad there were no Hurons at Helm's Deep, but I didn't really feel that loss either.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an extremely enjoyable adaptation. The images, sounds, and character interactions were very impressive, and the battle scenes were a lot of fun. I just wish Faramir had been more fairly portrayed."

","What do you expect if you are going to watch The Two Towers? A perfect literature adaptation? A perfect action loaded fantasy-epic? A role-play-like character-development-story? It is none of that. It is the perfect synthesis of all. This movie combines all you can imagine in Tolkiens fantasy world. It is Tolkiens world. It describes the pessimism of all inhabitans in middleearth, the pure evil that would destroy everything. And the one, who can turn everything into light.<br/><br/>Of course, it is not perfect. There are literature sequenzes, which you can not adapt to a film. Who wants to see a scene taking hours of discussion - like in the book - with Theoden and Gandalf about the fate of Rohan? Within this scene, Peter Jackson improved as well as in other scenes.<br/><br/>There can not be a discussion about the special effects- they are genius. But all those effects just help to tell the story. All characters loose something, just like within the book. In others- Jackson and his writers did not improved well. There is a plenty of work to do within the TWO TOWERS, but we did not see the last third of the book. But what we had to see is a redundant dying of characters and a love story, which is absoltuly unnecessary. To cut a long story short - unimportant. All in all this film is a phenomenon. It is worth to see for people who love the book, and people who never read it (but saw the first part!). It can not fulfill the fantasies of readers who see a mistake where a film cannot adapt a book. But this film is a cineastic storm- it affects you even if you are attached to your glass of water."

","A good movie but it changes the story from the book for no apparent reasons. Too many scenes were added or done differently from the book that made this movie disappointing. While I found it visually satisfying, I found myself getting more and more disenchanted due to the story changes, most of which added nothing to the story.<br/><br/>The love story between Arwen and Aragorn never happened. Saruman may have had Theoden's ear through Wormtongue but he never controlled him as the movie portrayed. Eomer was an integral part of the Battle of Helm's Deep and Edoras was never deserted for that battle. The Ents (and the Hurons) played a much better role in the book. I am sure I could continue with this list.<br/><br/>However, I did find the character of Gollum to be the BEST part of the movie. It was well generated and the conflicts that arose between Gollum and Smeagol were wonderful.<br/><br/>In the end though, if you want to truly appreciate Lord of the Rings in all of it's splendor, read the book. Once you are done re-read it again and see what you missed the first time. You won't be disappointed."

","Major deviations from the book. The sad thing is that most of them take plot out of the film instead of adding to it. There was no need for instance for poor Theoden to be mentally substituted by Saruman himself (does that mean Saruman could multitask?). A mere plot by his treacherous consultant, finally exposed by Gandalf would do (as in the book). What about this semi romantic and semi metaphysic scene with the elven woman? How does it stick to the plot and what's the relevance with book 2? Nor was it necessary for Gimli and Aragon to anihilate hundreds of orcs, just on their own. And where was that huron tree intervention to save the Helm's Deep? Frankly, I had this feeling I was watching a set of visually impressive video clips, due to the very loose plotline. And that can get tiresome after an hour. Especially since I was waiting for much more.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, visual effects got better, film got worse (Gandalf looks much worse too).<br/><br/>I wonder why second sequels are often worse. Let us hope third gets better."
"MITCH!","8","0","0","15 January 2003"," Overwhelming AND Underwhelming?
","Give a man a tower and he'll see across a kingdom; give a man two towers and he'll be blinded by special effects.<br/><br/>I'll admit I've never read the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which may render my commentary meaningless to diehard fans of the series. However, I'll give Peter Jackson loads of credit for his job on the first two adaptations. Thus far, I can't say I've seen any other film positing itself as an ""epic"" lately and actually FELT like I was seeing an epic. From the hordes of armies and the bombastic, poetic dialogue to the expanses of New Zealand that serve as the beautiful, majestic Middle Earth, Jackson and his dedicated creative team have done a superb job in recreating a world that I know many people love dearly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, as a film, The Two Towers (and to some extent The Fellowship of the Ring before it) leaves me wanting for something. It's hard to believe because there's so much THERE -- drama, archetype, huge battle sequences, lush cinematography, incredible special effects -- but I came away from the film feeling empty, like I'd just seen a gorgeous work of art that didn't speak to me personally. Some might say this is because I haven't read the books; I claim the opposite. I think what I'm missing is a sense of inclusion, of characters, of personal moments. These are the things that make me ""connect"" with any film, and which I didn't see in The Two Towers. If I sense them lacking, and I haven't even read the books, I can only imagine how half-empty the serious fans of the story are, in that they probably come into the theater expecting every nuance of Tolkien's 1000-odd pages to come to life onscreen and leave wondering where all their favorite moments were.<br/><br/>The first film had the luxury of being based around interpersonal relationships among the Fellowship members, and Frodo's reluctance to be a hero, Bilbo's mixed feelings about the ring, Gandalf's weary wisdom, etc. All character traits, character moments -- building blocks of conflict and story. Here, the conflict is primarily external -- Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli must help the people of Rohan defend themselves from a swarm of orc soldiers as a show of force, good standing strong against the onslaught of evil. The character moments, particularly those between Aragorn and nearly anyone else, feel forced and artificial primarily because they occur opposite underdeveloped characters seemingly introduced solely to further the plot or embody elements of the theme (Rohan's king in particular) rather than being integral parts of the story. Why Rohan? Why not any other city, any other characters? Why would Aragorn be so easily swayed from his original love as to develop eyes for another? It seems like a plot device, not a natural occurrence.<br/><br/>Even the comedic moments, especially those between Legolas and Gimli, are unnatural. The elf and dwarf are reduced to comedic foils, buddy characters, recipients of exposition and mood-lightening one-liners. Surely the bravest representatives of their races can do more than play second fiddle to Aragorn, yet they're given no chance here. They fade into the background, except for gratuitous and suspiciously out-of-tone (and character) comments and actions (Legolas on a medieval snowboard?).<br/><br/>Finally, there's the redundancy and disinterest of the alleged central plot, that of Frodo, Sam and Gollum transporting the ring to Mount Doom. Never before has the main conflict of a story taken a backseat to a subplot (Aragorn and the defense of Helm's Deep) and been so welcome. Every time the film cut back to Frodo I became increasingly bored. It may be because Elijah Wood is reduced to playing a primarily one-note character at this point, given that his rational thought and will are eroding throughout the tale. Or maybe it's the frustration I felt at seeing them so close to gates of Mordor, only to have them decide to go COMPLETELY AROUND the main entrance to approach from a ""hidden entrance,"" which smacks of plot device. Call it theme; I call it flat story. And I'll say nothing of the rest of their end of the film, which features no conflicts we haven't already seen, paired with characters we're asked to care about prematurely, except that their final scene onscreen is a mirror image of the Frodo-Sam bonding moment at the end of Fellowship -- are there no fresh angles to this plotline?<br/><br/>The Merry and Pippin subplot exists solely to topple another subplot, the tower of Sauruman. I'm sure the themes involved were more clearly stated in the book; here, they feel tacked-on. The film could have existed without them and been perfectly engaging, if not moreso, since we'd have no momentum-killing cuts from Helm's Deep to the langorous Ents, talking (for comic relief).<br/><br/>The special effects are remarkable. The detail is commendable. The movie as a whole is impressive. But the attention to detail cannot overcome what for me is a lack of basic plot and character, deficiencies that hamper the aftertaste of the film. As everyone knows, special effects will never be able to replace a solid, coherent, emotionally engaging story, which the original trilogy likely is and which seems to be at least partially lost in the translation to the screen."

","Everyone seems to have many great and not so great things to say regarding this movie. Like most anybody else after FOTR I was left with an intense wanting for the movie to continue. Even after my butt went numb from sitting in that theater seat for 2 1/2 hours. Most people must understand that the first film was of building the characters so that non LOTR fans would be able to understand the second and third films.<br/><br/>That being said, Holy cow, this movie truly was amazing. I am of the same belief that Legolas should not have done the XXX (movie) Tony Hawk shield slide down the stairs. Gimli's comic relief was welcomed on the lines regarding running across country and the line regarding being tossed by Aragorn. It tied the stairs scene from FOTR. They could have left out the part where he falls off the horse and the ""shall I describe it our should I get you a box"" Those were not needed. Well maybe the horse one helps explain why he always is riding shotgun.<br/><br/>Well Gollum was a special effects AAA+++. The only flaw was in the fight scene with Frodo and Sam when Gollum spins on the blanket. It just looked staged. But other than that Gollum should be nominated for his spilt personality arguement scene. That was hilarious and explained Gollum to the new LOTR fan very well. So how about that Helms deep battle. Is it just me or did Peter Jackson really like seeing heads being whacked off in these movies or what. Ok how many others out there thought that when they saw the Ent with his head on fire and plunges it into the rushing dam water thought it gave you a flashback to Micheal Jackson and the Pepsi commercial from the eighties where his hair caught on fire.<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin really didnt get much in this movie but they'll get there chance in ROTK later this year.<br/><br/>My hats off to the score for both films. I own both and they are fantastic. Look for the London symphony orchestra they have a CD with music inspired by the films. But if I were rating score alone the FOTR was better. The Hobbit tune is great. But then the Gollum song on TTT was wickedly dark and exciting.<br/><br/>Well I have seen TTT 9 times since it opened and will probably see it at least half a dozen more before it leaves the theaters."

","***CONTAINS VERY MILD SPOILERS***<br/><br/>First of all, I must say I haven't seen the first movie and haven't read the books, so maybe some will discard my views, but I think it lends me the advantage of judging this purely on its cinematic merits, of which I'm sad to say there are not that many. The scenes were disjointed and I would bet that at least twenty minutes could have been shaved off its length by not resorting to sweeping scenic views every two minutes - at times it looked like a commercial by the New Zealand tourist board. Nothing in the actors' performances made me care about their fate. When Elijah Wood (as Frodo) tries to show moral turmoil, he looks like a guy trying to remember where he left his diary. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) seems to think that staring into the distance conveys intensity - it doesn't. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) is the only saving grace, performance wise, but his main scenes arrive far too late in the day, by that time I was bored out of my tree.<br/><br/>My main problem with the film is actually the same thing many people name as their favourite aspect - Tolkien painstakingly created this alternate world, but that's what bogs the film down and prevents it from exploding into action - so much time is wasted explaining things, and in the end, none of it is grounded in reality, which makes it very difficult to care about the outcome of the story.<br/><br/>The only moment of gravitas in the entire picture comes just before the battle of Helms Deep, but is utterly ruined by some lame jokes from the Jah-Jah Binks of the piece - Gimli. Just when the solemn weight of what is about to be decided (we are told) is making an impression, the one-liners destroy any sense of impending significance. If it was an attempt at brave gallows humour on the frontline, it failed miserably.<br/><br/>I don't really blame Peter Jackson for this mess of a film - he could have made a movie that was 45 minutes shorter, fewer wasted scenes and less aimless meandering - but that would have seemingly meant deviating from the plot of the book, and that was obviously judged to be too big a risk given the project's obvious money-making ability with the millions of diehard Tolkien-ites.<br/><br/>Overall: 4/10 (marked generously due to the constraints of filming such a long and tiresome story)"

","`This grand epic  this is the first film of the modern age that dares to dream a DeMille dream a D.W. Griffith dream a Kurosawa dream.' Harry Knowles  Ain't It Cool News<br/><br/>Certain films are born from a special source, from the deepest imagination, from dreams and visions. More than stories, they are icons of life itself and the experience of what it is to be human in our world. It is King Kong standing on the top of the Empire State Building, it's Errol Flynn coming down from a tree in the Adventures of Robin Hood, it's Gary Cooper in the middle of an empty city in High Noon. We can't explain it, but we recognize it in Gene Kelly singing in the rain, in Hitchcock's birds and Splielberg's flying bycicles. And we recognize it because they're the expression of what is of more intimate in human emotion, of joy and fear, of sorrow, of redemption...<br/><br/>It is a dream I had, when I was young, that I would see Middle Earth with my very own eyes, someday. But for many long years, The Lord Of The Rings remained with a red stamp on the cover: `Impossible'. How could cinema breed life to the landscapes of Tolkien, larger than the horizon, or to it's talking trees, or to the largest and fearsome battles ever imagined by an author. And while we waited, hidden as the One Ring lost for centuries, the myth took shape. In the New York subway walls someone wrote `Frodo Lives'. And the dream grew in silent whispers, in the paintings of John Howe and Alan Lee, in unknown fan clubs and the dedicated imagination of millions of readers. Peter Jackson embraced this myth and attempted to translate the iconography of Middle Earth into the big screen. The final result is overwhelming, the product of impressive dedication and effort, incomprehensible to those who do not share the love for fantasy. But there it is, from the projector light, that all the beauty and grandeur of this ancient world comes to life. Here are Tolkien's themes, the corruption of absolute power, the value of friendship, the inevitability of growth, the strength of hope. Here we are, launched in the eloquence of a long journey of discovery through the deepest of ourselves, recognized in Gandalf's immortal words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the future, and have a part to play in the destiny of all.<br/><br/>This is the Middle Earth, a place that lives in that world of dreams created from the same fabric of The Wizard Of Oz and Peter Pan. It is the hobbit Frodo in the world of darkness facing an eye of fire, it is Gandalf surrounded in light leading an army charging thousands of Uruk-Hai. It is a landscape that breeds, timeless, that makes us dream. Because we have all been there, in our childhood, when we were afraid of the dark or believed we could fly. Cinema, the great cinema, is not the rollercoaster we embark on with a bucket of popcorn. The greatness of cinema lies in Gollum's conflict, in our ability to believe that this being massacred by the greatest of torments can still find peace, even though we know the inevitable. And how it is great, how magical, that this ingenuity remains and is alive today in the movie theater.<br/><br/>It is a dream I had, that I would see Middle Earth with my very own eyes, someday. Lucky for me, that in the movies, sometimes dreams come true."

","I understand that many people don't think it is a valid criticism to say that this movie doesn't follow the book.  So let's set aside the book and look at this movie as a movie.  While it is beautifully shot and the acting is roughly equivalent to the first film, The Two Towers fails at crucial moments.  For example (SPOILERS):<br/><br/>1.  First, and most important, the end of this film is not believable. The battle of Helm's Deep is a complete rout.  There are literally 10,000 orcs out on the plains in front of the fortress, and Aragorn decides to ride out with 10 men on horseback?!?  Then we see Gandalf up on a hill about 1/2 mile away, on the other side of the orc army, charging forward with what appears to be a couple hundred men.  The way this battle is staged, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli must die.  I didn't think Gandalf would make it past the first row of spears set in the ground.  And are we supposed to believe that 10,000 orcs, including numerous archers who are standing within 100 yards of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, all turn around and completely ignore our heroes when Gandalf charges?  Isn't it a tad more likely that our heroes are immediately pelted with thousands of arrows?  This battle is insulting to the audience's intelligence.  Mr. Jackson fades the battle out, as he must, because there is no way that the forces of good are going to win.  This is not a minor problem.  Mr. Jackson has chosen to make the battle at Helm's Deep the climax of this film.  The fact that this climax is not credible is a serious flaw in this film, and one that I just couldn't overlook.<br/><br/>2.  Mr. Jackson's decision to use the battle of Helm's Deep as the climax of his film meant that he had to spend an inordinate amount of time showing people shuffling toward the fortress, shuffling into the fortress, sitting in alley ways, getting weapons, missing Aragorn, rejoicing when Aragorn comes back . . . .  There is no real action or character development going on during this hour of screen time.  This build up could have been replaced with something more essential to the storyline.<br/><br/>3.  Treebeard and the other Ents take half a day to pronounce someone's name.  They have stood in the forest for thousands of years and seen countless trees fall and be destroyed.  Yet, for some reason, they rashly decide to wreak havoc on Saruman because he has destroyed what looks to be about 50 feet of treeline.  Not very consistent with their character, so why do they do it?  The only reason I could discern is that Mr. Jackson wants us to think that Merry has done something clever for once.  This thin reed of justification cannot support such an obvious break from character.<br/><br/>4.  Aragorn being dragged over the cliff by a worg served two obvious purposes.  First, we get to see that Eowyn loves him.  But we knew that already.  Second, he spots the army of orcs.  We knew that as well. Further, the fall over the cliff feels crassly manipulative.  We don't seriously believe that Aragorn is dead, but we are forced to watch the characters display their grief.  Ugh.  I wish this screen time had been used for any other purpose.<br/><br/>5.  Faramir's decision to bring Frodo into Gondor seemed like a pointless detour, and, sadly, one that inadvertantly led to some mighty contrived acting by Elijah Wood.  Ian Holm and the computer-generated Gollum are fine when showing the pull of the ring's power, but the ring seems to make Mr. Wood stare into space.  Also, what exactly is it that changes Faramir's mind?  Seeing Frodo try to give the ring to a ringwraith convinces Faramir that he should let Frodo continue to carry the ring into Mordor? Huh?<br/><br/>What do all these flaws have in common?  None of them are in the books. Tolkien spent literally decades crafting his trilogy.  I understand that some things must be cut from the books for the sake of time.  Mr. Jackson showed admirable discretion in the first film, which was a compelling adaptation of the novel.  This film falls far short.  It is still beautifully rendered, but that is not enough to save a film riddled with flaws.<br/><br/>I was sorely disappointed by this picture."

","This was so so so much better than the first one!  I found the first book in the series to be rather boring anyway, as it was simply setting up the story line.  The Two Towers is when the action finally comes into play, and boy was there a lot of action in the movie!  There were a few more changes made to the story line in this one than there were in the first one, but for the most part they seemed to work, although I didn't think they were really necessary to the flow of the story.  But what do I know, I'm no Peter Jackson.  All I know is my eyes were glued to the screen for the entire duration of the movie.  I thought the devastatingly handsome Orlando Bloom as the ultra bad-ass elven assassin Legolas carried the battle scenes with a sleek finesse that is unusual to supporting actors in an epic action/adventure.  The audience in the theater was gasping with astonishment at every light footed feat he performed.  This was a beautiful motion picture that left me breathless.  I WILL pay 9 dollars to see it again, and perhaps again after that."

","Aside from one or two minor complaints, I found the movie very entertaining and enjoyable and would highly recommend the movie to anyone. I would like to point out that very little if anything has been mentioned about Andy Serkis and the character of Gollum/Smeagol. For myself, that was the most memorable character in the entire film. The animation sequences of Gollum/Smeagol were nothing short of phenomenal. They left me feeling almost as if he were real and deserved to be nominated for best supporting actor. At the very least, a new category of best voice over should be added. Andy Serkis most definitely deserves something for giving Gollum such amazing depth. I've done some acting and know firsthand it is no easy task to bring to life a live character. I can only imagine how much more difficult it is to bring so much  life to an animated character as to cause to me willingly suspend my disbelief for nearly 3 hours and actually feel pity for the character. Call it an overstatement if you will. I stand by my comments about Serkis' performance and would be willing to cast my vote for him as a best supporting actor."

","As a film student and a Tolkein fan I loved this movie and almost everything about it.  Peter Jackson really does understand what he's doing.  For all those who say that this film made too many changes from the book, this is all I have to say to you:  go cry me a river.  It's an adaptation for the love of God, it's not supposed to follow the story exactly.<br/><br/>Most of the things that were changed in this film were changed with good reason.  As much as I love Tolkein and his writing, he does tend to meander with his narration to a point that I sometimes wonder if Treebeard is supposed to be the one narrating these books.  Additionally, alot of information in the books is conveyed through dialogue instead of through action and visuals, which is a big no-no in film, and not a great idea in storytelling in general.  Therefore, Peter Jackson created some new ideas that got the same story across only more visually.  Yes, he changed alot, but all of the new stuff still accomplished the same thing as the books and still got the THEMES of the story across.<br/><br/>Yes, there were changes that p***ed me off.  Faramir is supposed to be the good brother and that bothered me because it was a complete change of a character, not just of the story.  As far as the whole Arwen thing goes, I'm not happy that they made the decision to blow up her character and all, but I like the way they did it once the decision was made.  It could have been done a lot worse, with her following him into battle and trying to be a lovey dovey, turning this into another Titanic/Pearl Harbor.  At least they stuck to things that actually DID happen, albeit in the appendicies."

It's therefore a fallacy to evaluate them as separate entities, as they were filmed simultaneously and are simply being released separately only to generate the maximum possible revenue and hype.  There are things that were left out and changed in consideration of the Fellowship and for the sake of the Return of the King, in order to continue and elaborate on the themes presented previously and save enough firepower for the final movie (SHELOB'S LAIR, Gandalf Returning to Isengard).

","What a great movie The Two Towers is, chiefly because it is the exact opposite of its smashing prequel The Fellowship of the Ring, and yet the movie still delivers and much more! My opinion on both movies stands on an equal ground, because these two complement each other. The differences are very apparent, especially on second viewing: it feels less intimate, has much more action sequences, doesn't have the prequel's linear pace and progression, the emergence of an important CGI character, and overall has a much more perilous tone than the last.<br/><br/>It is true that much has been left out or changed, even more so than the first movie. But most of the crucial events as well as tone & movement is all there, and that is all that matters to me (this is speaking from a BIG fan of the book who has read many of Tolkien's works and understood much of Middle-Earth's lores).<br/><br/>My instinct tells me to put a hold on all opinions until The Return of the King comes out, and then watch all three one after the other in the same day. We'll then realise at how AWESOME the trilogy is and marvel at its unimaginable scope. It is the only way the story can be enjoyed - after all, no die-hard fan of the book stops reading it when it gets to a certain part!<br/><br/>Once again well done to Peter Jackson & writers, the stellar casts, and all at Weta workshop for a wonderful movie."
"evilasahobby","9","0","0","19 January 2003"," An action packed middle to the LOTR saga
","Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers hits almost all the right notes in its adaption of JRR Tolkein's work to the screen. Starting with a fantastic scene straight off the bat, there is little doubt that this movie will be action packed and full throttle.<br/><br/>This is a great middle section to the LOTR saga. Arguments can be made about how true it stayed to sections of the book and how the changes influenced the story, but given that the movie stayed internally consistent, these gripes are possibly misfired. In adapting a book for the screen changes are always going to be made - the important thing is for those changes to be consistent to the overall narrative as it appears on screen. In TTT's case, Peter Jackson has made changes that have arguably added to the picture.<br/><br/>TTT has some of the greatest battle scenes shown on film thus far. Although shying away from the visceral reality of Saving Private Ryan, these battles are epic in scope and brutal to watch. These battles also avoid skewing into the ""hero beats all"" stereotypes that so many fantasy films enter into - each battle sees both sides take casualties, which sometimes include more than just the nameless rabble.<br/><br/>The flaws in TTT are almost unavoidable given the adapted material. Firstly, it is sometimes disrupting to move from one of the story arcs (say Aragon, Legolas and Gimli's) to another (Frodo and Samwise's). Unfortunately the most important journey to the narrative in Frodo's and Samwise's journey to Mt Doom is also the least interesting to watch which also disrupts the enjoyment of TTT. The final problem is that none of the characters really seem to develop to the same capacity of FOTR; the exception here is Golum, who is the most memorable character contained within this sequel.<br/><br/>That said, these are minor points. TTT continues the LOTR's epic scope and vision. With the Return of the King due out on Boxing Day 2003, TTT has set up the audience for an exciting and dynamic conclusion to this epic fantasy saga."
"mfisher452","Null","0","0","19 January 2003"," Visually splendid but otherwise disappointing
","Alas, my opinion of The Two Towers is no different from that of The Fellowship of the Ring. In my review of that film I said that people who see it because they want to see Middle-Earth on the screen will be thrilled, and the same is true here: Tolkien's visual world has been brought triumphantly to life in Peter Jackson's films. Rivendell, Isengard, Orthanc, Rohan, Osgiliad, Helm's Deep, Fangorn Forest, the Dead Marshes, Mordor, all of it looks spectacular. Here are hobbits, wizards, Rangers, men, elves, dwarfs, Half-Elven, Ents, Ringwraiths, orcs, Gollum (a fully digital character, à la Jar Jar Binks), even Sauron's Eye. The battle scenes are as exciting as any in recent films. Everything is drenched in generic medieval atmosphere, including lots of tangled, matted, filthy hair hanging down in people's faces. That's one good thing about this movie: It doesn't look like a sanitized, Errol-Flynn-as-Robin Hood romp; there is more than enough dirt to go around. (No chamber pots or outhouses, though, but then, there weren't any in the books, either.)<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the film cannot be the book, and must be judged on its own merits. And in order to compress the book into a 3-hour film, compromises were, of course, inevitable. Still, those who hope for more than pretty pictures may well be disappointed. I didn't mind the elimination of whole sections featuring characters that don't advance the plot. However, if you are like me, and what you treasure is the elaborately wrought, intricately detailed story beneath the visual effects, you will find little of it here. The outline of the plot has been preserved, as how could it not. But gone is the leisurely, majestic journey of the books; this is a race, a breakneck dash through a fever dream. Those who delight in Tolkien's rich, textured, muscular dialogue will find little of it here; what the FOUR, count em, four screenwriters have replaced it with is flaccid, bland, and banal. What little of Tolkien's original dialogue remains has been moved around and chopped up so that it has lost most or all of its power. The great sweep and turning of the seasons, so much a part of Tolkien's story, is barely touched here, and then only by the scenery. Whole sequences have been rearranged or transposed, or entirely new ones invented, for no reason that I can fathom; I cannot see where the originals would have been less cinematically successful. Many scenes are embellished and baroque where Tolkien's simple and direct treatment was much more effective. Wonderful scenes of dialogue have been trimmed to almost nothing.<br/><br/>About 20 years ago, the BBC produced a 12-hour radio serial of The Lord of the Rings. I was curious how these films would compare to it. It turns out that the radio version still conveys the true feel of Tolkien's story better than this attempt. It is also interesting to note that 12 hours of radio works out to 4 hours per volume, or only about an hour longer than the filmed LOTR is to be per film; yet the radio series manages to achieve a much more leisurely and measured pace, much more like the book. It is still the best dramatization."

","I'll admit it  I gave up reading J.R.R. Tolkkien's `The Two Towers' halfway through. The book plodded for me more slowly than the anthropomorphized tree in which two of its heroes spend virtually the entire story. Peter Jackson's film of `the Fellowship of the Ring,' though, made me wonder if I'd perhaps been too impatient with the trilogy. The furious intensity and imagination he brought to that film convinced me that I dug this stuff after all. But just like those guys who dress up in chain mail and hit each other with padded swords, `The Two Towers' reminds me why I've never really gotten into fantasy. All the extraordinary production values of the first film are there  not surprising, as they were filmed at the same time  but one suspects that this installment could easily be skipped without missing the larger impact of Tolkkien's universe. The problem is that the `The Two Towers' essentially amounts to nothing more than a pointless aside in the epic trilogy of swordplay and sorcery. As expected, we pick up with our friends from Middle Earth as we left them  covered with Middle Dirt and speaking proper fantasy-inflected English, still questing to cast the One Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom. Along the way, hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamje pick up the dubious guide services of Gollum, a scheming creature who appears to be a CGI rendition of Willem Dafoe. The film culminates in the battle of Helms Deep, the last ditch survival effort of the race of men against the invading armies of Mordor. The scope of this spectacle flirts with the impressive, although anyone familiar with `Army of Darkness' will have a hard time suppressing a chuckle at the sweeping shots of armored ghoulies gurgling and yawning menacingly.      The puzzling bit, at least to the uninitiated, is that by the end of the film everyone is pretty much in the same place they began, giving rise to the suspicion that Tolkkien was perhaps trying to stretch this whole business a bit further than prudence would dictate  like introducing Vance and Coy on `The Dukes of Hazzard.' The film's cinematography is again breathtaking, but is left searching for material worthy of its scope. There's walking, riding (on both horse and tree), and even a bit of running, but little else to warrant the constant swooping cameras. After an hour or so, `The Two Towers' begins to feel more like a fantasy edition of National Geographic than a necessary middle chapter of what might work better as a two-part tale."

","***Note: Can be revealing*** Yes!  The 'Rings' gang has returned; this time to pursuit not one gleeful mission but several.  Peter Jackson's ""The Two Towers"" is a dashing masterpiece of visual dazzle.  Jackson's remedy to increase the journey adrenaline was to top notch the senses of our eyes and gaze through the screen as if it were a radiant constellation.  Thanks plenty to New Zealand's visual effects workshop, Weta, their extreme realistic imaginations strongly surpassed ""Fellowship's"" capability (for instance, the zoom-out phase of Saruman (Christopher Lee, respectfully) and the multitude of Orcs, or the illustrious struggle between Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and the Balrog and their descent down the vertical cave).  The splendid creation of Treebeard and the Ents added to the spectacular visual puzzle, and their fight for survival was a landmark in this film.  But it is Jackson's conception of the monster-like Gollum that will win it many film effects awards, because this shows the farthest a filmmaker has explored to clone the characteristics and movements of a human (a creepy one, however), and interact with real actors and sets. Yet, it wasn't just the groundbreaking eye magic that makes this film seem so worthy.  Howard Shore's grand compilation of sorrowful, joyous, and romantic tunes eased our ears.  Every time, Arwen (Liv Tyler) was ravishingly reminisced by Aragorn (action-packed Viggo Mortensen), her choirs of angels chirped like robins.  And on another note, the fellowship of Aragorn, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) broke out into a pleasantly, achieving tune that would make up for all that musical banter, which took up half the books.      Cinematographer Andrew Lesnie exceeded the sky's limit, as the picturesque views of the snow-capped peaks of the dusted, rusted hills provided insight to many minds into Middle-earth.  Jackson's depiction of the Battle of Helm's Deep no-doubt was pictured as a fuss for society.  This 40-minute clash with the Uruk-Hai included Legola's grand stunt, boarding down the steps on a shield catching gasps of surprise.  But it was the union of Gandalf and the Rohan Riders, led by Eomer (Karl Urban) that captivated the audiences, as they drove their horses down a nearly vertical trail, colliding and passing through the Orcs.      Yeah, Jackson did not meticulously scrutinize Tolkien's masterpiece to verify every movement done in the chapters, but it's Peter Jackson's story. It raved out eyes, our minds...our hearts."
"bahrom1","9","0","0","18 January 2003"," very good but not quite as good as FOTR
","I've just watched the Two Towers and I liked it very much but it didn't floor me like the Fellowship did.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about TTT. It's truly epic, it's action packed, some of the battle scenes are simply breathtaking and the special effects are great (the CGI Gollum simply rocks). <br/><br/>
 TTT is probably the most difficult of all three books to film mostly because story splits into several separate lines. The resulting  constant crosscutting is often annoying and momentum breaking. Also there are a number of new characters  and there is simply not enough screen time to develop them. Same goes for many of the the plot lines some of which are VERY thin. (hopefully this will be partly rectified on the extended DVD). For example, I found the explanation of why Faramir lets Frodo go entirely unconvincing. BTW, there ARE some plot changes as compared to the book. Unlike other Tolkien fanatics ( I think I qualify as one having read the books several times a year for the past 10 years) I don't think they were excessive. Such changes are always necessary when converting a book into a movie.  For all those screaming about too many changes, just compare TTT with something  like the Three musketeers, the Count of Monte Cristo or any of the Disney adaptations and you'll realize that you really have nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>However, I found that a couple of the new plot twists simply didn't work. The would be death  of Aragorn is a prime example. The ploy there is EXACTLY the same as in the fall of Gandalf and it doesn't advance the story so why do it?<br/><br/>
Finally, some of the acting performances in FOTR (most notably Bilbo, Boromir and Galadriel) were so good that the new guys (such as Faramir and Theoden) simply pale in comparison. I wish they'd let Sean Bean play Faramir too - just make Faramir and Boromir twin brothers or use a bit of make up.<br/><br/>As far as acting is concerned Gollum steals the whole show (huge props to Andy Serkis who played him). <br/><br/>
Anyway, despite its shortfalls TTT is a very good movie, more than worth the money to watch it."

","Spoilers.<br/><br/>After watching the first Lord of the Rings, I wasn't expecting too much from its sequel.  Thank goodness, because I didn't get much.  These two movies have much in common.  For instance, they're both extremely boring in parts and way too long.<br/><br/>Sometimes I really enjoy long movies.  But at times like these, when the movie is extremely slow, I want to fall asleep.<br/><br/>The Two Towers has an extravagant beginning, though, in which Gandalf battles the gigantic behemoth Balrog.  This scene was probably the most impressive in the entire movie, matched only by the battle of the Ents toward the end.<br/><br/>The characters have all split up, and so the movie jumps from one to the next to the next without really following any particular pattern.  It's almost random, and at times I was getting a little confused.  One time I was wondering where the heck Gandalf had gone, but then I remembered that about an hour ago he rode off on a horse.  Such is the way of The Lord of the Rings, and I'm beginning to believe that this series will never change.<br/><br/>I am also quickly tiring of the way these movies try to `trick' the audience into believing a certain character is dead or has died, when its obvious that it hasn't happened.  Aragorn goes over a cliff (but fell into a river and survived), and Merry (or was it Pippin?) is `trampled' by a horse (nope, we find out ten minutes later that he actually rolled out of the way!).  But it's all in good fun, and I guess it's supposed to keep the movie tense. Which doesn't really work.<br/><br/>The plot is the same as the first, but this time Frodo and Sam have aid in the form of Gollum.  Within the first few minutes, I was tired of Gollum. He is a sickly little character, with an interesting schizophrenic personality, but an annoying and poorly generated character nonetheless.<br/><br/>Story line is, of course, different than The Fellowship of the Ring, but I found it just as boring.  There is so much going on, yet the movie somehow manages to nearly put me to sleep.<br/><br/>The music is absolutely awful.  I no longer appreciate Howard Shore's work. In the first movie, he thought up some excellent themes and I was impressed. However, in The Two Towers, several themes play over and over nonstop, which is EXTREMELY annoying.  No new themes are created in this movie; instead, Shore takes snips of pieces from the first movie and puts them in this one, which makes for a lousy soundtrack.  Sickeningly lousy.  I can really say it hit rock bottom.<br/><br/>Despite all these flaws, The Two Towers does have some excellent battle scenes, although they, too, are stretched far too long sometimes.  Gimli, the dwarf, provides some excellent comic relief, and he basically pulled me through the movie.  Character development is still poor, but better than the first.<br/><br/>All in all, The Two Towers is exactly what I expected.  Much like the first, it is a major disappointment because it is so boring, lacking in a good storyline, and just too flawed."

Here's why.<br/><br/>Why does it have to clock in at three hours plus? It's difficult to keep this guy enthused for what's, and let us be frank here, basically an action movie within a fantasy setting. Action scene after action scene and very  s l o w  bits in the middle disguised at character building. Even the climactic Battle at Helm's Deep, although finely executed, felt overlong in my book, a prime example of more being less. Films like Traffic and Magnolia require a three hour running time because these are complex character driven stories. TTT does not.Why non-fantasy buffs are looking forward to the four hour DVD extravaganza baffles me.<br/><br/>The whole interweaving of plotlines that culminate in a grand finale, read: Star Wars,type of storytelling that is so pervasive in movies these days defies logic in this one. Are we to believe that Merry and Pippin are hopping along on this three for what must be a week? Come to think of it, Merry and Pippin were as pointless in the film as they were in the books. Nothing to do but to sit on Treebeard and express but one emotion, the ""wide-eyed look of amazement"".<br/><br/>The Romance. One word. Forced. In there to keep the chicks happy too. And if Aragorn doesn't have enough troubles on his mind, why with fighting an assorted lot of Uruk-Hai, Wargs and Trolls and all, we just throw in an extra love-element for good measure. <br/><br/>And finally, the film reeks of self-importance. That's why the Indiana Jones Trilogy is miles above LOTR in my book. Jones acknowledges that it's entertainment. It's doesn't take itself too serious. It winks at the audience saying "" Come on, we're entertaining you so don't bemoan the flaws and errors in logic"" and as a result you don't. This baby has *art* smeared all over it's smug face.

What follows is an incredibly intricate weaving of the many story lines that together resonate as a true symphony.<br/><br/>Smeagol/Gollum portrayal is breathtaking (and I do not mean the computer graphics). The slight change in the character of Faramir towards being more tempted by the ring is minor (since it only furthers a trace suggested by the book) and it works miracles. Frodo is fittingly shown as having a lot in common with Smeagol. The character interaction between Frodo, Smeagol and Sam tells us so much in so little space. All other members of the fellowship grow immensely too.<br/><br/>If only there was more development between Gimli and Legolas. But since the extended version of the FotR gave more of this, I hope to see Gimli in the caves and making a deal with Legolas in the extended version or in the Return of the King.<br/><br/>The ending of course-- I cannot suggest a better point at which to end the middle movie so I am not going to complain.

","Considering how I saw the Fellowship of the Rings, fifteen million times (actually 9 times in theatres, millions of times on DVD), I had very high expectations when I went to see TTT.  I have to say that it blew me away but like all wonderful things, it has some flaws.  Thus, I put it on the same scale as FOTR,  a very high rating of a 9.<br/><br/>First, FOTR benefited because it was new, no one knew what to expect, and it was ingeniously adapted to incorporate the book very well.  There were no major changes except the obvious cut of Tom Bombadil, and I think Peter Jackson made Frodo a much more likable character.  All the characters were somewhat new or unknown (in the mainstream) actors.  It was just a giant surprise and the world was VERY impressed.<br/><br/>TTT is a continuation of FOTR so there isn't much more surprise anymore. List of the good and bad:<br/><br/>GOOD: 1.  Helm's Deep:  simply awesome graphics, well put together and just amazing!!!!!! 2.  Acting:  everyone, even Elijah Wood, was very good.  I give kudos to Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, he was wonderful.  Ian McKellen had a lesser part but he was good in the parts he was in. 3.  As a movie, it flowed, had great music, and overall, it is a beautiful picture. 4.  Okay, admit it, Orlando Bloom is simply beautiful!!! 5.  Very good adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>BAD: 1.  The love scenes between Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler were ludicrous. It was ALMOST as bad as the love scenes in the Attack of the Clones (which was one of the year's worst movies).  They just looked so awkward that it was PAINFUL to watch. 2.  Faramir.  Why change a very good character, who was supposed to be the opposite of Boromir?  WHY???????  I was so disheartened by that character change. 3.  Drags at points.  Drags when there is no action and there is talking. Sometimes it doesn't, but most times, such as scenes in the Rohan castle, it really dragged on and on and on . . . 4.  Fake deaths.  Why pretend Aragorn died when we know he is the future king and must be in the sequel????????<br/><br/>I've seen this movie twice so far.  The first time blew me away, the second I saw at Washington DC's Uptown theatre.  Apparently, Orlando BLoom was there at the first premiere of FOTR.  I was so excited and spent the whole movie waiting for his scenes.  I'm sorry!  He is just so hot.  So anyway, TTT will go down as one of the best movies, but like everything, it has its flaws.  =) Legolas:  ""You're late.""  Smiles.  ""You look terrible."""

","There is no denying that Peter Jackson has done an incredible job in bringing Tolkien's world to life. It truly is a special movie... the acting and directing are amongst the best you will ever see, and somewhat unusually for a movie with this much money behind it, the special effects add to, rather than detract from, the spectacle.<br/><br/>However, there are a few details ('bugs' maybe?) that really annoyed me about the movie. When Aragorn, Legolas and Ghimli are tracking the Urakai across the plains, the dwarf kept falling behind but by the next cut had miraculously caught up again. Then, when they encountered the horsemen, there were nowhere near 2000 of them; yet when Aragorn confronts the king, he claims that was their number. Finally, when the king rides out for his last stand, there are very few of his men left (especially in the scenes in the hall directly before they ride out) - yet once Gandalf and the rescue party turn up, more of them suddenly appear out of nowhere.<br/><br/>The details that Tolkien put into his book are part of what makes the stories so great, and it disappointed me just a little that such obvious (to me, anyway) things were overlooked.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, an awesome cinematic experience."
"Argead","6","0","0","16 January 2003"," Beware the Rave Reviews
","A surprisingly bland and childish adaptation of Tolkien's legendary epic. I felt I was watching a Disney film. The talents of Lee and McKellen are wasted here. Jackson has already shown with ""Fellowship"" -- a superior film -- that he understands Tolkien and knows how to translate his works to the big screen. But with ""The Two Towers"" he takes literary license too far. Skateboarding elves and wisecracking dwarves, is that all it takes to defeat the Uruk-hai? What gives with Aragorn and the pseudo love triangle? These are distractions. Oh, and how about putting some emotional impact back into the story? I want to empathize with the main characters. Still, I'd forgive all its defects in a heartbeat if wasn't so boring. 6/10"

","PROBABLY SOME SPOILERS IN THIS<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first film. Plenty of action, plenty of character development, plenty of emotion, some fantastic NZ scenery. Saw TTT, though, and thought it was, by contrast, incredibly poor. I wasn't expecting anything life-affirming but I was expecting another good, well-made movie. Again, there was great scenery, and the NZ tourist board must be rubbing their hands. But as for the film...<br/><br/>This was, essentially, a long middle part of another film. Whilst this could be expected, the clearest comparison that can be drawn is the Star Wars films, with certainly the first-released trilogy each forming great films in their own right. This was not the case with TTT.<br/><br/>As far as characters went, there was no discernable development other than Gollum. I enjoyed his little ramblings, and thought he was very well done, if slightly comic book in facial appearance. We learned absolutely nothing about anyone else of value. Aragorn was just about the only character with whom I felt any kind of empathy (well, I would say that, wouldn't I). Frodo spent more time in a badly-acted trance than he did communicating (I understand the ring was taking him over, etc etc, but how often do we need telling?). Gandalf was disappointing, Saruman weak, Sam good (he's supposed to be annoying) but underdeveloped, Legolas acting like he was from Legoland, and demoting Gimli to light relief was a shame. New characters like Theoden and Grima were assiduously kept on one level.<br/><br/>The plot was, well, not strong enough to make the film stand on its own. Perhaps it could have been, but I got the feeling that we were being blasted with special effects which, whilst very impressive, almost seemed to be trying to mask the fact that the storyline itself was too slow-moving and didn't contain enough to keep us interested unaided.<br/><br/>And aside from all this, there were so many elements to the film that were plain ridiculous that I actually left the cinema laughing. The giant tree things. Incredible. I know there's a certain suspension of disbelief required here and that they are a vital part of the story but, despite looking good and being in some visually interesting scenes, these too looked like comic characters. Reminded me of the rocks that come alive in, I think, Return to Oz, but the rocks were much darker and struck a more appropriate tone. The trees just reminded me of my grandad (yes, he was forty foot high and covered in moss) and their transformation into destructive forces capable of bringing down Saruman's gaff was then too far-fetched.<br/><br/>And so many cliches it wasn't true. From the painfully obvious pathetic fallacy of the rain at the start of the battle for Helm's Deep to the cringe-worthy appearance of Gandalf on shining steed bringing light to battle against the forces of dark at daybreak. And then leading a handful of blokes into battle against a massive army of really quite vicious creatures, and apparently trouncing them, is a bit beyond belief. Could we not have seen the battle? Did they run short on budget? I personally would appreciate a chance to see such an apparently incredible feat. And instead all we get is five of the main good guys sauntering over yet another hill crest to observe, 'Well, that was a job well done, but the really BIG stuff is going to happen in the next film.'<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>So I thought this was a waste of time but I'll still look forward to the final installment because I'd love to see how Jackson ends this. I suspect that the outcome could well have been a heavily-edited down 4 or five hour single film instead of a protracted 9 hour trilogy, but I'm still keen. As for this one, I was sorely disappointed."
"dave2112","Null","0","0","12 January 2003"," Epic Movie making.... but...
","Peter Jackson has made another film that reminds us why the love going to the movies.   Big battles - amazing characters (Gollum is one cool CGI treat), subplots on top of subplots, etc.   I don't care how big your widescreen TV is at home, you need to see these movies at the theatre.<br/><br/>With that said, I do have a problem with ""The Two Towers"".    And this is coming from someone who has not read the books.  (Cast me into the depths of hell now!)<br/><br/>Did Tolkien intend on having his characters turn into likeable, ""cute"" people we could laugh at and with?    These movies are dark, forboding, operatic tales of good vs evil.   Should I be laughing and giggling at small sarcastic quirky jokes about Gimli's height?   Or the ""competition"" he and the Elfin Robin Hood have during the battle?   It just seemed that Jackson tried a little to hard to make sure that EVERYONE liked this movie - and created some humor mixed in with the poignant story telling.    For me, the two didn't mix very well.<br/><br/>And while I am glorifying and criticizing this movie at the same time... someone needs to tell me about the Tree creatures from Tolkiens stories. In my opinion, they hurt the film.   Where they big huggable characters in the books?   All they reminded me of were some those other characters that many movie fans detested, and felt they had no place in a large epic saga - those other characters that also ""cutely"" assisted the heroes in their fight against the dark forces...   anyone know which pint sizes, hairy (Wookie-looking) creatures I am referring to??"

","The 3-hour running time definitely felt short for this movie. But I still recommend you to read the book for a further grasp of the story and the characters. They didn't show why Gimli and Legolas become so close and friendly despite being dwarf and elf. The fighting scenes were definitely better than the first movie (where most of the scenes just showed blurry, fast and slow moving people, not knowing who against who or what kind of action was done, and so on) The SFX was amazing.<br/><br/>There's one thing though. Before this movie, I happened to listed to LOTR reading cassettes. I really like the voice of Gollum of that version which was a bit low and the ""gollum"" was more like swallowing the word itself. But in the movie, Gollum was high-pitch and its ""gollum"" sounded more like having something stuck in its throat. But that's just a personal opinion.<br/><br/>
Overall, this is a very very amazing movie, a must see movie, and a must read book."

"Frogfisher","7","0","0","12 January 2003"," Greater and better than the average, but fare from Fellowship
","Now I'll start by saying that for me the second installment of the Lord of the rings trilogy, hasn't meant as much to me as FoTR and RoTK.<br/><br/>But two things has meant a lot to me; Gollum and parts of the books we'll see in RoTK, and Boromirs Last Stand.<br/><br/>The film is a great epic war movie. And for me thats not good enough. The story is fare from what i remember. The most important scenes in the film are the ones in Helms Deep. Tolkien also lies much weight on these chapters but not as much as PJ & co. The scenes are well made and probably only seen better a few times before. That Massive system really works out great. I have no problem with the battle in helm deep, beside the fact that i think it's too long. And here I wonder. Why is there is teen scenes we never read about in the books, too end the movie five chapters or so before the book. Before that we already knew that one chapter would be cut from TTT, Boromir's Last Stand. Where have the original story gone? Instead they put the elves in the middle of the story, where they don't belong. Why? So we have a more clear love story. For most of the fans I guess we don't need it, and beside, isn't there warm feelings between Aragorn and Eowyn? But wait that isn't the only new scene. Varges? Where do they come from and the result of the fight with the varges doesn't even support any of the important story lines that we have in this film, why should he fall? Well, to make it more hectic and give it more speed and action, yes, but isn't there enough when the Uruk-hai's are killed, when Theoden King is freed from the poison of Isengard and the battle of Helms Deep? And we even get to see some action in a place where Frodo, Sam and Gollum never went. Another new scene, but this is so short and important to clear out what Faramir has to do, this probably was a hard task.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action and incredible scenes as in FoTR, and some are betters, much better.<br/><br/>The Judgement: This is still one of the best films seen the last year, terrifying at points, beautiful, actionpacked and deep most of the time and remarkable in every scene. But besides the fact the it isn't excatly what the book is telling at some points, it is a great epic journey to a new part of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The designs, the effects, the music everything helps us fall in to the world and feel that this is a historic film, not a fantasy film. I love it, but it lacks magic and suffers under that the makers sees it as a middle part to guide our heroes to their destiny in RoTK, because that is what it is. We see magic places, but not because of beauty and history of the place but because the story takes them there, not as in FoTR, where it all is new and exciting. I hope that in the last installment they have regained the exciting feeling of the project too make a great end to what stil is the best trilogy so fare.<br/><br/>
Gollum. Gollum is so perfect, incredible and realistic like no other thing I've seen in movies. Andy Serkis delivers a great performances and defintely is the right choice. He is the movie. I would like to see those deleted scenes with him in the movie and a couple of minutes less battle and new scenes, would have savved the movie.<br/><br/>I like the first half and of course Gollum in every scene. It is a great intro to the movie with, Gandalf and the Balrog, and of course our first glimce of Gollum. It is great up to the point the varges attack, and after that in few periodes. The battle of Helms Deep is epic and historic, but too long. And the destruction of Isengard is well done. But to make it one of the last scenes, it doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>I still love the movie and I give it 7 out of 10, because of the grandness of the story and the very beautiful images of Middle Earth."
"dbudelsky","8","0","0","12 January 2003"," Not as good as FOTR
","Contains Spoilers I waited a year for this film. Overall, it was a disappointment to me. As a real Tolkien fan, I loved the first film and understood most alterations to the book as more or less necessary for shortening the plot to three and a half hours. I love the long DVD version even more than the shorter cinema version as the extension calms the journey a little bit, so the watcher can really see what is happening.<br/><br/>In the second film TTT the sets, tricks and character looks are again excellent. The best persons in my humble opinion are Wormtongue and of course: Gollum really put to live, the most interesting person even in the books; here a real character.<br/><br/>What I don't like are the alterations to the book, as they replace plot with massacre! A chapter in the book is made the central part in the film, lasting may be half an hour while eight chapters are left out and shifted partly to the third film, as the last scene clearly implies. That the battle is changed: replacement of the rangers by elves and Erkenbrand by Eomer is not the problem, but for example the Ents: Why do they turn up at Isengard so suddenly after the decision to do nothing at the Ent Thing and the rethinking of Treebeard ad the border of Fangorn? Or why does Frodo face a Nazgul at Osgiliath who should clearly feel the presence of the ring and restart the hunt for it at Osgiliath? A decade of plot outline from Tolkien is replaced by holes!<br/><br/>Overall a must see film, but a clear decrease after FOTR. What will we see in the third film? The book alone has enough plot for two Jackson films, but elements of the TTT book have to be added to Return of the king, namely Shelob and the joining of Merry/Pippin with Gandalf/Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli (and Eowyn!!!) for further adventures together."
"derickallen","Null","0","0","12 January 2003"," An unprecedented mamoth of splendor, majesty, and magic!
","This masterpiece film is borne out of direction with soaring passion! Period. But wait... can't help it... can't fight it... anyone who has beheld this film's beauty is sure-bound to feel the sense of pouring out a stampede of adjectives and superlatives in describing it - almost to the point of annoying exagerration and over-acting! (Such is actually evident with how I word my review, as I have so realized post-writing.)<br/><br/>First, is this film better than Fellowship? I'd say it's at par with Fellowship's magic. While some claim the WOW factor is absent in TTT, I beg to disagree. There are still many areas and aspects of the film that abound with it! The landscapes still wow us. The structures (Edoras, Helm's Deep) still do. The attention to details. Frodo's acting. And so on. Then, there's gollum/smeagol.<br/><br/>Is gollum real-like? No, conceptually. But technically, YES. The image rendering is perfect. The only thing that betrays its being real-like is that we know for a fact that no such real creature exists, or can exist. Switching this reminder off in our brains and you have the most realistic CGI creation ever made. But you don't have to consciously turn a part of your brain off primarily because the personality the creature bears will make everything feel real.<br/><br/>Did TTT deviate much from the book? Yes it did, on many accounts. 1st, it deviated from the Tolkien aura, for me at least. I do not think Tolkien ever intended for example, the battle to be of this magnitude. 2nd, you know the rest... (Faramir's attitude, the elves helping at Helm's deep, the Arwen Eowyn Aragorn love triangle, etc.)<br/><br/>Were the deviations good? Yes, they were coherent with the whole plot. They did not do damage.<br/><br/>My only negative comment comes in the form of a suggestion: PJ needs to develop more individual combat shoots, in addition to the collective (generalized) non-detailed combat he used most often esp. in Helm's deep. There should be more martial arts, hand-to-hand combat sequences on top of the collective combats. Ever seen how Legolas mounted on his horse? Or how the Elves shoot arrows? More of these detailed individual feats should be made.<br/><br/>The plot was never confusing, even for someone who has'nt read the 2nd book. But watching or reading the first movie or book is a must.<br/><br/>Finally, the march of the ents to Isengard as well as the Battle of Helm's Deep are spectacular. The Battle of Helm's Deep effectively gave us (in fact let us feel) the sense of the ""large-scaleness"" of the battle, the valor and determination of each men, as well as hope and despair.<br/><br/>Rating: No movie is ever perfect, even this one. With that in mind, I'll give this a 10/10."

The special effects are breath taking and Gollum is superb. Yes, the movie does depart from the book (I have read the trilogy twice) and I have heard disgruntled LOTR fans commenting on that while leaving the theater, but to me it does not take from its value. I'll definitely see it again, and again. One viewing (and in my case two) is not enough to catch everything that this visual feast offers. In comparison with Fellowship of the Ring, this movie is lighter, both in appearance (wide open sunlit spaces of Rohan) and character (the comic angle added in competition between Gimli and Legolas amidst the darkness of Helm's Deep), and the darkness is now more within (the `possessed' king Theoden, the tormented Gollum/Smeagol, and Frodo becoming more and more like the wretched creature).

The difficulty of bringing this to the screen, and in only 3 hours time, had to be daunting, but Jackson managed it splendidly! The creation of Edoras and Hornburg were amazing, and the action carried me along so completely that the 3 hours seemed like a much shorter time. I admit that I was put off a bit by some of the  changes made to the story. I can understand giving some of the key characters more exposure, but I don't understand such decisions as changing the outcome of the Ent Moot or Frodo's encounter with Faramir, who was a wiser and more noble character in the book.

","TTT picks up where FotR ends, naturally. The opening sequence of TTT is breathtaking, why a girl in the row behind me even cheered when Gandalf snatches Glamdring in mid air. You're in medias res and can't help but to immerse yourself in the world of Middle-Earth once again. The grin was back on my face, I liked it... yes you know what I am going to say... the 3 letter word: ""but"" - but not all is well in the land of Tolkien this time around.<br/><br/>The book has 3 main plot lines and so does the movie. A difficult and daunting task one the director has mastered well to a certain degree. I will not argue about character changes plot cuts, rearrangements or additions, since it is the right of the director to do what he or she feels is necessary in the light of dramaturgy.<br/><br/>Again: but... the pacing does not feel right this time, esp. flashback scenes with Arwen slow the movie down to zero numerous times and are trying the viewers patience and good will, esp. since Liv Tyler fails to impress us with her interpretation of Arwen.<br/><br/>But... it is not only Liv Tyler's scenes, the ""pathos"" swings high throughout the movie, too high for my taste. King Theoden could have been depicted with greater care and detail and less ""pathetic"". Him crying with close-up is a little too much. Let him say his lines at his son's grave and ""cut"" for pity sake.<br/><br/>All in all it is still a well made movie and a worthy successor of FotR. Unfortunately, if you haven't seen the first part you won't get much out of the second one. If you have read the books then you will be upset about certain changes and additions or omissions (as you might have been with FotR). Try to ignore your first impulse and see it for what it is: An interpretation of Tolkien's masterpiece, an action loaded one with a lot of pathos and less character development, except for Gollum, who really saved the day this time around.<br/><br/>Kudos to Andy Serkins. Never have I been so thrilled to watch a CGI character on screen and forget that it is CGI I am watching. Bravo. Of course all effects are top-notch (yes, the Ents are fantastic, too) and the musical score is darker and matches the movie's tone very well.<br/><br/>Given the difficulty to film the 3 plotted 2nd part one might forgive the ""pathos"" and flashback sequences, even the Faramir changes or the (pointless) ""Aragorn River scene"" (etc.) but since the pacing is already extremely difficult to handle with 3 plots, it weighs even heavier to make such drastic pacing ""mistakes"" or - let's say - rather ""decisions"". 3 points off for this one, Mr. PJ.<br/><br/>7/10 Theatrical Release [maybe 9/10 for Extended Edition if we see more Faramir character development, if certain flashback scenes are cut/changed and if we get more screen time for Ents]"

","I See the Tolkien purists, I see the fools, I see the fans, but what I don't see is anyone bitching about common stupidity during the battle.<br/><br/>It strikes one as odd that no one thought to start PUSHING the damned ladders over when they started coming up, after all, you've got to keep them from coming up so that's one way to do, appoint some of the Elves to be ready to slice up the Uruk-Hai on top then push his ladder to the side, sending it crashing.<br/><br/>Also, as for those who bitch that the Uruk-Hai were so easy to hold off, these guys were just spawned, I don't think they've had time to master the art of swordsmanship in a few days, or does that never register for you? If someone just shoved a sword into your hand, how well would you perform?<br/><br/>As for when the Wall broke down and the Uruk-Hai charged through and set up that spear line, I really shook my head, you charged a bunch of pointy spears, when you really should have filled the buggers up with arrows, then attacked, I swear, what is that?<br/><br/>As for Aragorn and Gimli holding off the Uruk-Hai chargers on the bridge, they do sort of have an advantage, they only have to attack forwards, they KNOW how to handle their weapons and when you start killing a fair number of them, the bodies tend to pile and make it difficult for their fellows to get over the corpses.<br/><br/>As for the 300 Vs 10,000, it was more like 600-700 with the Elves arriving, add the fact that you only have to fight a fraction of their force at a time, the ones with crossbows, the ones climbing up the ladders and making it through the breach, you fight the enemies who are actually attacking, not waiting their turn.<br/><br/>As for you Tolkien Purists, I don't care how dedicated you are, I doubt New Line Cinema was going to spring for three NINE-Hour movies and I doubt the actors wanted to spend a decade in New Zealand only to find out a few thousand geeks in Elf, Dwarf and Wizard costumes show up. This is an abridged version as Movies usually are and if you don't like that, well the book's still there buddy, READ IT AGAIN FOR ALL I CARE. I don't watch JP: Lost World and keep it in my DVD Collection, I read the book because the movie is a travesty and is nothing like the book.<br/><br/>The movie itself is great, the animatics are amazing, the Ents are a beautiful creation to behold and Gollum was great work too, the Special Effects are hitting new levels these days and it shows. The acting was great and I find the performances are enhanced in this film as the Fellowship falls into their roles and performs them splendidly, Gimli was comic relief but it was helpful in a movie with little humour too it, Gollum was an annoyance at times but he also was used very well.<br/><br/>Still, I must ask you, if you hate the movie that much, why do you waste your time bitching about it?

","I give The Two Towers a full 10 stars out of 10 and declare it a must-see. Here's why:<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings has been with me since I first read it in early adolescence (now quite while ago). As such, my relationship with it over the years has been very personal, and as 2000 drew to a close I knew I would be a tough critic of any attempt at turning these very special books into films.<br/><br/>So I began watching The Fellowship of the Ring with trepidation. By its close, I esteemed it a tremendous achievement, worthy of much praise. But as anyone familiar with the books knows, the real challenges for a film-maker determined to mount the whole epic really begin with Book 3, the first of The Two Towers...<br/><br/>The second film is an unequivocal triumph. It works on every level, through the grandest moments to the most intimate. And it surpasses the first picture in significant ways.<br/><br/>Underlying the success of the film is its realisation of the world in which the drama takes place. With dedicated attention to detail,  Middle Earth is brought to life as a continent inhabited by real people, their feelings as real as the grime on their faces and the dirt under their fingernails. The landscape is marked out by palpable contrasts of geography and culture, all fitting into a strong spatial context where distances and differences matter. One has the feeling that to walk from Hobbiton to Edoras really is like walking from Paris to Moscow.<br/><br/>The Two Towers introduces a new human element which was rather lacking in the first film, through new characters and a fuller treatment of old ones. Here Peter Jackson is admirably served by his cast: Bernard Hill is perfect as Theoden (and this although I had originally imagined the king of the Riddermark as a much older man), and there is an eye-catching turn from David Wenham, whose performance as Faramir is transfixing. Real humanity is introduced through powerful details, too: normality shattered by the onslaught of the orcs; boys and grandfathers in ill-fitting helmets manning the parapets to await battle; women and children cowering in caves, listening to the awful fate of the men who must defend them with their lives.<br/><br/>Every scale of engagement, from attritional siege to minor skirmish, is represented in the course of the opening war - and represented as a messy, frantic tangle, a chaotic contact sport with the highest of stakes. The orcs are seen as skilled, strong, courageous, disciplined and determined. In so many films any excitement is utterly undermined by what I term the 'Keystone Baddies' effect: take for example Imperial Storm Troopers who can't hit jack and don't know the meaning of the word 'cover', up against heros who never miss. But in The Two Towers, the orcs are every bit as dangerous as their non-orc opponents. We see them fall in scores to arrows, only to exact retribution with their own crossbows when in range; at close-quarters, as many non-orcs as orcs are seen slain; once-immaculate elven warriors lie cheek-by-jowl in the mud with goblins. These battles are to the death, and no-one holds back for the purposes of narrative.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most remarkable achievement is Smeagol, pure CGI except in voice. In those films I had previously seen employing such effects, they were never used as more than tokens to please the eye. But so assured is the characterisation by Andy Serkis and the sfx team that this entirely artificial personage becomes as real as the human cast: indeed, he carries some of the most heart-wrenching scenes (for example the soliloquy in which he wrestles with his twisted, ring-intoxicated self).<br/><br/>To cap it all, no concession is made to younger audiences. This phenomenon has bedevilled movies for too long, and it's time a stop was put to it. Example: in the original Star Wars trilogy, there was not a single child, and yet all three films were perfectly accessible to all ages. Twenty years on, and Episode I is all about a child (one who can't act, moreover), and Episode II has content clearly intended to help children get involved (the young Boba Fett, who's also no Olivier). No such compromises in either installment of The Lord of the Rings (and compromises they would be, for there is nothing of the sort in the books). These are films for adults, just as they should be. If kids have to grow into them, they'll be the better for it."

","When I first saw the second part of the Trilogy, I had really high hopes for it, as I recenlty reed all the books in the trilogy. Tough in some places the action got kinda stuck, the message were given over very well. The scenario didn't went exactly as written in book: In the book, Faramir understood Frodo, and let him go from the hideout and didn't drag him to Osgiliath.<br/><br/>For conclusion, a well made second part of the Trilogy...worth of 10 points."
"Edu-16","Null","0","0","11 January 2003"," Trying ever so hard to be detached....
","..which of course is almost impossible when you've read the books 7 or 8 times.  But Ill try.<br/><br/>Adaptation: 6.5<br/><br/>Probably going to be my lowest score.  If there was one story that jumps straight from the page as a complete visual and dramatic entity then it's got to be this one.  Leaving scenes/ characters out is going to have to happen unless the finished film lasts 15 hrs or so, but there doesn't seem to be any need for inventing anything new.  Certainly no need for any new action scenes - so I took umbrage at the extra battle between Aragorn, the Riders and some mounted Orcs - and the subsequent 'is Aragorn alive or not' bit.  It's all new and just didnt work for me at all.  There was no tension there since it is obvious to one and all (even those who havent read the book) that the romantic lead is not going to be written out half-way through.  Aragorn lamely turns up again at Helm's deep and that's about it.<br/><br/>As a general point to me it is also obvious whenever something non-Tolkein happens in the film.  There is a sudden lack of substance/ thud/ conviction. At first I thought this was born from my familiarity with the original story.  But to me there is a distinct lack of inspiration in the new scenes and the feeling that they don't belong to the original's overall architecture.<br/><br/>I wasn't happy with the scene where Merry and Pippin manage to make it to Fangorn, and the preceeding running down of the orcs by the riders - which is so well described in the book I was looking for something rather more in the film than was delivered.  The book had a real sense of a race against the clock, with tension and action - more than enough for a good screenplay!<br/><br/>Losing the extra Orc battle and Aragorn yawn bit and adhering more faithfully to the book would have improved things.  I conceed that adaptation must be a bit of a b*gger to do well.  Rather like flattening the biscuit tin lid - as soon as you flatten one bump, another one pops out somewhere else and you have to change that too..  etc.  Simple answer - don't fiddle - and especially don't fiddle purely to add action.  We have enough action already.<br/><br/>Take the Faramir change/ Frodo to Osgiliath.  For one ghastly moment I was reminded of 'Reign of fire' - thankfully it passed, but it was a nasty reminder of what a narrow plank Jackson walks sometimes.  The book already had a quite simple distinction between Faramir and Boromir.  It was an important distinction that parallels the difference between the corrupt men who had been letting Middle earth slip, and those who would be entrusted with it's bright new future.  Jackson has blurred this - and I hope he's got a good reason for doing so.<br/><br/>Theoden.  Hmmm, quite liked the concept of making him possessed by Sauruman. In the book, his negative and insular attitude is a result of years of subtle guidance from Wormtongue.  And I conceed this would have been hard to get across convincingly in a short space of time.  But in the book - when he snaps out of it - he snaps out of it for good.  In the film, he has some relapses in Helms deep.  THis didnt make alot of sense for me...<br/><br/>Final remarks about the adaptation are on the two climaxes...  Ah yes, and of course you are right, you can;t have two climaxes can you.  In the book, space separates the flooding of Isengard from the Battle at Helms deep. THis gives each it's place and prominence within the drama.  In the film, JAckson cuts from one to another. (even though one happens mostly at Night, the other during the day.....?!)  As a result I believe the impact of both suffers.  Which is saying something because even with this weakness they are both fantastic.  But it's a bit like trying to flick between two channels - one showing 'Titanic', the other 'Waterloo'.  Marriages have foundered on such behaviour!<br/><br/>ps Unlike some I wasn;t too worried about who turns up at the last minute at Helms Deep.  I sooo liked those Elven warriors that I kind of forgave Jackson that one.<br/><br/>
Cinematography/ Costumes/ general look: 10<br/><br/>Faultless - a yardstick for others to follow.  Particularly liked the elven warriors.  They had am impressive 'other worldly' quality about them. Gollum - utterly utterly perfect.  But Im not going to give Jackson all the credit for this.  The reason G has got almost universal approval from LotR officianados the world over is that he is one of the best described chararcters in all fantasy literature - and Jackson has just drawn him straight from the book.  Jolly good job too in my mind - since if G had been a failure - then so might the entire trilogy.<br/><br/>Ents - pretty good.  Again could have really blown but they didnt.<br/><br/>Isn't New Zealand a nice place ?!  Speaking as someone who has had the good sense to Emigrate here, it has always been easy to relate the geography here to Middle-earth.<br/><br/>Riders? - Again about right.  Edoras was nicely Scandinavian I thought.<br/><br/>Acting: 9<br/><br/>The acting behind the CGI Gollum is spectularly good.  Not sure how the academy may view the achievement, but it's the standout performance for me.<br/><br/>
Getting happier with Aragorn - and all the other cast members seem to be about right.  Wormtongue especially good - (Only minor quibble is Elrond. Every time he appears I hear 'That. Mr Anderson, is the sound of inevitability....'.  I just can;t stop myself....)<br/><br/>Ps.  Hey - Im sorry but Treebeard and Gimili's voices were obviously one and the same.....<br/><br/>
Script: 8<br/><br/>Nothing too silly.  Enough lines taken direct from the book - even Gimili humour was done nicely and didnt pander.  I think we've lost alot of the poetry that is contained in the books.  But I guess we have the BBC radio series for this if we need it.<br/><br/>Overall: 9<br/><br/>As a standalone film 'Excellent' - and better than the 'Fellowship'.  But put this down to the better structure of the TT book than anything else. And in any case there is no way you can judge this or any of the Trilogy on it's own - especially if you have yet to read the books.<br/><br/>In general, there was more additions than were necessary, and some missed opportunities.  Jackson was never going to keep everyone happy, but he's probably upset fewer than might have been expected given the passion that surrounds this work.<br/><br/>As a final point - Ive never been to a movie that passed so quickly - or where the audience applauded at the end.  There are some of the most breath taking scenes ever filmed - and I'm personally very grateful that someone has so lovingly (and by and large faithfully) brought to life one of the great works of English literature.<br/><br/>Judgement as a piece of film making - very good."

","Ok, this is the best movie I've seen for 2002.<br/><br/>The movie completely blew me away. It was an excellent adaptation from the book in my opinion and what really REALLY surprises me is the makers adapted one part that wasn't at all in the original three books (all the parts about Arwen leaving Middle Earth and the facts about inmortality and stuff) but in the apendixes by Tolkien himself (he talked about many things in those apendices, including the love between Arwen and Aragorn, The fates of Elrond, Galadriel and other high elves and some other really cool stuff that just make the Middle Earth world more believable and absolutely incredible). It all fit so well in the movie. I think it was a marvelous work (the book adaptation).<br/><br/>But having read the books some dozens of times (again, if you saw the movie and you liked it, you will love the books much MUCH more dearly) I was surprised by how some stuff was cut out of it. Like the book 2 ends after Frodo was taken for dead after the fight with She-lob and it really made the ending MUCH more intriguing. Then I hated the way Gimli was treated in this movie, making dwarves be such stupid characters and they're not at all (he is not stupid in the book at all)...<br/><br/>One thing I was also very surprised and never thought the movie would make it possible was the change the king of Rohan, Theoden, went through after meeting Gandalf again.... I never thought they could make it appear by such a difference between the before and the after but they did!!<br/><br/>They also picked a really nice actress for the role of Eowyn....Never thought there would be someone to be able to perform such a strong female character without making it look like she was taken from an action movie.<br/><br/>
Gollum/Smeagol was astounishing and I think he's the central character in this movie. WHat a great work they did with him.<br/><br/>finally, just one thing that I really wish I could have seen more of is the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog. In the book Tolkien made my imagination run wild with it....wished the movie would have done something like that too.<br/><br/>Well, these are just my opinions...<br/><br/>One more year........hope the 3rd part will be longer (it would be amazing to have a Retur of The King 4 hours long!!!!!) and I also hope they won't cut the final part of the book (spoiler: it doesn't end with Frodo destroying the ring) but also show his coming back to the Shire, the Grey Havens and Sam's return home.<br/><br/>By they way......this movie would be very hard to see (wouldn't understand a lot of things) if I hadn't seen the extra 30 minutes of the extended edition of the first movie."

I dont understand at all why watching hobbits walk around for 3 hours is exciting .. or a rollercoaster ride.. or even a bit interesting. Some of the special effects were good.. I must say .. but if thats all that was good about the movie .. then it sucks. I could have cared less if any of the main characters died. I expected sooo much more out of this movie.

","It is very difficult to imagine the task that lay ahead of 38 year old Peter Jackson, when we went off to simultaneously film all the LOTR entries. It is amazing that anyone would green light a $300MM project like this. FOTR was nearly perfect and TTT is even better - a masterpiece if I may use a tired word. JRR Tolkien gave us this world, and Peter Jackson has brilliantly brought it to life.<br/><br/>In every measure I can name, this film is equal to or superior to its predecessor. Effects, dialogue, battles, action, intrigue, and of course Gollum. <br/><br/>The battle of Helm's Deep, which occupies most of the third act of this film, is tour-de-force. Every computer generated character is believable and there are more kills on the battlefield than in Braveheart.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of two of the CGI characters. Gollum is perhaps the most fascinating creature I have seen. Pathetic and sympathetic, repulsive and lovable all at once. The best scene takes place when Gollum converses with his evil self. The other is Treebeard, the wise Ent, the shepherd of the forest, a talking tree that rises to battle to defend and avenge his brethren. The scene where one of the battling Ents dunks his head in the flood waters to extinguish himself is one the films great moments.<br/><br/>You can argue until you are blue in the face whether or not this is true to the book. That's irrelevant. We are fortunate to be witnessing a trilogy that will be regaled as one of movie history's key events. This is the only sequel in recent memory that surpassed its predecessor at the box office, which is proof of the fact that it is a better, more engaging and more entertaining film. **** out of ****."

","I have read the books  a few times. I am a very big Tolkien's fan but the movie can't satisfy all viewers, but after I have seen the movie I realized that the movie isn't  bad but wasn't great either. Anyway here are my critics about Two Towers<br/><br/>The plot is manipulated to get the audience attention and I know that is very different from viewing a movie and reading a book.<br/><br/>The first thing that is crucial on a movie is time. But in the movie Peter Jackson thought that it was a good idea to change different things, personally I don't have any problem with that, but he remove important things and then it is filled with some unnecessary stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the story. First P.J. extend the story too much, contrary from the first book that he did a excellent job deleting some unnecessary material that in the movie is impossible to show. But in this movie  for no reason he change his storytelling style. (he ended FOTR on the first chapter of Two Tower and on Two Tower he did not end the book).<br/><br/>The exorcism from Gandalf to Theoden was a bad idea because Grima Wormtonge poison his mind but he didn't necessary put a spell on him why, because if it is true that Saruman have Theoden possessed there is no use for Grima on Rohan.<br/><br/>The elves on Helm's Deep. First of all if you are aware about the details the character Haldir says `I am send by Master Elrond from Rivendale to honor the old alliance' Haldir on the books and in the first movie was from Lothlorien not from Rivendale, second the elves were blaming  the humans that the ring  still exist. The elves didn't help the humans for many reasons. In the movie I feel very uncomfortable when Elrond appear, the character magic from the book and from the first movie really disappeared.<br/><br/>The credibility from the ents were on the floor. They were very wise in the books but in the movie they were dumb. The young hobbits manipulate a very old character (threebeard) and they do with him whatever they want.<br/><br/>The strange incident that happened with Aragon and the cheesy scene with Arwen last an eternity and it was a little excuse to extend the story (remember time is very limited on a movie and there is no need for that waste of time).<br/><br/>The movie announce the arrival of Gandalf that take away all the feeling and the aspect surprise of the scene.<br/><br/>After all I think that Two Towers is a good movie after all and we have to wait to see him finish his work because on Return of the King he have to do a miracle to fix those mistakes that has been made on Two Towers (remember he still had a lot of material for only 3 hours)."

"eljambon","Null","0","0","10 January 2003"," could not have been a better sequel
","When has adaptation been the only requirement in determining the quality of a film? Last time I have checked, directing, script, and acting were the primary requirements. This commentary is less a review and more a rant as to why a weak adaptation does not make for a weak movie. First and foremost, regardless of how good this movie was people can't help be a little dissapointed. Before everyone was deflowered by the fellowship there was a sense of excitement and awe as to what was to be expected. The fellowship delivered in every respect. Everything was new and exciting, thus with recycled footage, the eye candy does not have the same impact. But this is just a minor problem. Another key issue lies in the ending of the fellowship. People were left wanting more, and could only rely on their sense of imagination as to what would occur the next installment. What this meant was expectations that could never be met, after all, we have been given a most excellent tour of middle earth in the fellowship and now its time to deal with plot. Finally because it was the first installment we were much more forgiving as to how the book was modified, in fact for every change made in two towers I could name two changes in the fellowship.<br/><br/>My first viewing resulted in analysing the s*** out of the two towers and thus I could not enjoy it. The so called mortal sins commited would have to be the weaknesses found in King Theodens and Faramirs character. Theoden was a much more confident king in the book and much more likeable and Faramir was much stronger willed than his brother, Boromir, and does not succumb to the power of the ring nor take the ring to Osgiliath. The next is the chapters ommited i.e. Aragorn and crew heading to Isengard and Shelob the spider bitch. The venial sins commited are due to typical blockbuster formula. Gimli's comic relief, the love conflict between Aragorn, Arwen and Eowyn, the elfs assisting at helms deep and Eomer/Gandalf to the rescue at the end. These follow the typical Hollywood formula and there is no sense in fighting them they always were and always will be present.<br/><br/>When adapting a novel it cannot be done word for word for there are qualities that make a book good which would make a movie bad and vice-versa. After a most excellent war seen the movie had to be ended any furthur action sequence would have seemed less significant and second rate not to mention the viewers need for a break.<br/><br/>People's concern with the so called craming that will have to be done in the third installment need no worry for it is the shortest book and really not a whole lot happens. I mean for how long could you watch Sam and Frodo hide from orcs before climbing Mount Doom? This will most likely be shortened to spend more time in developing Aragorns character. And if one can remember how much time was spent in Hobbiton at the begining of the fellowship, this was merely to suck the purests in if you think they will change the end of the book you are mistaken they will have have to end the movie just as detailed.<br/><br/>As far as the two towers is concerned it was a damn good movie. With the exception of the Hollywood cheese,(Legolas surfing on the shield was utter shite) acting was tight, directing near flawless(given the amount of jumping from story line to story line it could not have been any smoother, and the script was better than the fellowship. If anyone cannot forgive Peter Jackson for modifying the book should go watch Harry Potter and stop p***ing me off."

","Thank you, Peter Jackson.  Thank you for bringing things to the screen that I was not able to imagine from the book in my mind's eye for some reason.<br/><br/>Respects paid, I'd like to comment on the film.  It was fantastic.  I grew up on the books (as many reviewers have, naturally), and I have loved every minute of both Fellowhip and Two Towers.  I am not a Tolkein snob, though, and I don't care that they cut certain things short or out entirely.  I understand that this is a movie, and it's Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, and I'm okay with other people's interpretations of things.<br/><br/>I was particularly excited about seeing Gollum, the Ents, the kingdom of Rohan, and Shelob when I first sat in the theatre. Shelob did not appear, but that's okay, they left off at a really good point, leaving the viewers who haven't read the books saying, ""Wait, who the hell is this 'she' that Gollum's speaking about????""<br/><br/>I was really impressed with Gollum.  When he smiled when Frodo first called him Smeagol, I was creeped out.  And then I remembered it was CGI stuff that created him and I got even more goosebumps.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen more with the Ents (not only 'cause they're cool, but Dominic Monaghan is wildly attractive).  I would have also liked to see them be bigger, but this isn't my interpretation of things.<br/><br/>Rohan....  When I read the books as a young'n, I LOVED Rohan.  I couldn't (and still can't) help but feel that if I lived in that fictitious world, I would have lived in that kingdom.  Hell, I'd give anything to play Eomer.  Anyway, at first I was a little disappointed with it.  I pictured the kingdom being more majestic and regal, like the horses they master.  I pictured marble halls, a lot of blue, and cleaner surroundings, but after I saw the movie for a second time, I got used to it.  I am growing to love it, actually.  The Norweigan fiddle they used as a theme of sorts for Rohan was just incredible.<br/><br/>Dear me, this is getting long.  Okay, in short (too late), this is an incredible cast.  Fantastic performances from Dominic Monaghan (not just because he's attractive), Ian McKellan (duh), David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill, Craig Parker, Elijah Wood, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Again, thank you Peter Jackson.

Come on, people!  Read a book for once in your life!  This movie, just like the first one, is a masterpiece!  As a person who as read the trilogy several times over, I can honestly say that Tolkien would be proud. Peter Jackson has brilliantly carried over Tolkien's amazing vision to the big screen (Yes, you young idiots, the story was a book before it was a movie).  Sure there are pieces of the story missing!  But would you really want to sit through a nine hour movie!?  The meat of the story is there...and it's there in all it's glory.

","I'm not a die-hard fan of Tolkien and deviations from the original idea, when well staged and performed, are surely welcomed and appreciated, but I must confess that this time I had great expectations and was disappointed. The film has lots of action and special effects and is very grandiose. It also has a fine storyline, flowing smoothly on, and is technically impeccable.  But in spite of all those merits, it has no soul and leaves me cold.  In contrast with the first installment, in which there was character and atmosphere building, and you left the theater with a feeling of euphoria, you make no emotional connection with any of the characters in The Two Towers, exception made for the endearing Gimli (Rhys-Jones), creepy Grima (Dourif's very good performance) and the animation character Gollum, which I must say, is the best thing on the film.  Others noticeable are McKellen, who manages to come alive as Gandalf with a wink, and Lee's screen presence which is always outstanding.  For the rest, I came out of the cinema with a feeling of having been cheated.  I just hope that the third installment is as good as the first was."

Gollum, as may others viewers have sugegsted, was an incredible work of CGI/real character brilliance and gave real life, humor and humanity to Smeagol/Gollum. Gimli also added a bit of comic relief throughout the movie which was good to break up the intensity. The film left me more emotionally mved to sadness than the first, however it was extremely well done.<br/><br/>Brad Dourif as Wormtounge excelled and liked the casting of Miranada Otto as Eowyn. Bernard Hill was a different Theoden to how I perceived him in the book, however was put in a good performance.<br/><br/>I found that the dialouge was a bit heavier this time with some of it I could recall straight out of the book. However, I didnt enjoy how PC treated the relationship between Arwen / Aragorn went or how Elrond dispises humans. I also didn't like how the Elves turned up at Helms Deep or how Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath. My idea of the ""rolling hills of Rohan"" was not really what appeared on the screen either.<br/><br/>Howver, apart from these things, I'm sure the second installment will grow on me over time and it kept on reminding me of the second installment in another great Trilogy, Star Wars (IV, V and VI)."

","I went and saw the second film in the trilogy the day it came out here in Australia (26 December 02) and I just have to say the air in the cinema was electric, we all cheered as the lights went down and cheered again when the New Line Cinema logo appeard. Peter Jackson's take on the trilogy has only gotten better with The Two Towers. Considering how brilliant The Fellowship of the Ring was this had a lot of expectations to live up to and by far it met every one of them. The battle of Helms Deep, what more can I say then mind-blowing, Gollum and Treebeard were fantastic and the addition of cast members Bernard Hill, Karl Urban, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif and David Wenham fantastic. Andy Serkis is a brilliant actor and made you pity Gollum at times and then at the same time feel repulsed by him. By far the hobbits are still my favourite characters, I loved Merry's speech to the ents about being part of Middle Earth, it is by far one of my favourite lines in the film. Sam was gorgeous and of course Elijah Wood brilliant as Frodo, not forgetting Pippin, who was great too. However I do believe that Ian McKellen (Gandalf) and Karl Urban (Eomer) didn't get enough screen time, but hopefully Return of the King will change that. All in all a brilliant film, I didn't even realises the three hours it went for. 10/10!"

","In a totally fictitious Middle Ages, peopled by men, elves,monsters, dwarfs, moving trees and other more or less strange beings, another episode of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil unfolds itself in a succession of fantasy and dream sceneries where terror and poetry combine in a fantastic symbiosis. On the other hand some dialogues and monologues as well as some characters reach an almost Shakespearean grandeur. This movie has some images of rare beauty and some others which fill us with awe and wonder. And what about the story? Well the story is the weakest part of all this with the usual plot flaws and a lot of unlikely facilities in the outcome of certain plot scenes about which I will not dwell now to avoid being a spoiler. But who cares after all? The usual spectator of this kind of movies only wants to be recreated during the projection time and devoted to all the emotions that the various incidents produce in his mind. It's therefore intrinsically one more movie aimed at entertaining the spectator and not at making him think or at conveying any message beyond the simple one according to which Good must always triumph over Evil."

"HeKS","Null","0","0","9 January 2003"," Yeah, so he changed some parts . . . but with reason.
","I've never actually written a review for IMDB before but I felt the need in this case for three reasons: 1) I loved the books; 2) I've loved both movies so far; and 3) Because I just read a review by someone saying you could not do both.<br/><br/>This person mainly took issue with the changing of certain parts and the absence of others. I'm briefly going to address a few of the differences between the book THE TWO TOWERS and Peter Jackson's cinematic interpretation of it and why I feel the differences were, in the vast majority of cases, more than justified. I may touch on one or two SPOILERS in the process so readers beware.<br/><br/>The first point I would like to address is that of the length of the three books. This reviewer claimed it was ridiculous for Peter Jackson (hereafter PJ) to have left some of the latter portions of the Two Towers (hereafter TT) story for inclusion in The Return of the King (hereafter ROTK) because ROTK was already the longest volume. This, in fact, is an inaccurate statement. While ROTK does contain the most pages, a large portion of those pages are dedicated to the Appendices. In reality, ROTK contains the LEAST number of pages actually dedicated to the story - that being 374. The Fellowship of the Ring (hereafter FOTR) contains 509 pages dedicated to the main story, making it the longest. TT rings in at 435 story pages. Right from the start then we can see that ROTK can reasonably borrow some story from TT to make it match the length and style of the first two movies.<br/><br/>To further support the extraction of some story from TT for placement in ROTK is the fact that TT is actually the most in-depth and involved of the three books (though some may disagree with me I suppose). I say that for a few simple reasons. FOTR is the beginning of a number of stories which prepare to diverge and ROTK is the conclusion of a number of stories which once again converge. TT, on the other hand, is the book in which these divergent stories must be dealt with and developed.<br/><br/>As most people are aware, it is almost always impossible to make a movie exactly mirror a book. There is much that reads well but does not film well. An example mentioned by John-Rhys Davies (Gimli the Dwarf) is that in the book of FOTR, Gimli asks Galadriel for a strand of hair from her head as a gift and she gives him three. That may read well, but imagine trying to film that. Zoom in as she plucks three hairs from her head and then hands them to Gimli? Doesn't make for a very nice scene, nor would it even be possible to SEE the hairs. In the extended version of the FOTR film they deal with it differently and leave it out of the theatrical version altogether.<br/><br/>In the book of TT, Frodo complains about the weight of the ring countless times and keeps stumbling because of it. Had they shown it in the movie any more than they did it would have just become annoying.<br/><br/>Here's a bit of a spoiler. In the book of TT, King Theoden's nephew, Eomer, and all of the Rohirrim, accompany the King and his people to Helm's Deep, along with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. Eomer fights alongside them at the battle of Helm's Deep and then at dawn Gandalf arrives on the crest of the hill with Erkenbrand of Westfold and all his men and turns the tide of the battle. In the movie, Eomer and the Rohirrim are banished from Rohan by Grima Wormtongue and ride away North. At dawn, after the battle of Helm's Deep has carried on all night, Gandalf arrives on the crest of the hill to save the day with Eomer and the Rohirrim. This may seem like a useless change from the book but it is not. In the book of TT, after showing up to help with the battle of Helm's Deep, Erkenbrand is a fairly minor character with not much time devoted to him, if any at all (he may play a part in the battle during ROTK but I can't quite remember). This change was simply a way of keeping the main storyline and events very similar to the book without having to take the time to introduce a brand new but minor character. Consider, this movie already had the task of introducing Gollum/Smeagol, Theoden, Eomer, Eowyn, Grima Wormtongue, Faramir, Treebeard and the Ents and explaining the Return of Gandalf. That's at least eight major characters . .. seven of them completely new. There simply would not be enough time or enough value in introducing such a character as Erkenbrand, hence PJ slightly adjusted the flow of events to put more light on one of the major characters.<br/><br/>As far as Aragorn and the so-called love stories . . . the only love story that is MEANT to be a love story is that of Arwen and Aragorn. Even this storyline - taken from the appendices - is meant to give us further insight to Aragorn and his past and his turmoil. The Aragorn/Arwen plot is not meant to provide a light quality to the movie or simply to attract people who may not be otherwise interested. It serves a purpose. It shows that even love, which in these types of stories (and hopefully in real life) can have the strongest ability to motivate us and keep us hoping has been darkened and soiled with doubt by the shadow of Mordor. The relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn is not a romance at all. Eowyn says early on that she fears a cage and having no chance or hope for valor. She sees the possibility of attaining these things at Aragorn's side. This is evidenced by the relationship she ends up in during ROTK. Neither of these storylines should leave us feeling warm and fuzzy, they should have an uncomfortable feeling to them.<br/><br/>This reviewer also claimed both FOTR and TT were badly directed and edited. I don't think I even need to respond to that comment. The actors did magnificent jobs and whose vision do you think they were carrying out. the LOTR movies have been two of the most stunning films I can remember without crossing the border to being just an excuse for CG effects.<br/><br/>I think that these movies are a credit to the books and could not have been done better. I praise PJ for his work and look forward to the ROTK movie with anticipation. Clearly it is possible for someone to love both the books and the movies . . . lest we forget that almost everybody who worked on the films were fans of Tolkien and had read the books numerous times.<br/><br/>Go see the movie and enjoy it!<br/><br/>Hope this wasn't too long :)"
"Klausfiend","Null","0","0","14 January 2003"," Good, but not great.
","Unlike the last Tolkien film Jackson made, on this one, he doesn't adhere to the ""show, don't tell"" principle, and there are numerous (and rather annoying) ad-libs and editions to the plot. Without attempting to sound too much like a Tolkien fanatic, I have to take issue with a few parts (which, while not disturbing the main plot threads, nevertheless change the tone of the overall story) ... so, if you haven't seen it, stop reading this now:<br/><br/>Okay, people who haven't yet seen it looking away? Hey, a few of you are cheating - so look away already ...<br/><br/><ul><li>The trip to Helm's Deep, after the evacuation of Rohan - there was no battle. It seemed less like an interesting plot addition and more of a ham-fisted attempt to make the show more exciting (which is, quite honestly, unnecessary - the story is already pretty damned interesting).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The changes in characterization of Sam and Frodo were also rather unnecessary. Sam and Frodo both understand Gollum's true nature, and while tolerating him - neither trusts him - and the film fails to reflect their accurate understanding of the broken and unredeemed character that Gollum is, in pursuit of some mealy ""everyone can be redeemed"" moralizing. Get over it. Some are evil by design, some by accident, Gollum happens to be one destroyed by his own moral weakness - and the film fails to accurately convey that. Frodo is also not so much seduced by the power of the ring, but more driven to despair - he is pure in spirit, but the nature of the ring begins to corrupt and destroy the hope that he brings with him - the very hope that will see him through the bitter end. His apparent willingness to surrender the ring to the Nazgul at Osgilliath (who thought that one up, anyway?) is completely bogus, and does not properly reflect Frodo's true nature - the humble servant, charged with an almost impossible task, but willingly accepting of his duty, and willing to see it done, despite what it may cost him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As for Faramir - again, the screenplay fails to accurately convey that he is quite different from his brother; his brother was ambitious and proud. Faramir is humble and honourable - he knows what must be done, and is not arrogant like his brother, who assumed that the power of the ring could be turned against its master - a mistake which cost him his life. Tolkien generally does not allow his characters a morally ambiguous fate, and by portraying Faramir as cut of the same cloth as his brother, it opens the possibility for him to be similarly corrupted by the same thing, and eventually to suffer the same fate. This is quite simply not true, and to do so would ruin one of the finest of Tolkien's characters, and distort the story.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Ents, too, are never unsure of what must be done; they understand their fate, should they fail to act, and they recognize that they, too, must struggle against evil, even to a bitter end. The cheesy pseudo-green moralizing is an irritating distraction.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sappy love triangle between Eowyn and Aragon is pointless, and smacks of the kind of phony romanticism that has made Hollywood famous.</li></ul><br/><br/>However, I will say that those complaints notwithstanding, the film still manages to come together quite spectacularly - especially the battle of Helm's Deep (the appearance of the Elves aside). Jackson manages to portray very well the almost insurmountable odds the people of Rohan face, and their courage and indomitability even in the face of certain death.<br/><br/>So ... on the whole, a decent job - but not as good a depiction as the first installment. I sincerely hope that the screenwriters don't take further liberties, and create an ambiguous mish-mash of cloying sentimentality and cheap aphorisms for the sake of a bigger audience. I think it rather presumptuous for screenwriters to assume that they can tell a better story than one of the best."

The scenery is pretty much the same as the first - in fact, pretty much everything is the same apart from the story and the fact that this movie doesn't focus so much on Frodo but on Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the dwarf (John Rhys-Davies).<br/><br/>The fight scenes are also realistic and the costumes are great.<br/><br/>Basically, if you loved the first film, you'll probably love this one too.

"bpilgrim2002","Null","0","0","9 January 2003"," A Tolkien fan gives credit despite disappointments with changes.
","Let me first say that I am a fan of the author, J.R.R. Tolkien.  I am not a fanatic who memorizes Elven languages or hobbit genealogies, I am a fan of Tolkien and his brilliant works including `The Lord of the Rings'.  I feel that in coming decades and centuries it is quite likely Tolkien will be considered a giant of English Literature rivaled only by Dickens and Shakespeare. At the least Tolkien will be remembered as one of the most important literary figures of the 20th century.   Although I don't feel any of the artists who worked on this production come anywhere near Tolkien in creative genius (Peter Jackson included), I do give credit to the movies for turning on a whole generation to Tolkien's written works.  Additionally, I don't care what the reason is (whether someone has a crush on Elijah Wood or Orlando Bloom, enjoyed the movie making from a technology standpoint or any other reason) I am grateful to the movie for creating great new enthusiasm for the author's works.  Whether Tolkien would have accepted Peter Jackson's interpretation or not is beyond my knowledge and beyond my realm of speculation.  I can only comment about what I felt. Here it is:<br/><br/>First, I must say that I found many of the changes in the movie annoying and sometimes unnecessary.  Yet I only found a few of these changes very disturbing. One of the reasons for this is that most of these changes weren't done in way that was too distracting.   For instance, I thought that it was very annoying and completely unnecessary that Elrond sent Elves to fight at Helm's Deep.  The elves filed in very quickly and so it did not become too distracting.<br/><br/>However, the part where Elrond and Arwen discuss her relationship with Aragorn and the Elves possible role in the wars of men disturbing and poorly written.  This was the case with much of the dialogue  in the movie in which direct quotes were not pulled from the work.  Also, some of the dialogue between Merry and Treebeard was ridiculous especially when he and Pippin trick Treebeard into going towards Isengard.  The old Ent said something to the effect of  `It's nice to go south now and then' or something very much like that.  Any true fan of Tolkien had to cringe at this.<br/><br/>Every bit as uncomfortable was Frodo's pep talk with Gollum/Smeagol. While this was somewhat necessary in fairness to the author's intent it is poorly written for the movie.  Frodo: `You were not unlike a hobbit at one time'. Blagh!  Then at the end of the movie, Gandalf's character leads us into the next movie. To paraphrase: `Now begins the battle of Middle Earth'.  This was simply awful.<br/><br/>I was also annoyed with the attack by the Orcs on Wargs on the way to Helm's Deep which led to Aragorn's temporary fall.  It was not need and his return was unbelievably predictable to anyone who read the books.  Imagine doing `The Return of the King' without the king!  Still this was only mildly annoying and I did not find it too distracting. Yet wouldn't it have been better to have used that time later in the movie and had Gandalf expel Saruman from the order?! One other note:  Gimli's character becoming a focus for humor really didn't bother me much, but the line in which Gimli tells Legolas that he picked the wrong place to stand when the battle at Helm's Deep was about to begin was perhaps the most INANE line in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Although I didn't like all the changes in the plot and I thought some of the screenplay was below standard, the acting and the casting were both superb. Ian McKellan was terrific as Gandalf, as was Brad Dourif as Wormtongue, David Wenham as Faramir and Bernard Hill as Theoden.  I give Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortenson good ratings.  The only cast members I really didn't like were Dominic Monaghan and Sean Astin.  I do realize, however, how difficult it must have been to cast the hobbits.  I thought Liv Tyler was good as Arwen, I just thought the character was overdone.<br/><br/>Miranda Otto was perfect (and perfectly cast) as Eowyn.  She was fabulous in portraying both inner and outer beauty. I'm quite sure I would not have been at all happy if this part was not well cast or acted.  I just hope that in the final installment, Eowyn's character gets the glory intended for it. If not, I think it will completely ruin most of the good feelings I have for these movies.<br/><br/>It was smart to go back and forth to Frodo and Sam's struggles.   It would have been terribly boring on film to watch their quest for the Black Gate let by Gollum if had been done in one long stretch.    I also like the pace of the movie.  NOTHING DRAGGED.<br/><br/>Having said all of this as someone with a huge amount of respect for the creator of Middle Earth and all its characters, I also must point out that I feel overall this was an extremely entertaining movie, not despite Peter Jackson and his crew, but because of it.  As well as the overall acting, the settings, the costumes, and the action in the movie were all done in a first class manner and I found the movie exciting.  As I mentioned in great detail my dissatisfactions with the movie, I realize that putting this work into movie form was a monumental task and I give Mr. Jackson a great deal of credit for putting together a first class project depicting J.R.R. Tolkien's works and adding millions of moviegoers to the ever growing collection of Tolkien's readers!"
"stamper","8","0","0","13 January 2003"," A waste of money or the dawn of an epic Trilogy?
","I must start by saying, that at the end of this review you will get two ratings from me. One for the first time I saw the film (December 19th) and a second one for the second time I saw it (January 12th). I watch films like this (and Star Wars films) two times in the cinema, because I feel that I am too overwhelmed by the visuals at the first time to really capture the whole film. Another reason, why I do not enjoy The Lord of the Rings as much at my first view, is that I've read the books. This means that I (while watching the film) start wondering how they've done this and that and ask myself: What came next?'. This of course prevents me from getting deep into' the film, but unlike other films it does not totally spoil my viewing experience. The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers (together with a limited number of other films) are the only ones, that can make me shed a tear, even when I'm not that able to plunge into' the story.<br/><br/>
After the big success and the quality adaption, that The Fellowship of the Ring was, the expectations for the Two Towers were enormous. Not only for the general public, but for me also, even despite the fact that I thought that The Two Towers was the worst' book of the trilogy ( with The Return being just a notch better than The Fellowship of the Ring). I obviously cannot say yet, that The Two Towers is my least favorite film, but what I can say, is that it was not as good as the first film. This has nothing to do with the actors (even though Ian McKellen isn't as great as he was in The Fellowship of the Ring), the effects or the story. Contrary to what some might think now it has also nothing to do with the fact that Peter Jackson added a few scenes,left some out and even delayed the appearance of Shelob until the last film although it has something to do with the artistic freedom' Peter Jackson permitted himself in making this film. The only thing that really bugs' me about this film is (and I know I'm going to sound like one of those idiotic Tolkien freaks) that it did not quite grasp the essence of the book, of the whole trilogy for that matter, for The Lord of the Rings is basically about Frodo's quest to destroy the Ring of power in the fires of mount doom and it is my opinion that this part of the story did not get enough attention throughout the film. While I was reading the book, I could fully understand Frodo's difficulty with the ever heavier growing ring, that started to poison his mind and caused a lot of struggle within Frodo. A struggle in which he was all by himself, for nobody knew what it was like and nobody could help him bear this ever growing burden. Peter Jackson (obviously) tried to bring that part of Frodo's feelings onto the screen, but in my eyes he failed. The terror of the Ringwraith's and the inner struggle within Frodo were much better depicted in The Fellowship of the Ring than they were in this film despite the fact that it was an essential part of the 2nd book of the trilogy. Now I know that this film has been cut (as The Fellowship of the Ring had been) to reach a wider audience and to earn back the BIG bucks that were invested in the making of this trilogy, so I can only hope that Peter Jackson cut essential parts out of the film instead of forgetting to forge a good second chapter of what is and could become an epic and classic trilogy on paper and on film respectively.<br/><br/>

Unfortunitly, the storyline is very slow, and at times, very boring. Peter Jackson has done a great job transforming and tinkering Tolkeins work into something movie viewers can enjoy, but, sad as it may be, even Jackson must have struggled to turn a story so mind numbingly tedious into a screenplay. Dont get me wrong, the main events depicted in the story are interesting - its just that these good bits are intersperced with some very boring and rather unnecissary storytelling. Despite Jacksons best efforts, these bits are evident on the screen and this is why the movie is too long.<br/><br/>I have read comments raving about what a great acheivement the battle of Helms Deep was. I dont know where these people have been living, but the Battle of Helms Deep was not as amazing and jaw droping as some say. Infact, it was really just a run of the mill battle sequence which can be seen in many movies to have been released in the last few years- the battle at the end of 'Attack of the Clones' was just as good, and in saying this 'The Two Towers' was no better than the latest Star Wars film.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10."

","As a movie, this is a brilliant piece of work. It's complex, well-crafted, and painstakingly put together. As an adaptation however, The Two Towers is awful. Perhaps it's just because I'm a Tolkien purist, but I found the missing plot points to be upsetting; not only do I feel that they were co-opted by what seems to be a better version of ""The Exorcist-Power-of-Christ-Compels-You"" scene(s), but there's probably a whole generation of people out there who're going to accept the movie as truth and not realize how much they're missing. The breaking of Saruman's staff, the loss of the palantir (for those of you who haven't read the books, that's the glowing stone Saruman is so frequently depicted with, holding it under his palm); the actual ""arousal"" of the Ents, which in the movie came across as sheer bad reverse-psychology (yes, of course, we'll trick the eons-old wise beings, aren't we clever?). And just out of curiousity, when did Faramir become such a putz? What about the death of Theoden? The battle with the Nazgul? Eowyn's sacrifice? And why in the WORLD would Elrond (who is half-Elven and half human) decide that he despises all humans? There's a curious inconsistency, within both the movie's ""romance"" idea, which is absolutely stupid. It doesn't happen in the book, and it shouldn't be in the movie--it's misleading and quite frankly, destroys the chemistry between two (unnamed) characters.<br/><br/>In all fairness, I have to admit that as a cinematic piece, I found that ""The Two Towers"" was quite spectacular. While I hesitate to gush and rave as many do, that this is ""THE BEST FILM EVER!!!"", it must be said that you could certainly do far worse with your money. The acting is excellent; Gollum/Smeagol is characterized in an absolutely fascinating manner, with a wonderful theatrical device; the battle with the Balrog is just phenomenal, and the vistas breathtaking. Again, it has to be said--the movie is terrific; the adaptation leaves much to be desired."

","Looking at reviews worldwide, they tend to focus on all the great elements of this movie as if existing on their own. They talk about how brilliant Gollum is portrayed both technically aswell as acting-wise (which is true), or they talk about how the battle at helm's deep is the biggest battle-scene ever produced on celluloid (wich is also true). But my main praise for this movie is that it works as a complete picture, and it's sum is even greater than it's parts.<br/><br/>With the two towers you've got a story which is, well, a nightmare to translate to screen. No beginning, no real end, two different storylines, told in such a way that they don't seem to connect (which in the book is no problem, but it just doesn't work in a motion picture like this).<br/><br/>
But when I look at Peter Jackson's film, I cannot see any weakness in it's story. Even though it hasn't got a real beginning and ending, it does open with a bang, and ends with a BIG bang, and the picture comes to a more satisfying conclusion than FOTR.<br/><br/>Next to this all the technical elements are once again flawless. Shore's score works, in my opinion, just that bit better than his FOTR score, the FX are not even in the same league as FOTR's, their waaaay above them. Acting is great once again, with special praise to the actors portraying Aragorn, Theoden and Gollum.<br/><br/>So is this movie perfect? Well close, in the same way FOTR was. But that's a personal opinion. I do understand that people don't like the change to Faramir's character, even though I liked them, and I do understand people don't always appreciate Gimli's humor, even though I thought it worked extremely well. Also I have to say that the ending is in some parts a tad unconvincing and unsatisfying. The way Faramir changes his view seems abrupt, and you really don't see much of the characters reactions after Helm's deep, but that is probably saved for ROTK, wich will surely be even better.....<br/><br/>All in all, I have to say, I DO like this one better than FOTR, because it's tighter told, has a more satisfying conclusion, is much more breathtaking, if it was ever possible, and it just flows better. But the best compliment might be; It is a perfect followup to FOTR, expanding on it, while remaining faithfull to the feeling of part 1."

","Well what can i say that hasnt been said before. I love this film, so what if Peter Jackson doesnt have every inch of Tolkiens book down because he's got most of it, and he expands into areas which i personally felt were missing or bunged off into the appendicies, and i cant see what all the uproar is about. Remember people its a film, a film of a long book, which i can honestly say is not without fault in itself. Some areas would translate very difficultly onto film. The Portrayal of Faramir disappointed me a bit, because i liked his character of a noble man in the book, but his greed and power lust is there to show that men are not without fault, and he comes good in the end. The battle scene with the Wargs is a very nice addition, and Legolas does that cool thing on the horse. Shelob will turn up, stop writing threatening letters to Peter Jackson, give the poor guy a break, he's dedicated years of his life to these films and he's done a superb job so far. Now its another year of post production!!!"

","One thing that I find people having an extremely difficult time realizing is that the movie cannot in any way be exactly true to the book, there is absolutely no time for it. This movie was funded by a company that is smart and knows that no regular person is going to sit for longer than three hours in a movie theater. And they have money to make. But it was directed by a huge fan of Tolkein who knew that there are many fans just like him that he wanted to please. But he also had to please people who knew nothing about the books. Yes, it's sad what they took out and what they changed, but I am completely conifident that Peter Jackson changed it in ways that none of us could have imagined. With a project of this size you have to hit 5 birds with one stone every chance you get. And yes, there are small beautiful things that were left out. But I saw the Fellowship of the Ring and I hadn't even read or knew anything about the books, but after I saw it, there was nothing that could keep me from reading the book 24/7. These movies make fans happy, (if they will let themselves) and make non-fans curious, and I think that that is exactly what Peter was going for. I don't envy his job of trying to accomplish that, but admire him for doing a very good job."
"mitchell_k81","8","0","0","7 January 2003"," I demand some explanations from Peter Jackson
","I hadn't read the story until last summer.  I read it all.  I hadn't given it a second look by the time Two Towers came out.  One thing about the storyline needs to be addressed ASAP:  THERE WERE NO ELVES AT HELM'S DEEP! Nowhere in the text are any more than one elf, Legolas, even mentioned. There is no mention of the Last Alliance of Men and Elves at the defeat of Sauron, like in the prologue of Fellowhip.  Eowyn was not at Helm's Deep, but that addition to the story is understandable, it makes female parts bigger. There is no mention of the Entwash and no mention of when Merry and Pippin drink from it, they end up being four or five inches taller than they were before drinking the water.  The Entmoot was smaller in the movie, but digital characters take a lot of time to render, so that is understandable as well. I think that New Line and the producers of this movie messed big time even before releasing the movie.  They showed Gandalf in the trailers.  That is one of the best parts of all the Middle Earth stories, when Gandalf comes back from death and you think it's Saruman.  By showing in the trailers that he is alive, it removes almost all of the suspense.  I think that this was an idea of the people of New Line more than it was on the part of Mr. Jackson.  I think he would have realized this but New Line had the final say.  I hope this was the case. I give this theatrical version an 8 out of ten because of all the missing stuff and craptacular addition of the elves at Helm's Deep."

","The Two Towers is actually a notch down from The Fellowship of the Ring, but make no mistake: it's still an extraordinary film. The first hour or so is just a teeny, tiny bit ponderous, but other than that the film is virtually perfect in every other way.<br/><br/>The battle sequences are breathtaking. The battle at Helm's Deep contains copious blood-spilling and incredible special effects, making the audience believe beyond all doubt that 10,000 orcs are beseiging 300 weary warriors. In actual fact, most of what is on screen in computer enhanced, but it looks and sounds so much like a real battle that it's impossible to spot the difference.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly excellent. John Rhys-Davies, as Gimli the dwarf, seems a bit too broad and plays the part slightly too much for laughs. However, the rest of the cast rise to the wonderful script, etching out memorable performances.

","before you jump on me for blasphemy, i rated this movie 8 out of 10.  i'm not going to go into what i liked about it.  suffice it to say that i feel it was pretty complete, very well acted, and of course the production is incredible.  almost perfect.<br/><br/>so just let me give you 5 reasons why it's not 10/10:<br/><br/>1. the CG grandness is ANNOYING (but at least not as annoying as in the Fellowship).  how many times must we take a flight through various caverns and structures, rotating impossibly around the towers, basically the stuff of the Back To The Future ride at Universal or the Star Wars ride at Disney. are movies going to learn from video game cut-scenes and computer graphic demos?  or shouldn't it be the other way around?  i can forgive this tho, CG is still fairly young and i'm praying that CG directors will finally get off the ""we can do it therefore we should"" and start thinking about ART.<br/><br/>2. Why was Gimli turned into comic relief?  To reach some strange audience? do the producers think the movie wouldn't sell if we didn't make fun of a short guy?  uncool.  just uncool.  Gimli is a dark and tragic character in the *REAL* LOTR.  i cannot forgive this.<br/><br/>3. all those sad women and children at Helmsgate.  Awwwwww.  what a waste of screen time.  reminded me of the horrors of Mad Max Beyond the Thunderdome and the SCI FI channel version of Dune.  ugh.  edit that filler out.  put in more dialog to explain the reasons why Rohan and Gondor are not (yet) working together.  that was such an important part of the book and it's not well explained in the movie.<br/><br/>4. Aragorn's love life blown out of proportion.  a friend of mine says it's probably directed at the female viewers as Vigo is a hotty.  but again, an unnecessary drawing out of an already long movie.  but i can forgive this, Tolkien's Two Towers was pretty cold, a little love ain't a bad thing. just a little too much of it.  it broke the story apart too much.<br/><br/>5. Legolas skateboarding down the stairs while shooting his bow at the orcs. now this i cannot even fathom.  is Jackson MAD???  i know, 10 seconds in a 3+ hour movie.  but i almost screamed in anguish when i saw that.  it wasn't even well done.  it happens out of the blue and it's unclear even what Legolas was riding.  was it a shield?  a piece of wood?  an Element deck with Darkstar wheels?  those stupid stupid 360 frames of film.  we hates it. we hates it forever!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>the Two Towers was a very gloomy book.  a difficult read.  i can understand why Jackson would want to liven it up a bit.  but he went too far.  good thing there was enough in the movie to make up for it (gollum, the dead marshes, and the continuing ability for Jackson and his crew to tell a very difficult story in the visual medium)"
"mellonquendi","9","0","0","6 January 2003"," Great movie in many ways and a worthy follow-up to The Fellowship.
","(*minor spoilers*)<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has done it again! He has given us a splendid movie, which is moving, funny spectacular, imaginative and epic in scale. He keeps you engrossed in the story for the whole 3 hours and leaves you wanting more when the end-credits roll by.<br/><br/>Even though there are many similarities with the Fellowship when it comes to style, tone and general story elements, The Two Towers is also a very different movie-experience. And still Peter Jackson manages to reach the same quality standard set by its predecessor. Amazing!<br/><br/>
A great part of the movie is about the battle at Helm's Deep and it's preparations. Much has been said already about the greatness of the battle scenes. I have to agree with most critics. It's unparalleled! Spectacularly shot and executed. The whole build-up to the battle is tense, emotional, with great pieces of dialogue delivered by Theoden, Aragorn and Legolas.<br/><br/>
Another fairly large part shows Frodo's struggles with the ring, his emerging dark side, and the complications that the creature Gollum brings to the drama of his character. Of course it's also about the tragic figure of Gollum himself (a brilliantly created cgi-character), but it's especially interesting to see how Frodo and Gollum mirror each other. Sam is the stable figure in all this and has to make sure Frodo keeps his sanity. It's really wonderful to see the interaction between these three characters.<br/><br/>Then there is a smaller part dedicated to Merry and Pippin's meeting with the Ents (walking and talking trees), and Treebeard in particular. Even though the Ents didn't completely match the image I had of them prior to seeing the movie (I had imagined them as being really huge, like all the other trees in the forest while in the movie they were quite a bit smaller), they were still a joy to watch, and once they were lined up, getting ready for battle, I was totally buying their appearance. The battle of the Ents was one of the standout moments of the movie, I must say. Seeing the vengeance of these ents, hurtling rocks, squashing orks, and flooding Isengard, is really terrific! Still, there are many more enchanting and spectacular moments in the movie. Gandalf's fight with the Balrog, a warg attack (beasts looking like huge hyena's), two trolls opening the black gate, olifaunts (huge elephant-like creatures), I could go on.<br/><br/>The way Peter Jackson tells the separate stories works terrifically. The cutting between the different storylines is refreshing, makes for a good pace of the movie, and keeps you involved with every character. Halfway through, we even get a sequence in which we return to the Aragorn-Arwen love story (through a dream/flashback scene), and see appearances by Elrond and Galadriel. It doesn't distract from the rest. On the contrary: it is a nice and calm intermission in the midst of all the mayhem going on in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The overall tone of the movie is nicely balanced. Dramatic moments, action-sequences, dashes of humour, romance; Peter Jackson finds the time and place for all of these elements.<br/><br/>The movie isn't flawless though. For example, Gimli is portrayed as a funny dwarf who is clumsy and often can't keep up with the rest. Even though the funny moments work many times and he is still tough and ruthless with his axe, his character is a little too much of a comic relief. It doesn't do justice to his character. (Hopefully, Jackson will compensate this in the Return of the King. Then I can forgive him.) Other moments go a little over the top or get a bit corny. Then there are some scenes, which are not menacing enough (for example the first appearance of the nazgul on the winged creature), or need to be a little more fleshed out.<br/><br/>
In the end though, in the light of the whole movie, the weak points turn out to be minor quibbles. The amazing experience that is 'The Two Towers' is definitely no letdown. It is a work of art and can proudly stand next to 'The Fellowship Of the Ring'."

Good luck trying to keep up with all the changes, all the backstabbing, and all the fighting. Some rather amazing special effects.<br/><br/>One thing that amazed me though was the way that the theater delivered the sound. It all came from the front of the theater, even though there were speakers all around the audience. I felt cheated in this regard. I haven't read weather others had this same poor sound experience or not. Hopefully. it was just this screwy place and that isn't how the movie is being shipped out. Then, 20 minutes into the movie, the sound level dropped and your hearing people crunching popcorn and slurping drinks instead of the movie.

"ligross","Null","0","0","6 January 2003"," Better - but not for the right reasons
","I think Tolkien's trilogy is one of the most overrated works of literature ever produced.  And no I'm not stupid, and yes, I can read long books (I love Moby-Dick, one of the best black humor stories ever written).  I am, also, a fantasy fan.  I don't think they're bad books because I can't appreciate fantasy or philosophy, but simply because they're poorly written and plotted.  I made it 3/4 of the way through TFOTR before giving up. That said, I think Jackson's films are a VAST improvement over the books, and the second film much better than the first.  Why?  Because Jackson gives me pretty pictures and one very fine Viggo Mortensen to look at for three hours.  Distracted by the pretty landscape and Aragorn's cheekbones, I can ignore the fact that character development is non-existent and emotional manipulation runs rampant.  LOTR is really nothing more than a shallow action story with banal bits of philosophy floating through it. FOTR tries so hard to create character development and empathy, but fails miserably (I never understood why Arwen was so upset when she thought Frodo was dead, they had just met).  All the music swelling, let's-have-a-deep-moment scenes were terrible. But TTT dispenses with most of this faux feeling and focuses instead on the action.  This at least is entertaining and funny, unlike the endless walking in FOTR, interrupted by gravely somber discussions on how are we going to save the world.  (Incidentally, there is some great character work in TTT, but it's found in Gollum, who has already been so praised here that I don't think I need say anymore on him.  All the positive comments are true concerning him.)  But there is no true friendship between Legolas and Gimli, no true love between Aragorn and Arwen, and the elves seem more like doped-up supermodels than mystical beings.  The films carry no astounding message about the value of friendship or the struggle between good and evil (what, in life, is ever simply black and white?).  When they try to be philopshical, they fail miserably.  TTT has less ""think-talk"" than FOTR, which is very good. But the dialogue, oh god, the dialogue.  It's terrible, not one single truly memorable line.  This is straight from Tolkien and his own failure to write grippingly.  ""I think we have tarried here too long,"" Frodo says, before being captured by Faramir.  Who, in real life, says crap like that? There's no tension, no laughter, no brilliance.  It's Shakespearean language, but without Shakeseare's wit, double entendres, and dirty jokes. Bottom line, TTT is a great action flick for those who enjoy sword fights and gritty looking men (which I do - hey, we all have our shallow sides).  But if you're looking for the best film of all time, look somewhere else.  FOTR and TTT aren't even the best fantasy films ever made.  That title, IMO, can be possessed only by Reiner's The Princess Bride. Memorable dialogue, wit, love, action, murder, revenge, The Princess Bride has it all - and clocks in at under three hours.  Before you go see TTT for the gazillionth time, rent this delightful parody of fantasy and then tell me I'm wrong."

You may recognize bits and pieces you remember and have some fun comparing the visualizations with the way you imagined things. And as in the first part, some of the scenery is breathtaking. But aside from that, the movie is simply boring and confusing.<br/><br/>It's boring because it lacks a coherent, compelling story. In a nutshell, this movie is about a bunch of people wandering around rather aimlessly. To disguise the simplicity of that 'story', many names of people, places and things are thrown at you constantly.

","I absolutely adored FOTR, even with my impossibly high standards due to my reading the entire series twice.  Jackson not only was faithful to the plot but also created a movie that was enjoyable on its own.  Then, the sequel came to theaters.  After hearing many rumors of how the plot was going to be altered, I admit, I was apprehensive as I sat down in front of that large screen.  My fears were soon justified. Yes, the visuals were stunning.  Yes, the CGI was beyond anything I could have imagined.  Still, the character development was noticeably lacking. Legolas got a little more screen time than in the first movie, but nothing significant, and poor Gimli was reduced to comic relief. <br/><br/>Then, Jackson made really unnecessary additions to the plot.  Between Aragorn's repeated fantasies about Arwen, and the incident where he almost perished after falling from a cliff, not to mention the kidnapping of Sam and Frodo by Faramir, who was supposed to be wiser than his late brother, I was wondering if the book had been so boring that they had to create an entirely new plot. There were also numerous plot holes.  Why were Merry and Pippin brought before the newly-revived Gandalf, and then in the next scene it was like it never happened?  Even with elvish abilities, why did it take such a short time for the Lothlorien elves to arrive at Helm's Deep?  For that matter, why were they there in the first place? I realize that artistic license must be taken to bring any book to the big screen, but the unnecessary changes only served to hurt the movie as a movie, book aside.  I'm hoping that the final film of the trilogy will return to the original plot and give the characters the depth they deserve."

I'm not talking in terms of quality, in production, acting, directing etc, but this is the middle of the story. While this introduces new characters and had the complication and more large scale battles, I really liked the exposition of the first film, with its sense of mystery building up, I was also a big fan of Borimir, he was a great character and his brother, who appears in this film is not quite as interesting.<br/><br/>Some of the improvements are as followed. Aragons role in the film is more central. In this film he is in it start to finish whereas he didn't enter the first movie until an hour in. I think Viggo's expanded role will give him a very good shot for an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor. He didn't quite have enough screen time in Fellowship to warrant that but he certainly put an Oscar worthy performance in. The rest of the cast are on fine form and I think I really have to re-iterate everything I said about the first film. This is pure magic and film making excellence, the production design is fantastic, the whole look of the film from its sets to the visual effects really transport you to middle earth for three hours and keep you transfixed. The real, real star of this movie and really what really breaks the mould in terms of movie magic, which wasn't yet broken by the first installment, is the most frighteningly realistic CGI character ever. Gollum is freakily realistic, and the vocal performance from Andy Serkis is Oscar worthy. You really feel as if he is a real living person, the animation is superb, awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>As I mentioned all the cast are great, the new additions such as Bernard Hill and in particular Brad Dourif as Worm Tongue are excellent. Basically, like Fellowship, you won't find a better mixture of top draw action, music, acting, cinematography, direction, production design, visual effects in any movie period. No other films can compete in terms of having grade A class in every department. This gets a well deserved 10 out of 10."

","To be perfectly honest, I am a Die Hard Star Wars Fan. I never cared much for anything about LOTR or the hobbit until the movies came out. I went to watch the film only because I had nothing to do that day, only to be turned into one of the best fans of this story. Never read the books but I intend to now. Its unbelievable  how stories like these are hidden like treasures waiting to be found. This is story that i would like to tell my children because it has the stuff heroes are made of. Not only because of the battle scenes, but because the characters are all from different backgrounds, races, gender and beliefs really do not care for one anther so as long as they leave each other alone. Kind of like our world. With the difference of a very few who realize the danger their world is in and decide to go against the odds, which is the attitude this world should have. The heroes of this story forget their backgrounds, beliefs, and differences for the search of a better life in which all live for the better. A story of honor, friendship unconditional love and just knowing that you should always try to do what you think is right. To be honest that is an interesting life the characters live in this epic. I am not one to really write or read a lot or even do what I'm doing right now but i must say this tale has changed my life. Well this is just to let you know all you LOTR fans you can count with a SW fan too."

","I have heard some criticize this film in saying that those who have not read The Lord of the Rings can appreciate the film, and those who have read the books cannot. Well, I whole-heartedly disagree with this statement. The only ones who are not able to enjoy Peter Jackson's films are those who cannot separate themselves from a ""book"" and a ""movie."" People, you absolutely cannot interpret a book directly into film and make it work without taking some creative license. And to those who disagree, I say try it!<br/><br/>
I, as one who has read the books, as well as having seen both films thus far, love them equally and independently of each other. Jackson's The Two Towers took by breath away, it is truly an amazing cinematic spectacle and I didn't find it a bit dull at any time.

","************NOTE - SOME MINOR SPOILERS**************<br/><br/><br/><br/>Got to see this new one on Saturday and had a few quick thoughts. First off, a disclaimer - I have never read the full trilogy. I skimmed over the Fellowship Of The Ring when I was about 12 years old but got bogged down in the multitude of characters and plot twists. I do know that the books are some of the best written in the 20th century and am impressed so far with Peter Jackson's direction of the stories. Now, The Two Towers is a ""good"" movie. Much better than a lot of the crap Hollywood shovels out normally. However, compared to Fellowship  falls a little short.<br/><br/>First off, I didn't get a sense for much of the humanity in this film that I got in the first one. Not until the end does Sam make a little monologue about the nature of ""goodness"" and how it is worth fighting for. There are other moments when the King is talking about the nature of war and Treebeard talks about the attitude of the forest and that stuff works but I didn't ""feel"" as much this time around.<br/><br/>Secondly, in the first film there was a great scene where Boromir dies because he couldn't resist the temptation of the Ring. In his final words to Aragorn, he talks about this and how he realized it was his downfall. This kind of 3-dimensional characterizing is what made the Fellowship a success to me; instead of copping typical Hollywood cliches about ""good and evil"", we find conflicted anti-heroes you can believe. In this movie there is simply too much ""Jar Jar Dwarf"" in the character of Gimli. Too many throw-away silly lines about his height, tossing dwarfs, etc. This dialogue really brought a cheezy feel to what should be a proud and dignified (though slight) character.<br/><br/>Also along the lines of ""cheezy"", don't get me started on the elf ""shield-boarding"" down the stairs during the climactic battle scene near the end. Scenes like this come across as pandering to the younger crowd and rob the film (and books) of its inherent dignity. Someone with a feel for the books (Jackson himself?) shoulda stepped in and stopped this silliness.<br/><br/>There was also less development of the villains in this one. Brad Dourif could've made for a great villain as Grima Wormtongue (as he was as Pieter in David Lynch's somewhat flawed Dune). But in spite of a few bits of interesting dialog he disappears only to be found floundering around Saruman's feet. And Saruman himself doesn't hold up nearly as evil while looking desperate when Treebeard and gang attack Isengard. Gollum is an interesting, conflicted anti-hero (along the lines of Boromir - but even more demented because of the power of the Ring) that was developed somewhat with interesting monologues (though hard to understand at times). But there didn't seem to be enough of these fellows (sans Gollum and his soliloquies). Overall, those helping Sauron are interesting baddies and I wouldve liked to see more from them (especially Christopher Lee's Saruman). Lets hope we get more in the next installment.<br/><br/>Alas, for all these deficiencies, there are some truly inspired moments in The Two Towers. Obviously the storming of the keep at the end is some of the greatest film-making ever (no over-exaggeration there either). Jackson and crew truly made you feel like you were watching the CNN-televised take on this historic event. The CGI was very seamless (even Gollum looked real when a lesser FX crew could've made him look fake) and as a matter of fact I was very impressed with how the movie kept the consistent look and feel of the Fellowship. Of course, it was always great to see Gandalf again - Ian McKellan IS this character through and through (such a great actor).<br/><br/>In the end, The Two Towers ranks as one of the better action films I've seen but didn't hold my interest as well as its predecessor. I was wondering when it would end just before the big battle, whereas I found myself a bit sad during Fellowship when it was clear that movie was about over (how many 3 hour+ movies are there where you actually wish it would continue its so good?). But you can do much worse than Two Towers and I recommend it for most intelligent movie-goers. It is a thrilling ride, no doubt about that. Let's just hope Jackson & Co. work on regaining some of the dignified emotional magic from the Fellowship when they make Return Of The King.<br/><br/>**** out of 5 stars"

How on earth could one of the greatest cinematic achievements of our time get beat by a movie that was not much better than a television movie of the week?  It's because the whole thing is a farce.

"dcorr123","10","0","0","10 January 2003"," The Growth of a Masterpiece Continues, *Spoilers*
","Many reviewers, professional as well as us amateurs, have commented that *The Two Towers* departs much more from the novel than did *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  I have gone over both movies comparing them with the novel and don't find this to be the case. One difference between the movie and the book is organizational.  In the book, all of the events involving Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, etc were told as a continuous story followed by the events involving Frodo, Sam and Gollum even though these events were taking part concurrently.  The movie instead interwove these.  This gives the appearance of being more of a departure than it was and actually I find the movie approach in this respect more satisfying.  Presumably, this approach will continue into *The Return of the King*.  <br/><br/>Another seeming departure is that the last 4 chapters of each of these halves of the story were excluded.  That much of this will be presented in *The Return of the King* is fairly certain.  Gollum, e.g. does say that She will be able to help him recover the ring, referring of course to Shelob. I assume that the chapters after the defeat of Sauron will greatly reduced. Except for the very important *Scouring of the Shire* most of these are rather anticlimactic. <br/><br/>Faramir's behavior is different than in the book. In the book he never attempted to take Frodo and the Ring back to Gondor.  However in the movie he does, in the end, realize the *truth* and lets Frodo continue his mission.  I find this probably more believable behavior than the more noble image depicted in the book.  <br/><br/>To some extent the same can be said for the Ents.  In the book, Treebeard was well aware of Saruman's crimes against the forest and I find it unlikely that he had to wait until the coming of a couple of Hobbits before he felt motivated to take action.  On the other hand, I find it also unlikely that, as in the movie, he would have been unaware of Saruman's crimes. Either way, this part still leaves me a bit dissatisfied.  <br/><br/>I did find the addition of Aragorn's plight, after falling over the cliff and being presumed lost, a bit contrived.  I assume that's so they could add more of the Aragorn/Arwen romance to the story but maybe they could have found a better way.  And talking of Arwen, the movie gives the impression that she has, after all, taken the ship over the sea.  That could of course lead the way open for Aragorn, instead of Faramir,  to marry Eowyn. That would be a significant departure.  My bet is that Arwen will prove not to have sailed after all.  <br/><br/>Further speaking of Elves, I was glad to see Elves, lead by Haldir, come to the aid of Rohan at Helm's Deep.  The Elves after all ultimately had a large part in bringing all these troubles about to begin with even if that's not apparent in LOTR.<br/><br/>The highlight of this movie for me is Gollum. I've always regarded him as the most interesting character in LOTR anyway and was hoping they would do his part well.  Not only was it done technically superbly well but they capture much of the combined revulsion and pathos of Gollum.  I'm in the ranks of those who would like to see an Oscar for Andy Serkin.<br/><br/>Finally there is the battle of Helm's Deep.  This was done as spectacularly as I anticipated (based to a large extent on the short battle scene presented as a prologue to *The Fellowship of the Ring*.  Many have hailed this as the most spectacular battle scene you will ever see in a movie. Maybe to date, but this is but a skirmish compared to the Siege of Gondar/Battle of Pellanor Fields in *The Return of the King* !   Prepare to be blown away by that one."

","Oh my God, I have waited a whole rather painful year for this. Not that that was a bad thing - it just gave me another excuse to watch the first film over and over. And thank you God, praise you Peter Jackson, you failed to disappoint me. Again. From the opening scene with Gandalf and the Balrog where I sat with my mouth open for a good five minutes, to the second most painful cliff hanger of all time (the first being FOTR), I was in movie heaven, thanks to a little something known as Peter Jackson, Tolkien and Orlando Bloom. After spending at least three hours downloading the trailer on my (slow as hell) computer, I have been waiting and waiting for the second installment of the brilliant Lord of the Rings trilogy. And then the time finally came, and once again I was swept to Middle Earth. The film was everything I expected and much, much more. Not only was every new member of the cast as brilliant as I had expected, the special effects even more spectacular, the music even more beautiful, but this film actually broke the sound barrier and topped 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. We weren't just given some new characters who waltzed in and had one thing to say and then we never saw them again, these characters played a big part in the story. Gollum was probably my favourite - the tortured little soul yearning for the ring provided some wonderful little moments and also tickled my funny bone at times. He was also very freaky in some ways too - as my brother said after we first saw it ""He looked so damn real!"" I also found it more funnier than the first film too - Gimli mostly providing the comic relief. And as for the battle of Hemls Deep - oh my God, how can ANYONE top that? Well, I have no doubt that P J can in 'Return of the King'. I thought that after seeing the first film, nothing could top all the surprises and effects in this one. I was wrong. Of course, the Gandalf and Balrong opening sequence was probably one of my favourites, but also the completely unexpected unveiling of the Ringwraith on the dragon! HOW cool??? I think my second most favourite thing about this movie other than the movie itself was the music. Once again Howard Shore delivers a superbly written and beautifully scored soundtrack. I have a thing for choir singing and dramatic sounding music - tracks ""Evenstar"", ""Isengard Unleashed"", and ""Foundations of Stone"" so you get my drift... Anyway, before I get disconnected off the internet, I will round it up. If you LOVED, or even liked FOTR, then get your arse down to the cinema and see this film. The only disappointment is that it doesn't last six hours like it really should..."
"sflorman","Null","0","0","6 January 2003"," Opportunity Missed (Spoilers!)
","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>My main objections to this film are based in the fact that I am a hopeless Tolkien purist. You've all met people like me: we started playing Dungeons and Dragons because it was modeled on Tolkien; we did Halloween dressed as Rangers, Elven Warriors, and the like; we found places to get real swords; we made our own chain mail; we can sit and discuss the LOTR books ad infinitum and even quote dialogue; we bought and read The Silmarillion in hardcover as soon as it hit the shelves; and we all secretly loved, while publicly denigrating, the cartoon version of The Hobbit with Orson Bean as the voice of Bilbo. I first read the books in about 1976, at the behest of my 6th-grade English teacher, to whom I still owe an immense debt. I have read the trilogy literally dozens of times. I've read it three times in an Italian translation. I read it out loud to my kids. Well, you get the picture.<br/><br/>Now that you know that about me, the following will be understandable. I thought it was an OK movie. Technically, it was magnificent; the filming every bit as majestic or epic or whatever adjective you want to use, as FOTR. The actors did nice work (although Elijah Wood is not stellar at portraying the ever-growing weight of the burden of the Ring). I even think Liv Tyler is a passable Arwen. What I didn't like was the fact that, in a couple of instances in this movie, the filmmakers took liberties with parts of the story line gratuitously. I can see doing some things differently for visual effect, since any movie ""watches"" different than its book reads. However, in this film more so than in The Fellowship of the Ring, the makers made changes that were unnecessary for dramatic effect, but were more geared toward the action-adventure angle. There were some changes that were more effective dramatically, but I objected to a couple of fairly major things.<br/><br/>First, the whole sub-story about Eomer, Eowyn, Theoden, and the Kingdom of Rohan got bollixed up for no reason. Eomer was not banished in the book, and didn't need to be banished in the movie, to achieve the drama in the rejuvenation of Theoden. In fact, this little ad-lib actually made it more difficult to get him and his band of Riders (what? Did they all go into banishment with him?) back into the fight in Helm's Deep. And he got Gandalf's best line, the one where he asks Wormtongue, ""How long?"" How long since he sold out and was to receive from a victorious Saruman his share of the spoils, and the woman he has long coveted? Eomer gets that line, and he gets it too early. He's long-gone, instead of being released from his cell in time to join Aragorn and company after Theoden perks up.<br/><br/>In the books, Gandalf (now returned from the dead, dressed in radiant white, remember) talks to Theoden and helps him break the spell of lethargy and the despair that Wormtongue has poisoned his mind with. There's very little implication that Wormy has worked any actual magic on Theoden in the book. Rather, he has helped Theoden always see the negative, and he falls into depression and despair. Gandalf, bringer of hope and new life, gives him back his pride and his desire to do good, defend his people, go out in glory if go out he must. Instead, in the book, we get a Theoden who is actually possessed by Saruman, and must be literally exorcised; he then becomes visibly younger as Saruman is ""cast out."" Excuse me, but if Saruman could possess Theoden, what need was there for Wormtongue? And why hadn't Theoden/Saruman just concluded an alliance with Isengard? The book version is a lot more credible, and could have been done with equal or greater drama. Real drama, not the cheap-thrill drama of the exorcism scene. The whole thing was as unfair to Gandalf and to Saruman as the ""Saruman Meets Gandalf in WWF ACTION!!!!"" fight scene in the FOTR film.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, this new, younger Theoden then becomes a constant bitcher and whiner in Helm's Deep. Just shut up and fight, Your Majesty. The less-glorious, less ""Numenorean"" dignity and majesty of the King of the Rohirrim is lost; a dignity and majesty that is homier and more easily understood by the simple salt-of-the-earth Hobbits than the more refined, esoteric, rarified Numenorean lords. He could have been the kind and noble King to whom Merry freely gives his sword in the books, but no, it's more ""dramatic"" to make him, first, a possessed, hag-ridden dotard, and then a futile whiner.<br/><br/>Minor points on this story line: Eowyn is left in Edoras; she doesn't go to Helm's Deep. No Elvish army ever shows up at Helm's Deep - what the heck was that all about, anyway? It's Erkenbrand with the remnants of the army of the Westfold who shows up at the last minute, not Eomer and his Riders-in-Exile. The Isengard army is supposed to be destroyed by the Huorns, the nasty semi-Ents - where were they? Wouldn't have been dramatic to have shown the awe on the faces of the defenders at the sight of the new forest, the Orc army fleeing into the trees, and its disappearance the next morning? And you could have done it all in the time it took to have that darn Elvish army march in. Instead, Eomer, who shouldn't have been banished, shows up with an army that shouldn't have followed him into banishment, and they save the day, somewhat less than credibly given the numbers stated - 400 against 10,000.<br/><br/>I have to say that Brad Dourif, the guy who did Wormtongue was phenomenal. Very nice job!<br/><br/>Next, Treebeard and the Ents lost some gravity and credibility. In the book they didn't tell Merry and Pippin they wouldn't help, and they didn't suddenly change their minds when they saw the stumps on the borders of Fangorn near Isengard. They were the shepherds of the trees, for heaven's sake. They already knew about the depredations, hated the Orcs, and Treebeard had already been thinking of doing something about Saruman. They lost the deep, intense dignity and wisdom they have by virtue of being the oldest living creatures in Middle Earth. The humorous banter and friendship between Treebeard and the Hobbits could have been, but was not, developed. Again, the time to do so could have been gained by cutting the dumb parts.<br/><br/>Third, Faramir was dealt a grave injustice, and he is no doubt rolling over on his bier in Rath Dinen. He is one of the few truly noble characters in the book, and the filmmakers succumbed to the temptation to give him a dark side. In the book he treats Frodo and Sam as honored guests, and gives them safe passage in all of Gondor except Henneth Annun. In the movie, he basically tries to shanghai them back to Minas Tirith to bring the Ring to Gondor, and is only convinced to let them go when they draw the wrath of the Ringwraith, once he's dragged them all the way back to Osgiliath. In releasing them, he is reminded by a lieutenant that his life is subject to forfeit by so doing, even though he is a Captain of Gondor and the Heir of the Steward. Wanna bet this is the setup to another Dumb Dramatic Scene in the 3d movie? Anyway, Faramir loses all of his nobility and becomes only one shade better than his brother Boromir. The contrast between noble, etherial Faramir and earthy, temporal Boromir, as Faramir laments his brother's death, wouldn't have been all that hard to do in the movie, but again, the makers chose action/adventure over real drama.<br/><br/>Gollum was very well-done, computer-animated with Andy Serkis. I've been trying unsuccessfully for years to visualize Gollum in my mind, and this is a rare case when the movie version just might fit the bill. Aside from a slight resemblance to Yoda (""When carry the Ring as long as did I you have, evil will you be also!""), Gollum is done really well. The interplay between Smeagol and Gollum is done especially well, with the contrast heightened by some cool camera angle work.<br/><br/>Small complaint about FOTR, since she makes a cameo appearance in a sort of flashback in TTT: Cate Blanchett is absolutely horrible as Galadriel, and I can't decide if that's Blanchett's fault or lousy script and direction. I'd have liked to see what that actress, who only has one character, would have done had her script required her to play the ""real"" Galadriel. She reminded me of Morgan Le Fay in ""Excalibur"" (the Helen Mirren role). Galadriel was warm, stern, noble, loving and lovabale in the books; the Blanchett version is harsh, hissy, mysterious, cruel and cold. She reminds me of one of those overdone Goth chicks you meet late at night in espresso bars, except in white robes. There's no ""touchability"" to her at all and no way for the hobbits and others to relate to her in the movies, whereas they all relate to her quite well in the book. I have heard that, iin the extended DVD version of FOTR, there's some cut scenes that develop Gimli's crush on Galadriel, and I will be interested to see how they do this, since I'm not sure Blanchett is capable of holding up her end of it.<br/><br/>Well, that's about it. Not a bad movie, but not one to please the dramatist or the Tolkien purist. A little too much action/adventure and not enough real drama, and plot weaknesses created out of whole cloth and papered over by special effects and frankly brilliant filming. Still a must-see, still a success, but tragically less than it could have been, and less than this long-time Tolkien fan would have liked. Opportunity lost."

","Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was in my opinion was the film highlight of 2001. The Two Towers although a good film, is not as good as the first one. The first film opened up with a fantastic prologue, showing how the ring came into being, and the war of the ring. The second opens up with a scene as good if not better than than the first, of Gandalfs battle with the Balrog. Sam and Frodo's quest goes on, with stunning scenes overlooking Mordor and the Dead Marshes, when they are joined by Gollum. In this film WETA workshops outdid themselves with Gollum and Treebeard, the opinion of most is that these characters were better than anticipated, not alot of people realise how much effort WETA put into these films, as they create nearly everything you see on screen ( i.e armour, minatures, make-up etc). New scenes, that were not in the book have been added, which at the time seemed quite pointless, but for instance during the battle with the Wargs, Aragorn goes over the side of a cliff, leaving Legolas and Gimli to mourn, however of course, Aragorn does die, I didnt see the relevance of this, until I thought about how it shows the bond that these characters have made since they left Rivendell. In the Fellowship, Merry and Pippin were used to delivier the comic relief, however in this film they play the serious role of trying to get the Ents to attack Isengaurd, they are replaced by Gimli, whilst his jokes are funny at times, there are other occasions where his jokes are irrelevant and sometimes break the tension, that is often needed. The stunts in this film are quite remarkable, those of you who have seen it will know what I mean when I say the name Legolas, for the rest of you, you will know what I mean when you see it. While the film is great and amazing in places i.e Helms Deep, it does not delivier its emotions as well as the first, the love between Arwen and Aragorn although strong isn't deliviered as well, as quite a lot of the film is centered around their love, tension isn't delivered very well at all, with Gimli breaking most of it. And terror, in the first film the Nazgul are seen as being quite terrifying, but in this one their, almost comical looking winged beasts do not create the terror the Nazgul on horses did. However do not let my comments put you off, as it is an extremely good film, but doesnt quite live up to the first installment, don't let my comments make you be the only one to not see it."

This movie has a completely different feel from the Fellowship (with the help of Howard Shore) and is an excellent movie, easily the best of the year.

","Please excuse the advanced critique that IMDB has posted with this movie. I have to say, it was obviously generated by someone schooled in the film industry who has very hardened opinions on what constitutes good filmmaking. Unless you are looking to view this film with a critical eye or rip it apart for your script writing class, you will hardly notice half the things mentioned in the previous critique.<br/><br/>This movie was astounding in its ability to portray a true fantasy story in a dramatic, serious fashion. American filmmakers seem to have a block when it comes to science fiction and fantasy and seem to want to ""silly it up"" for the kids. This movie does not have any of this. It is given all the serious attention this type of story deserves. I am *very* pleased with this. I feel the fantasy character of Gimli was expounded upon as a dwarf in the way that Legolas was as an elf in the first movie. We got to see dwarves as they should be portrayed, with laughing good cheer, belching good appetites, and an at times comical battle lust. <br/><br/>This movie is just a heavenly delight for a true fantasy lover. Even if you've never read Tolkien, just newer fantasy novels, you'll recognize all your characters in these people.<br/><br/>My one critique would be in casting of the Lorien elves which come to assist at the battle of Rohan.

","Two films in and its now impossible not to admire what Peter Jackson and his team have pulled of in adapting Tolkien's classic.<br/><br/>I am no die-hard fan of the books, in fact I read them only once, and while the depth and world-building seduced me, Tolkien's unconventional narrative choices made me skeptical at times. Thank Jackson and crew for painstakingly scrutinizing not only every last sentence of his work, but also for dissecting the lengthy appendices and fleshing out the core story in real time, while streamlining it, a paradox you'd think impossible to pull off: the plot keeps moving, but never at the expense of character, and fun but payoff-free side-notes (Tom Bombadil?) are left aside to focus on expanding what matters, particularly Aragorn, the main Rohan trio and Gollum.<br/><br/>Structurally, there was a lot of work to do as the saga moved along: fans had noted deviations from book 1 in The Fellowship, and Jackson & CO had to do additional tinkering on The Two Towers, not least in interweaving its previously cleanly separated narrative strands (Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas in part 1, Sam/Frodo/Gollum in part 2) in a way that heightened the impact of both.<br/><br/>Increasingly, it is impossible not to be contaminated by the love and care put into making these films by all involved, so breathtaking is the world on display, so lovable are its characters, and so gorgeous the execution: the melding of computer graphics, stellar model work and live action sets new, unprecedented standards, and these films are gorgeous to both look at and listen to - Howard Shore's score reaches new, hear- shattering heights - from one set-piece to the next, culminating in Helm's Deep, a battle for the ages ending in a series of shots that will have the hairs standing on your neck.<br/><br/>Thank your lucky stars this was made into three films and not two or - shudder - just one, because our main focus, our characters, beautifully played as they are, are given time to breathe, evolve, and get under our skin in ways you'd never expect from a feature films. And speaking of characters, though this is a case of ensemble greatness, it is impossible to discuss this particular entry without mentioning Andy Serkis and Gollum. Through an award-worthy performance and digital wizardry, Weta, Serkis and Jackson pull off something unprecedented: they make Gollum not an effect - and he is a landmark - but just another character, as real as any other!<br/><br/>And so the quest races forth to its conclusion, continued in the staggering Return of the King. As a bridge film, Two Towers has a thankless task: it has to have its own structure and ending but can neither establish everything from scratch nor end in a clean way. Most will call this their least favorite, but for the way it achieves its impossible objectives so beautifully, I would call it my personal favorite. It certainly contains enough of my favorite and very best moments of the saga, from the charge at Helm's Deep to the Ents, all the way to a wonderfully staged Gollum/Smeagol standoff.<br/><br/>This truly is the masterpiece none of us had dared hope for."

","Finally here comes a movie that is worth the price of admission and more, a movie that surpasses your wildest expectations and constantly fills your eyes with wonder, a movie that grabs you from the first frame, carries you off to another time and place, immerses you in an epic struggle of good versus evil and makes you give a darn about the outcome, a movie with characters who are real and are given poetry for dialog in place of profanity, a movie where we care about those characters, where we root for our heroes and curse their enemies. Finally here comes a movie that deserves the title ""epic."" Here comes Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Kneel down and pray.<br/><br/>I should say I am not a huge fan of Tolkien  (though I enjoyed reading The Hobbit as a boy). I saw the first film and thought it was ""okay,"" but this one -- this one made me a believer. The movie simply does not mess around. For one thing, you need not be a LOTR-geek to get caught up in the spectacle of the thing -- probably the best that modern special effects has to offer the movie-going public. A surreal, dream-like world is established, half-cartoon, half-flesh-and-blood; which is which is often hard to tell. Like any good magic show, at some point you just give in and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>The Two Towers astounds its audience with sweeping vistas, gargantuan armies, looming castle walls, dark forests, giant monsters, dragons, and all manner of fantastical creatures. And its real. I particularly enjoyed the way mythological creatures became real creatures before my eyes. We become familiar with the nature and limitations of dwarves and wizards, elves and orcs, and oh yes...hobbits. For example, when Gandalf the Grey throws off his robe, revealing that he has acquired new power and become Gandalf the ""White,"" you feel like you are witnessing a real wizard. All of the creatures move and operate according to certain rules -- just like in any universe. But its not hokey, the way, say, an episode of Charmed might be with its ""White Lighters"" and ""Demons."" Here is a world where a master dwarf is, well, a master dwarf -- a creature with excellent fighting abilities, sure, but don't count on him to give chase to bad guys (since he can't run very fast or for very long). Nor can you expect him to be able to leap from a tiny ledge on the side of a castle, some ten feet across in order to attack a battalion of Uruk-Hai warriors gathered on the narrow entrance leading into the castle. He must be thrown across the way if he is to make it at all. Hey come on; after all, he's a dwarf!<br/><br/>The acting is so good that the characters are not being portrayed -- they simply are. The plot, though complex, never leaves us wondering. In fact, the plot is really quite simple: War is brewing. An evil force is gathering. Innocent lives are threatened. A final battle is promised and when it finally occurs, we are in awe. Ladders are slowly raised to storm castle walls, swarms of arrows impale snarling soldiers, and all of it looks magnificent. As clichÃ© as it sounds, the movie is a rollercoaster ride of excitement. Get in line and buy your ticket."

","I have read the books, three times each, thrice and thrice, the Power of Three, but I write not as a Tolkien scholar, nor as your middle of the bee-curve, ""what's a book?"" movie-goer. Nor even as an educated critic.<br/><br/>I write now as a confirmed escapist, one who - not so much would rather be there, but would rather be anywhere but here. One who is reasonably certain that they were born in the wrong world, and if only they could concentrate hard enough, surely it should be possible to launch fire from their fingertips? Someone who was always puzzled when the other kids failed to understand his witty one-liners, or realize that his peculiar expression was not a facial tick, but rather the hidden depths of inner-torment and a rage, a rage barely concealed and fit to burn the world, sort of thing.<br/><br/>So when I say this movie was fantastic, I am being context inclusive. True, no-one in *our* world would go prancing about in the wilderness, shouting defiant taunts and challenges where no-one but the wind could hear them... almost as if, despite the isolation, every moment of their lives were being captured on film. Because, in Middle Earth, every man, elf, dwarf, hobbit and tree is a hero, and such is how heroes behave.<br/><br/>We can forgive the constant aerial shots too because, in Middle Earth, they are aware of the stunning, breath-taking beauty and mystery of their land, they are never removed from it, and in their heads, their own heads, this is how they see their lives, a sort of panoptic hallucaegenia where every step rebounds in their imagination as it might be seen from the air by a drunk bird with an eye for action. Wizards are mysterious, orcs are foul, King's are brooding, swords are sharp and elves are consummate acrobats. It was all enough to bring a tear to an old geek's eye.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the movie was very short. Only three hours long. A good book can last me a couple of days.<br/><br/>I'll give it an 8/10, because I'm a writer myself, and I would have done it differently. ;)"
"eclipsse","10","0","0","9 January 2003"," Not true to the books, but an excellent alternate vision
","I will cheerfully admit that I am a Tolkien fan, and was concerned about the changes that I had heard/read about on the web sites etc.<br/><br/>However, I decided to go and see it - keeping an open mind - and try to keep my rabid fandom under control (!)<br/><br/>Yes, the film is excellent. Yes, there are flaws, but not enough to change the experience significantly. Yes, the story is substantially changed from the book. So what?<br/><br/>I have read the book at least once a year since I was nine, which adds up to a ""tidy few"". I would just like to make one or two points - <br/><br/>1. Literature and film are two completely different media, with completely different strengths and weaknesses, problems and constraints, and those expecting to see exactly what was in the book - everything that was in the book - were always going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>2. In the book, Tolkien ""travels"" with each group in turn, skewing the timelines substantially until everything is tied up at the Black Gate. In film, it would be confusing to do that, as you would have subtantial chunks of the film based around each set of characters in turn, so many cuts and a ""contemporaneous action"" system makes sense, as Peter Jackson has so ably done.<br/><br/>3. The book finishes on a particularly grim note, and is not a suitable cinematic closing point.<br/><br/>The review bit - I thoroughly enjoyed the film. I thought the acting was superb, the technical aspects unmatched in any other film I have seen, and the production felt so much that this was a living, breathing world that we were somehow able to get a sneaky glimpse into. I thought that Orlando Bloom and Viggo Mortenson developed their characters superbly, with my only major niggles being the 'comic relief' role that has been given to Gimli - he is never very prominent in the book, but the ""jokes"" began to grate almost immediately. I was also very irritated by the fact that <spoiler> Gandalf's return <end of Spoiler> was shown in the trailers - that completely ruined the tension and wonder of the moment.<br/><br/>My rating? 8.5 - maybe 9 if it does what the Fellowship did and improve on second watching."

I was a little frightened to see a big tree carry little humans with hairy feet(hobbits) for the entirety of the three hour plus movie. He just told them stories and walked around.... This is probably a very common problem for adapted screenplays but it seems this could've been handled a little better so that everyone could enjoy and understand it. I love the emotions expressed in this movie- being attacked by an army of 10,000, seeing a tall man step out of a white cloud and start talking to you, traveling with an ugly creature with a striking resemblance to Dobby of Harry Potter.

"padiyark","10","0","0","6 January 2003"," From the director of ""Bad Taste"", who made LOTRFOR, i.e. ""Good Taste"", now has made ""Better Taste""
","Warning: Possible spoilers<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed Peter Jackson's older, more disturbing movies such as ""Bad Taste"" (ironically, his first one), ""Meet The Feebles"", and ""Dead-Alive"".  That's because he's a no B.S. director who lets his imagination take him to great heights.  Yet he also can be a gentle story teller, as seen in ""Heavenly Creatures"".<br/><br/>So no doubt, when he was set to direct the LOTR series, I had no doubts that he would do a smash up job.  The result?  Well, we could easily call FOTR ""Good Taste"".  George Lucas should take a refresher in storytelling from Jackson and his wife Fran Walsh.  Yes, the story had been written, but to adapt it for the screen is in itself a rewriting of a story in itself. If one wants to see a truly bad adaptation, just watch Ralph Bakshi's LOTR, and see how one could trash a simple storyline.  And no doubt, being a fan of Tolkien helped Jackson be more critical of himself.  Jackson juggles backround storytelling and many characters with beautiful cinematography and dazzling special effects.<br/><br/>So what does this have to do with LOTR:T2T?  This movie should be called ""Better Taste"".  While I loved FOTR, it did drag at certain moments, but this is simply due to storyline and not to bad writing.  The first thing that T2T does right is that it doesn't catch us up with LOTR, which in itself is a blessing.  Quite frankly, Jackson not only did a brilliant job of making 3 films at one time, but also knew that eventually, everyone will be watching these films back to back on their mutlit-DVD players with HDTV, so why bore us with redundant material?  Second, Jackson knows where to use CGI environments and how to use them.  If we want to see serenity, we use the real thing.  When we want see an ominous scene, especially at night, CGI works beautifully.  And this is where another previously famous fantasy movie's first 2 prequels fail.  And while we are on the subject, let's get on Gollum, the CGI character who almost steals the show from the human characters.  Not only is he made more realistically than another dumb CGI character (i.e. Jar Jar Binks from SW:TPM), but the team that created him really knows human emotions and how do interpret them digitally.  And let's not forget the beautiful job with the Ents as well!  Kudos to WETA!  And finally, Jackson shows us how great a visualist he is.  Scenes such as the confrontation between the Ring Wraith and Frodo, the Battle of Helm's Deep, and Frodo in the Swamp are some of the most beautiful pictures ever put on film.<br/><br/>So will LOTR:ROTK be ""Best Taste""?  If the current trend stays, then most definitely yes. 10/10"

Why is it that all of the silliest parts of the movie are the ones that are changes from the book?  I have more respect for Tolkien than ever (and far less for Peter Jackson).  I guess Jackson figured that Tolkien fans will see it anyway and decided to Hollywoodize it to gain favor with the Lowest Common (pun intended) Denominator..and I guess it doesn't matter that it makes *him* look stupid to add such gaping holes in the plot."

","Who are we to judge how the book didn't come out the same on the screen? Books traverse time and space differently than how a motion picture does. Peter Jackson and all of his writers deserve kudos for what they have accomplished.  It truly is a cinematic experience that one should see just for the experience.  Not to whine and p**s and moan about how different it really is from the book, that might I remind all of you was written about 60 some odd years ago.  I for one started of saying, ""That's not how it is in the book.  Blah, blah, blah....""  And as I caught myself doing it I realized that when I got the FOTR on DVD I watched through the commentary for the extended version and paid attention to what was being said about the differences from print to movie screen and how each point in the film was shot a specific way for the whole of the story to remain intact.  Time does pass much differently on screen than in the book and certain parts of the story have to be re-written to achieve their point.  It's simply AMAZING that Peter Jackson had the BALLS to go out and film all three back to back to back and make this story come alive for all of us to enjoy.  He has done what no one thought possible and I read how people are bashing his efforts because he left out 5+ chapters and Liv Tyler was in there when she wasn't supposed to be.  Does anyone realize that for the giant battle scene in the Two Towers he spent over 4 months filming in the rain at night?  Entire movies have been made in four months, but this was just one part of one movie for him.  Shame on us.  Shame on you and certainly, shame on me."

I pretty much agree with the last couple of postings about this flick and I know that an exact reproduction of the book in movie form would be impossible as well as boring. I know that the movie will never be what the book was. I know that people will have a hard time remembering who characters are so some are eliminated while others expand to fill the gaps (like the way the reduced 6 rocket boys to 4 in the movie October sky). But the change in Farmir's character from a man who is almost Aragorn like in his duty and understanding of the dangers of the ring to a man who is a carbon copy of Boromir baffled me. Everything else was good to great. Gollum was fantastic, the addition of the elves to the battle of helms deep was ok, the dwarve jokes were cute.

","There are a few flaws this movie suffers from, and let me clear them away first, then I'll say why Fellowship is better (and it is).  For one, Merry and Pippen's story wasn't nearly as long as the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli story or the Froddo/Samwise/Gollumn story.  This is a shame as Merry and Pippen's story was the best.  Pippen transforms into a much more leader quality person.  He's the only character in Two Towers that show signs of character development.  His disision         (!POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS NEXT SENTENCE!) -to convince the tree-men to attack Isengard- (.END OF SPOILER.)was brilliant and probably my favorate part in the movie.<br/><br/>Second, the part where (!YET ANOTHER SPOILER!) -Aragorn falls off the cliff, then later arrives (late) at the fortress of Helm's Deep- (.END OF SPOILER.) was very forced and affected the next few scenes in the Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli story.<br/><br/>Taking those flaws into account, the movie still might've been better than the first in the trilogy, but there's more that makes it not as good as the first.  This isn't a flaw though, it's just a different style, and one that I don't like as much (or just aren't used to).  While the first movie was straightford with all the characters in the same spot, the second has three seperate stories.  The one with the most screen time is my least favorate, the shortest story is my favorate.  The switching between stories is well done, but let's hope at some point everyone will get together (or just the four hobbits, that's also fine) in the third movie, and I also hope the hobbits get as much screen time as the other three.<br/><br/>There go all my complaints.  Otherwise, Two Towers is everything I wanted and more.  The battle at Helm's Deep is an epic battle in every sense of the word (Legolas sliding down a staircase on a sheild is classic).  The camerawork is spectacular and a milestone in movie history.  Love the ending!"

And, my God, are the LOTR haters proving it or what?!  I love to look back in the imdb archives for last year's film ""Fellowship"". People were predicting a big downfall for part two because Peter Jackson had used up all the interesting characters and effects. (pause) Are you done laughing now? Good. Well, here we are one Gollum, one Helm's Deep, not to mention some amazing Wargs and Ents later and Jackson and his crew amazed us again.<br/><br/>Another common criticism that blows me away is the way people misuse the term ""character development"" so much- do they even know what it means??? How can you not see Aragorn's development from rough, mysterious ranger to troubled heir to heroic warrior right before your eyes. How can you not see Frodo develop from innocent, peaceful hobbit to tortured possesser of the ring. There are many others but the biggest is Gollum. I heard one ""basher"" say he didn't understand why he should care about some Middle-Earth schizophrenia. Well, if you don't understand the torment behind this character then there really is no point trying to explain anything to you. As Sam said to Gollum in the ""stewed conies"" scene, ""You're Hopeless"".<br/><br/>
Well checking the latest data report, LOTR:TTT has just pulled ahead of Potter in the states, something the last film couldn't do. And considering the headstart Potter had, LOTR should finish well ahead of it. Even more impressive is the critical reviews it's still getting (Time, Newsweek, USA Today, etal). Heck, even Ebert gave this one a better review than the last one. And of course the awards just keep piling up!<br/><br/>So the LOTR bashers can keep babbling their jealousy-enduced dribble and the masses will continue to be swept away by this truly marvelous epic adventure.

People who couldn't direct traffic, let alone three MAJOR pictures, have no business commenting on the movies.<br/><br/>That aside, this was simply an amazing movie.  True, PJ was pretty liberal with the novel - but he has to be to compress 600+ pages into a three hour movie that a non-fanatic could understand.  Did I like all the changes? Nope.  But its still a damn fine movie.<br/><br/>The good stuff:<br/><br/>1.  The battles.  Simply incredible.  The battle for Helm's Deep is one of the finest battle sequences ever.  It truly captures the chaos, horror, and claustraphobic feel of hand to hand combat.  I felt like I was on the wall at Helms Deep surrounded and outnumbered.  I felt like I should be there defending the Rohirrim people.<br/><br/>2.  The actors.  Outstanding casting - everyone fits their role.  Usually, you have at least one person who just doesn't fit their part.  Not here. Bernhard Hill (Theoden) should be a nominee for best supporting actor.  He more than holds his own against the major characters.  Another plus - John Rhys Davies.  There was too little of Gimli the dwarf in FOTR.  Not here. Gimli steals the show with a mix of humor, action and compassion throughout the film.<br/><br/>3.  The score.  Howard Shore's Gaelic inspired music enhance the emotion in every scene.  I was nearly in tears during Theodred's burial (and another nod to Bernhard hill for his acting here).  A lowpoint - the end credits song - what the hell was that?<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a film worth seeing.  Its another highpoint for American cinema.

I am a big, big, big Tolkein fan; I read the book so I could read it before I saw the film, as my dad said I must read it as I read ""The Hobbit"" when I was eight. So any Tolkein fans out there.... I am one too!<br/><br/>I thought Gollum was fascinating; he was so mesmerising and just like the book. The battle scenes lived up to expectations, as they were incredible! Oh yes and the Ents.....let's not forget the Ents! They were just like the book...... good old Peter Jackson huh? Well that's not the end of it....<br/><br/>What the hell is our good old PJ up to? Why oh why did he have to change Faramir? He was such a noble character! He was the sensible, kind one out of him and Boromir and had no desire to use the ring. Why did they have to change it? It was purely because he couldn't be bothered to build up Sam and Frodo's character/relationship like Tolkein did at that point in the book, so he copped out and went for the easy option of adding a bit of action to keep us interested. We can watch a film with not a lot of action in and a lot of good character building you know PJ!<br/><br/>And Aragorn dying? What was going on there? It was just an excuse for a soppy, pathetic, slushy scene with him and Arwen! A terribly naff attempt to attract non - Tolkein fans.<br/><br/>Well I torn over whether I liked TTT or not, so I am going to give it 8/10. I have one plea to make to our mate PJ: You have proven worthy of directing an epic film so often, please please please don't mess up ROTK, stick to the book, and you can do it!"

"lexy248804","10","0","0","5 January 2003"," A Brilliant Sequel
","Peter Jackson and co. have brilliantly brought to life the second book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, which has traditionally been my least favorite installment.  Somehow, they've managed to navigate through the story's scattered plotline to produce a compelling movie whose graceful transitions increase the audience's emotional investment in each of the characters. Although Aragorn is brooding and beautiful, the character development of Gollum (or Smeagol) makes him the favorite of the movie. Jar Jar Binx would envy the world's love for this CG character.  Other than the tree-hugging, hippie-loving sentiment portrayed by the Ents, this was a fabulous film. (Just kidding- I love Treebeard)"
"evanhalikias","10","0","0","4 January 2003"," Brilliant for such a tough movie
","People thought that making a movie of The Lord Of The Rings would be an impossible task with its variety of environment and complex characters but Peter Jackson made it look easy. He combined action with depth and an unbeatable cast to pull such a thing off. In my opinion this will be considered a great for decades.<br/><br/>If you know anything about writing you should know that a screenplay is very different from a book. Turning a book into a movie is no easy task. I admit that Jackson added a few things and left some things out but he had to. He had a flow and had to stick with it. He focused more on Helms Deep than the other scenes but that is what he had to do.<br/><br/>I you have not seen the movie and are reading this let me tell you this: you will have a wide smile on your face the whole three hours. I know that I did. It is one of those movies where you feel like you are with them and you want to jump into the screen and help them. It is an enjoyment very hard to find, especially in a movie.<br/><br/>If you read the book right before you go, don't look for things that really happened and things that are made up, but just watch the movie. On top of its correctness to the book, it is also a 5 star movie. One of my favorites at that."
"jens_flottmann","Null","0","0","5 January 2003"," There is a (simple) reason for all the changes!
","I´ve read so many reviews concerning the plot changes concerning this movie. So many fans were disappointed. Certainly most people (especially in the first view) do not understand WHY PJ and his co-writers did it. I was confused as anyone. Viewing the movie for a second time gave me a clue...<br/><br/>My thesis is that THEY TRIED TO REPEAT OR AT LEAST ECHO CENTRAL PLOT ELEMENTS OF PART I!!!<br/><br/>Parallels to ""The Fellowship"" are at least (I´m convinced there are still a lot more to discover):<br/><br/><ul><li>Frodo falling two times into the ""ghost world"" with the green spherical light.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the exorcism of Theoden as a duel with Saruman (fight of the wizards in Orthanc in Part I)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the threat of a nazgul early in the film (quite smaller though but remember the introduction of Gollum is also a threat to the ringbearer!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the attack of the warg-riders as a parallel to the orc-attack in Moria (Just to throw some action in???)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Aragorn falling down an abyss with a creature and eventually dying (like Gandalf in Part I but saved earlier because he needs to be at Helms Deep!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Arwen ""rescueing"" Aragorn. (After rescuing Frodo in Part I.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the appearance of Elronds home and the ""love story"" in the middle of the film</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the narrator speech of Galadriel</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>a ""good guy"" dying in the end battle (This time its the elf Haldir instead of Boromir in TFOTR and one reason to kick a guy into the end battle that doesn´t appear in the book and isn´t central to the plot.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Frodo in danger to lose the ring of power to Faramir (the ""Boromir"" of Part II and the reason why he´s a different character than in the book.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the somehow ""cheesy"" speeches in the last part of the film this time by Sam. (Unavoidable???)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the movie ending with the 2 Hobbits facing to get into Mordor with a clear reference to the end pictures of Part I (The main reason why Cirith Ungol and Shelob were left over for ROTK.)</li></ul><br/><br/>There are some thoughtful references in Part I you can understand now. Remember the shock when Bilbo tried to get the ring in Part I at Elronds home? Remember the face and the teeth? A thoughtful display of what might happen to the weak ringbearer. We saw the Gollum in Bilbo!<br/><br/>Excuse my BAD english but maybe the ideas are useful.<br/><br/>My personal score ist 7 out of 10 for an excellent action movie blockbuster.<br/><br/>
Jens Flottmann<br/><br/>PS: If you love to see a monumental literature film that manages to create a world and a meaning of its own go for ""Once Upon A Time in America"" one of my personal favourites and a true work of art."
"MercuryDrinker","Null","0","0","5 January 2003"," Excellent, slightly better than the first, but slightly overrated.
","Note: I've read the books 1.5 times (i.e. I'm half way through)so I have a fair idea of pretty much all of the changes... this also makes my opinion slightly biased. This is also my first review here at imdb.com so bear with me.<br/><br/>After waiting 8 more days than the Americans, I finally got to watch it and I wasn't disappointed (well, maybe a little). In general I think it's slightly better than the first, even though it wasn't as good as the Fellowship prior to Helm's Deep and the attack on Isengard. Although I haven't seen it enough (twice so far, I intend to see it once more) to make a complete opinion. although i think that the first one was more 'polished'.<br/><br/>I'll skip the plot summary and just go straight to my opinion.<br/><br/>Stuff I liked: *The Ent attack on Isengard, it was a bit short, but it was still great. Although I liked the flooding of Isengard, it was still obvious it was a miniature. The Ents overall were pretty well done, alot better than I expected, I expected them to look cheesy or lame. *The Nazgul with wings was also well done, although shots of just the nazgul, it was obvious that they just used blue screen. *Dead Marshes and Emyn Muil were perfectly visualised... *The Oliphaunts, almost exactly how I imagined them. *The Warg attack on the Rohirrim. One of the few changes that enhanced the story. The only complaint is that the wargs still looked a bit CGI-ish, especially when compared to the extremely well done Gollum.<br/><br/>Stuff I loved: *Gollum/Smeagel is the best CG character ever. period. He is the first CG character that actually made me feel any emotion towards (does that sound right?). Every other CG character I have seen has been either soulless (Final Fantasy), retarded (Jar Jar, from Star Wars ""The Phantom Menace"") or not realistic enough (Jar Jar and Yoda and pretty much any other CG character that I can remember). *Gollum/Smeagel also did a terrific 'acting' job and was thoroughly convincing and realistic, unlike Yoda or Jar Jar. He was also very lovable and cute in a sort of pitiful and pathetic way, and I actually felt really sorry for him, something that has never happened with anyother CG character... Peter Jackons choice of accentuating the two characters (Smeagel and Gollum) was also a welcome change, as it made the arguements between them more dramatic. *Helm's Deep, completely epic and huge, although I have to admit its not quite as epic as the clone war in Star Wars ""Attack of the Clones"". I also have to admit they showed too much of the battle in the trailers, which sorta wrecked it for me. The constant cuts to Treebeard, Merry and Pippin also cut up the action in Helm's Deep, which wasn't a great editing choice. *Gandalf saving the day with Eomer, absolutely brilliant shot, even thought technically they would've been completely slaughter by the pikes that the Uruk-Hai were holdling (see: Braveheart).<br/><br/>Stuff I didn't like: *Alot of the stuff I didn't like deviated from the book, although I don't mind minor changes, and I am in no way a tolkien ""purist"", I thought that Fellowship's changes were all good or excellent, except for the lack of Galadriel's gifts (although that was remedied in the extended DVD) *Near the ending when they were winding everything down, they shortened all the battles (Isengard and Helm's Deep) and cut them off and didn't really show the closing parts of the battle, it lacked the detail that they had at the beginning of the battles. *The movie seemed a bit 'all over the place' with about four plotlines to follow that weren't really edited correctly and didn't flow very well, for instance Merry and Pippin hardly get any screen time and as mentioned before they shouldn't have cut up the battle at Helm's Deep. *Didn't really like Aragorn's death, it was just an excuse to tack on the romance bits with Liv Tyler, which weren't very good to begin with, although I really liked the part where Elrond explains why the relationship is doomed to failure, showing Aragorn's death and all that. *The film probably focused a little too much on the plight of Rohan, rather than the ring, after all the movie is called ""The Lord of the RINGS"". They also neglected the Merry, Pippin and Treebeard story line and didn't include things that would have been of interest from the book, like Treebeards house and the Ent-wives. *The part where Aragorn and Gimili take on about 50 orcs on the bridge to Hornburg, that was completely unrealistic (within the psychics of Middle Earth that is.) *Gimili constantly being used as comic relief. The last film used him only slightly for this purpose (""No one tosses a Dwarf!""), which was great, but this film over did it... Gimili constantly lagging behind, falling off horses, getting crushed and having his height ridiculed just weren't that funny and got tiresome very quickly. *The big eye above Baradur. It looked a bit too cartoon-ish *Legolas surfing on a shield. Complete cheese.<br/><br/>Stuff I'm undecided on: *I'm still ambivalent to the character changes of Faramir. On one hand I understand why Peter Jackson decided to change him, but on the other I liked the idea that not every human could be so easily seduced by the ring. *The ents not realizing that the Isengard orcs were burning down forrests until Merry and Pippin showed them. I understand that the main reason for changing this was so that Merry and Pippin would not appear to be completely useless, but it also compromises the fact that the Ents are among the oldest and wisest creatures in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>All in all a solid 9/10, although I have to admit I am biased and probably would give it 8/10-8.5/10 if I wasn't a LOTR fan. I would also like to add, that I can't believe that the Fellowship and Towers are rated so highly, they are excellent movies, but they are also full of flaws, as mentioned above."

Most of the negative comments are from people who were miffed by how it strayed from the book, but you cannot reasonably judge how good a movie it was based on how closely it followed the book. The content of the book has nothing to do with whether or not it was a good movie, which it was. I too have read the book and am a big Tolkien fan. I was disappointed by the inaccuracies, but in and of itself this movie was nothing short of a ten. I have spoken to many people who have seen the film, and none have given negative feedback, even those who are Tolkien purists. I am of the belief that those who have given this film negative reviews are simply geeks looking for an excuse to show off their ""extensive"" knowledge of the books. Get over your self.

","I loved this movie. So many people are saying that they left out a lot of stuff and added a lot of sappy lovey dovey stuff between Aragorn and Arwen. SO WHAT? They had to have that in there to explain Aragorn and Arwens love for each other. And about leaving Shelob out. It gives you something to anticipate now. So for all you people complaining about how he didn't stick to the books. WAIT FOR THE SPECIAL EDITION DVD. All the cut scenes will be there and you will get all the precious missing material you so love to complain about. I thought the movie was excellent. Gollum looked realistic (even though he did travel during day and he hates the sun) Treebeard was excellent. Sure Saruman wasn't in as much as I would like but whatever. And you shouldn't complain about this. You could never have all the stuff from the books in there. If they did the movies would each be about 5 hours long. And you need the love scenes and everything to explain to the people who haven't read Lord of the Rings what happens."

","In my opinion, this movie was one of the best ones out right now.  I enjoyed it as much as the Fellowship of the Ring, and though it did stray for the plot of the book in some areas (I'll let those curious of that to read other comments) I still feel that all in all the main story gets told.<br/><br/>You must understand that the middle 2 books (Yes, I am calling the ""trilogy"" 6 books, as it was written) are mostly of 2 battles (Helm's Deep and Isengard) and Frodo and Sam and their dealings with Gollum.<br/><br/>While this does make for great action and adventure on the part of Aragorn & Company, it really wasnt much to go on in terms of resolution, something most people need in a movie, even if you know the story.  I do think they could have lessened the love story a little, but I can understand why he put it in, so that the love is more developed and those who havent ever read Tolkien can appreciate the love of Arwen and Aragorn.<br/><br/>
I thought that Gollum's part was done beautifully, and the story between himself and between Frodo and Sam interesting and complex.  To make Frodo more interesting (From here on out he becomes more or less a zombie), they included the scene with the Nazgul, which I felt could also have been done without, but once again, I can understand why it was put in.<br/><br/>
As for the last 5 chapters, I have heard rumors that he is saving that (Shelbob and the like) for the final movie, also probably to help the storyline of Frodo and Sam to be more interesting and involved rather than them just trudgeing along every time they appear in the next film.<br/><br/>
You must understand that while Peter Jackson did stray from the story-line, it was done with good intentions and in will make for a more interesting movie in the end.  You must balance those who love the series and those who dont even know that it was a book before these movies first came out.  In the end, the merging of the two has created a magnificent blend of story-telling that has stayed more true to its origins than almost ALL other story based movies."

","As a very avid fan of the books, I felt that a few too many liberties were taken with the plot of the Two Towers in it's adaption to the screen. The two major changes from the book which (in my opinion) would have been better cinematicly if they had NOT been changed were Faramir taking Frodo and Sam to Osgilliath and the downplaying of the Legolas and Gimli commraderie. Faramir lost some of his wisdom, Gimli some of his dignity and Legolas seemed to gain some super powers. Regardless, this isn't the book and had more than enough enjoyable parts to make up for what I perceived as discrepancies.  Really enjoyable and almost as good as Fellowship of the Ring."

","Wow. This film is loved by nearly everyone on the face of this earth, and is, of course, high in the top 250 at imdb.com. I don't really get it, but I guess it's not my thing. Should be certainly true, especially when it's loved so feverishly much.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say; it didn't keep my interest really. There were some pretty well done moments, but there were moments (long, long moments) where I was either bored out of my mind or nitpicking the CGI.<br/><br/>Good thing is that there's nothing wrong with any of the CGI. It's nearly flawless. Sadly, it seemed like the whole damn movie was made out of CGI. I was noticing how much there was of it, and I realized nearly three quarters through that all I was really doing was seeing how the CGI worked into scenes. What a distraction. I know Jackson wanted the battle scenes to be filled with millions of people, but couldn't he used close up shots of real people (less, but still a lot)? It's definitely possible. Look at some battle scenes from movies made before 1997.<br/><br/>And the cinematography got down right muddled and uninteresting at points. Except for the rare nice shots, the whole movie seemed to be filmed with the same sweeping camera movements (over the battle scenes) and used the brown looking color scheme a bit too much.<br/><br/>The characters themselves aren't very interesting. Frodo gets downright annoying sometimes. I'm sorry to say I've never read any of the books, and I can only imagine what it did for the characters in them. They're probably wonderful, imaginative, compelling stories. If so, this film is ultimately generic.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is that it's not my cup of tea. Obviously, it's millions of others. That's cool though.<br/><br/>What would be even cooler is if I could show some of these hardcore fans Jackson's ""Heavenly Creatures."" I wonder how much they'd like ""The Two Towers"" then."

","In the space of Three hours not a lot happens! A bit of fighting then some walking then some more fighting. The fighting does look good and that's pretty much the only redeeming aspect of this film. This movie is at times unbearably slow, you just wonder why it takes three hours to get to the end which is of course where the next film will begin. It's just pointless, maybe it follows the book too closely, I wouldn't know though, I haven't read it. Frodo is meant to be the hero right? well, he's barely characterized in the movie and he's just plain dull, not that he's on screen much anyway, in fact it seems as if there are so many characters to keep up with that each one only gets a couple minutes screen time. The movie has a couple plots going on at once and because some scenes are overly long you would have forgotten what was going on previously with another group of characters. Fans of the book though will most likely love this, but again, what's the point? Why turn it into a movie if you're not going to appeal to those who haven't read the book?"

","After viewing the director's cut of the Fellowship of the Ring, I have a much deeper appreciation for this film and lament many of the scenes that were ""lost"" to meet time constraints.<br/><br/>Having said that, I want to express to any readers of this commentary that the recently released version of The Two Towers is a much more compelling film. It is poignant and more fleshed out on many important ""human"" levels than was its predecessor, even without the advantage of added character development lost in TFOTR.<br/><br/>While I thoroughly enjoyed TFOTR, at times it suffered from pacing problems brought on by necessary exposition, a lack of energy or glee in Elfkind that was so evident in Tolkien's masterpiece, and even some scenes added to purely show off special effects. The Two Towers has a pace and scope that doesn't allow for any of these worries.<br/><br/>Elves are leaving (not a lot of room for glee), Hobbits are lost (get used to it) and Humans are on the brink (sound familiar?). The action here is tighter and made more meaningful by a truly compelling plot. A king must rise to the occasion for his people, or all may be lost! The scenes we are given in the Rohan capital of Ederas are akin to good Shakespeare.<br/><br/>If I convey only one thing about what I think makes these films truly great, it has to be the impeccable casting. Peter Jackson has shown us that he has the soul of a Hobbit and the eye of an artist, but the decisions on casting are truly awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>Now off to see it for the fourth time...."

","Well after seeing the first film, which far exceeded my expectations in terms of how closely it followed the book, I was not expecting the second film to be a blundering failure.... And thank god it wasn't!!! This film has made me think that Hollywood has taken a different philosophy out on 'safe' moviemaking ie: ""nothing too complex for the masses please"" (which the likes of George Lucas & Chris Columbus preach to) and even some critics may have said ""it is simply too fragmented and complex to be followed like The Fellowship wasn't"", but hey just because you're a bit slow and rather dumb Mr Critic, please don't think that we are. It was the best job I have seen of a director piecing together what is essentially four different stories and making them ALL feel like one... It's big, it's clever and it is TOLKIEN to the letter!

","Before talking about the movie, I would like to make some remarks about some thing said. When I entered the movies, I KNEW I was gonna watch something that lasted almost 3 hours (2h 50m to be precise), so the only thing that annoyed me about the length was that I was starving.<br/><br/>I also knew that I was gonna watch a movie, not watch a book, so I didn't expect it to be exactly like the book.<br/><br/>But, I didn't enjoy at all the final speech that Sam and Frodo had. I just looked at the trees fighting and all that to find out that Sam had been talking nonsense all that while. Happened the same in Harry Potter: ""touching"" dialogs with soft music.<br/><br/>No words about Gollum, nicely made, I understood him, as I understood Frodo being nice to him. Maybe Frodo realized that HE was gonna be another Gollum. I didn't even notice the trees being mixed up with the war. If I had seen that war more than half an hour (JUST-A-WAR) I would get the hellaouta there. And when the trees came down from the forest to destroy the giant headquarter, I couldn't help to smile like saying victory!<br/><br/>
I have seen better scores, the were sometimes uncomprehensible. I sometimes was trying to find out if that was a scottish instrument or a violin.Bull's eye when someone said quasi-Irish, quasi-classical.<br/><br/>In the beginning the acting was a little unconvincing. Spoilers: We MUST remember that in that time -the middle ages- the fire did not extinguish because of water. In the battle, when the rain starts, almost everyone has torches. If that actually happen, I just do not know how the fire kept alive. If some can explain that to me... Also, I don't know if hobbit can have some kind of a disease, that changes their height but sometimes they went underneath a horse, and, what kid can pass underneath a horse. The weren't THAT small. Sometimes very predictable. Who DIDN'T know that in the forest they were gonna be saved by a giant tree. Sort of a cliché. Great movies, the spoilers only made me laugh."

Then, of course, the special effects were impressive, especially when the masses of Orcs go marching to Helms Deep to destroy mankind and they seem to fill the whole valley like a dark cloud that is thundering across the sky, covering everything with darkness that's in its way. Also the creature Gollum is just brilliant, because the expressions on its face and his movements are so realistic. It must be a computer animation, though it doesn't look it at all! Another thing I admire is that most of the actors are unknown. Except for Liv Tyler who I personally don't like at all, and Cate Blanchett who is just perfect for Galadriel the Elvenqueen. But apart from them, I don't know the others which is important, because you tend to identify them with the former films they did and it would be irritating to imagine lets say, Bruce Willis as a hero of Middle Earth, fighting against Orcs with a sword when you last saw him, shooting gangsters with a machine gun!<br/><br/>The reason why I'm disappointed is, because the story was changed a little! I really don't care if some parts of the book are left out, because the plot would be far too complicated for a film. But, and they really got me angry with that, there is no point in changing the story! In the first film `The Fellowship of the Ring', Boromir was totally obsessed by the ring and the desire to have power that he even tried to kill Frodo, the ring bearer. In the `Two Towers', Frodo is confronted with Faramir, Boromir's brother who according to the book is not at all hasty in making decisions nor is he drawn to the desire of having power. He lets the Hobbits go by his own will. However, in the film he is just like Boromir not a bit better than him, so he takes the Hobbits with him to Osgiliath were a Nazgûl , a dark rider who has the only desire to get the one ring, is looking for them. The most idiotic scene is the following: Frodo is standing alone facing the Nazgûl riding on a huge flying beast. Then Faramir comes along, hurting the beast with a single arrow and its flying away, just like that! I mean, apart from that modification the film is so excellent! No one would ever believe that a Nazgûl that would rather face destruction than leaving the ring behind, would do so, just because its means of transport is hurt, when the ring is just a stone throw away! Never!<br/><br/>Anyway, I enjoyed the film a lot, for the reason that most of the characters, like Aragorn, Gimly, Legolas and Treebeard are just as I imagined them to be! I'm so curious about how they'll do the last part. It's a pain to know it will take one more year to find out!"

","This movie presented me with a dilemma. I read and loved the book, and I sure did like the first one. I realize that to make a movie you can´t just follow the book (that would take at least a 20 hour movie) but why waste time in details shown in the book while discarding some important effects the book causes? For example, Frodo´s journey becomes unbearable in the book, here it only seems like a long walk, only uncomfortable. And the story, honestly, becomes to slow and long for a movie. It´s ok for the book to be slow because it gives us time to enjoy the details of Tolkien´s work, but in the movie is just a waste of time. Besides all it´s downsides, it has most of what people should expect: Absolutely AMAZING special effects, Gollum is as real as it gets and the battle scene it´s marvellous, but it comes too late. My girlfriend didn´t read the book and thought the movie was allright, not as surprising as the first one, but good. So, to sum it up, for me it can barely make it. It has a 10 in special effects, but a 2 in the plot."

","Just to make sure it doesn't go unnoticed by the book-experienced... Sam's comment in Gondor that ""by rights we shouldn't even be here"" was wonderfully tongue-in-cheek and a real nod to those familiar with Tolkien's books. I gotta quibble that Faramir was a lore master in his own right and his knowledge and sense of honor are keys to his ability to resist the ring; so, having changed Faramir in this fundamental way, I don't quite know where PJ will take his character--perhaps just throw it away which would be too bad.<br/><br/>There were ""rewrites"" of the book certainly but most didn't bother me. I could sort of see the story team saying ""let's add some tension here or there for those who don't know the books."" The Faramir gambit above did annoy me a little and so did the suggestion that Aragorn is falling for Eowyn and Arwen is off to the Grey Havens. I don't really see the point in changing key elements of a character's personality--especially since in these three cases we're talking about character archetypes whose lineage, honor and dignity define them.<br/><br/>But, it's a tremendous film for all of that I enjoyed every minute of it."

"SulphurMan","Null","0","0","3 January 2003"," A huge and jolting dissapointment
","I am a huge fan of both the original Tolkien LOTR trilogy and the first film, the fellowship of the ring. Both possesed a certain intimacy and overall sense of strength due to the way in which they were original and engaging. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same about the Two Towers. TTT was a total and complete mess from top to bottom, a downward spiral of pathetic Hollywood money making schemes and an overall heap of cliche garbage.<br/><br/>
Characters are as deep as a puddle at this point, and the sole desire of the movie seemed to be geared towards ""awe inspiring"" battle scenes,""scary"" orcs and the sappy, melodramatic ""bravery"" of the heroes. Well, awe inspiring they were not. Predictable and bland is more like it. Gollum was the only shining light in this film, otherwise it was just a total piece of trash. It hurts me to say that, because I enjoyed the first film so much and the books are just absolutely phenomenal. I think P. Jackson must have polled a group of 11 year old boys on the way out of the Fellowship of the Ring last year and decided the go on their advice. They probably said stuff like ""The dwarf gimli was so funny! heehee!"", ""the battle scenes were really awesome - wow!!!"", ""the Uruk Hai leader was scary! - eeek!!!"" etc etc etc. After tabulating this information, it seems like he based the movie around these weak sets of standards and made it a long boring waste of time and money.<br/><br/>Many crazed and obsessed fans of this film have been defeated by the hype. I think they have been convincing themselves for the last year that since the first one was good, this one will be even better. When they were presented with this melodramatic b.s., somehow I feel like many of them just accepted it because they didnt want to be let down. Thats a real shame. I say embrace the dissapointing feeling and just be honest, rather than trying to convince yourself that it was the incredible triumph you think it was. Hey - if you liked it, you liked it. Im not going to argue with that. It just seems really pitiful when someone claims they dont like TTT and get ripped apart for speaking their opinion. Thats just depressing. I think many fans are unfortunately starting to equate the books with these movies, and claming that a true fan of the books MUST love TTT or else theyre not a real fan. Thats just sad, I think. will probably bring up the boneheaded argument ""well why did you post this much if you hated it so much!?!?!"". Im posting this in hope that maybe somehow, someway, anyone else out there who loved the books and was dissapointed with this movie can honestly feel like they arent the only one who is honest with themselves. A film series of this magnitude also deserves an even headed approach rather than just a bunch of blind Peter Jackson worshippers saying that it is the greatest movie of all time.<br/><br/>I would like to see a more charecter based and mature approach to the last film so that it can at least be seen as some sort of overall effort rather than just a good start and nothing more. This needs to improve, its gotten very weak.<br/><br/>Can you honestly claim that this film deserves a 9.0?????????"

","Tolkien created a world with depth of huge proportions and this is portrayed to great effect in these films. Only with todays technology can it be portrayed so well. These films are a feat of planning and project management if nothing else. Two Towers has everything you could get into a film, action, war, romance, character developmennt, intrigue....I loved it and have seen it three times already! Some may find it slow going for the first hour or so, but watch it carefully as you see more elements of the whole story being brought together. Gollum is a fantastic technological achievment and almost steals the show if it wasn't for everything else going on. The battle scenes are amazing. There are differences (a good number to) with the book but I think its worth letting them pass, the film does justice to Tolkiens creation. Truly great film making, what will Jackson do next."

","Well, it's not bad but it's not the best either. I was expecting much more than I got. Perhaps the reason is that LOTR 1 was absolutely brilliant and set high expectations. Perhaps another reason is the fact that I am a hardcore fan and have read the book innumerable times.<br/><br/>Still, I accepted some changes in the LOTR 1. In The Two Towers, however, there are things that I cannot understand and/or accept.<br/><br/>Mind you, I am not saying the movie is bad!

I just want to say that certain changes of the original plot do not contribute whatsoever to a better movie.<br/><br/>
POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW The kiss and hug part is all right - people who have not read the book have to understand the drama of Aragorn and Arwen. But, for god's sake, why changing some crucial details in the battle of Helm's Deep?! The elves' arrival and the speech of their leader was a horrible cliche. Not to mention Frodo and Sam's trip to Osgilliath - now that was really too much. END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>The ents were quite meager - I am sure that PJ would have cut them out the way he cut out Tom Bombadil in LOTR 1 if he could. The outcome of the entmoot and the following speech was yet another horrible cliche. As a result, at certain points, I was outright bored and/or was shaking my head in complete confusion and bewilderment. (I've never thought that I will be bored during this movie.)<br/><br/>Now some good words. Gollum was really brilliant - too sad he is a computer graphic, not a human. He deserves an Oscar for his part.<br/><br/>The effects in general were Ok, though, during the battle for Helm's Deep the orcs were flying aside like toothpicks. The crossing of the Dead Marshes was creepy enough to scare me out of my wit.<br/><br/>The Two Towers time and time again reminded me that New Zealand has a very pretty nature and made me wish to go there.<br/><br/>Once again, the film is not bad at all, but could have been better.

","This is probably a pretty controversial opinion but looking at some of the comments left for this film I'm surprised some of you people even bother to air your petty disagreements, so all's fair, I suppose.<br/><br/>First of all, a bit of background, as at least one other reviewer doesn't think this film is going to be enjoyed by ""females"". I'm quite happily female, from the UK, and read the books for the first time when I was 11 - more recently to get my memory up to speed too.<br/><br/>My problem with TTT - the book - was really that I always got bored in the middle and simply turned off. I'm a pretty intelligent person and avid reader (or so I'd like to think) but something about the middle-end of TTT always put me off. I was, therefore, a bit dubious about seeing the film.<br/><br/>However, I was delighted to watch this masterpiece from Peter Jackson. In my opinion this film is BETTER than FoTR - the amazing ratings for FoTR are mostly for the visuals and novelty which are obviously very similar in TTT. However this film is extremely gripping and fast paced, with moments of tension and surprise throughout, and EXTREMELY strong characterisation of the main players. I disagree with the opinions about Faramir and was delighted to see how closely he was played to Boromir with the difference showing in Faramir's decision, which did not happen earlier because he wasn't aware of Boromir's downfall - once he found that out, he laid his life forfeit. Good stuff. I also don't think that a few of the other characters in the film were portrayed as weakly as some people make out - did you really see the same film I did, or only what you wanted to believe?<br/><br/>One thing that pleased me most as a UKian was the accuracy of the characters' accents throughout. Gimli was Scottish sometimes and not at others, but other than that everything was spot on - especially all the characters' quaint habit of saying ""can not"" instead of ""can't""!<br/><br/>TTT was spectacular, amazing, fantastic (in the fantasy sense of the word), epic, huge, beautiful, emotional and human. I was surprised when the interval came up and astonished that the end happened so quickly, and can't WAIT for the Return of the King to hit our screens!"

","There must be a lot of Tolkien readers hyping up the movie 'cos unfortunately it seems like this movie was created for their watching pleasure only.

The movie becomes too long because of this too. I'm sure there are superfluous scenes that can be trimmed without disturbing the overall storyline.<br/><br/>But the biggest problem I had with this movie is that there is a sense of detachment that I get when watching it, that I end up being an observer rather than getting involved in the thick of it all. It's like watching ""The Longest Day"" instead of ""Star Wars"" (the original ones that is).<br/><br/>I am not asking for the movie to follow a formulaic Hollywood style storyline, I just want a simpler script.

","What more can anyone say about this installment of LOTR?  It just gets better and better.<br/><br/>For those who have complained about this movie being too long, too confusing, having too much violence, having too much added or taken away from the books, etc:  How can I politely say this?  Well, here it is -- Quit whining!  This is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>It should be understood that the task of capturing a story as huge as LOTR on film is probably the most ambitious cinema project ever attempted, and Peter Jackson has succeeded in a HUGE way.  The Two Towers is epic, grand, awe-inspiring, colossal, and did I say epic?<br/><br/>Ok, all hype aside, the only one thing that can justifiably be said to criticize this film really can't be helped.   As a stand-alone movie, it can be darned confusing.   Anyone who hasn't seen Fellowship Of The Ring will be hopelessly lost and confused.  Those who haven't read the books might have a hard time following the fine points of the story.  But even people who fit into those categories will be treated to lots of eye candy and spectacular cinemaphotography.<br/><br/>TTT is in the unfortunate position of effectively being the middle three hours of a nine hour movie.  Just like the middle child of a family, it has to struggle a bit to get the attention that its siblings do.  Fellowship was groundbreaking and emotional; Return of the King will likely be spectacular in bringing the story to closure; but TTT has the difficult job of connecting those portions together while still holding the attention of the average movie goer.<br/><br/>Those of us who are familiar with the books know what is coming next, and how the events of TTT are crucial to setting it all up; while those who don't know the books might well wonder what the point of this movie is.<br/><br/>With that rather long preamble, let me say that this movie has it all: drama, humor, action, emotion, spectacular sets and costumes, great acting, special effects that blow you away yet don't call attention to themselves. Gollum is nothing short of amazing.  He is exactly as he is depicted in the books.  His voice sends shivers down your spine and you actually feel sorry for him as he is still tortured by the ring.  The ents are superb.  The riders of Rohan and the city of Edoras are just as I imagined them to be. The battle of Helm's deep is some of the most incredible battle footage I've had the pleasure to watch in any movie of any genre.  Etc, etc.<br/><br/>Ok, now for the nitpicking.  (Spoiler country ahead!)  There were some significant modifications to the story.  In the books, the ents didn't have to be tricked into destroying Isengard.  Faramir wasn't really a clone of his older brother in trying to seize the ring for Gondor.  Elves didn't really show up at the last minute to defend Helm's Deep.  The movie left out the role of the Huorns (trees with an attitude) in defeating the orcs after the battle.  Aragorn never took a fall over a cliff only to miraculously return.   Shelob was left out entirely. (Although I fully expect that part to be included in the next and final chapter, since Gollum clearly set it up with his talk of ""She'll kill them.."")<br/><br/>I can't say if the modifications made the movie better or worse; I'll just trust Peter Jackson and company's judgment that the changes were necessary in order to adapt a long and detailed written story to a manageable visual one.   If every single detail of the books was turned into film, the title might very well need to be changed to ""Bored of the Ring.""  For a purist, the changes might be blasphemy.  But in reality, the changes added to the suspense and flow of the movie.<br/><br/>No question about it, this one earns a solid 10/10 !"

It is ALSO an excellent adaptation of the second book, with a few changes made and extras added in, and I didn't mind that Shelob (who features at the end of the book TTT) won't make her appearance until the third movie.<br/><br/>I was a little worried that this film wouldn't meet my (rather high!) expectations (re Star Wars I, II) and the battle scenes would turn out like they did in Star Wars II - but I was pleasantly surprised! You see real warriors (and C.G.I ones of course) in real armor during the huge battle at Helm's Deep. I liked the battle with the Waarg riders, and Gandalf's fight with the Balrog was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Gollum is simply amazing. You forget he's C.G.I and marvel at how hideous and slimy he is. His animation is just about perfect, even better than that boring Final Fantasy flick. His movements were animated over a live actor (who also does his voice) which really added to his realism.<br/><br/>I found TTT to be even better than FotR! Unlike the first movie, which concentrated mostly on character development, TTT now concentrates on moving the story along with the battles, rise of Sauron etc. <br/><br/>MR LUCAS TAKE NOTE!! Watch this film a few times BEFORE you make Star Wars III (after all, we *do* have to wait 3 or 4 years for the third installment, which is *plenty* of time to come up with a *good* movie)<br/><br/>

","My opinion is that although it had some great scenes of action, after the first hour ,had nothing to do with the book. A lot of junk was added  to the film. From the love-story of Arwen and Aragorn ,to the elvish army in Deep of Helm (there was no such thing in the book) along with the orc-wolf attack to the people (where did this come from?) to the attempt to persuade the Ents by Pippin (their decision was instant), the lose of the torture feeling by hunger and thirst of Froddo and Sam, Faramir's decision to take froddo with him (not such thing happened) and last the worst of all the confrontation of Froddo to the black rider so close to Mordor. This totally sucked since the whole journey of the fellowship of the ring was based on the secrecy of this trip. I would not speak of the cut of five chapters of the book about the Shellob spider ,since this could be added to the next film (I really hope so!) So in my opinion it was a nice action adventure film that had NOTHING TO DO WITH TOLKJIEN. A real boxoffice buster but a total failure regarding the Trilogy about the ring. So the fact remains. If you really want to have that sensational feeling of this masterpiece ,BUY THE BOOKS. They are several classes superior than the films... Too bad ,cause the first film really ,got me going."

","Well, it's not perfect, but it is a hell of a lot of movie. You can argue whether or not the changes are good or bad, add anything or detract. The stilted script isn't too much of an issue; this isn't a soap opera, after all. It isn't the effect on THIS film that counts. It's just that Jackson's approach to the Two Towers is making me a little anxious about his future handling of ROTK. For Jackson has created Middle-Earth for us, so forcefully and beautifully, that we can actually start wondering what would make ROTK the show-stopper. He has the chance to make the third film one of the most beautifully balanced, moving, poignant yet uplifting ever run through a projector. So can he pull it back to capture the poetry (not literal!) of the last book, or will he succumb to the temptation to make the battles bigger and bigger? For the pay-off, ROTK has to display a subtlety not always evident in TTT.<br/><br/>so what will make the difference between another brilliant Epic and the one we really all want? It isn't a question about slavish adherence to the book, but the way it hangs together is nonetheless the key.<br/><br/>Frodo has already flashed his ring at a Nazgul, but, once Minas Tirith has held, the entire purpose of Aragorn, his fellow generals and the army is to stop Sauron noticing that his ring is on its way to Mount Doom. Faramir saw him do it! How to re-forge the integrity of the plot?<br/><br/>The battle before the Black Gate isn't a battle. It isn't a desperate play for survival, like Helm's Deep. It is a sacrifice. The last army (no elves, now, we hope - they are a spent force) don't even know if the ring is still abroad, but they know this is the only gamble left. Will Jackson get it?<br/><br/>The lord of the Nazgul is going to ride up to the gates of Gondor. Gandalf will block him. This Nazgul needs to inspire dread and loathing. In comparison, the Balrog, your average Alien and Dracula must feel like Noddy's tea-time companions. Will he go for it?<br/><br/>It is one of the ironies of the story that, as Frodo succumbs finally and completely to the ring, and Gollum bites his finger off in yet another replay of Sauron's downfall in the Prologue, the destiny of Middle-Earth is actually decided by luck / fate / Wyrd as Gollum stumbles. Despite all the valiant efforts of Men to distract, Frodo and Sam to reach the Mountain and even Gollum to intervene, the ring is finally destroyed by chance. If you can capture that, Mr. Jackson, then you can take your seat next to Kurosawa and Coppola.<br/><br/>The last stroke of the war ought to fall on Frod's doorstep - a wonderful symmetry, and some trouble in the Shire will incidentally also allow Rose Cotton to deliver potentially one of the greatest one liners in cinema history (if you've read the book you'll know...)<br/><br/>Sam must be utterly floored when he sees Elrond and Galadriel in that line-up on the way to the Havens. This is one of the emotional climaxes of the film. And Gandalf ought to be held back to the Havens. It would be a diminishment if he wasn't.<br/><br/>All I'm saying is: ROTK depends on a lot more than CGI, sweepy camera syndrome and big battles, however brilliantly they have been executed (and they were!!) We know PJ can do that stuff, but he has to be brave to make his real mark. It is cinematically possible, and he hasn't really done anything to the plot to stop him. I am just hoping I can enjoy the Two Towers as a deliberate, superbly crafted, titanic action curtain-raiser to a very different kind of climax.<br/><br/>Over to you, Peter Jackson. Drop me a line if you want!"

","When I first saw the Two Towers I thought the changes very distracting and incomplete. 2nd time around I stopped comparing it to the book and actually enjoyed it very much, there is some extra depth introduced to the characters and the story, the success of this extra depth is normally revealed if there is an improvement on further viewings.<br/><br/>The movie suffers a little from trying to be all things to all people, however its more interesting in the long run for having more angles. I spoke to some people who thought the love story was their favourite part. If more care is taken with the story lines, humour, action and dialogue, there will be more immediacy as well as depth.<br/><br/>I hope Peter Jackson takes his time a bit more with the next one."
"NotTheOne000","10","0","0","3 January 2003"," Masterpiece
","It is a hazardous business, watching much anticipated films, especially when those are based upon greatly loved existing works - the new Star Wars films or the Judge Dredd movie are good examples. When it comes to a work that touches people so deeply, everyone has their own very personal opinions about how things should look, about which characters or events are most important and about how many alterations are acceptable. Some hold that if the story is not to be re-created exactly then it should not be done at all; others hold that as long as the spirit of the source material is maintained we should accept any changes that are made.<br/><br/>I am one of the lucky ones, as my vision of LotR and Peter Jackson's vision are remarkably similar. When I watched The Two Towers it was as though (with a few exceptions) my own imaginings had been sucked out of my head, polished, tweaked, filled out and generally improved, and then projected onto a giant white screen with Dolby surround sound accompaniment. I didn't mind the changes, and I didn't mind the fact that the film ends before the book does because I was too busy falling in love with the second part of what I consider to be the greatest cinematic work of all time.<br/><br/>Citizen Kane? Unimaginative! Star Wars? Old Hat! I know this will sound really tragic, but there were points during the film (and also, I found, when watching the extended DVD version of The Fellowship yesterday afternoon) where the vision before me was so exquisite and captured so well my understanding of the book that I worried I would embarrass myself by bursting into tears! To put it simply, there may be a few other films that achieve to greater effect individual aspects of this film, but as a whole experience LotR is, to me, simply without equal; no other film even comes close. This realisation of Tolkien's great classic is the pinnacle of a hundred years of film making, and I would compare it with the Sistine Chapel, St Peter's cathedral or Beethoven's Midnight Concerto as one of humanity's truly great artistic creations.<br/><br/>I do feel deeply for those fans who do not find Jackson's interpretation as wonderful as I do, and I am sorry that some do not see him as the great visionary that many others do. All I can suggest is that next time you watch the Two Towers, try and forget the details of the plot - ignore the alterations and the differences in interpretation and try to remember how you felt when you first read the books. Hopefully, with time, you will learn to love this film as much as I do."

","It sounds to me as if some people are disappointed that they haven't just witnessed their own personal epiphany on celluloid (or digitally projected where available).  If you are one of these people, I feel sorry for you. You are missing a truly wonderful experience and probably one of the best cinematic adaptations from source material there is around.  Don't worry, those treasured images conjured from reading the books will still be there after you've seen the film.  Maybe they'll even be improved.  Plus, you can always read the books again afterwards.<br/><br/>This film is the equal of the magnificent 'The Fellowship of the Ring'.  The themes are different of course and the feeling is possible even more traditionally Epic.  You get swept along with the whole experience, you feel the devastation of Rohan, the assault on Helm's Deep, the possibility of the extinction of men. <br/><br/>The portrayal of the effect of the Ring is magnificent.  Frodo's pain and fall into its grip are clear across the screen as Frodo's dependence on Sam to keep him going grows.  Gollum/Smeagol is the best use of a CGI character I've yet seen on film, praise which should not detract from the Ents, Fell Beasts and Wargs.  The assault of Helm's Deep in stunning mostly because of the clarity of editing and narrative at what could be a very confusing moment.  At all points it is clear what is going on and how desperate the situation is becoming.<br/><br/>The only slight criticism I have (and it's only tiny and not enough to stop me giving the film a 10), is that it feels as though there's something missing.  You'll know what I mean if you've seen the extend Fellowship DVD. The extra footage in that seems to round out that film and complete it.  I already can't wait for the extended DVD of the Two Towers.<br/><br/>So, you must see this even if you think that Elves and Dwarves are a little bit silly.  Peter Jackson has made a stunning film out of what could have been the hardest book of the three adapt.  Possibly the best epic film series there has yet been made."
"Chris_USA","Null","0","0","2 January 2003"," Incredible Movie Even With Changes From the Book
","Once again, Peter Jackson, with his cast and crew, completely baffled me and many other audiences with The Two Towers. Yes, its true that it's not 100% true to the book, but lets face it: As Stephen King says, ""Movies and books are like apples and oranges. They're both delicious, but taste completely different."" Personally, I'm a huge Tolkien fan, and I would love to see them adapt every single line of the books to the screen. However, it would be impractical and would probably only please big Tolkien fans like myself.<br/><br/>Even with changes in effect, it seems to me that the movie's most powerful themes (good vs. evil, Love between Frodo and Sam, corruption of the ring, etc)are 100% true to the books. In the end, thats what, I believe, the audience will value most.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was amazing. For action-lovers, the Two Towers is much more action-packed than the Fellowship, and portrayal of the battle at Helm's Deep is downright incredible. Other pluses include: excellent adaptation of Gollum and the Ents, and excellent acting. Excellent work, Peter Jackson and the entire cast and crew - Keep it up! Waiting a year for the third will be torture but based on the first two films, absolutely worth it!"

","Mild spoilers<br/><br/>Great film, full of great action scenes, directing, acting, and the scenic backdrops blew me away. However I enjoyed the first one more. I was expecting, like everyone else, TTT to top FOTR in just about every aspect, which it did not.<br/><br/>The ""weakness"" with this film compared to the first, is not following up the great characters and their portrayals on screen. Maybe the fact that the first film was supposed to get us into the characters more, and the 2nd is to emphasize new characters, (which was mediocre) however, we need to care about all principle characters in the moment, we don't want to remember how they were, we want to re-discover what made us love them in the first film. This I don't believe was well done.<br/><br/>Scenic shots, and backgrounds are absolutely fantastic. In FOTR, we had a great comparison of these `small' hobbits in such a large world. In TTT, I had that same feeling. The size of the Black Gate and Helm's Deep stood out above all, especially the remarkable battle scene that took place.<br/><br/>Overall, of course it is a definite recommendation, but don't expect the acting to surpass the first, but expect the overall astonishing visuals to keep you gripping your seat, asking for more. It will be a tortuous 12 months for the next. ****"

","The first time I that read Lord of the Rings I was eleven years old -in love with fantasy and television- and  I knew no one would ever be able to bring Tolkien to life on the big screen. I was wrong. Kudos to Peter Jackson and an amazing group of talented people. The Fellowship was awesome. A beautiful expression of Tolkien's Middle Earth. I didn't think the Two Towers could really pull that same level in the middle of a trilogy. Again, I was wrong. Just amazing. And now  I have to wait another year for the finale. Arg! But this time I believe. Thank you. Just hold me down when all three are released in extended DVD. I'll be in front of the tele for a day. I hope! Don't read any farther if you have not seen the movie. Possible minor spoilers ahead. And now that I've said that. I do have a complaint. I wish someone had caught the two sword problems in the movie. The first: when  Aragorn went over the cliff . Didn't anyone think that after being knocked off his horse in the middle of the battle he would not take the time to sheath his long sword? That just  doesn't make sense. And than there's Sting. Frodo and Sam are captured and  someone gave Frodo his weapon back? Or they didn't take it away? Then there's that shot where Gandalf is clearly holding onto the 'non-existent' saddle on Shadowfax. And didn't Mary and Pipin cut/remove their ropes after the 'horse incident'? He clearly has his arms open and up when the horse is coming down. And then, okay, I'm sorry. I know I'm being picky. But this movie is so gorgeous , so beautifully made- it's a true vision -that I just wanted perfection. I guess I can settle with a work of art. Thanks."

"ahellyer","10","0","0","2 January 2003"," Roll on Return of the King
","Like most people who saw this film, I found it to be a very enjoyable experience. While it is not without some flaws overall it deserves the praise it has received. (Please excuse the spoilers ahead).<br/><br/>For those of you who found it a bit disjointed just remember that the film encompasses two major plot lines - events in Rohan and Frodo heads to Mordor - plus the minor one of Merry and Pippin's escapades. No matter how the director tries to fit them together it won't suit all viewers. Additionally, as the middle part of a trilogy it was always going to be difficult to make it stand on its own as well as the first. But just wait until 2004 when you can watch all three in a row....<br/><br/>For those of you who have made comments about film quality, the CGI used to overlay the digital Gollum over the actor Andy Cserkis, etc, I highly recommend getting the DVD extended edition pack that has two discs devoted to the making of the first film.<br/><br/>Just sit back and enjoy the action, scenery, music and adventure. Appreciate the scope of the movies and the effort made for realism (for example, two guys spent about 18 months full time just making suits of chainmail). Read the books and if possible watch FoTR again before you see TTT. Sure it is a long movie and slow in parts but what movie isn't. And don't get caught up with trying to compare it to other great movies (if you think the Godfather movies are the pinnacle of cinema excellence, fine, but they are not the LoTR trilogy and should not be rated against each other).<br/><br/>As for some of the other issues people have commented/complained about...<br/><br/>1. Faramir - I agree that Jackson was a bit harsh on him but I believe Tolkien himself was a bit generous towards him. Imagine you are the commander of military forces guarding your borders from huge evil and two little guys turn up carrying a powerful artifact that in the wrong hands would destroy your land. I think Faramir would have been suspicious of their motives (as he was at first in the book) and not basically say ""off you go lads, here's some food, head due east to Mordor, you can't miss it - high mountains, volcanoes and a squillion orcs"". Wait for the third movie to see him more in tune with the Faramir of the books. His change of heart and allowing the hobbits to leave is, I suspect, also part of setting the conflict with, and within, his father Denethor in the next book.<br/><br/>2. Shelob - don't worry she will be in the next movie. Gollum basically says so at the end of TTT. Who cares whether she was in the second book but not in the second movie.<br/><br/>3. Elves at Helm's Deep are a symbol of the wider conflict - Peter Jackson is trying to convey in the movie what was covered in a few lines in the books - namely that forces of evil were fighting elves, men and dwarves elsewhere while the fighting in Gondor and Rohan was occurring. I would not find it unusual if the third movie had dwarves appearing at the siege of Minas Tirith to further symbolise the alliance of the three races. The sequence with Elrond and Galdriel was necessary to explain why the elves would be at Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>4. Aragorn and Eowyn - this bit is basically showing Eowyn's infatuation with a powerful, handsome and noble man (which is touched upon in Tolkien's writings somewhere). Cliched? Perhaps, but in real life romance, when you look closely, is often cliched. Why should the movies be any different? I have to admit that the bit with Aragorn falling off the cliff is a bit unnecessary - perhaps the extended version might make it clearer.<br/><br/>5. Arwen and Aragorn - some found this theme slow and laboured. But remember she is considering giving up immortality for Aragorn, not just deciding what colour gossamer dress to wear that day. It is an integral theme to Tolkien's work."

'the Two Towers'is a breathtaking movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, even if you have read the book. Errors, errors, yes of course, but ive come up with my own reasoning for why they were there.<br/><br/>There are rules to literature and rules to cinema and sometimes, both of them dont mix. However, little things (like Aragorns horse being named Brego-?) were a little excessive.<br/><br/>I did love the Warg fight, though it was not in the book. I also like Legolas' little outburst, and i loved gimli as the comedy in what would have been a completely tense movie.<br/><br/>But i will say this. Liv Tylers portrayal as Arwen is quite dissapointing. Yes, She does look the part. I will give you that, but the way she speaks, and some of her facial expressions is enough to drive me up a wall. And her place in the movie was over the top. The love triangle was nice i thought, but does anyone really care if she leaves, other than aragorn? Ya gotta know that Eowyn wants her gone.<br/><br/>Gollum. Good god, was he not incredible? CG has come a long way, has it not? He looked totally believable, and the interaction between he and Frodo and Sam was absolutely amazing. I guess we owe a bow to Andy Serkis for that one. He is definantly a pioneer in that category.<br/><br/>THe dialogue i enjoyed, and the music was absolutley fantastic. But being the Elf fan that i am, it is saying something that the best argument in the entire movie was Gollum....with himself.<br/><br/>Go and see it, if you havent already.

A large number of them leave me wondering a) what they were expecting to see b)how they thought Peter Jackson was supposed to crunch all that information into a short film (and yes three hours IS short for all that Tolkien put to paper) without taking liberty with the book and c) didn't they see the line 'BASED on the novel by JRR Tolkien'??<br/><br/>In my opinion, Tolkien weaves a good story BUT he talks too dang much. While Peter did take some liberties with the plotline, what movie based on a film has not? The Wizard of Oz, often referred to as one of the best films ever...NOT like the book. Gone with the Wind? Mary Poppins?The Green Mile? Jaws? Jurrasic Park? All very popular and award winning movies...not one of them page for page like the book. All of them are ADAPTATIONS of the book. Learn this word people! ADAPTATION.<br/><br/>Calm down guys!!!  So far the two LOTR movies have not dissapointed me. Yes TTT was different than the book, but who knows what will show up in ROTK?? I really wish people could just go to a movie and enjoy it for what it is and not pick it apart. If the purists of the world can't stand for their beloved books to be adapted for film THEN DON'T GO SEE THE FILM.<br/><br/>I loved LOTR. I was awestruck by TTT.

","The Two Towers, the sequel.  Not only a sequel, but part two of three. One has to remember that when they sit down with their popcorn.  This movie is pretty fast paced, fast cut, and overall intense.  The battle scenes are epic and the dialogue scenes have loads of information to digest.  If you haven't read the books (like myself) but are familiar with the story, you're in luck.  You'll learn something and possibly even walk away a bit confused. The most intriguing and the most emotional, for me, are the scenes involving Gollum/Smeagol (Slinker & Stinker).  Tears and laughter want to explode at the same time while Gollum and Smeagol have at it with one another.  An internal turmoil that has been there for hundreds of years. And the CGI, well, nevermind that.  You'll forget in an instant that Gollum is computer generated.  Unlike Dawby the house-elf.<br/><br/>There are many scenes that were added in apart from the books, and many parts of the books that aren't in the movie.  The transition from book to film is not always easy.  Suspense (aka Hooks) is a key form to action flicks.  It's necessary.  Internal and external struggle are also key parts in screenplays/movies.  As is romance.  (yawn)  But, it has to be done.<br/><br/>There were a few scenes where the CGI jumps out at you and you can tell that something is outta whack, but those brief instances are quickly forgotten or dismissed.  There are many heavy action/battle scenes and several breathtaking topography shots.  All of it is amazing.  It's well acted, well conceived and overall a great MOVIE!  I say it like that so the purists will not turn beet red and explode with anger.  Yes, it's a fact, it is not 100% true to the book.  But, the story is the same.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing it at least TWICE.  You'll get a lot more from it because the brain can only consume so much.  Once is definately not enough.

","First, I believe 'Lord of the Rings' to be one of the greatest books of the 20th century - (and definitely the best fantasy books ever to be written) -- we'll get that out of the way... I am a fan of the book.<br/><br/>If you are one of those people who expects a word-for-word translation of the written text to the visual medium, forget it. Tolkien knew that this was impossible, as did the cast and crew of the film adaptation. However, Peter Jackson has done an incredible job keeping to the spirit (if not necessarily the letter) of Tolkien's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Yes... this means that Jackson and company had to cut out some sections of the book, and yes, add (or at least emphasise) and re-organise other sections. To feel that somehow this betrays both Tolkien (and his fans) is utter nonsense.<br/><br/>The film is absolute beauty and grandeur - gorgeous cinematography and production. The battle scenes are truly epic (in an age when that term gets thrown about a bit much) - Never before has CGI been so seamlessly integrated into live action (the crew at WETA workshop deserves many, many awards for their work). Most impressive on the CGI front is that this movies realises the first full-fledged CGI character (Gollum/Smeagol makes Yoda from SWII look like the Kracken from Clash of the Titans). Let's not forget the actors (the 'real' ones, that is)... stellar group that one - someone paid attention when casting and hired not 'stars' but the right people for the roles (novel concept that).<br/><br/>So yes, this is not a 1:1 mapping from book to movie, and it never could have been. Peter Jackson has done brilliantly and certainly better than any other director working today could have done (and might I add, better than any of those 'fans' who feel it necessary to slag the film could have done either).<br/><br/>Appreciate what has been given to you. There could never have been a better version (and this one is pretty spectacular at that). 10/10"
"nicoamil","7","0","0","2 January 2003"," Technically, a great movie
","Well, what to say when you see a movie you´ve been imagining for 7 years... It is really hard to throw away prejudices and preconcepts. I think the result of this adaptation is more than acceptable, in fact, an excellent product. Great action, the love story, superb FX, nice and respectable stars, the drama, the commedy. It has all that it has to have. BUT then, as a LOTR fan, I feel very very dissappointed with some points. First of all, it makes me feel sad to see that THE ACTING, the best interpretation, the scene that better shows the spirit of theater and acting is the one of Gollum ""struggling"" with Sméagol. The best actor is computer created, without forgetting the surelly hard work (and very good one) of Andy Serkis. Now on to the characters. I was pissed off when I saw Aragorn giving the daggers to the hobbits and I understood that no Tom Bombadil will be in FOTR. I said, ""OK, it´s a whole new character and lot of time for something that, truly, doesn´t affect so much the storyline"". Something similar with Arwen and Glorfindel; but now, when Gollum decides to take Frodo and Sam to SheLob´s lair, it decides so because of Frodo ""betrays"" him. In the books, and I´ve already said that I´m a fan and cannot throw my concepts, Gollum takes the two hobbits to SheLob because of Sam, and this is one of the most important things in Sam´s character. Like Frodo hasn´t enough, Jackson took it off of Sam to give it to Frodo. HEY! SAM ALREADY EXISTS, YOU DON´T HAVE TO MAKE A NEW CHARACTER!!! This makes me sad too. But with Faramir, what Jackson did to Faramir makes me not sad but VERY P***ED OFF. This Faramir is totally opposed to the Faramir of the books. He was one of the noblest and wisest characters, even being very young, and there was a very big difference between Boromir and Faramir. I can´t see this difference in the movie. Man, Faramir resisted the temptation of the ring almost without effort, and here he don´t have the chance to get out of the shadow of his big brohter. In fact, it doesn´t even seems to bother him... It is a good movie, really well done, but for someone who have already created and recreated the characters, it will be a little difficult to accept some of these changes. Anyway, everyone should see it once or twice."

","Orcs, uruk-hai,oliphants, gollum, Treebeard, dragons the Two Towers is populated with a cavalcade of imaginative creations. Any film worth it's merit though must stand on the quality of it's characters and storyline, the second rings film does well to continue the narrative started in fellowship, but falls a bit short in pacing. The book on which the film is based is very dense containing no less than three seperate plot threads. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli come to the aid of Rohan in dire times, Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard in Fanghorn forest, and Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their journy to Mordor. For the most part Peter Jackson cuts and pastes the story well. With so much to tell in three hours The Two Towers isn't quite as poetic as Fellowship and is much more action oriented. This is not a short coming by any means since the entire purpose of Fellowship was exposition and character devolpment. At this point we know all of the main characters, there is no reason to re-introduce them. As a second act of a nine hour film it's goal is get the piston's of the storyline to fire and get the engine going in the red. However in a few instances the editing is a little too rapid fire.(this will be remedied with the extended edition 30 scenes were cut.) The portion with Rohan is clearly the stand out. Saruman's genocide of the race of men is portrayed in a grim stand off with the desperate people of Rohan. The film makes it very clear what is at stake because of this I was able to empathize with the plight of Theoden and his people. At Helm's Deep we a shown children as young as 12 being forced into the service of the king. This is a nation of the verge of utter destruction the war is bleak and violent and not glamourized as in Micheal Bay's special effect commercials. Also during Helm's Deep we begin to see Aragorn as a leader.<br/><br/>The story of Sam and Frodo is brief in this installment but still effective. Their journy contains the film's most fascinating character Gollum. Gollum has been tortured with his desire for the ring for a very long time. He has a split personality Gollum is the evil, and smeagol the small part of him left over from the days when he used to be a hobbit. Gollum could have easily came off as an annoying character. Here though he is a wretched pitiful creature that is actually a sympathetic character. There is a scene in which he is captured and interigated and it very sad to watch Gollum struggle with his splintered mind. Merry and Pippin meet the ents a race of old humanoid trees that watch over the forest. Depending on your tolerance for fantasy you'll either like them or gag on their caricature. Treebeard is the main ent and he is a representation of the forest. This thread is the shortest and the least of the three presented. More time with this would have been beneficial since the storming of Isengard is a center peice at the end. The production values range from average to outstanding. Filming three films back to back clearly has left a mark on this trilogy. In some scenes the camera work seems to have been done on the fly. As with Fellowship there is still too much shaky cam. Sometimes I felt the camera shots weren't chosen for any artistic reason, but because it was all the unit was able to get under the strict schedule. The effects are again a grab bag of good and bad. The Two Towers in general is a more acomplished film than Fellowship in it's effects than the first. Although there are still a few bad blue screen shots here and there. The Two Towers is a fantasic epic with a few very minor problems that do not distract from the overall enjoyment of the film. This was by far the hardest book to translate to film of the three. 9/10"

","What can I say, that everyone else has not said. This movie was amazing. I can't say it was better than FOTR, because they were two totally different movies, with different meanings, philosphies,and whatnot. I saw this movie 3 times in one week, and I plan on going again.<br/><br/>I am not going to go over the story, but just give you the key moments I loved about this movie. Golumm- was amazing. As everyone says, Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his performance. He did a brilliant job, and so did the animators. His schyizophrenia, was hilarious, and filmed just right! I was lucky when I went the first night, to be in a full theatre full of lotr's fans, b/c it was like a bond. Before it started, we all clapped and at the end, we all clapped.<br/><br/>I also loved the scenes when Frodo and Sam see all those new evil races. I think that they were all dressed amazing. I loved the Oliphaunts! My all time favorite moment( well i have two) is 1, when Gandalf and Eoumer come on the 5th day, and with all the riders, they ride down that steep mountain and they seem to fly. The music at that moment, is AMAZING! I cry every time I see that.  My 2nd favorite is when Treebeard, Merry, and Pippin see the damage that Saruman dealt on the outer trees, and when Treebeard calls his fellow Ents on the ""last march of the Ents"". The score was equally moving and it still all amazes me.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10, and now I must wait a whole year before I do this again.."

"zaff_","10","0","0","2 January 2003"," Welcome back to Middle Earth
","The Two Towers starts off right where The Fellowship of the Ring ends, with an amazing flashback of Gandalf fighting the huge and terrifying Balrog. This scene gave me the same ""Wow"" feelings as the prologe in FOTR, and I just love it; you are literally *thrown* into the action with spectacular special effects that will make your jaw drop. Speaking of that, throughout the movie this happend several times for me. I thought I had seen it all (amazing special effects), but TTT brought even more memorable moments. Gandalf vs. Balrog, Wargs attack, Oliphaunts, Helm's Deep, The Ents etc. And let's not forget about Gollum.<br/><br/>Gollum, what can I say, looked *exactly* as I had imagined him as, and behaved *exactly* the same. Andy Serkis has created movie history with his fine performance as Gollum, which was also digitally made with CGI. Treebeard, also he a CGI creation, looked really good.<br/><br/>Acting was good, great performances from the ""new"" addition to the cast, and the cinematography was as beautiful and well-done as FOTR.<br/><br/>Now, the only problems I had, was some of the major changes made to the plot (Faramir & Osgiliath for example), and some of the editing. Sometimes it felt a little bit choppy (following three groups/stories), and sometimes it slowed down the movie, (Arwen and Elrond scenes), but I guess Peter Jackson had no choice.<br/><br/>And to compare FOTR with TTT is impossible, because there are two very different movies, both in mood and speed. However, I think TTT is a great movie and a worthy sequel to my favorite movie of all time, FOTR.<br/><br/>
TTT - 9/10 !"

","Big spoiler alert ! My opinion on tTT is a mixed one. Instead of an extended version, I would like a shorter one in next November.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing about tTT is that it can be a much better film if you cut out some scenes !<br/><br/>1. Cut out the scene where the hobbits tell the ents to go south instead of north (I think) and that's why the ents attack. Let the ents figured it out.<br/><br/><ul><li>The ents are the oldest beings in middle earth. Why should hobbits be smarter ? Why PJ thinks that the hobbits need to have more influence on the story I can not figure out. We got a hint about this when Frodo guessing the riddle in FotR. What's the point ?</li></ul><br/><br/>2. Cut out the scenes where Gimli is made fun of.<br/><br/><ul><li>This I understand. The film is made mainstream a even though I don't agree and can see why.</li></ul><br/><br/>3. Cut out the scene where Frodo shows the ring to a Nazgul.<br/><br/><ul><li>I just dont figure out how Frodo is going to get away with the ring when Sauron now knows where the ring is. I think nothing of this will be in RoTK, and then its just don't make sense.</li></ul><br/><br/>4. Cut out the scene where Legolas uses a shield as a scateboard.<br/><br/>
<ul><li>The horse-mounting scene is enough.</li></ul><br/><br/>5. Cut out the part where Gandalf dispels Sarumans spell on Theoden and just let Theoden revive when Wormtongue is removed from his side so he no longer can poison Theodens ear.<br/><br/><ul><li>The contest between Gandalf and Saruman is not made better or clearer. It is not a battle won or lost in a magic contest.</li></ul><br/><br/>The portray of Faramir is beyond saving I'm afraid. A great hero fell. Not before the wicked hand of Sauron, but to Peter Jackson. Don't do it again with RotK, I don't want another George Lucas.<br/><br/>On the other hand the portray of Gollum is fantastic. The madness, the innocence, the internal battle all is here. Fantastic. The Ents attack is wonderful. The scenery is right on again. The overall pictures works for me.<br/><br/>So on some points Peter Jackson has ruined the book and made his own film, and on the other hand he has visualized something that was said couldn't be done."
"cptcake","10","0","0","2 January 2003"," Expectations
","As the director of the ""Back to the Future"" series, Bob Zemeckis, states, concerning sequels, everybody consciously or inconsciously has a picture in mind of what it has to look like. This is even more the case, as LOTR 2 has been quite a while out there as the famous book by JRR Tolkien. However, Jackson did a great job in converting the depth of the literature to fit to a cinema screen. Astonishing pictures and brilliant music give you a feeling probably never seen on a screen before. Never before have I seen computer-animated characters as good as Gollum and impressive fortresses as those in the movie. One might say, that the dialogues of Gimli and Legolas ridicule the movie a little bit too much, but on the other hand a comic relief is at some points of the movie really needed.<br/><br/>It is not possible to show the depth of the original books on screen, but this movie comes as close as possible.<br/><br/>In fact, even though Jackson in some points differs from the book quite a bit, even more than in the first movie, LOTR 2 is most likely one of the greatest movies in history."
"yandr","5","0","0","2 January 2003"," Awful at best
","This can't get any worse. After seeing LOTR I and enjoying it immensely, I was eager to watch the sequel. Unfortunately, the movie does not live up to my expectations for hundreds of reasons.<br/><br/>1. Too many in-battle humorous(?) one-liners. The dwarf is a Rambo wannabe<br/><br/>2. Horrible acting with the exception of 2-3 characters<br/><br/>3. A Golum (forget the spelling) with clear sexual abuse problems during its childhood. Do we really care so much about the Golum?<br/><br/>4. Little annoying speeches about the ecological disasters involved. Is this a green party brochure? This is Good vs Evil. Who cares about the trees cut down?<br/><br/>5. Too many characters so the film emphasizes on none of them. The end result? The viewer does not really care what happens in the last battle. Personally, I really wanted the Uruk-hai (or whatever) warriors to completely destroy the castle. It is a typical silvester-tweety (again sorry if the spelling is not correct) situation. Why the cat can't eat the damn bird is beyond me.<br/><br/>6. Hundreds of logical holes (I have not read the book and don't plan to). Sharuman is inside the king, controlling him. So why the need for the ""advisor"" (one of the best characters portrayed)? And why don't they cut his head when they have the chance? Who would really spare his life? And what are the defenses (catapults etc) of the castle?<br/><br/>And last but not least, the editing is absolutely horrible. It's just a sequence of cut-out scenes that do not make any sence. Anyway, 3/10 for the soundtrack, make-up, graphics and scenery alone. All the rest should amount to zero. (rated 8/10+ LOTR I)"

","Firstly let me say that i loved TTT, but not quite as much as FOTR. As other people have already commented, although spectacular, it lacks the heart of the first movie - a necessary evil just because of the sheer nature of the story. i do not have any problems with the changes PJ has made to the original books, and i do not think that just because i have the read the books that makes me a better judge of the movies. all the tolkien nerds out there who cant handle any changes - grow up, there is more to life than reading LOTR 365 days a year. a movie is a movie, not a book. imagine if we had tom bombadil in the first movie, it woulda dragged on and on and we would have never gotten to rivendell. arwen's extended role(as much as it is criticised) is an effective movie device. through her we are given an insight(and a means) into seeing what is going on with the elves. romance does occur in real life(as much as tolkien geeks hate to admit it due to lack of romance in there own lives). i couldnt be bothered going on, so ill wrap up now.

"jillypoo83","10","0","0","1 January 2003"," Fell even harder
","For those so-called ""Tolkien"" fans who keep bashing this movie along with the first: get off it.  No, neither movie so far has stuck exactly to everything in the books.  Yes, a lot of stuff is exaggerated.  But true ""Lord of the Rings"" fans should realize that it is impossible to put Tolkien's world onto a screen perfectly.  True Tolkien fans should realize that Tolkien's world is something that exists differently in the minds of each reader.  These are Peter Jackson's movies; they are HIS versions of the Tolkien world.<br/><br/>
""The Two Towers"" exceeds ""Fellowship"" in various ways.  First, there's Gollum.  Gollum is absolutely wonderful in this movie.  After a bit you forget that Gollum is mostly a computer trick and you see him as a real creature.  Gollum offers many things: comic relief, foreshadowing, plot revelation, etc.  But he also brings out different aspects of Sam and Frodo's personalities.  Gollum brings out the protective nature of Sam and the loyal nature of Frodo.  Gollum being as great as he is is probably one of the key elements to this movie's success.<br/><br/>
Another improvement in this movie is the character development we see. Each character's personality is revealed much more in this film than it was in the first.  We see the determination that lies in Merry.  We see the bravery come out in Pippin.  We see the friendship that's developing between Legolas and Gimli.  We see Gimli as a die-hard, determined fighter and Legolas as a noble protector.  More of Aragorn's past and future are revealed in this movie.  All this character revelation makes ""Two Towers"" more satisfying for any view, Tolkien fan or not.<br/><br/>
And then there's the romance between Aragorn and Arwen.  Now for all those who have read the books, come on; who didn't want to know more about that?? I think that maybe Tolkien left that relationship hazy so that each reader would dream up a story to fit in.  And that's exactly what Jackson did. Before i saw ""Fellowship,"" i had only read ""The Hobbit"" and had no real desire to read ""Lord of the Rings.""  Then i saw ""Fellowship.""  I immediately ran out, re-read the Hobbit, and then finished the series.  I was not disappointed.  Pater Jackson may have disappointed many Tolkien fans, but he inspired another.<br/><br/>
I fell in love with ""Fellowship;"" I fell even harder for ""The Two Towers."""

","I saw LOTR: TTT just last week and found it an excellent movie. Better than the first as the story gets going from the first frame and doesn't bother (much) with reintroducing the story. It is just assumed that you saw the previous film and are fully familiar with it all. Maybe a bit arrogant, but then again they are absolutely right! If you haven't seen the first movie (or did and didn't like it, then shame on you!), don't bother with the 2nd one.<br/><br/>The good thing about all this is that the movie gets right to the point and doesn't waste any second. It just plunges the audience right back in the experience they had in the first movie and even tops it. I am (unfortunately) used to people chatting etc during the movie, because the movie is taking to long, is boring, etc. Well, that did NOT happen this time. The theatre was completely packed and right up to the last minute everybody was totally caught up in it. And that is saying something for a movie that is running up to 3 hours.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to what it is all about: the movie. The story of the original book is followed rather closely. Yes, as several people have already commented, there are several differences as compared to the book, but in all the thread of the book is left intact. The story doesn't lose any pace and keeps you glued to the screen right up to the end. Key scenes are well thought of (Gollum's inner struggle as a key part in the book (in my opinion) is very well translated to the screen) and explain as well as keep the audience interested'.<br/><br/>But.... One of the best performances of the movie, at least for me, was given by Gollum. His inner struggle between doing ""the right thing"" and following his desire for the ring are very well portrayed (as already mentioned above). And yet..... Frodo is going to a similar struggle and doesn't pull it off as convincingly as does Gollum. So, is a CGI-character beating a human in acting ? Gollum, for me, gives a much more convincing picture of the struggle within, than does Frodo, who just rolls his eyes and looks completely out of is. Is computer science already so far that it can beat a human performance or is it just happenstance ?"
"NarnianDan","Null","0","0","1 January 2003"," True to the author's intent
","I'm a professor of literature, and I can tell you that Tolkien would have complained about several things in the movie, but J.R.R. Tolkien tended to complain about a good many things.  However, the movie, ""The Two Towers"" stays true to the original intent of the author.<br/><br/>Tolkien's intent in his trilogy was to create a new mythology for England. One of the defining aspects of mythology is that the stories are retold endlessly.  Peter Jackson's retelling of the ""Lord of the Rings"" mythology will have differences from the original telling, but that is to be expected.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are many D&D-playing, Star-Trek-watching, parents-basement-living, computer-wielding individuals who will bemoan the loss of story-line aspects and lament that Shelob will be in the 3rd movie rather than the 2nd.  Indeed, Peter Jackson does take many liberties with the story-line of the original books.  But he does stay true, for the most part, to the foundational personalities and motives of the characters.  He also maintains the integrity of Tolkien's main thematic elements.<br/><br/>If you don't like the retelling of your favorite stories, don't go see the movies, reread the books instead.  If your interested in seeing someone else's interpretation of Tolkien's mythology, you should enjoy ""The Two Towers""."

This was possibly the most dissapointing movie i have ever seen. i understand that changes have to be made to suit film audiences who havent read the book and to squeeze the film into a reasonable time, however huge parts of this film were a total perversion of tolkien's work and seem to be part of Jackson's ego trip does he really think he can improve on an all time classic. i can deal with Shelob not being in the film ( as she will be in Return of the King) and i can just about handle Aragorns unnecessary ""near death"" experience and the stupid bits of comic relief which lower the tone of the film (its supposed to be dark and full of dread). However i cannot candle the total destruction of Faramir's character simply to make Aragorn look more noble, the stupid dwarf tossing scene. the changing of lines to make frodo braver than Sam etc. The elf joining the men to fight at helm's deep shows that Jackson is missing the point of the story. but the thing that annoys me the most is the totally Jackson created inclusion of Arwen's character in this film. yes I'm sure male cinema goers like the chance to eye up hot elf totty but this romance which barely features distracts valuable screen time from incidents that tolkien DID write and quite frankly p*sses me off (sorry) That said I think the acting was great and the special effects and scenery were breathtaking i just wish Jackson would stick to what he does best directing, not rewriting classic literature.

","As someone read the book, I found the film version pretty disappointing. The film maker made a number of deviations from the book, and it is not obvious why. Does Peter Jackson think he is a better story teller than Tolkein? I don't think so. He made plot changes, like having Theoden actually possessed by Saruman (!) and having Frodo actually offer the ring to the Ringwraith (!). Why? He also developed characters differently, which was sort of annoying. All of a sudden, Treebeard was a menacing zombie, Faramir was mean-spirited, and Gimli was comical. Again, why? I thought Jackson did a much better job with the ""Fellowship of the Ring."" Here he took way too much license. And he puts so much focus into the battle scenes that that the actually story gets kind of lost. Thumbs down!"

So, I used that as an excuse to pick up the books and spent Christmas week re-reading, for the fifth time, the trilogy yet again.

","I am from Brazil, and should say that Tolkien has become incredibly popular over here with the LOTR movies. I have read the books, am currently reading Silmarillion. The first movie, Fellowship of the Ring, simply blew me away. I had to watch it five times before I could believe it. And this movie (the Two Towers) has done it again.<br/><br/>It owns by far the BEST epic battle sequences my eyes have witnessed. Forget about Braveheart, 13th warrior, Gladiator or any other movie. This is prime. And this alone should captivate the audience. Oh, but there is more. There is so much more.<br/><br/>This movie should also amaze the audience with the creature named Gollum. Despite being CG, Gollum will give you shivers and it will be hard (very hard) to believe that Smeagol is not real. Once again, forget about Jar Jar Binks, Dobby or any other CG character. This impersonation made by Andy Serkis is so perfect it will bring tears to your eyes.<br/><br/>The complaints on this one are about the changes in the story (faramir being tempted by the ring, elves in Helms Deep and so on). To be honest, I did not think that those changes compromised the main plot. They were necessary as Peter Jackson (who dedicated many years of his life to this project) saw them. And who are we Tolkien Geeks to complain? The movie is absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot to mention Treebeard, Gimli, The Warg Battle (absolutely thrilling), King Theoden (an excellent performance by Bernard Hill) and, of course, the best opening sequence (dueling with Apocalipse Now) that I've known: Gandalf vs. The Balrog of Morgoth."

To have the scene of where Gandalf the Grey falls in Kazad Dum and the words he says to the Balrog gets louder and louder while we are looking at the mountains, and then becomes the loudest when we are in Kazad Dum. Then we actually see Gandalf fall, and bam! We are with Frodo and he has had a dream about how Gandalf fell. That was done beautifully.<br/><br/>Regarding the two hobbits, I think it was done effectively how we see that they cannot go to Mordor without Gollum. The scenes we Gollum were excellent! I loved it how we would see the two sides of Gollum, and how we would converse with his two selves. The defeat of 'bad Gollum' and the return of 'bad Gollum' in the movie was excellent.<br/><br/>Back to the three companions, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and them running after the Orcs who have taken Pippin and Merry. Gimli stole the show most of the time. I adored him so much, more than part one in this movie. I loved how the men of Rohan stop them and Eomer says to Gimli what is you name and he says tell me yours first, then Eomer goes I will have you killed or something along those lines, and our favourite elf goes `you will die before you axe falls', I was cheering.  I loved that part in the book and I am so glad it was in the movie.<br/><br/>The actor Karl Urban, who played Eomer nailed his character. I kept on thinking to myself when he had left the Kingdom of Rohan, we will see him, we will see him, but we only see him at the end with Gandalf. And that part I was going to jump and scream `YAHOO!' He gave his character so much life, integrity, strength and charm that I like the character of Eomer even more than I did before. I was a bit disappointed not to have seen more of Eomer, but I guess in number three we will see more of him. The woman who plays lady Ewoyn was good, and I liked her.<br/><br/>Okay king Theoden, he was good, but not the way I imagined. The way he came back to life after Gandalf drove Saruman out of him, and then we see Saruman fall back was good.<br/><br/>Now for the best part, the battle for helms deep. I was gripping my hands to my seats, then I'd be covering my mouth in terror and then I would be clapping when they'd have a minor victory. I loved how Legolas used the shield armour and did that surf boarding movement and shoot with his arrow at the orcs. I could not help it, I went `yeah!' and then I clapped, the whole cinema soon followed my lead. Gimli was so great in the battle of helms deep. He was the comic relief, also a tough warrior. Every scene that our dwarf was in, made the scene that much better.<br/><br/>Did anyone think there was a bit too much Aragorn in this film? Why so much kissing with him and Arwen?<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is one of the best actors of our time. He is Lord Elrond. I really loved the scene with Galadrial and how she is talking to Elrond and she is telling him of the battle that men are facing, and how the Elves are leaving and we hear her speak while the men are getting ready for war. The parts of when galadrial, sam would be talking to another character and the scenes would be on where the different people were, was good in the sense that it kept on reassuring the audience that all, no mater where they were and who they were with were going through the same thing and kept the story moving along.<br/><br/>When the Elves go to fight alongside the men [I was soooooo happy, I was clapping again] got me all excited, I was like this is it, this is what the movie has been building for. Again I will say the battle of helms deep was done to perfection. It was like I was there and I was going to fight, I felt the terror and the excitement all at once. I was upset when Halder died. I was shocked and heartbroken.<br/><br/>The ents! I really liked them. Merry and Pippin again fulfilled their roles beautiful. The ents scenes were a treat to watch. The battle of Isengard was great with the ents. Faramir was more sinister in this film, but very courage's at the end. I can't wait to see the scenes with Faramir and his father, because as we now know he has forfeited his life to let the hobbits go.<br/><br/>Now know that all who have read the books say that the ending was cut out, with Sheolob, Pippin finding the ball, Gandalf knocking on the door and so on. Yet remember folks that out of all three books, the third one is the shortest and the end parts are made of appendices entirely. I thought the ending with Gollum leaving everyone in suspicion of this 'she' that he is taking them too was good.<br/><br/>I stayed up last night thinking, I loved the two towers, so why is there some people who did not, and came up with these theories of why people may have been disappointed in this film, and preferred number one more.<br/><br/>1. The fellowship broke. I know you would all think, duh that's what happened in number one, but I think people did not understand what it would do in number two. They were all in different areas, meeting different characters battling different things. So the audience had to concentrate on the different scenes and what people were doing. 2. The movie suffers from being the middle of the trilogy. My sister said that she needed closure. People may be sitting there going, we started with frodo going to mordor, and he is still going to mordor. 3. New characters to take in 4. it was less emotional than number."

","Though the action is thrilling and practically non-stop, Jackson still manages evoke the rich complexity of Tolkien's Middle Earth. I found the added touches of humor a welcome balance against the bleak and dark aspects of the story. While purists may balk at some of the changes made from the text, overall, The Two Towers captures the spirit of the book very well."

","Wow! the expectations I had on this movie was huge. Did it deliver ohh yes... The movie is darker cooler funnier and more action packed then Fotr. but maybe not really as good as a movie. The last one I thought was complete without a single flaw except maybe to little action. TTT has a 15 min slow part with Arwen and Aragorn that is pretty boring and It feels a little that that fellowship didn´t get anywhere in the story. I also felt that it could have been longer that some scenes and explanation to things were way to short. But all this is small problems compared to the experience you get from the movie. The special effects and acting and the music and scenery everything is top notch and you can really feel the love Peter jackson has for the material. The battle at helms deep is unlike anything you have ever seen before just so stong and impressive. the part where Legolas glides down the stairs in a shield and at the same time shooting arrows is one of the best and coolest moments in movie history. George Lucas should learn a bit about film making from peter. Gollum so good is he that a can`t describe it with words. TTT is not a perfect movie with the most intellectual story and there are a lot of better movies out there but it so exciting well written well made and entertaining that I almost could cry. Especially the trio of Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn has everything. Fellowship,humor, action and I love the way they speak this epic language which just sounds so cool and evolving. Go and see this movie and the first one. When the third comes out you should see all three in a row cause this is basicly one big adventure divided into three it is meant as on 10 hour movie. I cannot wait until the extended cut of TTT because then I´think this movie won´t have a singel flaw and be a 10. See the movie and feel the love for Peter Jacksons masterpiece 9.5/10"
"Sandy-99","9","0","0","1 January 2003"," Take time to ponder
","By this time last year, I had seen FOTR twice and contributed to several message board discussions. I rated it 10/10 and was of the firm opinion that it was the best movie that I had seen for a long time. I had no complaints about the differences between the screenplay and the book; the changes were appropriate, given the book's length, detail and differences of emphasis.<br/><br/>Inevitably, the passage of time and further viewings at the cinema, on video and the extended DVD prompted further thoughts. Whilst Peter Jackson's film is exceptionally good, it is not flawless. The most significant is Elijah Wood's Frodo who is too passive and insufficiently worldly-wise. The frequent shots of his doe-eyed gaze into Middle-Distance suggest someone who is transfixed by and unreactive to, all that happens to him. Still, The Two Towers would surely see his gradual change to a more ""human"" hobbit, as the ring increases its influence.<br/><br/>I have so far seen The Two Towers only once. My first impression is that, whilst Peter Jackson has created a worthy sequel, its impact has been diminished simply because it was preceded by FOTR - the visual style, effects, characterisation, pace are now rather too familiar. This does not make TTT a bad film. Peter Jackson knew that this would be a problem and appears to have spent the last year fiddling to counteract it. The promise was that since all three films were ""made"" at the same time, there would be a consistency that other similar projects lacked. This was of course not entirely true, and with so much post-production taking place after the release of FOTR, it is difficult to imagine that the director's work on TT was completely unaffected by the reception of its predecessor. Without the same impact, (or the hype!) the film can instead be considered on its merits. For example, has the aforementioned weak characterisation of Frodo been improved? At first viewing, only marginally so, but his anger at Sam in the ruins of Osgiliath promises further developments in the final film. If I were Peter Jackson, it is this that I would spend the next year fiddling with, and not the visual effects. Of course, if I was a ""Tolkien Virgin"", I might have had a profoundly different view. My niece, who has not read the book and has seen FOTR only once, laughed aloud every time Gollum appeared. Her reaction, that he was a figure of fun, was completely at odds with mine, that he is a figure of pathos...but was I right to be irritated at her response?<br/><br/>I would love to have been able to set aside my own familiarity with the books and previous dramatised versions and have come to these films afresh. Given that this is not possible, the best I can do is to take time to ponder; to see it again and not to leap to hasty conclusions as some other users seem to have done. I was certainly absorbed for three hours, and there was much to enjoy, as well as much to question, as others have done. For that reason, it will probably be a film that I will want to see not just once more, but many times more. I have no all-time favourite movie, although ""Oh Mr Porter!"", a bargain I picked up on video this Christmas and which I have loved ever since I saw it as an eight-year old, offers endless charming amusement. Could The Two Towers occupy a similar place in my affections in another 40 years?<br/><br/>Take time to ponder..."
"Cooce","10","0","0","31 December 2002"," THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!
","I've seen SO many movies this year, none can compare to this one! The action & suspense kept me wanting to watch more & more! Although it was rather long, i wouldn't have wanted it to be any shorter. It was the perfect length of time. They sequenced it so well, it couldn't be any better. Although my legs went numb near the ending, i wouldn't have stayed for any other movie but i did for this one. The story is so fascinating, you want to know everything, but the great thing about the LOTR, it keeps you interested for the next movie to come out! The best thing about the LOTR is that you get a good feel for the character. Such as when something wrong happens, you feel sad for the character, this is what makes the movie so great! You feel the character's emotions. The jumping back & forth between Frodo & Aragron made it very easy to follow. You understood it once they got to the big fight scene. In the beginning, it was hard to understand how Frodo & Sam fitted in, like what they were trying to do. But the creature that kept saying precious made them all tie together. These are my opinions on the LOTR, the best movie of the year!"
"rob_w_clark","10","0","0","1 January 2003"," A great film-remember it is an adaptation though
","As you have probably already heard, Two Towers is a big hit and has been reviewed well by almost all who have seen it.<br/><br/>Yet there seems to be this group of people who rubbish it simply because it varies from the book. I agree a few changes were largely unnecissary but the most only add to the story. This is a film, not a book and must appeal to not only those who read the books but who haven't and I think it does admirably.<br/><br/>The film is three hours long and holds you for all of that time, even seeing it a second or third time. It is a vision splendid and will certinly go down as one of the most visually magnificent films ever made. New Zealand is simply stunning, every new scene brings another massive and beautiful vista. Edoras must be mentioned as possibly one of the most beautiful locations every filmed, a hill in between two massive mountain ranges. And the end, oh the end. I have simply never seen anything like it. You must repeat must see this on a huge screen. The thousands of troops marching and fighting on mass is amazing and breathtaking. I originally thought a large CG army would look fake but it doesn't. It looks truly real. The final ent battle is a treat and it is quite an achievement to make the ents creatures you don't laugh at at first sight. They do look ridiculous but not much can be done with tlaking, walking trees. Peter Jackson has pulled of a feat of amazing daring to create truly gritty, real fighting and has to be congratulated. If he doesn't get a best director oscar for at least one of the LOTR films the academy will be truly out of touch.<br/><br/>I will not say whether it is better or worse than last year's, it is merely a continuation of one gigantic 9-10 hr epic that will surely be one of the best in cinema's history. Be glad that Jackson had the daring to change some of the story-it creates some originality compared to Harry Potter which simply copies the books, no wonder people don't see it a second time. It is simply boring (and in this case impossible) to copy the book completely. Bring on Christmas 2003 and PJ get ready to shine some oscars as at the end of next year the academy will simply have NO choice but to lavish them upon you because of the MASSIVE public and critical support for your work. I have absolutely no doubt that ""Return of the King"" will be the best of the trilogy and will be one of the best films ever made. Can't wait!"

","Firstly,let me say the Two Towers is visually Stunning with Gollum and Helms Deep as the two standout features in an otherwise ambiguous and convoluted interpretation of the book. By this I mean Peter Jackson has misinterpreted the book in his own image and likeness.<br/><br/>Secondly, The Two Towers concern Orthanc and Minas Morgul, that guards the secret entrance to Mordor (not Bara-dur )......please see last page of The Fellowship of the Ring (Hardback Ed. illustrated by Alan Lee. Pub. by Harper Collins )<br/><br/>In the book Eowyn is left behind as shield maiden to look after her people after Theodens departure at Meduseld (Edoras ).She certainly does NOT leave with the King for Helms Deep. This makes nonsence when in the third book Aragorn see's her before riding to Dunharrow and The Paths of the Dead refusing her to join his company.<br/><br/>Frodo does Not go to Osgiliath but is left with Sam and Gollum in the forest by Faramir to journey to the cross-roads and the Stairs of Cirith Ungol.<br/><br/>At No point does the Nazgul try to take the Ring from Frodo.......Pure Fabrication.<br/><br/>The Ents DO decide to help Merry and Pippin to go to War against Saruman with the help of the Huorns. Where are the Huorns at Helms Deep that help to annilhate the fleeing Orcs????<br/><br/>Where is the confrontation with Gandalf and Saruman, the breaking of his Staff and the Palantir being thrown by Wormtongue at the Company.Where is the ride to Minas Tirith with Gandalf and Pippin after he has looked into the Palantir?<br/><br/>Finally and most important where is Shelob? why does the film not finish, as the book, with this superb cliff-hanger?<br/><br/>There are far too many annomalies in this convoluted interpretation of the Two Towers........especially from some one purportavely to have read the books in such detail.

","I read many comments from so many people, and I realized that people are not happy with the changes that Peter Jackson put it in the adaptation.<br/><br/>The ones that actually read the ""The Two Towers"" could realize that between the three volumes, the second one would be the most difficult to put in a regular time-line story. They are forgetting that one of the most important tools in the book is the narrator, which is not used in the film. It is necessary learn to respect the differences between the movie and the book, otherwise, ""The Fellowship"" would be a completely failure as an adapted film, because they put too much from the second book in the first movie. In my opinion, the ones who loved the first film are going to love the second one, and the ones who hated ""The Fellowship of The Ring"" are going to hate ""The Two Towers"". The only real danger is the expectation for the third movie, because the ones who read ""The Return of The King"" are expecting a lot of perfection, and Peter Jackson cannot miss on that one.<br/><br/>I liked this film because I simply LOVE the book. Peter Jackson is doing an extraordinary work. He knew the It would be risky to do it, and everybody knows, or should know, that it wouldn't be perfect. I think that the curriculum of all the ones involved in the ""Lord of The Rings"" project will be divided in before-L.R. and after-L.R."
"Tryystan","Null","0","0","31 December 2002"," Exceptional movie, with some questionable changes to the text
","I found it to be an extremely well made movie - one which requires, by reason of the sheer breadth of the material, that it be seen more than once. Same with the books, they require more than one reading.<br/><br/>I was surprised by some of the changes Mr. Jackson made to the text. Specifically, Faramir's character in the movie was unlike that in the book; also, leaving out Shelob and the ending of the Twin Towers - perhaps there was a cinematic device to explain the changes, but if so they escaped me.<br/><br/>That being said, Gollum's character was extraordinarily well rendered.<br/><br/>I do not wish to indicate that the movie was not extremely good. It suffers from having as its source a text which is zealously read around the world. The fact of the matter is, there must always be some changes in the transference from script to screen.<br/><br/>Mr. Jackson's movie(s) are truly amazing cinematic masterpieces."

","Usually I am a little scared to see a movie that I am actually very eager to see. I don't want to be disappointed, even slightly. Admittedly I was nervous about The Two Towers. It is my favorite book of the famed Tolkien trilogy. Gladly though I can say without hesitation that this was 3 hours of my life, and $20 of my meager monthly entertainment allotment well spent. As a matter of fact I plan on seeing it again and again. The performances by Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and John Rhys-Davies were all incredible. I really like how Peter Jackson has let those actors play off of each other. The realization of Gollum on the screen was well thought out, and portrayed. We also get to see a glimpse of how dreadful a thing the ring actually is, and what it's doing to Frodo. Tolkien's tale is being depicted wonderfully. I have been a fan of his work for over twenty years, and although some artistic liberties have been taken by Jackson and crew I feel they are warranted, and everyone sees the tales differently. To the harsh critics who are so called ""Tolkien fans"" I say ""Who are you to judge? Maybe ol' JRR is smiling down on us right now."" till then... just wait an' see... the movie lovers movie critic"

","I can't believe that I actually stayed up until midnight to see the sneak preview of this movie. It was so long and drawn out that by the time the big battle actually happened I wanted the movie to be over already. First, I would like to say that I enjoyed the first one and that I was eager to see this one. However, I was extremely disappointed. Like the relationship between Aragon and the elf chick. They made it out to be some huge deal in the second one when there wasn't much to it in the original. I'm talking about the films here so keep what you read in the books to yourself. None of the characters fit the way they were in the original, except for the elf. Aragon seemed rather lifeless. This is especially noticed in the scene where he says,"" Open war is upon you whether you would risk it or not."" He says it so monotone that you'd think he was reading it right off the script. Frodo was insane for the entire movie. Yes, you can argue that the ring was making him that way, but at least a little of his happy old self should have still been there. The dwarf came off as a total retard in this film and was there mostly for comic relief, whereas in the original he seemed more of a serious character. The battles were much more unrealistic in this film also. 300 men + some elves are fighting 10,000 orks. Obviously the orks are winning. So the orks break through the front gate of this fortress and Aragon and the dwarf are sent out to hold them back while they blockade the front gate. Those two people manage to hold off all those orks when 300+ people can't? I find that a little hard to believe. During the whole movie they're talking about this big battle that is going to happen. Two hours later, it finally happens. This is about the time when I was falling asleep from boredom. But I decided I'd stay awake for the battle. It definately wasn't worth it. The humans lose and lose and lose as you'd expect, but then Gandolf rides up over the mountain and the battle is won. It's just pathetic and unrealistic. This movie was endlessly boring, badly acted/interpreted, and completely untrue to the original. However, I did like the elf. His part was well done and he was the only one who maintained his role properly. I also liked the part when the trees went to war. That was rather amusing.<br/><br/>
So, I recommend that you don't see this movie and just read the book instead (it's much better), and if you absolutely must see it, wait until it comes out on video as it's not worth the money to see it in the theater."

Peter Jackson cuts no corners, and the casting and add-in scenes and lines that differ slightly from the book are phenomenal. The best transition from movie to book I have ever seen. Special FX with Gollum and Treebeard are TOP NOTCH. Very true to the book in every aspect. Only part of the movie I found odd was Eowen throwing herself at Aragorn.

But the truth is it's missing some things. There are several parts where it is boring and other parts where it is vulgar (those philosophical dialogues between Sam and Frodo are bad).<br/><br/>I'm very generous with my ratings, so this still gets 8/10.

Spiderman was a great movie this past summer.  But few are so epic and big that they're grand.  This is a movie that will forever be remembered in cinema history because it contains all of the elements that make a movie stand the test of time.  Lots of movies are forgotten or merely overlooked after a few years pass, but then there are those that you always remember because of the wonderful feeling they bring you when watching them.  You know your watching one of the greats when your completely taken out of your own life, you feel like your IN the movie.  When all your troubles are not on your mind for at least a few hours.  You know it's one of the best movies you've ever seen when everything on screen looks like it is real.  Even the CGI in this movie is merged so well with real shots that you don't really think ""hey that's fake!""  That's quite an accomplishment in today's movies.<br/><br/>Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is.. like a lot of films.. a little more interesting than it's original movie, since the plot of the film has basically already been sat in motion and we can jump right into the story and all the action.  But because the three films are really one story and not three seperate stories, like the books themselves, you can't really rate one movie over the other.  Just see it as one big story....

"Shin Kyo","7","0","0","31 December 2002"," Very overrated, but still likable - some spoilers
","The first Lord of the Rings movie was great, remarkable, innovative and as close as possible to the book. It is a shame that those are the qualities we don´t find in The Two Towers.<br/><br/>First of all, it would have been nice to have some kind of introductory sequence to remind what happened in the first movie. Many people don´t remember, or haven´t even seen it. The only thing we get is a - incredible - scene with Gandalf and the Balrog that was a good touch, since it is a very obscure part of the book. Too bad this was the only modification to the original story that actually helps the sequence of the plot.<br/><br/>In fact, this was the most hated aspect of the movie: its lack of fidelity to Tolkien´s work. Some say that Peter Jackson did this in order to make the history a little easier to understand, and that it is impossible to compile this epic in ""only"" 3 hours. Well, if you think you need more time, why including unnecessary scenes, like extending the importance of Faramir in the movie? Or that scene where the hobbits have to convince Treebeard to turn back, only to see the destruction of his own forest? I usually don´t mind when changes are made to help the plot, but this is not the case.<br/><br/>Also, some parts should have been better planned, to cause the desired effect on audience. More than once, i heard laughs in a serious scene, like when Legolas throws a shield on some stairs, get on top of it and goes out shooting. It might appear to be just a detail, but perfection is achieved with attention to every little scene.<br/><br/>On to the good side. The special effects were wonderfully made. A perfect example for this is Gollum, with expressions and movements that could hardly get better. Most actors were ok, although not anything special can be said on this area. The plot, even modified by some unknown reason, is still a great classic and will be enjoyable by anyone who have not read the books.<br/><br/>
My advice is: watch it, have fun, but don´t expect this to be the best movie ever, as reading some reviews may suggest. I can only hope Peter Jackson learns from the things he have done right on the first and wrong on the second to make the last movie of this trilogy a classic to be remembered."
"heidi-39","Null","0","0","31 December 2002"," An Epic, no doubt
","Normally I don't review movies in great detail, but felt this time that I needed to add my thoughts - even if they probably are worth no more than two cents.<br/><br/>After recently viewing TTT for the second time, I have to say that I enjoyed the movie so much more the second time.  The first time, the spectator is simply bombarded with images (not to mention, when I saw it opening night, the theater cued the lights and cut the sound in the middle of the Helm's Deep battle which seriously ticked me off).  However, the second time, you can settle in and look for other things you may have missed the second time (for example, who noted that as Wormtongue was looking out at Sarumon's army of 10,000 that were about to be unleashed onto Rohan, a single tear slipped down his face?)  That, to me, spoke volumes.  So, if you liked it the first time, or even if you didn't, but feel you can afford to spend more time in the theater, go see it again.  Look for things you didn't notice before and prepared to be amazed and awed.<br/><br/>For Tolkien purists, let me just say that I've read the books.  No, not many times, but I have read them and recommended them to others.  So what if not everything that happens in the book, happens in the movie?  So what if things are added or changed?  No where in the opening credits did it state ""J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" (or, for that matter, ""Peter Jackson's LOTR: TTT."")  In the credits it states: ""BASED ON.""  Get over it!  It's a movie.  If you're going to fight about something, try fighting for world peace instead.  There's more important things going on!<br/><br/>Of course, I state that, but am in the middle of writing this, so what do I know?<br/><br/>Jackson has admitted, in interviews, that he took the most liberty with the storyline and adaptation of TTT more than the other two movies.  (If you need to understand what ""adaptation"" means, go find a dictionary, but it certainly doesn't mean literal, word-for-word storytelling).   Fine.  He directed the movie and New Line Cinema owns the rights and since they were writing his paycheck that means he can do with the story what he wants. Be thrilled that he didn't completely butcher the books along the way (although, I'm sure, in your opinion, that he did exactly that).  He told a story - an entertaining and timeless one.  Just enjoy it.<br/><br/>I plan on seeing this movie again - and will forgive the moments in the movie that I feel were unneeded, and be awed again by the scenes I downright enjoyed.  Also, what do people have against ""Gollum's Song?""  If you listen to the words, it fits.  (the use of ""us"" and ""we"" throughout the lyrics). Not to mention, the use of minor and major chords throughout [much like Gollum, himself.  Is he good (major) or bad(minor).]  And, the song ends on an unresolved chord - leaves you wanting more, much like the ending of the movie...just a few thoughts.  I, for one, am looking forward to what Peter Jackson, Howard Shore, et. al., will give us in RotK.  Until December '03."

Helm's deep alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>
Subsequent viewings lets you fully understand everything that has occured in this middle segment of the ""Lord of the Rings"". there are three sub strories to these movies, but the first time you see it, it seems that the only thing you remember is the Aragorn/Gimli/Legolas part of the movie. the other parts are cut and spread out so much, that they do not really flow. after seeing this movie four times, i have to say that the most enjoyable part of the movie watching Gollum on screen. he absolutely is the most interesting character in a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>this movie is long and covers a lot of material and needs to be seen more that once to be truly appreciated. although helm's deep is incredible, the greatest part of the movie is watching the Frodo/Sam/Gollum sequences, because they are deep, and help you understand the true power of the ring. you see how different people react to it."

The visuals are, for the most part, stunning.  There are a few moments when the use of animation/models is obvious, which is a little disappointing, but overall, it's a feast for the eyes.  Gollum is a spectacular piece of animation. The story moves along at a healthy pace, but is a little dull and uninvolving - Gollum being the only character that evokes any kind of emotional connection with the audience.  The battle scenes are dramatic and exciting, but the comedy element is unnecessary.  I also found the sight of Gandalf, appearing on the horizon like the Lone Ranger, at the moment of crisis, embarrassingly corny. For anyone wanting an evening of swords and sorcery, this is a reasonable film, but if you're looking for depth of character and to be swept away into another world for a couple of hours, look elsewhere."

"lertch1001","10","0","0","30 December 2002"," Great fantasy/adventure movie, small missteps
","*Spoilers after first paragraph*  (Although how much you could spoil a fifty year old book I am not sure)<br/><br/>I saw Fellowship last year and was absolutely blown away.  I hadn't read Tolkien since Jr. High, but it captured everything I liked about the books and even highlighted and expanded some of the central themes.  For me, Fellowship of the Ring was one of the best movies ever made--I saw Beautiful Mind once and thought it was nice, but I have watched Fellowship over and over and I am still moved by it. Like many of you, I reread the Lord of the Rings and eagerly looked forward to The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Reading the books may have been a mistake in terms of enjoying the movie. When the book is fresh on your mind, everything that is different from the novel jars you and inhibits your ability to relax and take in the film. For example, I was anticipating the climactic battle with Shelob and I started getting anxious as I realized the film was going in a completely different direction.  My main questions/gripes: 1) Tolkien's relationship with nature is one of the hallmarks of his work and I felt that Jackson unnecessarily minimized the Ents by making them appear foolishly out of touch with nature. What was gained by having Merry trick Treebeard instead of having Treebeard come to his own conclusions based on his supernatural relationship with Fanghorn forest and the damaged being caused it by Sauruman.  2)Frodo wandering up to the Ringwraith and holding up the ring made no sense--why did the Wraith just fly around aimlessly once it had seen the Ring?  Was it scared of the way Sam knocked Frodo down the stairs and it feared it would suffer the same fate?  Frodo and Sam had time for a nice conversation, but the Wraith was somehow unable to just fly down and pick them up. 3)Farimir quickly deciding to free both of them and their potential weapon with little obvious reason for doing so.  I can't see how any of these changes helped the movie--please e-mail me if you have insights.<br/><br/>However, these gripes all stem from a jarring of expectations set up by the book.  Otherwise, I thought the character of Aragorn in particular was nicely portrayed, and the battle scenes were superb. Gollum surpassed expectations.  This movie also caught the same Shakespearian themes introduced in the first one--we all suffer from greed, lust for power, and jealousy, but the most common person can stand up to the greatest human foibles.<br/><br/>I will be looking forward to next December for the scene with Shelob--and I hope Jackson slows down the pace a bit for more reflective scenes that made Fellowship such a great movie.  Fellowship rated a perfect 10--the Two Towers gets an 8.5 or 9."

","Without doubt, Peter Jackson has once again done justice to Tolkien's staggering literary achievement. This film, though much, much darker in tone than Fellowship, delivers the depth and breadth of the novel in dramatic and engrossing fashion.<br/><br/>Although several portions of the book have been either omitted or amended for the silver screen, the story does not suffer in any way. Fans of the book may be disappointed that the Ents received short shrift, but when viewed through the average cinema goers eyes (i.e. one that has not had the benefit of reading the book)even the most ardent LOTR fan must agree that the changes made sense. Several characters enjoy more screen time, notably Gimli, who provides comic relief at times when the on screen drama demands it. My highlight was the image of the Ents descending on Isengard. CGI has never seemed more appealing.<br/><br/>I for one will be counting down the days to ""The Return of The king"". I will also be keeping my fingers crossed that certain elements of that particular book make the final cut."

Saw the first film a few months ago in my late thirties and found it surprisingly entertaining. Waited eagerly for the this latest instalment and walked away disappointed.<br/><br/>Why? Well, look again at the first film. It has magic, it has wit, it has charm, it has wonder. Simply put, from the charm and wit of the Shire and Bilbo Baggins, to the magic of the Elves and the wonder of those great statues (erect and fallen) as we enter Gondor, the film places us very firmly in Middle Earth.<br/><br/>In this new film, wit seems to consist of poor ""jokes"" regarding Gimli's lack of height and Legolas speeding down a concrete staircase on a skateboard. Is this funny? The charm and sense of wonder has completely gone, and the magic that could (and should) have been created in the dark and mysterious forest of Fangorn has been replaced instead by a very amateurish rendering of the Ents. More than 10 years ago Steven Spielberg brought dinosaurs convincingly to life, so what on earth has happened here with Treebeard and co.?<br/><br/>Most sadly of all, I didn't once feel like I was in Middle Earth. To me, those panoramic background shots seemed all too often to be more the work of The New Zealand Tourist Authority than anything which Tolkien had conceived.<br/><br/>Gollum, of course, WAS good, but isn't a little tragic when a movie's best and most three dimensional character is the result of a computer?<br/><br/>I still look forward to the next episode, but whatever happens I know now that I can always console myself with one simple truth. While Jackson and Hollywood may destroy the movie, no one will ever be able to destroy the book(s).<br/><br/>May generations of youngsters to come continue to read these works and find in them the feelings of magic and wonder which I too did all those years ago!"

"BenChen","9","0","0","31 December 2002"," Can die-hard Tolkien fans forgive Jackson his flights of fancy?
","SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>First let me say that with `Fellowship Of The Ring' Peter Jackson did what many people thought would be impossible: he made a movie that satisfied both die-hard Tolkien fans as well as the general movie-going public.  Writing as one of those die-hard Tolkien fans, I forgave him the many omissions and occasional departures from the book: some annoying telescoping of events in the departure from the Shire, the total absence of Glorfindel, Arwen's incantation at the Ford (do I need to say that, in the book, Elrond is responsible for the wall of water and that Gandalf is responsible for the appearance of the water horses?), and Galadriel's `evil' moment to name but a few.  (This list could have been longer, but the extended DVD has righted many wrongs.)<br/><br/>However, with `Two Towers', the omissions and departures took us too far from the original, something that Jackson was aware of when he said that this movie was the one most different to the books.  I can forgive Jackson for pumping up the sexual tension wholly absent in Tolkien's rather staid love triangle.  I can't forgive him for doing it at the expense of playing fast and loose with Arwen's immortality and Elrond's affability. Aragorn's trip over the cliff and subsequent `resurrection' was totally unnecessary - and too much like Gandalf's Moria dive - especially since we hadn't yet seen Aragorn's dramatic door-opening scene from the trailer.  Merry and Pippin spent way too much of the film perched on Treebeard's shoulders - Treebeard has a house, remember, and the ent draught the hobbits drink there becomes somewhat important by the time of the Scouring of the Shire.  Also, Treebeard should have known what was going on in his forest, rather than being `surprised' into battle by a rare clever moment on Pippin's part (and the other ents came out of the forest remarkably quickly, didn't they?) Faramir turned out to be too much like his brother.  In fact, the whole capture of Frodo and Sam and their being taken to Osgiliath was too drawn out (unnecessary padding in a three hour movie?)  I also felt he gave away too much of the winged Nazgul; in Tolkien's book, they are a distant dread not directly encountered until the battle of Gondor.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I feel that the general movie-going public will probably enjoy Jackson's version of `Two Towers' even more than `Fellowship Of The Ring' which was perceived as a bit slow.  I, too, was stunned by the brilliantly conceived opening of `Two Towers'.  And there were many moments of further brilliance throughout: the tension-building editing during the Great Chase (although I would have liked to have seen Merry and Pippin's reaction to seeing Gandalf - on the extended DVD perhaps?); the opening of the Black Gate; Legolas mounting Gimli's horse mid-charge; the whole of the Helm's Deep battle scene, especially Theoden's last charge and Jackson's own spear-hurling cameo (although I would have liked to have seen more of Legolas' and Gimli's competition - on the extended DVD?); the oliphaunts; and the highlight of the entire movie: the ents destruction of Isengard. All in all, that is enough for me to give the movie a 9 out of 10 rating despite all my previous negativity.  Furthermore, `Return of the King' will be a better movie than it might have been, given what remains of Tolkien's second book left for the next movie.  So in the end, with a 10 out of 10 `Fellowship Of The Ring' and (I'll go out on a limb here) a 10 out of 10 `Return of the King', I'm sure die-hard fans will well and truly forgive Peter Jackson his flights of fancy in `Two Towers'."

","Much as I anticipated the release of the Two Towers, i was very much disappointed with the plotholes and additions to the storyline.<br/><br/>I am aware that the inclusion of Arwen was to attract more males to see the film, although I'm sure the battle scenes in the advert alone drew thousands to their nearest cinema. She has no part in the book, and her leaving for Valinor was a load of tripe. This never happened! No elven army arrived at Helm's Deep, the Ents DID decide to attack Isengard, and Haldir is not from Rivendell. The performance of Sean Astin was good, his speech about the need to pursue good was tear-inducing, but the hints of a more than friendly relationship are particularly annoying. Both Elijah Wood and Sean Astin played the parts well, all the actors played parts well, but it is the scripts i have a bone to pick with. I loved the portrayal of the riders of Rohan, just as i imagined them, with music to match the fantastic architecture and wardrobe. Brad Dourif was brilliant as Wormtongue, he was perfectly evil and slimy just as Tolkien portrays. i was delighted with Andy Serkis's performance as Gollum, and even more so when he sung his song in the forbidden pool. I loved the costumes, the score and the battle scenes, but one character in particular i have to demean. Gimli is shown as a comic, when of course in Middle Earth, he was a warrior. And to finish, i will critisize the ending. I expected a cliffhanger, as the one in the book, yet i was given a mention of 'she' who of course is mentioned much earlier in the book. Many viewers overlooked the pronoun, and presumed that Gollum was referring to his precious self, or as some of my companions cared to put it, his 'schiz self' but he was speaking of the creature which he leads the hobbits to to conclude the two towers as a book.<br/><br/>It is a habit of mine to critisize so that when others do this, i am prepared and don't just leap to the films defence. I was very pleased with the two towers, save for the mentioned mistakes and disappointments."

I found whole sections of the film to be quite boring and devoid of interest.  Quite different from The Fellowship of the Ring, which was a rollercoaster from start to finish.<br/><br/>
On the plus side, Gollum was great.  Am I the only one who thinks he looks like Michael Jackson?  The battle of Helms Deep was very also very cool.

","As I sat in the theatre, watching the Two Towers, I was remarkably disappointed.  Characters I've cherished all through my life were sacrificed at the altar of special effects and added story.   Frodo, a noble and wise character, is painted as a hapless hobbit on a doomed journey.  Elijah Wood fails in his portrayal by relying almost soley on his always wet eyes. But what really bothers me is the lack of dialog that was provided by Tolkien.<br/><br/>In the book, Faramir is a stark contrast to brother Boromir.  Faramir harkens back to the kings of old with a noble streak nearly as immense as that of Aragorn.  He states that even if he found Isildur's Bane on the side of the road, he would not take it....and then discovers that he must live up to those words.  In the book, Faramir releases Frodo to continue his journey, though it pains him to do so.  Not because he wants the Ring, but because the journey is perilous and he would spare his friend the sorrow. But in the movie, Faramir is painted as a lesser version of Boromir, a man who takes Frodo and Sam by force away from their path and only later realizes that they must be released.<br/><br/>Add to that, Jackson has decided that a love triangle must exist.  Arwen's role in Two Towers is increased and Eowyn, a noble warrior in her own right, is turned into a woman who pines after Aragorn.<br/><br/>There is so much in the books that clearly cannot be translated to the screen as there is simply not enough time.  I am forced to wonder why so many elements were added.  Was the original source not interesting enough?<br/><br/>
As I sat in the movie theatre, watching the story I've read countless times since I was 11, I remember being shocked and appalled that I had no idea what was going to happen next.  The movie had strayed so far from the book as to have created an entirely new tale.  Gimli became Comic Relief, and the growing friendship between the Elf and the Dwarf was barely demonstrated. Jackson completely reversed the outcome of Entmoot.<br/><br/>Things I liked:  Gollum.  Andy did an absolutely amazing job with that character.  The cleansing of Isengard was also quite spectacular.<br/><br/>It's a good film.  The effects are amazing and New Zealand is beautiful.

","This film has left me in an awkward frame of mind. I don't know whether I want to sing Peter Jackson's praises to the world or mutter  coarse and vulgar things about him under my breath.<br/><br/>I am an unabashed and lifelong Lord of the Rings nut. I have read the books more times than I can remember. If you give me the name of the most obscure character, I can probably tell you all about him or her. If you read me a line from one of the books, I can probably tell you which book and chapter it is from, as well as it's context.<br/><br/>I am also an avid film buff and understand perfectly well that a film-maker has to paraphrase, compress, and otherwise alter a book in order to fit it into a viable film. I think Peter Jackson did a masterful job of this with the Fellowship of the Ring, and I looked forward to a similar, if not even more faithful rendition of the Two Towers. After all, the story lines in the Two Towers (book) are fairly straightforward, though on multiple paths.<br/><br/>So I was quite taken aback by the extent to which Jackson has taken liberties with the story line in this film. Several major deviations he made seem unnecessary and unforgivable to me, though others do make sense for the reasons given above. I ought to have been furious about this, perhaps even to the point of walking out of the film. But I wasn't, and here is why: it is just too good a movie not to like.<br/><br/>The cast and performance are superb. The portrayal of Gollum is beyond all my expectations, and the Ents are quite good as well. The visuals are as breathtaking as they were in the first film. And, as with the Fellowship of the Ring, I was so immersed in the film that I had no sense of it's length.<br/><br/>So if, like me, you have practically memorized Tolkien's work, do see the film. If you can check your knowledge of the books at the theater entrance, you will enjoy the film for what it is. If you cannot, you will at least have a wealth of material for conversation. In either case, you will have a whole year to speculate about what PJ will do with, or to, the Return of the King."

To me it sounded like a serialised comic strip, and i paid no heed to it. 19 years later i was given The Fellowship in DVD, and sat down to watch. Three hours later i was totally hooked, and i still haven't read the book. I was counting the days until the release of TTT. it was way above my expectations.

","I felt this was superior to TFOR - if only because it was slightly less derivative of other movies. No I'm afraid that these films are not that original - but modern technology enables them to be so well made they are genuinely spectacular. Characterisation of the human actors is a little poor and with the alarming theme of people being killed and then returning to life - you don't really care if they might be the one who doesn't last the movie! However, my 14 year old son, as with the first film, thought it was fantastic so that merits it an 8 out of 10 especially at three hours.

"homerinvests","7","0","0","30 December 2002"," Trying to maintain an impossible balance.
","Before I saw the first movie, FOTR, I thought Tolkien's LOTR was impossible to adapt to film. It has so many strong characters and such a rich, multithreaded plot that I couldn't imagine how anyone could make all these people and ideas come to the screen without heavily watering down many of the details and characters. Somehow in FOTR Jackson maintained Tolkien's richness of story and characters with only minor changes. Jackson maintained an impossible balance of all Tolkien's detail to appeal to the Tolkien read as well as the unread viewer. In TTT, the big question for me was whether or not he would be able to maintain this 'impossible balance' as the story continued.<br/><br/>THE MOVIE - TTT ***Some minor Spoilers***.<br/><br/>The re-introductions to the FOTR characters and introductions to new characters was setup well. Gandalf's battle with the Balrog continues and Gandalf's return is explained in a great yet vague manner consistent with the book. Frodo, Sam and Gollum together worked for me. Gollum's schizophrenic scenes were believable and even comic (if a little overlong) at times. Merry and Pippin were more serious and no longer the comic relief duo, but any comic responsibility they shed was picked up many times over by Gimli. I'm sure he had more comic lines than serious ones. Aragorn and Legolas will again have their fan followings either for their battle prowess, or their lady swooning abilities. Saruman was back in a lesser role with his army of badies. We were also introduced to King Théoden, Wormtongue, Eomer and Eowyn in the first hour of the movie, so the beginning laid a solid foundation for the rest of the story.<br/><br/>I first got a sinking feeling that something was really missing when the Uruk-hai fought over Merry and Pippin. There was no division of ranks between the forces of Mordor and Isengard. Nor was there the counterplot in which Saruman had designs on keeping the ring for himself. Later, I again experienced this feeling of something missing when Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli met Eomer and the Riders of Rohan on the plain. Many of Tolkien's subtleties of that meeting were missing, and I could see that there was not going to be a brother-like bond between Aragorn and Eomer.<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin's escape from the Uruk-hai interleaved with Aragorn discovering the clues of their escape was well done. This sequence lead up to the introduction of Treebeard. I'm sure that there will be many who pick apart the CGI in these scenes, but I give top marks to Jackson et al. for being brave enough to include a force of walking, talking, fighting trees in the movie. My problem with the Ents was not with the effects, but rather it felt that Jackson was struggling to stay consistent with Tolkien. Jackson kept them very true to the book and 'unhasty' in some scenes then had them act in the opposite manner in the next scenes. Also, for one of the oldest, wisest creatures in Middle earth, Treebeard was more than a little naive. He acknowledges the smoke over Isengard, but failed to deduce than smoke means fire, fire mean wood, and wood means... (wait for it) ...TREES. Further, the overall significance of the Ents overthrowing Isengard was not clear, but there is (hopefully) room for exposition on that in the next movie.<br/><br/>Théoden's transformation back to himself was nicely done, but it didn't seem very logical that Grima was spared and set free given the knowledge he had of Rohan's defenses. This is perhaps another riddle to be answered in the next movie. The flight to Helmsdeep was good with a little of everything: comedy, romance (via Aragorn / Arwen flashback), and a battle.<br/><br/>Frodo, Sam and Gollum's journey introduced us to the flying Nazgul, and gave us glimpses of the mental turmoil the ring was causing for Frodo. We also got our first look at the impressive, impenetrable fortress of Mordor and of Sauron's massing armies. I thought Jackson did well to stay somewhat true to the book as Frodo, Sam and Gollum watched Faramir's ambush of the Oliphant riding Wildmen and during Frodo and Sam's capture, but struggled with Tolkien consistency in subsequent scenes. For the next few scenes I thought their whole interaction disappointing. There was no sense of mutual respect between Frodo and Faramir. When Faramir 'showed his worth' by declaring that the ring would go to Gondor, I felt my eyes bulge in my head.<br/><br/>The Helmsdeep arrival and battle preparation sequence was OK. The whole pacing of the movie seemed rushed here. Why did they have to try to make so much happen in one day? Between the arrival at Helmsdeep, the battle preparation, the tension building moments, the comic relief moments, the arrival of reinforcements combined with scenes of the simultaneous doings of Saruman, Aragorn, Merry and Pippin - whew!...keeping track of everything was a bit difficult to follow. Also, as an aside, what were those Hobbit children doing in Helmsdeep? - grin.<br/><br/>The battle of Helmsdeep itself was excellent with bad moments. On the good side, the scope was immense and the effects very good. Ten thousand enemies assaulting a fortified stronghold. There was an outer wall battle, an inner wall battle, and last stand at the gate - wave after wave of attack and counter attack. On the bad side, a few unbelievables that stood out for me: For example, Aragorn being blown off the outer wall to the courtyard in a massive explosion then getting up, uninjured, a few seconds later, or the scene where Aragorn and Gimli attacked everyone on the ramp then get pulled to safety by a dangling rope. Gandalf's arrival with Eomer was good but their initial charge looked to be a poor battle tactic - charging downhill into a pike holding mass. Another minor criticism for me was that King Théoden doesn't come across as very noble - quite inferior to Tolkien's Théoden.<br/><br/>The battle with Faramir's people in Osgiliath served no purpose. OK, reading a bit into it, we see that Faramir is the only one brave enough to raise a weapon to the flying Nazgul. But after Frodo's scene with the Nazgul Faramir comes to understand what Frodo is going through and decides to set him free after all. HUH!?!?!? What insight has he had? How could he possibly understand Frodo's situation and turmoil? Did Sam's speech win him over? This did not flow for me at all. Perhaps Jackson et al. wanted to include another battle using Sauron's forces to show that more evil forces were at work than only Saruman (? - I don't know.).<br/><br/>Overall, it didn't seem as though there were as many subtle scenes , or as many scenes with hidden significance in TTT as there were in FOTR. In the end we were left in similar circumstances to what we were in FOTR. While TTT still has the flavour of Tolkien's LOTR, the full essence of Tolkien's great work is not as strong as it was in the FOTR. There are so many things happening in the movie that I think the unread viewer will have problems following the 'why' behind all that is happening. But, by the same token, once you've read the book you can't help but to compare it to the movie and here TTT fails to achieve the same impossible balance that FOTR achieved.<br/><br/>My $0.02."

","That's right. The Two Towers cares not a whit for the good people in the eight-dollar seats. It doesn't care if it bores you to tears. It doesn't care if you can't tell one character from another. It doesn't care if you notice that the dwarf goes from about six-one in the initial running-around-Middle-Earth scenes to about three-eight in the closeups. It doesn't care if you think that the torment endured by the horribly pathetic, abused, and addicted Gollum is funny as hell, which half of the insensitive morons in the theater did.

","The Two Towers is a work of art and should be treated like one.  It is truly a great movie, but I have to admit that it was a disappointment since I read the book first and had some high expectations and the movie did not meet them.  They leave it completely open ended and don't end in the same spot as they do in the book, like what they did in Fellowship of the Ring.  They didn't really show you the Ents taking over Isengaurd, Merry and Pippen never meet back up with the others, They don't show the Palantir, and they don't include Shelob at all (but they do give u a hint as to the fact that she will appear in the third installment of the film)  A great relief to us all.<br/><br/>They also included some of their own ideas into the movie, which confused me at times.  They included their own battle scene, which is where Aragorn falls off the cliff (which is never mentioned in the book)  They also have Frodo and Sam go back to Gondor with Faramir, which is not included in the book.<br/><br/>Overall I think the movie was great and I encourage you all to see it. After you see it a second time you get a new perspective of the movie and<br/><br/>you are able to better enjoy it.  If you don't dwell in the things the movie has missed or added you will find it fun and exciting to watch.

The trolls working the gate were cool. Hmm, any other beasts.....? * All the 15 second-long sweeping scenery shots got old to me. I know it displays the beautiful landscape, and sets scenes, but shot-after-shot of Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas trekking across rocky mountain tops got a bit tedious. * The first Orc that mentioned eating the Hobbits was cool-lookin'.

","I read some comments on this movie (in magazines, internet, newspapers) saying it would be 'not as good as' or sometimes 'better as' the first movie. In my opinion, this is something that can't be said about this movie because it is not a separate movie. I think that when Tolkien wrote LOTR he didn't actually think it to be three separate stories; there is just 1 LOTR story. The same goes for the movie, especially because it was not filmed as three separate movies but as one. I think therefore that the parts we have seen until now of the LOTR movie (part I and II) are showing us that this is a really excellent movie (and I can't wait for the last part..)."

","The process of seeing a long-awaited, great film on a public holiday: Step 1:  7 days prior to screening, book tickets. Step 2:  Leave home at a time that will allow you to arrive at the cinema (minimum) 45 mins before scheduled starting time. (Take into account looking for a park and buying popcorn.) Step 3:  Get out the deck chairs and prepare to sit and wait for those two doors to open so you can get good seats. (Safety equipment is also advisable as people can be ruthless at times like these...) Step 4:  If you have any food and/or beverages left, place them in the correct positions, sit back, relax, pig out and enjoy the show. Step 5:  Log on to IMDb and write your comment on how fantastic the film was. On this occasion, the process applies to the amazing Lord of the Rings; The Two Towers, and my own experience. This would have to be one the historical films of our time in terms of production. Not only were the graphics,  acting, scenery, etc absolutely stunning, but the fact that the second film was as good as, if not better than the first is a rarity in the business. Even though the entire story was adapted from one the most famous books ever, it was put together in a way that was fresh and imaginative and thus, captured the audience, making them feel as if we were actually there in Middle Earth.  The actors presented their characters perfectly, the graphics were sensational and there was certainly no loss of quality in the film.<br/><br/>The second introduction of Gollum was also very well done.  He was brought to life in a way that made him seem so real. He is a great example of today's lack of technological boundaries. With so many great qualities, and a 1000 word limit, I think i'd be cutting it fine by going into more detail, but i have no doubt that this movie will be talked about for many years to come. The acting and directing were second-to-none, leaving a great impact in the world of film."
"TARGETER14","Null","0","0","30 December 2002"," I personally found Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers to be the worst adaptation of a novel to a film I've ever seen.
","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>First of all, if you wish to see 'The Two Towers' unspoiled (well, at least that hack job Peter Jackson calls The Two Towers) then I suggest that you do not read any further.<br/><br/>Before I go into what I absolutely despised about this movie (which was the majority of it) I shall first state the few things I DID like about it, because those few things were very well done, and deserve proper credit.<br/><br/>First of all, the portrayal of Gollum. For the most part, Gollum was in character- though he came off as being more of a pity case then the despicable 'Stinker and Slinker' that all readers of Tolkien's works know him to be as. As far as computer generated characters go, he's easily the best I've seen, and WETA should be applauded for that. Andy Serkis also deserves a line, as his portrayal was very good.<br/><br/>The opening fight between Gandalf and the Balrog was carried off very nicely. There's not really much more I can say about it, save that it looked nice, and gave a very misleading opening to the movie.<br/><br/>Two words- Eomer. Eowyn. They were portrayed well.<br/><br/>Finally, the soundtrack- it was as beautiful as ever.<br/><br/>Now, on to what made this movie (no longer an adaptation of a classic, but a way to rope in viewers.) so bad for me that I wanted to cry, walk out, or do both.<br/><br/>Characterisation is head of the list. Now, which butchered character shall I begin with...I believe it was Faramir who offended me the most.<br/><br/>
In Tolkien's works, Faramir was a good, noble man. He had honour, and no desire to take the Ring from Frodo. In fact, once he guessed what Frodo was carrying, he told the hobbit to 'Speak of it no more', in case he should feel tempted.<br/><br/>Gimli was a close second in the 'worst portrayal' list. Again, he was an honourable character in the novel- and was reduced to nothing but character relief. What was with his complaining about 'not eating and sleeping for three days and nights' at the start of the film? Gimli would never complain about such a thing! Dwarves in the novels were able to carry heavy loads and run for days. Also, Gimli would not complain when two of his friends were in the hands of the enemy, when he is on his way to help them. Not only was he comic relief- the complaining made him appear shallow and heartless as well.<br/><br/>Theoden was also fairly close to taking the number one spot, but came in at third. He was in the books- guess what, a noble and honourable character! (What IS it with Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh cutting out honour in the second film?) The moment he was out of Grima's influence (note please, that Saruman had NOT magically possessed him like the movie led us to believe.) he realised that there was a problem with his nation, and immediately acted on behalf of the citizens.<br/><br/>There were other characters that I was offended by- Elrond, who came off as a selfish old man; Frodo, who NEVER turned on Sam until right near the end of the third novel; the Ents and their 'hasty' behaviour- but there is a 1000 word limit on this, so I shall move on to.<br/><br/>Cheap humour! Yes, we all know it was there! In fact, the majority of the people probably LAUGHED at Gimli 'chatting up' Eowyn (which stripped him of his dignity) the 'dwarf tossing' jokes, Gimli hitting an Orc in the testicles, or even- God forbid- poor, butchered Legolas catering to the easily amused masses with his 'shield-boarding' stunt.<br/><br/>The Two Towers was NOT a humorous book! Sure, the series did have minor, humorous moment, but those were tasteful, and fit into the flow of the story. They did NOT make the book seem cheap. Overall, Lord Of the Rings is a very dark fantasy- it is one of literature's greatest fights between good and evil, and it WORKS as a dark fantasy.<br/><br/>Incidentally, anyone who says that Legolas' stunt merely proved how well Elves can balance shall earn my eternal scorn. If you want an example of the talents of Elves, either read the book, or admire Legolas' way of mounting the horse earlier in the movie. That was well done, and in character.<br/><br/>And taking into account the word limit, I shall bring up my last major grievance- all that was cut from the movie, and the add-ons.<br/><br/>
The second book had one of the best endings I have ever come across in a novel. It moved me to tears, and had me racing for the third book. Peter Jackson cutting Shelob and a pass of Cirith Ungol left me distraught. I don't care if they will be in the third movie- the simple fact of the matter is, these moments were in the second book, and last I checked, the movie being screened WAS The Two Towers, an adaptation of the second book.<br/><br/>Arwen. Ah, she annoyed me in the first movie, taking Glorfindel's place and in the second movie, she made me want to throttle something. If you go to the appendices of 'Return of the King', and find all the places she was mentioned in the trilogy, you will notice that her name never even appeared in the second novel. So why has she been given such a significant part in the film?<br/><br/>Damned political correctness.<br/><br/>Jackson was adapting a classic. It's a classic because people like it the way it is. If you are going to adapt a classic, then do it right, and do it the way it was intended- that's how the books got popular, and that's how they should remain as a film.<br/><br/>E-mail me if you wish to contend my views. I've put my address in for a reason, and I'd be happy to debate the issue further."

We meet up with Aragon, Gimli and Legolas, as well as the returning Gandalf the White(rider) as they journey to the gates of Rohan, to rescue the aged King Theoden who is under the spell of Wormtounge (played absolutly magnificantly by Brad Douriff). Saving and healing the king, they ride to the safety of Helms Deep, or so they think, with the party from Rohan, and encounter one of the most stunning battles that will leave your heart pounding.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Frodo and Samwise continue on their quest, catching up with Smeagul Gollum, as he tries to steal back his ""precious"". An amazing transformation of CG and acting make me feel that Gollum will be revverred up there with characters the likes of Yoda. They jouney to the Gates o Mordor, only to run into more trouble with the people of Gondor....<br/><br/>There are more storylines that intertwine in with the movie.

One of the noblest characters in the book was Faramir, who did what his brother Boromir could not do, and let Frodo leave for Mordor with the ring.  In the movie, Faramir is as bad as Boromir and wants the ring for Gondor. Arrrrrgh!  Letting Frodo go shows that even though a man can be tempted, he can overcome.  The movie eventually got it right, but only after Faramir took Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath.  What a crock!<br/><br/>The scene with Saruman's orcs riding the cats (or whatever they were) had no business being in the movie.  The screenwriters could've used the time to show more of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard, but they just glossed over this very important part.<br/><br/>Also, what's this crap with the almost love triangle among Arwen, Aragorn and Elrond? Yuck!  If I'd wanted a chick flick, I wouldn't have gone to see The Two Towers.<br/><br/>I saw ""Fellowship"" several times in the theatre, but ""The Two Towers"" was a dud.  I'll wait for it on DVD."

","The movie was great, a little too much focus on the fantastic scenery that is New Zealand, but if you've got it why not flaunt it.<br/><br/>I've read a few reviews, damning Peter Jackson for the story line, I'll not add to that damning, just a bit of disappointment.<br/><br/>We've got to look at the fact that this is an interpretation of the story, yes Peter and Co have rewritten a bit here and a bit there (obviously these bits vary in a) size, b) sentimental value to the Tolkien fan and c) a major part of the plot or character development).<br/><br/>To digress for a moment, The Two Towers was not the second book in a trilogy until Unwin and Allen decided that the 1300 odd pages was too much for a book at that time for the general reading public, so The Two Towers was a fill in, a way to develop characters and plots, before the climatic ending just as the middle of most books / stories are.<br/><br/>Why did Peter and Co change the story and characters? I don't know. They did, I may not agree with the changes, but for someone that is not a Tolkien fan with their own pre-conceived ideas the story line and movie was fantastic.<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING*<br/><br/>For me, the condensed, sun dried Ent's story was very disappointing the shortened Entmoot, lack of Ent brew and of course the trees coming to the aid of Helms Deep. The loss of the on going relationship between Legolas and Gimli and missing of the finality (although they still have the Return Of The King to go) of the counting of who killed more Orcs than the other, was a nice way to lighten an otherwise very dark battle. Faramir's dark side was a bit of a shock, but thinking on it he could be protrayed as a darker, slightly morbid sulking type of personallity. The side trip to Osgiliath really did not add to the story line at all, except maybe to give a reason for Faramir to be in the bad books with his father. I'm still coming to grips with the darker side of Elrond though.<br/><br/>What did I like about it? The start, the panning down the Misty Mountains, past Dimril Dale, suddenly I realised what was going on, it was the battle of Gandalf and the Balrog! The battle of Helms deep was great, the scenery fantastic. And of course how can one forget Gollum! In parts he looked very un-real, but in others he blended into the scenery so well, the argument between Gollum and Smeagol was brilliantly done.<br/><br/>All in all, forgetting my personal dislikes because of the storyline, I still give it a 9/10. For authenticity and faithfullness to the original story and feeling I'd only give it a 5/10. If you are a fan or not I'd recommend you go and watch it, for the fan, forget the story and concentrate on the one written by Peter and Co, its not the epic by Tolkien, but great none the less.<br/><br/>As a final comment, I have noticed that someone said the Hobbit or Silmarillion has not been done yet, with some of the omissions to the Lord of The Rings, Peter may have a little difficulty with the Silmarillion, as parts won't flow together all that well, although I think he'll do a great Hobbit :)"

","Those who would claim that The Two Towers is sub-par just because Peter Jackson did not religiously adhere to the book are being entirely unreasonable.  I would remind them that although Tolkien was a literary genius, he was not a screenwriter or a film maker.  Jackson did an exceptional job with this latest work by sifting through Tolkien's massive work and accentuating the portions which have the greatest amount of cinematic appeal.  Remember that film is an entirely different form and medium for artistic expression and should be treated as such.  Enjoy the film for its incredible story, the beauty of the New Zealand landscape, the formidable acting, and the absolutely mesmerizing visual effects.  This trilogy will without a doubt be remembered as one of the all-time great achievements in film.  Excellent work Mr. Jackson!"
"smith_sj","10","0","0","29 December 2002"," Not the film of the book!
","For anyone who has read the book of the Two Towers this film is going to be a bit of a dissapointment with the many scenes that Peter Jackson has either changed or inserted into the story. Peter has also been kind enough to let us have a toilet break halfway through the film with a load of old rubbish inserted with regards to the Elves. I'm not too bothered about an odd line or so being uttered by wrong characters but to change the story so much is beyond belief..at one point Sam says to Frodo ""Frodo, we shouldn't be here - but we are""...quite! This can only be a joke on Peter Jacksons part as indeed Frodo, Sam & Gollum should definately not be there. Faramir is made to look stupid whereas in the book he makes a wise decision by letting the party go. There are many other variations on the book with battles with Wargs, Aragorns apparent demise and the trip to Gondor.<br/><br/>Anyway if you hadn't read the book then you will probably love it. The effects are fantastic and Gollum is an absolute gem. It should make George Lucas think about what can be done with CGI characters. There is plenty of good quality action in this film with the battle of Helms Deep and the Ents marching on Isengard being particularly memorable.<br/><br/>I think that I really need to see the film again so that I can assess it properly. All I kept doing was notching up the major variations to the book. Now I have got over the shock of that I can watch the film again and enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>7/10 (for now)"
"fepp","Null","0","0","29 December 2002"," This is perilously close to a big fat turkey
","I have not read the books.  But after seeing part one and two of this over-hyped saga on the screen, I am beginning to doubt that there is much to be  had by reading the book.  Tolkien is simply not a very good author, or the screenplay does not do the books full justice. Judging from the enthusiastic fan comments, the latter does not seem very credible.<br/><br/>Compared to the first LOTR movie, this is much much worse. It actually comes very close to being a real big fat turkey,  but is saved by gollum.<br/><br/>It is too pompous.<br/><br/>And the actors are sometimes wooden with horribly,  overpompous, lines. Especially Legolas and Aragorn are settled with stupid comments.<br/><br/>The early part of the movie, with the dwarf, elf, and human heroes RUNNING for days and nights on end after a band of Uruk-Hai that kidnapped some hobbits, is plain ludicrous.  It brings back visions of Monthy Python's Quest for the Holy Grail.<br/><br/>The scenes where Gandalf returns in a heroic backlight and fog, while playing at some kind of pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo (with clear Jesus-like connotations), are too just plain too much!<br/><br/>The viking-style kingdom of Rohan is a nice change from the over-designed ultra-big locales of the first movie.  But the plot taking place there is rather shallow and obvious.<br/><br/>The battle for Helms  Deep is impressive,  especially technically. And the comic relief offered by Gimli is nicely put.   There are some almost shakespearian moments when kind Theodor (was that his name) seems to give up the battle.  Could have been really nice if he had been allowed to lose :)<br/><br/>The scenes with the fleeing women and children feel acutely contemporary, and is almost peace-propaganda.  Very disturbing, nice to point out the suffering of civilians in all conflicts.<br/><br/>The saving grace of the entire movie, however, is the torn character of Gollum/Smeagol.  He is actually believable, and interesting since he is neither good nor evil. All other characters are clearly one or the other, which is part of why the movie fails to engage. It is too simple, and we know who is going to win."
"gnosis7","Null","0","0","29 December 2002"," Final Revision: this essay pertains to both ""Rings"" films.
","The novels I've read in my life are few. When reading fiction, I prefer the short story, having read many -mostly science fiction. So the number of novels I've read is, I think, around fifteen. And along with ""Childhood's End"" by Arthur C. Clark (my life-long favorite), Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece ""The Lord of the Rings"" left a lasting impression on me when I first read it back in 1972.<br/><br/>Like most fans of fantasy and science-fiction, I first read Tolkien's epic trilogy when I was a teenager. I would never have attempted such a seemingly grueling ordeal if not for the constant badgering of friends; the thought of tackling a literary work which consists of more than fifty pages--and which might take a week or two to finish--made me sweat blood. However, growing tired of being left out of our literary discussion group, which usually met around 2:00am at our favorite Denny's restaurant every Friday night (well...maybe every Friday and Saturday night. OK...maybe every Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday night -I didn't have much of a life back then, either), I decided to expand my literary horizons. So, one night, after consuming about ten cups of coffee (Denny's coffee), we drove over to my friend Bill's house. Bill told me he had all of Tolkien's published works. I began to cringe as he handed me the trilogy: ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Two Towers"", and ""The Return of the King"". (Beads of blood appeared on my forehead.)<br/><br/>I dived into the first book while lying on the floor of Bill's bedroom. One of  Led Zeplin's early albums ( I can't remember which) was spinning on Bill's stereo system, and the room soon reeked with the smell of pot (Bill was a bit of a stoner). Yeah, that's right: Tolkien, Zeplin, and weed.(Oh, sweet counterculture!) Bill even had the proverbial black light and iridescent posters in his room. Of course, if Bill wanted ""iridescence"", all he had to do was close his eyes (he was doing more than just smoking grass in those days, if you know what I mean).<br/><br/>""The Lord of the Rings"" is about the adventures of a ""fellowship"": four diminutive, barefoot hobbits, an archetypal wizard, an elf with a longbow, two humans (one being a reluctant king), and a materialistic (but brave and honorable) dwarf, who set out on a mission to destroy a powerful, but corruptive, magical ring -that is, to throw the ring into the volcanic fires of ""Mount Doom"", in which it was forged. According to the powerful wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), it's the only way to prevent the impending, apocalyptic struggle between the armies of  Sauron (the evil guy) and the armies of noble elves and dutifull men, a struggle that will shake the foundations of  ""Middle Earth"" and determine the fate of its inhabitants for millennia to come.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed Tolkien's ""magnum opus"", I never became a Tolkien scholar. In fact, while watching the films, I wasn't sure of the correct sequence of events -I only half-remembered them from the books (it's been 30 years since I've read them). But intermittent tutorials from my buddy sitting next to me (uh...no, not Bill) kept me well informed, kindling my anticipation as the story progressed.<br/><br/>OK, so I'm not a Tolkien scholar, but I am a ""film geek"" (actually, just a ""geek""), and in my ""geekish"" opinion, the first two installments of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings"" are absolutely...FANTASTIC! The reason: the movies succeed in the attempt to create an ""implicit context"" (my own term), which I define as the underlying ""reality-framework"" of a story. This was fabulously accomplished by the author in the original books. Tolkien's Middle-Earth is awash in romance and lyricism, yet it's a very ""causal"" world; it's a world born out of vast, convergent histories and darwinian struggles. And even though Tolkien created a totally imaginary realm inhabited by a mythic plethora of fantastical beings, it's a very realistic, heavily textured realm. And as we follow the adventures of Frodo--the key character in the story--as he and his companions penetrate wispy, magical forests, and stumble through dark, foreboding, underground labrynths (wherein ""things more foul than orcs dwell""), we totally accept the reality of it all. We suspend our disbelief and totally immerse ouselves in Tolkien's world because he provides us with a wonderfully descriptive context, creating a realm born out of  history, a realm inhabited by beings that reflect an  evolutionary history, an incredibly ""textured"" realm, in which Frodo's adventure unfolds.<br/><br/>It takes a talented writer to create ""implicit context"" in a literary work, especially in the fantasy genre, and it takes equal talent--and even greater reserves of sweat and blood--to create this context in a motion picture. This is not to belittle Tolkien's literary skill; he was certainly a master storyteller who probably pulled out many of his own hairs while writing his trilogy. But the fact is, when making a movie, settings (real physicalities), hardware, and ""flesh-and-blood"" human beings are required. In these movies, of course, ""flesh-and-blood"" hobbits, elves, wizards, dwarves, orcs, trolls, and goblin-men are required (not to mention...BALROG!). And making it all appear ""believable"" can be a daunting task. But these movies succeed in the attempt; for example, the ""Shire""--where the hobbits live--with its beautifully photographed pastoral landscapes, seems a very real place with a real history, inhabited by real people (uh...hobbits) who belong to real families that have real lineages. This sense of context pervades both films, imprinting the landscapes of Middle-Earth indelibly on our minds.<br/><br/>But aside from the wonderfully textured environments of Middle-Earth--and its equally textured societies--it's the individual characters that make these films so enjoyable. The plot is certainly character driven, and the elaborate sets and opticals--impressive as they are--diminish into the background as we are entertained by the main characters; we look forward to meeting these quaint hobbits, and to acquaint ourselves with each of their idiosyncratic personalities. We learn to care about them, and to appreciate the dynamics of their relationships (the friendship between Frodo and his loyal friend, Sam Gamgee, is especially heartfelt).<br/><br/>Another example of how intensely both films focus on the characters is the director's extensive use of the most powerful filming technique in cinematic art -the ""Close-up"". There are many long, screen-filled close-ups of Frodo's face (Elijah Wood)--often without him even speaking--expressing  joy, fear, anxiety, and more subtle expressions denotative of innocency and naivete. There are also long, moody close-ups of Gandalf's wizardly countenance as he ponders the looming crisis which threatens Middle Earth. His deeply furrowed brow, vague mumblings, and almost subliminal, yet emotive, facial expressions subtly convey the wizard's intuitive awareness of the imminent clash between the forces of Good and Evil.<br/><br/>And for all you guys out there who drool on your popcorn whenever Liv Tylor is on the screen, well...you won't be seeing Liv (what kind of a name is that, anyway?) on her back in these films. But don't worry, you won't be disappointed; this movie has some nice close-ups of her, too -from the neck up, of course. And believe me, guys, watching Liv's hithering mouth--roughly 6ft across on the theater screen--molding seductive, melodic utterances in ""Elvish"", will do it for you. But restrain yourselves; her boyfriend, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), wields a pretty mean broadsword.<br/><br/>So, why am I praising both ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers""? Well, I guess it's because I really believed in the characters. They seemed to be as real as the director, screenwriters, and artisans could possibly make them. The now mythic realm of Middle-Earth has been concretized; the imagery in these films is born out of a reality-framework that appears to be long-established and anterior to our present-day world. And after I entered the quaint, little dwelling in the side of the hill, and was introduced to Frodo Baggins, I believed him to be a real person--even if he was only three feet tall with oversized furry feet--and I believed his ""hobbitish"" sensibilities to be genuine.<br/><br/>Indeed, upon leaving the theater each time, I realized that for three hours...I believed in hobbits."

","Sorry, but I did something in Two Towers I never thought I'd do.  I actually dozed off a couple of times!  I wasn't sleep-deprived, and overall I've enjoyed Peter Jackson's effort.  Still, I thought this movie somewhat less than Fellowship.  First, Character development suffered...and yes, that was the job of Fellowship; but still, each installment should develop all the characters to SOME degree.  Gimli became the comic relief; Legolas's character was almost totally ignored.  He became a kind of elvish Terminator.  Frodo and Sam went well, and I actually enjoyed what Jackson did with Gollum/ Smeagol.  Still, the introduction of 'new material' concerning Arwen and Aragorn seemed almost silly.  Helm's deep took WAY to long to tell (at the expensive of almost the rest of the story) and while it was visually wonderful, it too took way to many detours from the original story line. I fully understand that Jackson - or any director, really - would have to take some liberties to tell the story.  But some of Jackson's liberties simply haven't made sense to me.  The cast remains solid however, and visually this is one of the greatest movies ever made.  Please, Mr. Jackson...not so many liberties with the story!  Compress,but please don't make so many wholesale changes!"
"ed_minty39","Null","0","0","29 December 2002"," Excellant film, but what happened to the real Two Towers
","After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring, I dcided that i could not wait a year to find out what happened next, so i decided to read the books (all three), from reading the TT i had expected the film to be even better than the first (and the third (Return of the King) to be better still). Unfortunatly, when i saw the film, i was disappointed that Tolkien's story was lost, many scenes were lost, many characters were portrayed differently such as Faramir and Gimli. Faramir was a likeable heroric man in the books, but portrayed as an enemy to Frodo and Sam in the film.  Gimli has become the comic centre of the films, lacking his serous character in the books. Also,where in the book was Aragorn believed to be dead?  The title of the film is the ""Two Towers"", in the book, the Ents overrun Isengard (as in the film, although not such a major part as it should have been) and the tower of Cirith Ungol where Sam finds Frodo locked up after their battle with Shelob, this tower is non existant in the film and the film does not deserve it's title as the Two Towers, more like ""The One Tower that features at the end"". I don't like to complain because I thought that the film itself was a masterpiece (one of the best films I have ever seen), with a super scene with Gollum talking to himself (may i add that I think gollum is the best CG character ever).  The Ents were another masterpiece of the CGs and helped along with wonderfull acting from all involved (special credit to Andy Serkis for Gollum). Another high point was the music, I loved Howard Shore's score and it captured the world of Middle Earth perfectly again.  Gollum's song is superb and makes you feel sorry for the creature, and the theme fo Rohan is also just wonderfull. Overall, this film is much darker than FOTR and ends in the superb battle of Helm's Deep.  If this battle is anything to go by, then the battles in Return of the king are going to be aweinspiring. Congratulations for a super film, but a shame it's not quite the real Two Towers.  For the film i give it 10/10, for a portrayal of Tolkien's Two Towers, just a 6/10. Sorry Peter."

","Of course, I am a Tolkien fan that has enjoyed the books and associated art for years. I never thought anyone could possibly put this material on the big screen without butchering it so much it would not have the same magic.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has proved me so wrong, watching the Fellowship (about 30 times now!) and The Two Towers three times I feel I have been transported into Middle Earth in all its glory! Yes, I know the films have missed bits of the book out (Tom Bambardil for instance), enhanced some characters (Arwin being a good example, but seeing more of Liv Tyler is not a bad thing), changed dialogue (everyone I would say) and have characters appear where they shouldn't be (Sam and Frodo at osgiliath for instance). I agree with peter Jackson that it was necessary to change things around for the sake of making the movies as entertaining as possible whilst keeping as much of the essence of the book as possible. Therefore, i forgive Peter for all of the changes he has done, in fact he has even improved it in some places like the elves turning up to fight at Helms Deep, superb moment.<br/><br/>After the disaster of the cgi created character Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode I, I was really worried Gollum and Treebeard in The Two Towers. I was astonished with the realism of Gollum, I forgot he was cgi'd when I was watching him which is the ultimate test i would say. Treebeard was well done as well, would have liked to have seen more of him espiecially in his Ent house, hopefully we will see more on the extended DVD I am expecting late next year.<br/><br/>One question, how did Aragorn manage to put his sword back into its sheath when he fell off the cliff? Is there a break in continuity here?<br/><br/>Getting Alan Lee and John Howe involved in the artwork for the film was a master stroke, so many scenes looked just as if they had been lifted straight from their paintings.<br/><br/>Well done to all those that worked on the film, but particulary Peter Jackson, he is a genius.

By the time the battle was half way over i was actively rooting for the uruk-hai.<br/><br/>And as for the end...the heroes on horseback charging through the swarms of orcs like a vaguely inconvenient black fog, the rohirrim charging downhill onto a forest of spears (wouldnt that have resulted in about 2,000 horse kebabs? Or did Gandalf turn all the spears to rubber?) Even my 10 year old nephew thought the end was ""dumb"".<br/><br/>Shouldnt the second film in a trilogy like this end of a note of despair, loss, tragedy?

Basically this appears to have occurred to try and balance that fact that the elves had been painted as letting the poor humans do all the work to this point.  Fair enough.  Also, we needed a character to kill off, as Tolkien didn't really see the need for anyone to die in most of his trilogy, which is a bit silly in what is basically pages and pages of fight and flight.  Fair enough again.<br/><br/>Can't wait for number three."

","I am a giant fan of the LOTR books, The Hobbit, and especially The Silmarillon. This movie is good, but as an adaptation it isn't nearly as good as The Fellowship SE was. I was disappointed in the adaptation, but happy with the movie itself. If you've never seen The Fellowship, you'd be lost. It picks up literally right after The Fellowship ends. And those who've complained that they can't remember how The Fellowship ened, GO OUT AND RENT IT!!! It's been out since AUGUST!!! NO COMPLAINTS ARE VALID ABOUT THAT!!!<br/><br/>Now onto the film itself...(some spoilers involved)<br/><br/>CG Graphics- At spots it's really fake. Even with the ""great"" Gollum. Some parts are so bad that it reminds me of Ep. 1 Jar-Jar. The Deeping Wall scene with the Uruk-Hai was incredibly fake looking at times. Almost looked better in the ""Two Towers"" video game. <br/><br/>Plot- Drifted a bit too much from the book. In the book, there was no fake Aragorn death, nor a flashback with Arwen and Elrond. (Though that scene was well-done). The parts with the Ents were weak, not just adaptation wise either. The Faramir scenes were a bit forced and not wholly believable. Just a good summer-movie plotline by comparison to the previous film.<br/><br/>
Dialogue/Acting- Gimli's turn as a comedian blows chunks. Some lines are good, but he's a hardened warrior in the previous film. Can't they keep up some continuity? Theoden is well acted but not well scripted, Eomer is lacking in the script department too. Grima and Gollum were excellently acted and scripted. <br/><br/>Stuff That Caught Me- The last scene with the Ents overthrowing Isengard was wonderful. The death of Haldir was not necessary, and it made me a bit sad because Haldir's been around for a damn long time in The Silmarillon. The Wargs were interesting till Aragorn's fake death. The Nazgul and their winged steeds were friggin awesome. <br/><br/>All in all, a fairly good film. Not up to par of The Fellowship, but good.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

"hobbitonroad","10","0","0","5 January 2003"," Exceptional Cinema Experience
","The part two installment of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy provided an exceptional cinema experience. Two Towers shows boundless imagination, exceptional direction, and good old fashioned escape quality. The battle scenes are truly epic, the scenes in the Dead Marshes are chilling and freakish, and the beginning sequence of Frodo's dream and the Balrog battle all together demonstrates sheer genius and rare quality in film making. The CGI creation of Gollum is a marvellous achievement in technology and raises the level and standard of film to new heights. The vast complicated scope of Tolkien's imagination has seen a remarkable transfer to the cinema, and the scope of the filmmaker's imagination is unlimited. Those viewers who didn't see the first film may become lost in the increasingly complicated story, but they won't be disappointed in the cinema basics. Never the less, rarely would a film maker dwell so richly on certain moments such as the King of Rohan's pathos. Indeed a lot of character development takes place in this second part of the trilogy, and this justifies the focus of the first part. We see the characters of Merry and Pippin take on new depth, and Frodo's turmoil allows actor Elijah Wood to turn in a fine performance as the loveable and innocent Hobbit turns into a tortured soul.  Thus, anticipation is built to continue the journey with these now even more interesting characters. The pursuit of this project has greatly enriched film making. All kudos is due to the director, technicians and actors. This film earns a rare 10/10 from me; for this to me is what film making and what going to the cinema are all about."

","Yes, you could classify me as 'one of those Tolkien losers', but my opinion is just as valid as anyone elses'. I tried hard to blame my disappointment with this movie on me being disoriented when I saw it, or in a drunken- or stoned-like state somehow, but I have come to the conclusion that this movie really blew, especially if you have any clue what you're talking about. People, who I can only assume are too lazy to read the books, call this 'a great masterpiece of our time' and 'an instant classic', but I must negate that resolution. True, it is a subjective opinion, and true, it is an adaptation of the book, but honestly... that doesn't explain away anything in this, and people that say that 'it's jsut nerds who pay attention to that stuff' are probably insecure, and have a baseless argument. Read StumbleBee's comment on the movie to see my main issues with it, I really don't feel like repeating what's been said before. I will say what I liked about the movie, however. 1.Gollum was so-so. Much better than the Jar Jar v2.0 I dreaded when going into the movie, but not an incredible job done here. 2. Theoden and Faramir. Well cast, badly portrayed. Not the actor's fault. 3. There were parts of the movie where it felt they had strayed back on track. Some of the scenes in Itilien, before Frodo and Sam get captured, come to mind; i.e. the stuff about whether they were going to be in any songs or anything. I thought that to be very much in the spirit of the books. Patches of actual Tolkien a movie does not make. It isn't that Jackson made changesto the book, but the changes he made are what sadden me. He COULD have skipped adding in the Warg attack, Aragorn's adventure, the debate between Arwen and Elrond (though this wasn't really awful), and the trip to Osgiliath in favor of more Ent time, Entmoot, etc. Also the breaking of Saruman's staff, Shelob battle, and Frodo's capture were glossed over. Jackson's only screwing himself in ROTK... Dunno where to rate this. Maybe a 5/10, just can't trust Jackson anymore"

","Yes this movie is a fantastic, awesome adventure, I found myself wrapped up in it and wondering why it took so long to end.  Well, they could have cut out some of the big war near the end which could have left an Intermission for 15-20 minutes to go to bathrooms, but since the studios don't do this anymore what can we do?  This should really be taken into consideration by all of Hollywood with films over 2 1/2 hours long. The tale is quite complicated and one has to listen very carefully to understand the story of the Middle Earth, and it's creatures.  The winning creature is the hobbit, a computer generated character who teases and cajoles and has a winning personality; one has to listen to him to really know what's going on.  Sam and his buddy Mr Frodo are continually beset upon by this hobbit who is practically in the nude.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, photography is beautifully done, and the music is grand!

"ShinKyo81","9","0","0","29 December 2002"," Peter Jackson's LOTR, or how the purists will speak the hell out of him...
","After watching ""The Two Towers"" (TTT) twice, I've realized that ""The Lord Of The Rings"" (LOTR), apart from establishing itself as one of the pillars of the modern literature, it will achieve the same position in the 7th art world. Those sceptics that prophesied that the ambitious project of Peter Jackson would be a disaster, those guys should keep away from the theaters. Because they aren't obliged to watch Peter Jackson's interpretation of Tolkien's universe.<br/><br/>I believe the ""purists"" of the LOTR world won't agree with me when I say that Peter Jackson is leading an incredible job in conjunction with a huge number of people that forms the LOTR staff. Lots of fans complain about that Jackson has sort of invented some parts of the original story created by JRR Tolkien and they ironically say that the film should be titled ""Peter Jackson's The LOTR""...<br/><br/>For God's sake, if you're so critic, go on: ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" movies are still to be made. Look for a producer who gives you a millionaire budget and show me what you've got ^_^<br/><br/>We must understand that Peter Jackson is just another Tolkien's fan who has had the guts to take on with one of the most ambitious projects in the film history and in the movie-adaptation-from-novel thing.<br/><br/>TTT is the culmination of what ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" (FOTR) was. In the first chapter of the trilogy, everything is shown up but in fact you left the cinema with a bit of emptiness, like smelling the food but not eating it. In the TTT, which is the heart of the novel, it's where the story goes on and the action progresses.<br/><br/>Let me talk about plot for a second. (beware: spoiler imminent :P). If you've read the book, then you'll have the same `deja vu' sensation you had in FOTR. But you could possibly complain about the bigger amount of parts which are not in or differ from the book. I think Peter Jackson has done well not including some parts of the novel and I will prove it with the ending of TTT: it's better to end the movie right in front of Mordor than inside Mordor, as the book ends. It's more... movie-like.<br/><br/>Also, it's so astonishing how Jackson has achieved a level in the movie to keep up the story because, in my opinion (this is when the `purists' will hang me ^_^),  TTT novel is the most difficult to read, because of the plot, which is quite plain compared with the 1st and 3rd book.<br/><br/>
Talking about the characters, there are new people around the plot, like Éowyn, Théoden, Gríma Wormtongue. but in my opinion the best one is Gollum, such an incredible and realistic CGI character (probably the best one up to date), who steals the acting from Sam and Frodo in some sequences (just don't miss the dialogue between his two personalities. Worth of an Oscar!).<br/><br/>
Aragorn is probably less active in this sequel, probably because Legolas rocks with his acrobatic movements! Gimli has got a clown-like role, that I really hated through all the film, but however, he somehow fit in it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd like to say that `The Two Towers' is one of the most solid sequels I've ever seen. It's darker than the first one and the action is more intense. Peter Jackson is handling the situation with great success. I cannot wait to see `The Return Of The King'. Worth a look! 10/10<br/><br/>
PD: BTW, c'mon Lucas! Don't spend 3 years to do a movie! Learn from Peter Jackson! ^_^"
"ichikuo","9","0","0","29 December 2002"," Superb Story, Sub-par Directing
","I will make my comments away from the film's story but about the film's directing.  We all know that the LOTR has one of the most powerful stories ever in the media (including literature).  I've never read the novels but still very much enjoy the story on film.  However,  I can only imagine what the film would be like if it had a better director.  My opinion of ""The Two Towers"" is the same as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  Both films are driven by story.  I enjoyed both films extremely only because of the stories. This leads to my disappointment of Peter Jackson's film directing abilities. However, I guess a man jumping from a blockbuster as ""The Frighteners"" (sarcasm) lived up to my expectations.  Peter Jackson is not a young man and seeing how terrible his films were before LOTR, I expected a story driven film trilogy.  Why was he chosen for this film?  What credits does he have that make him honorable?  Any director that has such a powerful license to a story such as LOTR is going to be successful.  If you look at the film from a director's perspective, there is nothing special about it.  The film is watered down to nothing more than overhead fly-bys, which gets very old, early in the film it was like watching ""Behind Enemy Lines"" again.  The battle scenes are gorgeous simply because of location and CG, but there's no uniqueness to them.  Something Peter Jackson needs to make in order to make him stand out as one of the great directors to date.  He does not take advantage of the opportunity he has with LOTR.  An amateur film director could have designed the scenes for each battle.  They were too simplistic. Mind you, you must get over the strength of the story and look at the basics of the direction of the film.  I would've liked to seen what a director such as Ridley Scott or Steven Spielberg could have done with LOTR.  These film makers always seem to bring something new to the screen with each movie, something that makes them stand out, something Peter Jackson lacks.  Many people don't like Spielberg, but I like Spielberg films because they are always beautifully directed, same as Ridley Scott.  The point of this editorial is something that everyone should notice and not look at LOTR as the novel, but as the film.  Peter Jackson's sub-par direction is hidden behind the story of LOTR."

"ringbearer87","10","0","0","29 December 2002"," The most highly anticipated film of the year...did it live up to expectations?
","Well, it's a question not to be answered lightly. It leaves one feeling as though they are stuck in the middle...did we like it better then the first or didn't we? We can't answer! We don't know! TTT is so different to FOTR yet at the same time is so the same. The tone of the film is different and some characters are developed more eg Frodo & gollum. while many are not eg Saruman. New characters were introduced and all were acted brilliantly yet unfortunately we didn't get the chance to form a bond with them as we did with the fellowship in the first film as there just wasn't enough time to get to know them. The 2nd book is undoubtedly the hardest of the 3 books to translate into film. It is also the hardest to read. There are three different stories to follow and though the film interchanged between characters seemlessly unfortunately the story seemed to stray a little from it's main focus: Frodo and his quest to destroy the ring. Yet The film was brilliant, don't get me wrong. Everyone went in with very high expectations which is never a good thing when seeing a film, yet none left feeling very disappointed. The opening scene was one of the best, with the camera panning over mountains with whispers of dialogue from the first film to be heard in the background and then the reply of Gandalfs ""death"" but from different angles to keep fans from feeling cheated. The music was also a huge highlight keeping old themes and adding new ones. The actor who developed the most in this film and who is also terribly under-appreciated was Elijah Wood. His character changed so much from what it was like in FOTR. He is obviously and believably falling ill to the ring and his evil spells were very disturbing to watch as was the relationship between himself, Sam and Gollum - perhaps the best ever CGI character to date. It would have been nice to see a little more of them and also a bit more of Merry and Pippin. Bilbo's complete absence was also a down point. A little less Arwen to make room for Bilbo wouldn't have gone astray, yet the flashbacks let us learn the true depth and strains of Arwen and Aragorn relationship. Over all TTT is a brilliant film though I seem to have focused on mainly the bad points. It is alot funnier and darker and more unsettling. The beautiful scenery in still there looking wonderful and all the actors were magnificent. Peter Jackson had done a marvelous job translating the hardest of the 3 books into film! I give it a 9/10 and I will certainly be going to see it for the 4th time tomorrow!"
"dust-7","Null","0","0","29 December 2002"," Clumsy direction, but worth the ticket
","A popular film. Over 800 imdb.com comments within the first ten days. Sellout crowds at the theaters. However, as with the first part of the trilogy, Jackson is clumsy in his direction. The movie drags at times, and comes together in strange, disconnected ways - so unlike Tolkien's novel. It's been said that the film is boring. It's been said this is because Tolkien was boring. No one who has ever tried to read just one page of Lord of The Rings could believe that. Tolkien's casual style insists on telling a story, drawing one instantly into that world, and not calling attention to the novelist writing his novel (or the filmmaker calling attention to the beauty that is New Zealand, rather than the story of Middle Earth). Tolkien isn't to blame. Jackson is. This movie required a great director, with craft and a vision to work with. Had Jackson really paid his dues to direct Lord of the Rings?<br/><br/>Editing could help Twin Towers and a few flybys could be scrapped entirely. The film would move faster and flow better. The much maligned Bakshi cartoon of the 1970s, while weak on effects and hired extras, certainly makes the Jackson films seem plodding and leaden, by comparison. Bakshi was on pace to tell the entire Lord of The Rings in under four hours, not nine, had his money held out. The ideal Lord of The Rings movie, in other words, would take the pacing of Bakshi's telling, or more to the point, Tolkien's, the effects of the 21st century and Jackson, etc., and stick more faithfully to the plotlines and story Tolkien developed, as well. Those were well thought out.<br/><br/>The flybys suggest something else, as well. A disconnect. The audience isn't shoulder to shoulder with the characters, as in Bakshi's version. We are not running along, or fighting the fights. The audience is watching. The shots are wide shots. It's not an adventure - but an arena. There aren't story arcs, and subplots. There aren't characters, consistent in some ways, and changing in others. There are simply contests, and comic relief between the next show or bout. It's not that much of an exaggeration to compare Jackson's version of Tolkien's classic to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment.<br/><br/>Given the rewrite, then, of Tolkien's novel, by Jackson, and the emphasis in a George Lucas world much more on special effects than anything else, how did Jackson do? In my opinion, the Gollum was well done, but somehow cold, and mechanical. I know this has gotten rave reviews. But something was missing that you had in the snippets of Bakshi, by comparison. His Gollum, as a film version, even if a rotoscope, was more engaging. Jackson's approach of Saruman's army was impressive, as was the Battle at Helm's Deep (something Bakshi couldn't hope to rival with what he had). I did miss those magical mortars of Saruman, though. I thought that was what breached the wall in the book. The conclusion of Eomer's ride with Gandolph the White was cut short, I think, considering how much time was spent on the points of the battle beforehand. All of a sudden, it just ended, and Saruman had been defeated. But the charge down the hill was very impressive, as well, even if a whole bunch of the original '10,000' had disappeared (shades of Bakshi).<br/><br/>One could argue about Fanghorn, as well. I believe it was called bright, and interesting, in the book. In Jackson's view, it was forever forboding and decrepit. One of the ents seemed geared for the funny papers. But generally I thought the Ents were well done. On the other hand, the inclusion of the elves at Helm's Deep seemed gratuitous. They didn't change the outcome. The Rohanim still rode to the rescue. There were just a bunch of dead of elves to show in the gloom. I didn't understand the point of any of that. And Tolkien wouldn't have, either. Show the 'fires of Isengard', instead. Spend the scripting, and the money, on that. Jackson is not Tolkien. Jackson didn't write Lord of the Rings. Maybe as something of a hack, by comparison, the man is jealous of Tolkien. But that doesn't change anything.<br/><br/>
Again, the question is whether Jackson is fit or qualified to direct an epic like Lord of the Rings. I think Bakshi did far better, with a paltry few resources by comparison. Speilberg, perhaps. Others. You don't know. But sticking to the book is probably something new for Hollywood. This is a case where they should have done so, and tried to understand Tolkien rather than impart their own dim sense of things onto a work adapted, at best.<br/><br/>Still, for being boring, and a misstep, and an exercise in the pride of someone who thought he was Tolkien, but wasn't, there's still a lot to appreciate in the film. It is certainly worth a matinee price, even at six dollars, or so. It's worth that. On the other hand, the huge Christmas/New Year's sellout crowds, which doubled the gross compared to FotR, might only encourage more of this sort of treatment of the classics, rather than something with today's f/x, but perhaps yesterday's more profoundly human and interesting filmmaking. If only someone could be found to put those two together, and then attempt something like - The Lord of the Rings."

With Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn on the trail of Merry and Perrigrin who had been captured by the attacking Orcs.

The fight between Gandalf and the Balrog was very cool, as well as the Wolves of Isengard and Helms Deep fight.

Yes indeed, I've read the books and although they certainly were epic and imaginative, I also found them to be dry, filled with unnecessary descriptions, and boring.<br/><br/>
The movie manages to take exactly those parts of the book that are the most interesting, while adding some action and humor here and there to make the movie more appealing to large audiences. While Tolkien purists will likely be upset about (among others) the fact that Gimli has been turned into a comedian, I really liked it. Things like that are simply necessary to keep the casual movie-goer interested. <br/><br/>On top of that, Gollem is absolutely brilliant. The scene in which he (it?) talks to himself is amazing, and the whole Frodo/Gollem relation is done very well, even if Frodo remains a whining little brat. I'm not sure about the whole Aragorn/Arwen ""romance"", the movie could have done without that, and should instead have focused more on characters like Gandalf and Legolas, who get very little screen time. <br/><br/>In terms of plot, there are a couple of points where the movie screws up a little. For example, TWICE we have somebody who was presumably dead return to the land of the living, and there are a bit too much coincidences and lucky escapes in the plot. I'm not exactly sure to which extent this is due to the source material and which part was the ""fault"" of the script writers, though. <br/><br/>While this movie is by no means perfect (especially not in terms of story), it's still a very suspenseful, epic and spectacular film.

It is a wonder some of the actors were able to keep their faces straight while speaking some of the cod-Shakesperean dialogue.

","I must say openly at the outset of this review that I have attempted to read the story several times and have always found it stodgy and impenetrable. I suppose one either has affinity for Dark-Ages style sword-boilers, or one does not. For fantasy I prefer the multi-layered mysticism of C.S. Lewis and for sci-fi the brightly-coloured hyper-detail of Frank Herbert. So saying that The Two Towers is tedious, portentous and doesn't amount to very much in its volume of narrative is like a non-Wagner fan sitting through all sixteen hours of The (other) Ring and complaining that nothing much really happens.<br/><br/> So, I'll exasperate all the Tolkien acolytes here by saying that overall the story is reasonably well-paced and engrossing enough for the non-fanatics to enjoy. Costumes, sets and art direction are all excellent and Viggo Mortensen makes a charismatic lead. Also a constant source of delight is the octogenarian Christopher Lee doing his best Osama impression, raging impotently from his bedroom at the destruction of Isengard like an imam being woken early on a Sunday morning by a leaf-blower. The character of Gollum also is destined to be one of the movies' unforgettable, classic creations - his mental torment so beautifully conveyed, the conflict of greed and loyalty so clearly defined, he appears like a psychotic, hallucinating version of Yoda. The film comes alive every second Gollum appears on the screen<br/><br/>  To the negative aspects. As I said at the outset, not a lot happens over the course of three hours. The hobbits go on walking, our heroes appear on endless helicopter shots running or riding, and there's a battle at the end. That's it. Characters are already established so no further exposition is needed, but what we get is an awful lot of (sometimes exquisitely lovely) padding. I know this is a Celtic-style fantasy, but why does the dialogue have to be so heavy, slow and mock-Shakespearian? Surely Tolkien didn't originally write all this stuff? He did, you say? Geez! I'm sure to the reverential Tolkien-ites the characters drip pearls from their very lips each time they open them, but to me it all sounded rather like a po-faced version of Conan the Barbarian, minus the humour. Howard Shore's music also struck this reviewer as rather pedestrian and missing the required Wagnerian touch, and not enough (nearly enough!) of the delectable Liv Tyler.<br/><br/>  All-in-all, a bum-numbing haul along the road of synthetic lyricism, with seemingly more emphasis placed on not alienating Tolkien fans than on attracting new ones. I can guess the next one - the short people give the ring back and good triumphs over evil, right? I hope that doesn't spoil it for anybody.."

","With lots of reviews on the ""big picture"" of ""The Two Towers"", I wanted to make sure that two players got their props:  Bernard Hill as Theoden and Andy Serkis (and animators) as Gollum.  While Gollum has received lots of deserved praise for the animation, I think the animation grows out of the performance (on set and vocally) of Mr. Serkis.  His performance is a wonderful interpretation of a character that could have played merely as unbelievable and irritating ...instead we get tragic, complex, and compelling.  Mr. Hill's Theoden was joy, although his ""possession"" make-up was a bit over the top and unbelievable.  Once back in command, Theoden's presence more than held his own with Aragorn.  In fact if folks weren't so goggle-eyed over Viggo and Orlando, they might have noticed that Theoden stole a few scenes along the way..."

Then a bunch of kings and princes with beards show up, and I'm sorry but I just don't have time to tell them apart.

","The first time I saw this one, I could not decide if I had seen a great film or just a mediocre flick. After my second viewing, my mind were made up. This movie is another masterpiece from Team Jackson. I had some initial problems with the rewrites, but as the scenes ""sunk in"" they made perfectly good sense. A lot of shortcuts were inevitable since the story is impossible to film. Jackson have made some people very angry with some of the changes, but if one just puts down the book and watches the film instead, one will find that these changes actually works. <br/><br/>*Some Minor Spoilers*<br/><br/>There have been outcries about the Warg-scene, and how this did not happen in the book. That is correct, it did not happen Right There, but it actually DID happen in another place in the book (minus the actual wolf riders that were taken from another book written by Tolkien). It means Jackson just moved the incident to another time and place, no big deal really.<br/><br/>
There are a lot of rewrites in this part, some are brilliant and some kind of, well, meaningless. But as a whole they make for a great movie experience. Heck, for my part they could have shaved Gandalf, painted him blue and called him Grand Smurf, and I still would have watched in awe. This IS Middle Earth. They made it! They took one of the greatest books in the world and made a movie based on it. That is pretty amazing in my book.<br/><br/>Hats off to Team Jackson. Salute! 9/10."

","This movie is definitely worth seeing, regardless of whether you have read the books or not. The only thing that really bothered me about this movie was that it went off from the book around the second half. Perhaps the worst was the portrayal of Faramir, whose character in the book let Frodo and Sam go as soon as he found out their mission, instead of holding them prisoner in the movie; so basically his character was shortchanged.<br/><br/>Aside from that, the movie was awesome, and was better then fellowship in every way. The best part, in my opinion, was the battle of Helm's Deep, I had high expectations for this scene, and it exceeded them."

","I know that it's not really appropriate to review The Two Towers as a straight sequel since LOTR is essentially one nine hour long movie. Still, it falls into some traps that most regular sequels do.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Fellowship an immense amount more than this film. Maybe that has something to do with the fact that it was our first glimpse into this world and that unbelievable first impression has been somewhat watered down now that I've grown used to the impressive visuals and sweeping landscapes. It doesn't hit as hard when you've seen it all before.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with TTT is that the splitting of the Fellowship from Part I really hurts the story. Obviously they're following the books and this is the sequence of events but the only section of this film I found interesting were the events that centered around Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Frodo and Sam are very boring characters when they're left on their own. I won't even go into the ""other"" two hobbits bc if I had to see one more scene of them in that damn tree I was going to stab somebody. The characters work best together. Their chemistry was a huge part of the first films charm. This one feels rather flat. A lot of gloss without a whole lot of substance underneath it. It also feels like the first film was on a larger scale. This one kind of felt like I was looking at the same countryside over and over again.<br/><br/>Obviously the climax to TTT is far superior to Fellowship but that's about all it has on the original movie. That and Gollum, who alone is almost worth the price of admission. But the ring wraiths are totally wasted in this film, and surprisingly unfrightening. They were one of my favorite parts of Fellowship but here they're just cartoons.<br/><br/>Now I haven't read the books since I was a kid, but I know that Fellowship was a much better adaptation than TTT. Everything they needed was right there in the pages. Why did they feel the need to change so much? I don't need it to be down to the last detail. Hell, I like the new love triangle they've added... but there's something missing in this entry. A level of intrigue that the first one maintaned throughout it's entire running time. THere were only a few moments of TTT that left me with a similar reaction.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this was still one of the better movies I've seen. It's actually fantastic until compared to the earlier film. Bottom line- Great flick, but not the same rush as Part I."

Although a more potent display of wizardry for the epic Gandalf vs. the Balrog would have helped novice viewers grasp how an old man could defeat such a demon.  I was also a little disappointed in Faramir.  He seemed but a shadow of the valiant & noble (and wiser than Boromir) heir to the steward of Gondor that Tolkien intended.<br/><br/>Was I the only one who appreciated Miranda Otto's portrayal of Éowyn, Shieldmaiden of Rohan?  Her simple yet stunning looks and shy inward strength were impressive . an excellent characterization.<br/><br/>I agree that the level of detail was outstanding, and Jackson & crew are to be commended for their efforts . notice the `white tree' emblazoned on the tunics of the warriors of Gondor . exactly as Tolkien had originally drawn."

","There are a lot of comments here that will tell you how good this movie is. I agree, it is a wonderful movie, however I would like to comment on a few things that I didn't like. These things have more to do with the adaption of the book rather than the quality of the movie itself.<br/><br/>Firstly where is Faramir? I noticed his name appeared but his character as in the book is nowhere near. Faramir is supposedly his brother's opposite, showing that men aren't all bad. Also that Boromir's fate wasn't bound to the fact that his father is Steward (king) of Gondor. Faramir is exactly like Boromir, greedy, thinking first of his own glory rather than the survival of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>** perhaps spoiler ** Another thing is Aragorn's 'fake' death. Pretty pointless, clearly not from the book and does nothing for the plot of the movie. He just disappears and the reappears a little later. Peter Jackson could have left this part out easily and instead spent more time on the Ents for instance.<br/><br/>I however cannot complain about this movie because it is visually stunning and the acting is very impressive, especially from Andy Serkis. 9/10 (because I am a big fan of the books)."

","I don't want to get onto too much of a rant about the differences between the books and the movies, but I cannot contain my disappointment after seeing TTT.<br/><br/>I don't have the unreasonable expectation that the movie should mirror the book completely; I certainly expected Jackson to take some liberties as he did in FOTR.  In fact, I liked the differences between the book and the movie in FOTR.  But I cannot fathom why he made the choices he did in TTT. Among the most grievous:<br/><br/><ul><li>Aragorn's fall into the river and subsequent Arwen ""rescue"".  WTF is this all about?  Why is this necessary?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villification of Faramir.  Tolkein made clear the differences between Boromir and Faramir.  Faramir is supposed to be a likeable character, noble as Boromir could not be.  Why does PJ need to cast doubt on him?  Do we really need this additional conflict?  Faramir, like Galadriel, is supposed to pass the test unconditionally.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The banishment of Eomer/wussiness of Theoden/women &amp; children at Helm's Deep so that we could have all the worried looks in Helm's Deep.  I couldn't have disagreed more with PJ's entire interpretation of Rohan's involvement. Eomer, like Faramir, has his character stolen by this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>
There's more, but these were the worst.  I'm not opposed to his modifying of the story - I just don't understand what these modifications added to the movie.  In my opinion, they detracted from it greatly.  TTT should have been the best of the three movies.  There is so much good material to work with. And it is so wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>I know this won't be a popular position, but needed to put it out here so that those who do agree have some companionship..."

","I'm glad to see so much balanced comment this year on TTT. IMHO, the vitriolic rabble who rate it 1 simply don't understand movies.  As a film this is a fine piece of movie-making- not perfect, but absorbing from both the position of fast action and slow-paced dialogue.<br/><br/>It has flaws but the substance of the film is great epic story-telling. The essence if not the exact detail of the book IS represented, and it has been said dozens of times here, that it is simply not possible or desirable to film the book page by page. The inherent problems of the middle-part of the story cannot be avoided but I feel the structure with omissions for later and emergence of Gollum have made TTT a satisfying movie.<br/><br/>We all have our mental Middle-Earths and they vary from person to person. Jackson has done as well as anyone can in presenting a public Middle-earth. I admire the attention to the visual detail esp costumes, the use of the landscapes, the advances in CGI, casting,music. I found with the FOTR that there is so much in it that it is not possible to absorb it sufficiently in a single viewing. I think that this is so much more so with this film. New characters, some of whom give superb performances eg Brad Dourif, Andy Serkis, and some of the 'old' ones who do develop all make it a more complex movie.<br/><br/>I recognize the flaws and limitations, but, in the end, the world will have a wonderful 10-11 hour movie epic of Tolkien's work ..we should be thankful.<br/><br/>9/10 for FOTR 8/10 for TTT and let's all hope that the ROTK is the crowning glory of the epic... it certainly has all the drawing together of the threads to allow that to happen."

Both points are particularly hollow:<br/><br/>Faramir - various issues have been raised:<br/><br/>1) he is too similar to Boromir - they are brothers for fricks sake - what do you expect? In the book Faramir is described as close to Boromir but closer to the true line of Numenor.<br/><br/>2) He does not let the hobbits go at the Forbidden Pool but drags them to Osgiliath? And? So what? Does this really diminish him? He still does the right thing in the end.<br/><br/>3) Everyone in Gondor seems to know of the Ring. No, totally incorrect if you actually watched the film<br/><br/>4) His life becomes forfeit for letting the Ring go. No, amazingly incorrect for supposed fans of the book to complain - his life becomes forfeit for letting the hobbits go. By decree of the Steward of Gondor any individuals found in its territory near Mordor must be killed or taken as prisoner to Gondor - because Denethor suspects the Ring is returning to Mordor - as is explained in the book if you could read.<br/><br/>5) The Nazgul sequence looks false - really?<br/><br/>6) The CGI sucks? What planet exactly do you folks live on? Or have you returned from some distant future where CGI has reached unknown levels?<br/><br/>
Frankly every comment against this film can be categorised under 3 subsets:<br/><br/>1) People whose bums seem to demand more of their attention than anything else so they cannot sit through a 3 hour film - deserve some pity for a painful physical condition<br/><br/>2) People who simply have no appreciation of anything with a 'fantasy' premise as they have no imagination whatsoever - deserve even more pity for the drab and dreary lives they must lead<br/><br/>3) People who simply like to jump up & down and scream 'look at me, I'm different, I know something you all don't, look, look!!!' - deserve no pity whatsoever as they are the same types that make life a pain for everyone in any arena.<br/><br/>Give it a break.

It's kinda like a company makes these creatures and sends them out to multiple movies as ""Evil Creatures"".......But, puting all that and many other things aside, overall it's an okay film... Peter Jackson might be getting a little too much credit for this film..I still think the most powerful thing about this film is the story itself which had nothing to do with Peter Jackson... He did co-write the screenplay which i think was Terrible in ""The Fellowship.."", but was actually not too bad here... and finally, i thought Gollum was one of the most realistic looking CG creatures i've ever seen... so, a good film, but not a masterpiece..."

But, as having read the books, why all the changes?  I can swallow the Arwen junk in order to appeal to women, but why pull the Frodo almost killing Sam? why the Aragorn fake death sequence (Gandalf re-done and no one surprised this time)?  why the over-the-top unrealistic Helm's Deep battle? Regarding the last, yes, that was a dire battle, but not so much that the Elves came and perished (what was the point of that BS?  this is supposed to be the war/time of men), nor that the people of Edoras were down to the three of the Fellowship, the King Denethor and maybe three others to fight, and then to go down the stairs on horseback through overbelievable Ura-kai.  They did a poor job introducing Elfhelm or the Rhohirrim at all.  You know those dudes on horses at the end?  That was them.  They made Edoras and Rhohan in general look stupid and divided.<br/><br/>All in all, still I loved the movie because it is a delight.  I almost wish that I did not read the books.

","The Two Towers was a *good* movie. I say that to emphasize that it was not a *great* movie by any means. The Fellowship of the Ring was gorgeous, intelligent, well paced, and exciting. The Two Towers is less gorgeous, less intelligent (often embarrassingly scripted), horrendously paced, and it frequently drags. This is not to say it is a bad film, but it is hardly best picture material, and it is a good step down from Fellowship. Don't listen to the excessive praises or the excessive criticisms. The Two Towers is often beautiful, magical, and poetic. Unfortunately it is just as frequently dull, illogical, and full of clichés. Some of the effects are phenomenal, while some are borderline awful--the sort of thing one would see in a mid-eighties fantasy film. Especially bad were the scenes with Treebeard carrying the hobbits on his shoulder, with obvious green-screen backgrounds rolling by as the hobbits bobbed up and down in a way not at all like Treebeard's stride (which in itself was obviously an effect). But great films are not made of great effects, and the story comes first. While a great deal of the narrative problems can be attributed to the ""middle chapter syndrome"", still more are the result of poor scriptwriting and poo r direction. TTT seemed rushed, as though all the pieces for a great film were there, but they were assembled improperly. Conclusions were hurried, while some loose-ends were never tied up (and I'm not referring to events which will be resolved in the final chapter... I'm speaking on a smaller scale). I got the feeling that, in Fellowship, Jackson wanted to convince us of the reality of this world, while in TTT he assumed that he didn't have to. The whole Ring mythology didn't seem as gelled in this installment. It's an abstract complaint it's true, but I've been assured it's a valid one.<br/><br/>But don't let me discourage Ring lovers from seeing the film. If you liked Fellowship, you'll probably dig TTT. If you didn't, you won't be won over with this installment. It's good folks, but great it ain't.<br/><br/>7/10"

","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has strayed from Tolkien's novel in this part of the adaption, for better or for worse. It's not surprising that viewers who've read the book don't like this. What is surprising, though, is what appears to be the shared interpretation of some of the changes: that Faramir is turned into a baddie, Theoden into a fool and a coward and that the Ents are somehow ""tricked"" into war with Saruman. I couldn't see anything remotely like it up on the screen, and I'm going to try to rebutt the ""Bad Faramir"" view here.<br/><br/>Faramir as portrayed in the movie seemed to me be a man in a fantastically complicated situation; he's commanding his country's rearguard in a desperate war, and is suddenly stuck with three beings of unknown species, to say nothing of allegiances. Of course interrogates them rather sharply; he did in the book, too. When he finds that they're bearing the Ring, he has his father's orders - on pain of death - to bring it to Gondor. He commits treason when he doesn't. On the other hand he sees the effects of the Ring on Frodo,  right in front of him. He's in grief for his brother and is told of Boromir's treachery, can he be blamed if he doesn't want to believe it? And of course the ring affects him, it affects everybody. Tolkien made all this clear from the beginning, Jackson dramatizes it by only gradually revealing his true character. He makes Faramir a mystery to both the hobbits and to the audience, who might easily believe him to be evil. However, in the end his true value is revealed: as he says to Frodo: ""now we finally understand one another"". This becomes a double climax in the movie: plot-wise in that the whole future of Middle-Earth hangs on Faramir's decision, and morally in that Faramir stands true where his brother failed, thus indicating that mankind might itself stay true after all. Yes, this is somewhat different than Tolkien's Faramir, and one might quarrel with that. But to speak of a ""Bad Faramir"" seems to me to be nonsense."

","Overall it was a good adaptation of the book, I felt the second book of the series was boring in comparison to the rest, so it was good to see Peter Jackson take some directors license and play with the story a little bit to good effect, although in a few scenes not so much.<br/><br/>The excellent landscapes of New Zealand, the faithful recreation of middle earth, the convincing acting, the fabulous CGI creation of gollum, and fantastic battle scenes all culminate in a great movie. a lot of work went into this movie and it really shows.<br/><br/>the only problem with the movie was how the story is delivered, considering the size of the book scenes have to be summarised and dialogue is sometimes lacking between characters as the film rushes along to finish the story.<br/><br/>in my opinion it was better than fellowship, even though i prefered the fellowship book, and i found it rather fresh to find the story slightly altered so I did not know exactly what was going to happen.<br/><br/>cant wait for ROTK, its the best one in the series"

","I saw Two Towers for the second time today and have totally changed my mind about the movie. After the first viewing I found the changes from the book incredibly jarring and unnecessary. I rated it 5/10. As one who has read the books about seven times over a twenty year period the first viewing was like watching a very expensive train crash. It seemed distant and unfamiliar, perhaps because I had watched the FOTR DVDs too many times. However, as I knew what changes to expect the second time I could enjoy the movie for what it was and it was fantastic. Sure the  changes were many but the essence of the book was there. It had the right feel. If you are a purist and you hated the movie do yourself a favor. Open your mind and see it again. Don't fight it, just let it flow. Don't force yourself to like it. My only real gripe. Someone other than Gimli should have been the voice of Treebeard - it sounded way too much the same.Is Brian Blessed still acting. He would have been awesome. Still a 9/10"
"bjorn27","Null","0","0","27 December 2002"," The right choices..
","In his latest film, New Zealand's Peter Jackson has given us the Two Towers we wanted and deserved: rich, harsh, violent, alive, green, black and grey. Middle-Earth looms large as the greatest world the movies have yet given us. The fighting here is fiercer - there is sublime pleasure in the sight of lopped-off, muddy Orc heads arching end over end, of Uruk-hai spilling inky blood on the ruined walls of Helm's Deep. Hoo boy! Killing, in the noble name of all that is good and right in the world, has never looked more bad-ass and cool!<br/><br/>But the greatest battle scenes in recent film history are only part of the pleasure: Jackson skillfully juxtaposes the scenes at Helm's Deep with Frodo and Sam's funereal march to the lands of Sauron and with the triumphant march of the Ents against the foul and mechanical forces of Saruman. Frodo's passivity is punctuated by opaque rages, and there is great suspense in his own struggle and his struggle with the blighted creature Gollum (likewise in Gollum's self-struggle). The suspense in this film is of the best kind - it doesn't hinge on gradual revelation of plot points (besides, most of us know the plot backwards by now); instead, the suspense originates in identification, what could be called moral suspense. Middle-Earth is our world too, clearly allegorical (despite what Tolkien says) to our own struggles with technology, the dark, extrinsic forces of religious fundamentalism and the darker, intrinsic forces of our own nature. The Ring is attuned to both. Frodo is us, in his seemingly hopeless battle to retain his self, against the endless will and variety of evil arrayed against and within him.<br/><br/>The scenes with the Ents have been criticized on structural grounds, because they slow down the pace of the other two narratives. That is their weakness; their strength is that they provide respite from the otherwise demoralizing palette of grey, brown and black. The Ents, in the absence of a noble, good-humoured Faramir, provide the note of life and hope, and remind us that all nature rebels against the dominion of Sauron. A stirring theme, this one of nature vs. technology. Today, it is still a great, grim battle, and like the struggles in Tolkien's world, it takes place in the larger world and in us."
"paulb-16","Null","0","0","28 December 2002"," A disappointing but stunningly visual film!
","Tolkien's plot, language and character have been displaced by Jackson's concept of drama and finding a point to end his own second instalment to make it a stand alone package. I believe that on this point alone the film falls down and that the book finished at dramatically natural points which could have provided a better break. For me, this movie should have ended when the book ended, ie after we have reconciled what will happen to Saruman and when Frodo encounters Shelob. From a dramatical point of view, that would leave the return of Saruman in Part 3 is all the more suprising, and it is similar to the deaths (ie. of Gandalf and Boromir) that end part 1. Much has been said about Faramir, but can I add that the langauge of the exchange between Frodo and he at Henneth Annun in the book was moving and compelling. It was neutered in the movie. The Faramir/Frodo encounter is a fundamental symbol of hope for what Frodo is trying to do and for the role that men can still play in assisting him. This is the single most important thing to happen to Frodo in all of the Two Towers (allowing for the fact that Shelob appears in the book of the Two Towers). Jackson's Faramir is not the Faramir I know. The ents likewise are the oldest of living things in middle earth. They knew everything that went on in and around Fangorn. True it is that Merry and Pippin are like a breath of fresh air to Fangorn however and lead them to the action that they ultimatley take, however it was not a case of them being tricked into acting, as the movie implies. The ents decised for themselves that they will intervene. That being said the language of the ents, the lists of creatures, the songs they sing; are all completely missing. I was most impressed however by the visual effect of their sacking of Isengard. Aragorn - a ridiculous sub-plot involving he and Arwen; it simply doesn't work. Theoden. There is no suggestion in the book that he was possessed by Saruman, ie that Saruman could hear and speak with Gandalf when he arrived at Meduseld. He decided for himself that he will cast-off Grima and confront the situation facing Rohan. I can however accept using Eomer in place of Erkenbrand to break the seige of Helm's Deep, however the thought that Rohan alone + Gandalf could win that battle is at odds with the book and the whole premise of the film. If that was the case why did they not take them on in the forst place. Clealry the ents saved Rohan, and this was simply ignored. Overall, unlike the first film, little of the beatiful Tolkein languge is to be found in this film. The visuals, the Balrog/Gandalf fight, Sauron, The Black Tower, and the black Gate were all the stars of the film. They make it worth seeing."

","I hold back on giving LOTR a perfect or excellent rating not because of any special flaws but because of inherent traits mostly.  LOTR Two Towers is a good movie that people who don't mind seeing violence should see.  However LOTR is not a great movie because it is an adaption of a previous work. While that work was a book, and the director Peter Jackson does change a few things it is not as technically tough to create the content of LOTR as it might have been for the Coen brothers to create Fargo.  This is why I like movies Youjinbou by Akira Kurosawa, yes Youjinbou is the correct romanization of the Kanji, better than Gone With the Wind.  I will of course applaud Jackson's ability to use special effects, but using special effects as a judge of movie quality on a general scale would tend to modern movies or higher budget movies.  Jackson's only other mistake in my mind comes with some of the dialogue that ends the movie it feels a little cliche and off in an otherwise well-paced movie."

"gusmcrae","10","0","0","2 January 2003"," Gripping film that lives up to the first despite complaints
","Having seen THE TWO TOWERS I found myself fairly speechless.  The movie delighted me.  I thought I'd have an impossible time sitting through a three hour movie (even though I loved the first).  I found myself to not be bored or even confused throughout the entire time.  That in itself is an accomplishment.  Peter Jackson did an amazing job of keeping the storyline clear amongst all the action.  Often it's easy to lose track of what's going on, but TTT really avoided that problem.  Overall I give it a 10/10.  I realize a perfect rating is probably not the wisest to give.  Because I have yet to see THE RETURN OF THE KING, I do not know if TTT is really the best of the trilogy.  I did enjoy it even more than THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, if that is possible, though that movie is tremendously enjoyable too.<br/><br/>I'd like to comment on some of the other comments I've read.  Regarding Erowen's large role in the film compared to the book.  I have yet to read the books, so I can't really compare her place in each.  I do think it's probably a shame that so much time was devoted to developing her relationship with Aragorn, causing much else to be left out.  It stinks when movies add characters/create new events...but this is an adaptation of the books.  Sometimes things in the books have to change to make sense on the screen.  And sometimes Hollywood wants to flesh out interesting characters/scenarios that they think will play well on the screen, such as has been done with the trilogy.  Also, this film lacks the character development that I thought it would have.  Frodo clearly is slipping more and more into the evil grips of the ring, but that is not nearly as explored as it was in the first film.  None of the other characters are explored as much either, although Gimli is given a chance to show his sense of humor (I do hope we get to see some depth in Legolas too, although the cold/distant feeling he gives off is really rather appropriate for an elf).  These are issues with the movie, but seeing as how it was able to accomplish as much as it did in the time it did, they are easy to set somewhat aside.<br/><br/>Regardless of the many changes that have been made, I think the films are excellent.  I am waiting in great anticipation for the final movie.  I can hardly imagine how I'll stand waiting a year!  I guess that's what the novels are for, right??<br/><br/>I recommend these movies to anyone over the age of 10 or so.  They are great adventure stories.  They're a little heavy on the violence at times, but outside of a few unique moves made by Legolas (i.e. when he mounts the moving horse, when he 'skateboards' down the stairs, jumps on the cave troll's head), the violance does not seem so stylized or glorified even, as it does in most movies.  TTT is a film worthy of Tolkien's novels.  I'm sure the changes would have pained him some, but seeing the characters come to life as fully as they did, seeing Middle Earth become such a reality, is truly breathtaking, something Tolkien might have appreciated as well."

","When the Fellowship came out, I did not think it would be possible to top that film, and I was right. But the Two Towers is a mighty film in its own right, although you definitely need the first installment to understand what is going on. But then, Peter Jackson has always said that it is one huge film divided into three parts. I have seen this one twice and was very impressed by the way they were able to seriously move away from Tolkien´s TEXT, and at the same time seriously honor Tolkien´s SPIRIT. Sure, the Warg battle was not in that same spot in the book, but it was in the book AND in The Hobbit. Sure, Faramir was very unlike his brother in the book, but admit it, he was a rather talky, boring character in The Two Towers book. This has been amended in the film, for it to work as a FILM. Great work there, and it never bothered me - and I have read the books about 35 times, in several languages. Gollum is just so breathtaking. I could not believe it was all CGI, but apparently it is. Incredible, simply incredible. Let us put to rest the old Yoda - he´s using a cane anyway. Except when fighting, of course. Great movie, cannot wait to see The Return of the King."

But there was some problems. It was too quick, if you haven't read the book, you'll hardly understand anything. There wasn't very much character development. And the biggest problem: THERE WAS NO BOSS! You understand me. In the first movie we have the Balrog, in the ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"" -  the Basilisk, in ""Attack of the Clones"" - Darth Tyrannus.

"UltramarineX","10","0","0","27 December 2002"," The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is one of the best movies I have seen since The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring!
","(Possible, minor spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Ring (which was part 1 of the Lord of the Rings trilogy) exceeded every expectation I had. The acting was superb, especially performances by Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood, the music were fantastic, and the special effects were a visual feast. Therefore, I was expecting a lot from The Two Towers. I wanted The Two Towers to capture all the great qualities of the first movie, and if at all possible to exceed the standard of greatness set by the first movie. Did The Two Towers accomplish this task? Of course it did! The Two Towers is an amazing movie!<br/><br/>Now, for those of you who want to go see the Two Towers, but have not yet seen the Fellowship of the Ring, I strongly recommend you do so right away. The Two Towers spends little time re-introducing you to the characters and storyline of this series, and as such will likely confuse any newcomers. Now some people may dislike that fact, but I think it was the right decision, because the movie drops right into the action, which gives the story of The Two Towers more forward momentum than the Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>As in the first movie, the acting in The Two Towers was great, but the stand out actor in this movie was Andy Serkis, who played (and supplied the voice) to the character of Gollum. Gollum is a creature with a duel personality, which is torn between helping the main character, Frodo, on his quest to destroy the One Ring, and taking the ring for himself. Serkis portrays this aspect of Gollum quite well, and I think his performance is worthy of Oscar consideration.<br/><br/>But, the best thing about The Two Towers would have to be the exceptionally well done battle of Helm's Deep. If you like battle scenes such as those seen in movies like Gladiator and Braveheart, prepare to be blown away. The sheer scale of the battle, which features an army of 10,000 orc warriors, is sure to delight and impress anyone who sees it.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the first half of the movie has a few slow spots, but they are quickly forgotten by the end of the movie. Fans of the Fellowship of the Ring will not be disappointed, and even those who did not like the first movie, may change their minds about the series after seeing The Two Towers. It is my favourite movie of the year, and it should be considered a contender for an Oscar. Kudos to director Peter Jackson for another fine movie.<br/><br/>I give The Two Towers 10/10!"
"rogus","10","0","0","27 December 2002"," Overall, the hell of a movie
","I think the first thing that must be said is that The Two Towers is a better movie than The Fellowship of The Ring. Which I think is the hell of a compliment, because i loved The Fellowship and watched it seven times so far. But it is a worse adaptation of Tolkien´s work, I think, and although some adaptations are understandable, others I think are totally unnecessary, like Aragorn´s near death and Faramir taking Sam and Frodo to Osgliath. I´m not familiar with the maps to know if that even works geographically. I think the time spent in these scenes could be better used for showing Pippin and Merry´s relationship with the Ents, at least have them drinking the water that would make them grow bigger than any other hobbit. Other thing that could have spent more time in screen was the destruction of Isengard by the ents, which plays a fundamental role but is only used as background scene for a Sam´s speech.<br/><br/>But what I can say is that after having seen TTT only one time, I can´t make my mind whether I prefer this movie or the first, because TTT is a fantastic movie, with fantastic action scenes, a good dosis of tension and of humor. I can say that I am thoroughly satisfied, although we Tolkien-fans always hope for the most faithful adpatation possible. There was a time in the movie when Arwen and Elrond and Galadriel show up that you just think, was it written in their contracts that everybody had to appear in all the movies?<br/><br/>I expect to see TTT yet another many times, but we must difer, one thing is the book, and another one is the movie...I think that Peter Jackson is doing a great job after all. And I can hardly wait for The Return of the King!"

However, it is a shame that such a superb film, crafted by devoted film-makers, is picked apart by some of the comments made within this forum. It is certainly true to say that there are very minor points of criticism that can be levelled against it. But taken against the film as a whole they are largely irrelevant. When I go to see a film I want to be thoroughly entertained and moved by the experience. This film, and FOTR, achieved that. I did not, and never do for that matter, go with the intention of seeking out every minor fault in a film. If I did that, there would be very few that I would enjoy. The nitpickers are a pretty sad bunch and I do wonder whether they set out with the assumption that they would not enjoy the film before seeing it. I have read the book several times over the past 30 years, and despite the diversions, PJ has fully captured the essence of the world Tolkein created. That is one hell of an achievement, and I have no doubt that after ROTK this trilogy will go down in history as one of the landmarks of film history."

","SLAUGHTERED! Tolkien would sue from his grave if he saw this film! This is an exact description of what the filmakers did to J. R. R. Tolkien's masterpiece! In order for the film to become liked from the general public, the film was made in to a typical action love story. Poor Aragorn became a punching bag by adding all the extra action with the woolf riders! The book had a nice flow of events that was disturbed by the extra footage on the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen. The battle of Helm's deep was a tragedy since the director thought that it would sell more if the elves sent reinforcements while he increased the orc force to 10,000. Another deviation from the book was Frodo's trip to Osgiliath. This was totaly unnecessary ( i think they did that to increase the film's length) and as an effect it had the total destruction of Faramir's character ( HE didnt try to take the ring away, instead Frodo offered it to him and he denied). In the book, Faramir was meant to right the wrong his brother made ( i see him as a good version of Boromir). I think that you had enough of my wining so I will talk about the film's positive side. The Ents where GREAT! The film caught their characteristics perfectly! The gate of Mordor was GREAT! And finally the oliphant was nice!

That being said, I gave the movie a perfect 10 and can only make positive comments about the movie.<br/><br/>First, it is impossible to say that this movie was either better or worse than LOTR/Fellowship of the Rings, because both movies served different purposes.  The first movie devoted much of it's time setting up the story, establishing characters, and familiarizing the viewer with the world of Middle Earth.  The second movie was able to move the entire story along. The much more ""action"" nature of the second movie was probably a result of this.  In addition, the Two Towers book also has much more action than the first.  Therefore, those differences in the movies can be explained.<br/><br/>Second, just like everyone else on the planet, I would concur that the special effects were amazing (although most of my amazement was with the Gollum and character - versus the Helm's Deep battle).  The Battle of Pellanor Fields will be incredible!<br/><br/>Third, the acting was the part of the movie that really kept me in the story.  Lots of movies have big action and cannot keep your attention. The performances by Viggio Mortenson, Bernard Hill, Brad Dourif, and Elijah Wood were very solid.<br/><br/>Anyway, many people much more eloquent than me have waxed on about this movie.  This was a very good time.  If the purpose of the middle act of trilogy is to set up the grand finale, this movie was a complete success. However, it was also an entertaining evening in and of itself."

But no movie can truly capture the feeling and human quality of the books.  <br/><br/>The battle sequences were not emotionally engaging.  And the orcs are too ""over-the-top"" scary for my taste.

A few examples:  Wormtongue (cheesy I thought), Faramir (big deal, he's Boromir's brother, who excuses the captured hobbits before you find out too much about him), the Oliphant (in the movie, as I recall, the first time we see it is when Sam says ""Look the Oliphant""... who cares).   A way this could have been done better in my opinion, would have been to introduce things properly and give them a little time to grow on the screen.   This would add a little time to the film, but some heli-cam shots from afar could easily be edited out in an effort to develop the characters a little bit better.   Character development could be tightened.<br/><br/>And Gollum, cheesy in my eyes.   As cool as Yoda was in Episode 2.  Oh and Gollum, he's probably the best villain in modern literature... Because he evokes sympathy among viewers/readers... A human emotion that we can all relate to.   He represents the dark side of man... Addiction and acting upon that addiction.   Not sure that the filmakers captured that concept.<br/><br/>All aside, if you've read the novel, you should not like the ending of this film as I don't.  :)"

","Why don't they make producers put disclaimers on movie posters like they do with cigarettes and prescription drugs that could have potentially negative side effects? Something like ""Based very loosely on the book of the same title but don't get your hopes up"" would have been appreciated. Then at least I could have waited for the DVD rental and not been duped out of the full price of a movie ticket. I felt really cheated after having seen this Disneyfied crapfest that relied heavily on special effects to give it the momentum it otherwise lacked. People who love literature just need to get used to the fact that American filmakers will never trust the American public enough to make a film that is true to the literature that inspired the film. If you don't have a problem with not being true to the original creation then this ranks up there with any other special effects extravaganza. This film lacked the passion and the nobility of the book. The characters said and did things that were not in the book and that went completely against the grain of the book. On a positive note, I'm glad Tolkein himself didn't have to see this parody. He would have been insulted."

","Seriously, the greatest movie I have seen in the past 15 years.  Amazingly well acted, and not one character was left without that opportunity.  One can say that Viggo Mortensen just rocked this film, and with the subtly and sheer understated quality of his acting became the movie's heart and soul, and made every woman swoon at the same time.  Finally, we have returned to the screen the humble, quiet, real manly hero it has been desperately looking for for a very long time.  He's up there with the greats and I am absolutely psyched for the next film.<br/><br/>The CGI, animation, and total look of this unpretty fairy tale, was beyond perfection, and Peter Jackson is a genius.  Ian McKellan, of course, gave the film a class ""A"" in acting, and everyone else kept up their paces, from all the hobbits to Elijah Wood.  Just the most perfect film for what it says, how it looked, the acting, the drama, and even the slight comic quality at moments never went overboard to make this ever campy.  Very seldom does any film HAVE IT ALL, this one does. This one does.  One must see this film at least two times to intake all of it, seriously, you miss so much on just one viewing.  It's almost too much greatness at one time on that screen. A MUST SEE, and if you haven't seen the first in this trilogy I have a question, ""Are you living in a cave?""  :~)"
"ptwomey","10","0","0","26 December 2002"," A True Cinematic Masterpiece
","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is without any doubt the ultimate showcase of how good cinema can get. Not only is Towers a worthy extenstion of the first instalment, Fellowship, but it is a stand alone thrill ride of cinematic genius.<br/><br/>Without warning, without any form of reminder or any chance of catching ones breath, Peter Jackson thrusts us right back into the world of middle-earth and right back into his daring and exciting form of film-making. Unlike most sequals (I guess you can't really call this a sequal) Towers is a completely different and unique film from the first. Towers presents a darker more unforgiving Mddle-earth and is unquestionably a war epic of truly incredible proportions.<br/><br/>Watching the film the energy that oozes off the screen in the extremely fast paced and action packed three hours gives you a bizz that many people would relate as the feeling they had when watching The Empire Strikes Back for the first time all those years ago. The chemistry between each character, aided undoubtedly by the first film is electric and every scene serves to advance the film in a positive and entertaining direction. One weeps at the sheer brilliance of the films complex construction and near perfect cinematic execution. This is the stuff dreams are made of, this is the stuff that shapes the way forward in the future of film.<br/><br/>Towers is not without flaw, with a screen time limit of three hours much of the book has been cut and changed much to the displeasure of many fans and purists. Still the film stands alone all by itself as grand cinema regardless of how prescious the book is. There are some very obvious computer aided effects, especially when watching the Ents, but these are over shadowed by the sheer joy derived form the events on screen. Peter succeeds where most special effects directors fail, he suspends disbelief so that even the most fake of creations is missed as the audience gets sucked into the events on screen. Speaking of special effects, Gollum/Smeagol will undoubtedly go down in history as the very first succesful completely computer generated characters on film. Yes he is obviously created by a computer, but he looks far better than anything else that has ever been presented and the character itself is an absolute treat and completely steels the show. The emotional high point of the film is stolen by Gollum in his two he scenes where he speaks quite disturbingly to himself as each other alter ego.<br/><br/>The acting is all very sifficient and definately above average for any film of this style. Special credits should go to Brad Dourif as Wormtounge who is as evil and cunning as the genius of Peters vision, Elijah as Frodo and Sean as Sam who as a pair make for a great on screen plutonic chemistry defining a lost art of male comradeship, and of course Any Serkis as Gollum.<br/><br/>
The film is often very light hearted as John-Rhys Davis discards his sombre Dwarf character Gimli from the first film and settles in as the comic-relief, this is a sharp contrast to the films very dark themes. People die, limbs are hacked, the world falls apart around them, but all the while Peter remains focussed on the task at hand and delivers Tolkiens message with the edge that only he can.<br/><br/>The Films three climaxes, the Battle of Helm's Deep, the Trashing of isengard and the Siege at Osgilith would all be a single fitting end to any epic film, and then the film leaves you breathless and wanting more... Such torture - if the ending to Fellowship had you wanting more, this willhave you tearing out the seats at the cinema in riot that you have to wait another year... Still to behold the scene at Helm's Deep will be enough, no words can describe this except to say that it is the biggest most spectacular battle on screen and will not fail tpo satify.<br/><br/>These films are looking to be the defining trilogy of this century and are certainly groundbreaking near perfect cinema. This once weeped for a good portion of the film, I can only hope the experience is as good as that for everyone else. Peter Jackson, Heres to you and yours!"

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** A disappointment after the Fellowship, although likely enough to be enjoyed by those who haven't read the book.<br/><br/>First the good news, the stuff that was written by Tolkein has been treated really well. The action sequences are spectacular, the flying Nazgul better than I imagined, and Gollum is the best bit of CG animation ever. Gollum's schizophrenia is dealt with superbly, as is his relationship with Frodo.<br/><br/>Given the head-start into the film (the first chapter of the book is dealt with at the end of Fellowship), it would have been nice to get to the end of it. Peter J now has to compress a lot of missed storyline plus the whole of the Return into the final film. So why all the new material?<br/><br/>Stuff I could have done without:<br/><br/>(1) The Arwen/Elrond/Galadriel dream sequences. They are not in the book and add nothing to the film. I assume Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are on three-film contracts so they needed something to do.<br/><br/>(2) The use of Gimli as a butt of humour. I thought the Terry Pratchett material about not telling the difference between male and female dwarves was particularly out-of-place.<br/><br/>(3) Gandalf quoting Churchill, ""The battle for France is over. The Battle of Britain is about to start"" (substitute Helm's Deep and Middle Earth)<br/><br/>(4) The misinterpretation of Faramir, and the abduction of Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath.  As played, Faramir is just a slightly less competent version of Boromir, with the same character flaws. The point of Tolkein's Faramir is that he is different from Boromir, with no ambition to use the Ring.<br/><br/>Stuff I would like to have seen (basically the rest of the book):<br/><br/>(1) The meeting with Merry and Pippin at Isengard, which would have given closure to one of the open issues at the end of Fellowship<br/><br/>(2) Frodo and Sam's encounter with Shelob, which would allow their sequence to finish with the same cliffhanger that Tolkein wrote<br/><br/>(3) Gimli's argument with Eomer about the beauty of Galadriel<br/><br/>(4) The bonding between Gimli and Legolas, and their discussions about the relative beauty of mines and forests. Sorry Peter, only 6 out of 10, could do better."

","As one who has always wanted a top-quality movie adaptation of LOTR, I must say that Peter Jackson et al did a near perfect job.<br/><br/>Spoilers, ya hear? SPOILERS!!!!!!<br/><br/>The scenes were done with consumate artistry, the acting is terrific, the special effects are damned convincing and the score is excellent, though I'd have recommended atonal music for the bad guys. The battle with the Balrog vies with the first movie's outstanding beginning. The giant elephants, the trolls opening the gate (I thought trolls turned to stone in sunshine. Maybe they're given sunblock...) and of course the Ents are fantastic achievements. It's obvious that Gollum is drawn, but what a character! My brother, who isn't familiar with the books, found him to be among the most fascinating characters he's ever seen.<br/><br/>Gandalf's wink was priceless, Aragorn and Legolas are perfectly cast, Gimli's buffoonery might offend purists but is well within the director's acceptable licence, Frodo (Wood) is proving to be a fine actor. Much of the dialogue, which could so easily fall flat, is pulled off extremely well. Elrond's (who up till then tended towards overacting) talk with his daughter, blended with the images of an aging Elessar (Aragorn), is memorable, on the level of a similar monologue by Al Pacino in ""Devil's Advocate"". Of the other hobbits, Pippin's Pythonesque absurdity (credit to Mr. Beare) is more irritating than endearing, but you can't like them all. And who doesn't like the great Christopher Lee - wotta villain!!! There's even Aragorn's romantic interest, pitting elf against human, that is vicariously titillating a number of nerds I know.<br/><br/>The wheels could easily have fallen off this movie with all its disparate and outlandish elements. They didn't.<br/><br/>My only problems are with Tolkien's affectations. A couple days' flight by a giant eagle dropping the ring in the fire would be less risky, would have saved time and thousands of lives - but then there wouldn't be a story, would there? Sparing Wormtongue allowed him to give counsel that resulted in hundreds (only??) of deaths (though also resulting in the routing of a vast army). The horses running through those spears was a stretch. Airlifting Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas into the middle of the 10,000 strong army (though a statistical pixel-analysis reveals the number to be approximately 47,350, but this can be attributed to over-zealous rogue computer agency) as it was leaving Isengard would have allowed those three, under divine (read: Tolkien) protection, to decimate the bad guys. At a kill rate of about 300 per hour, the entire army would have been wiped out in a day and a half. When any of these three are out in the open, enemy arrows mysteriously cease to exist. In the first instalment, a single Uruk-Hai was almost too much for Aragorn; now an *injured* Aragorn among Uruk-Hai is like a Tasmanian Devil with razor blades among paper dolls. Oh well, after all it's mythology. I still think the books and the movies are high points in their respective artforms. Looking forward to ROTK."

","I am not a Tolkien purist and so I found the movie to be very good. Not as good as the ""Fellowship"" though. The reason is obvious. The ""Fellowship"" developed the characters and set the story. It introduced us to a new mythology and by doing this it created cinematic awe. The ""Two Towers"" book mainly describes action. It describes who goes where and who does what. It was expected that a movie describing the events in this book would not be as exciting as the first part. For this reason director Peter Jackson added his own ""inventions"" into the story and by doing this he made mortal enemies among the J. R. R. Tolkien fans. <br/><br/>I would say Peter Jackson's effort was fair enough. However, what he could have done was to invent a totally new cinematic style for telling the Tolkien story in the big screen. The new cinematic style would help him adapt the book without any alterations. Instead Jackson followed the well known action style of the Star Wars and Braveheart movies. I do not know if the outcome would be better if Peter Jackson had done differently. Perhaps his choices were right on target. Bottom line: Well done. Let's wait for the ""Return of the King""."

So in most theatres, you're bound to be sitting near a group of people who dragged a friend to this and have to explain what's going on throughout the film (eg. the show we saw had someone trying to explain why Frodo is important to the story even though his character has virtually nothing to do with the events depicted in Two Towers.)<br/><br/>I might only have given this film a 2, but for the fact that the scenes with the Ents were actually reasonably done.<br/><br/>Summary: For fans of Tolkien only."

","I've read the books in the same near-religious manner as Christopher Lee since I was about six years old (thank heavens for parents that take the time to teach their children literacy). So for the better part of twenty years, I have been immersed in the world of Tolkien and his characters. The simple fact of the matter is that while this film takes a lot of liberties with the novel, for which it cannot honestly be blamed, it does so for the overall good of the story.<br/><br/>The novel is often a confused tome. Events in it take days and even weeks, and it feels so when reading the damned thing. In spite of being the shortest volume in the series, The Two Towers takes the longest time to read. Partly because very little happens in it, but mostly because Tolkien's habit of describing his characters a little less than the falling leaves is in full swing. Even some of the most literate and knowledgeable people I've met who are reading the book for the first time find themselves flipping back and forth through the pages, trying to determine exactly who the hell this or that new character is.<br/><br/>I also find it pretty amusing when people who cannot spell Arwen's name, a name that is probably one of the simplest in the Tolkien world, presume to critique the films for making more out of her romance with Aragorn than is mentioned in the novels. This is actually a very good move. All we read about Arwen is a few sentences (if that) in The Fellowship Of The Ring, then maybe a chapter or two in The Return Of The King. The appendices explain a bit more (and numerous elements of them appear in this film), but Tolkien erred in giving us no reason whatsoever to believe that Aragorn would choose a seemingly docile Elf-woman over a valiant human princess as his wife. The film fixes this by making Arwen the strong, determined character she should always have been.<br/><br/>Now where do I begin in describing the film? My only problems with it are that there is a tad too much jump-cutting, and the visuals can sometimes give the viewer a headache during the battles. But aside from these problems, I was more than pleasantly surprised. Elrond stops telling people ""YOU must do this, YOU must destroy that"", drops the almighty pretense, and questions himself as to whether he is doing the right thing by leaving Middle-Earth while it is in such peril. And where do I begin with Gollum? We've all seen how all-digital characters can really distract from a film before, thanks to George Lucas, but Gollum is so well-made it is almost as if he really existed and the crew just photographed him. He gets the hook into the audience right from the get-go - he is so treacherous and bitter, but so sad and pathetic at the same time, that one fears seeing how he became what he is rather than what he might do to our heroes.<br/><br/>Treebeard and his fellow Ents are little different. They look so real, and yet so unreal, that they completely sell the world of Tolkien to the viewer. Seeing the early stage of their battle in Isengard, I fully understood the meaning of one of the Sindarin themes in the score music. The English translation given in the lyrics sheet reads something like ""The forest has declared war"", and by the time the film is over, you will feel it is quite the understatement. Speaking of the score music, Gollum's Song is enough to bring tears to the eyes. With lyrics like ""Don't say I didn't try"" or ""We are lost, we can never go home"", it puts the viewer/listener in Gollum's hobbit-feet and makes one feel how it is to shake on them for a while.<br/><br/>You might want to skip the next paragraph if you don't want to ruin any surprises.<br/><br/>At first I was a bit perplexed by the ending. The novel ends with Shelob poisoing Frodo and Frodo being taken by Orcs while Sam takes the Ring and makes a solemn vow to complete the quest, while the film simply ends with Gollum muttering to himself about how ""she"" will take care of those nasty, tricksy little Hobbitses. However, this is actually a great note to end the film on, as it leaves the audience hanging in anticipation - the literate ones anticipating how Shelob will be realised, and those who haven't read the book wondering what Gollum is on about now. And more than anything, the changes in expression on Gollum's face as the Halfling he used to be argues with the monstrous thing he is now sells the contrast between Frodo's kindness and the monstrous cruelty shown to Gollum by Sam and the Men Of Gondor. As the film ends, and the credits roll over Gollum's song, there isn't a dry eye in the audience.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, skip the inferior imitations and take your children to see this film. They will be grateful in later years that there was a story/film that respected their intelligence and didn't just sit there saying ""goo-goo gaa-gaa"" for two and a half hours at them. Who knows... after reading the novels and seeing these films, your children might even want to grow up to become linguists or the scientists who discover a way to do away with fossil fuel once and for all. Yes, this story, and the film(s), really are that inspiring."
"jmarmaro-1","Null","0","0","26 December 2002"," Great Visuals, disappointing story changes
","While marveling at the astounding visuals presented in ""The Two Towers"", I could not help but be somewhat chagrined at the alterations to the original story line. Having been a Tolkien fan since the mid 1960s, and having read all of his writings, I could not but watch the movie with the hope of seeing a screen rendition to the original book. In the first film, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I was disappointed with the story changes, but saw the wisdom of them in light of the mission of making a movie of reasonable length which would also appeal to those unfamiliar with the original writings. In the second installment, ""The Two Towers"", I expected some abridgement of the story and the occasional addition or alteration for cinematic necessity. However, what I did in fact see, were some wholesale alterations to the story that did not seem to serve any cinematic purpose. The change in the story concerning the actions of the Ents was no shorter or clearer than a true rendering of the story would have been. The same was true with the banishment of Eomer, the relationship between Aragorn and Eowyn and the encounter between Frodo and Faramir (especially Faramir's kidnapping of Frodo to Osgiliath and the ridiculous encounter between Frodo and the flying Ringwraith there). Yes, the evil influence of the ring may have been somewhat more emphatic with the story changes, but this is more than offset by the loss of emphasis on Frodo's role in the story. If you are a fan of Tolkien's vision, I think that you should still go see the movie; changes notwithstanding. It is a visual masterpiece, especially the CGI Gollum. However, I think that it was Roger Ebert (in his review in the ""Chicago Sun Times"") who stated things best: ""To do what he (Peter Jackson) has done in this film must have been awesomely difficult, and he deserves applause, but to remain true to Tolkien would have been more difficult, and braver."""
"steve49er","10","0","0","1 January 2003"," Brings Tolkien's tale to life
","The Two Towers is the middle piece of Tolkien's masterful fantasy, The Lord of the Rings.  Although written to entertain children, this story becomes PG-13 entertainment on the screen.  This section of the author's tale is actually many stories in one.  Following the first installment, The Fellowship, it continues to follow the surviving characters as they now move along different paths.  Differing but related plots involve two seperated pair of Hobbits, one pair moving toward evil Mordor in an attempt to destroy the ring, the second, captured by the enemy, to eventually escape and take on the battle of one of the two towers.  Other plots involve the transformation of Gandalf the gray wizard into a more powerful being, and the battles for two human cities.  A new character, once known as Gollum is soon recognized as a relative of the Hobbits. Utterly destroyed by long possession of the ring this character truely bears the name Smeagol.  He is a wonderfully digitized character.  It was most difficult to believe that Smeagol was an animation.  The story starts with the continuing battle of Gandalf and the creature in the caves of Moria.  It continues, non stop with action and battle after action and battle.  The war scenes are terrific.  If not a fantasy, these scenes would rate with the battles of Private Ryan.  As with the battle scenes, the entire movie is terrific, rating a strong 5. Hopefully, the academy can allow itself to give a Best Movie Oscar to a show made purely for  entertainment.  If ever a movie didn't disappoint after reading the book, this is it.  A warning however, Two Towers is very graphic.  It may have been written for children, but this director undoubtably made it for those of us that first read it years ago, and  are now adults.  It may give young tots nightmares."

","Hey, I just HAVE to comment on this wonderful film AGAIN to start the new year off. <br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>   I, who am known by my friends and family as a ""Lord of the Rings"" obsessee, went to see this film opening night with high expectations. Peter Jackson did such a wonderful job with the first installment, I felt no need to worry about the second being any worse. I went in shaking like a leaf, full of anticipation and excitement. I left dazed and limp. Like the first film, the special FX are incredible, the acting superb, the landscape breathtaking, the creatures believable, and the sound editing mind-blowing. I must comment specifically on the latter two, using the Ents as an example. Imagine how difficult it would be to pull off a walking, talking, thinking tree. I was more worried about Treebeard being believable, than I was Gollum. I needn't have fretted over it. The floor of the theatre actually rumbled when Treebeard talked, an aspect of his personality and character that Tolkien described vividly in the books. 	 The acting is absorbing, particularly Gollum's fight with his split personality. That was such a powerful and moving scene, my eyes watered. Peter Jackson captured him beautifully, showing that he isn't entirely evil but isn't entirely good, making him an incredibly sad character that twists and tugs at your emotions.

"frodofan00","10","0","0","1 January 2003"," My third comment of this stunning film.
","Hey, I just HAVE to comment on this wonderful film AGAIN to start the new year off. <br/><br/>   I, who am known by my friends and family as a ""Lord of the Rings"" obsessee, went to see this film opening night with high expectations. Peter Jackson did such a wonderful job with the first installment, I felt no need to worry about the second being any worse. I went in shaking like a leaf, full of anticipation and excitement. I left dazed and limp. Like the first film, the special FX are incredible, the acting superb, the landscape breathtaking, the creatures believable, and the sound editing mind-blowing. I must comment specifically on the latter two, using the Ents as an example. Imagine how difficult it would be to pull off a walking, talking, thinking tree. I was more worried about Treebeard being believable, than I was Gollum. I needn't have fretted over it. The floor of the theatre actually rumbled when Treebeard talked, an aspect of his personality and character that Tolkien described vividly in the books. 	 The acting is absorbing, particularly Gollum's fight with his split personality. That was such a powerful and moving scene, my eyes watered. Peter Jackson captured him beautifully, showing that he isn't entirely evil but isn't entirely good, making him an incredibly sad character that twists and tugs at your emotions. His Gollum matches Tolkien's Gollum perfectly. <br/><br/>	 Aragorn giving battle commands in Elvish on the walls of Helm's Deep were also great scenes -- speaking fluently and powerfully, the fierceness in his voice mixed with the determined look in his eyes was thrilling to watch.

"naschaka","Null","0","0","26 December 2002"," Despite pearls of filmmaking, disappointing to the faithful
","I went into Fellowship fully expecting to hate it.  I love the books and have read them countless times and know the plots, characters, and even the back stories from Simarillion.  Therefore, as I had never seen a book-made-movie that didn't butcher the original, I was ready to rant against the movie.  But a funny thing happened: I LOVED IT.  Though there were small changes and even large changes, Fellowship stayed true to the vision of Tolkien and brought the story to life quite fantastically.<br/><br/>Having made all three movies at the same time, I am astounded that Jackson could have hit a homerun with one and failed so miserably (and blatantly) to follow through on Two Towers.  I don't deny that it was visually stunning and, if I hadn't read the books I probably would have adored Towers more than Fellowship.  And I also believe that much of the movie was wonderful and stayed true to Tolkien's vision.  However, there were glaring aberrations that frankly ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>First and foremost was the TERRIBLE portrayal of Faramir's character. The entire plot of that storyline was changed.  Faramir is in Ithilien precisely because he was nothing like his brother Boromir.  He never attempts to take the ring, and in fact in the book he makes a point of saying that he knows how corrupting it is - Faramir as a character is closest to Aragorn in temperament.  He aids Frodo and Sam on their way, despite knowing that his father (Denethor the Steward of Gondor) will hate him for it. Incidentally, the premise that he takes Frodo and Sam all the way to Osgiliath, where the Wraith sees Frodo and Frodo nearly gives him the ring is absurd, as Sauron would have sent every resource at his command to get the ring at that point - Frodo and Sam's only hope is that Sauron doesn't notice them!)<br/><br/>Frankly, I have to say I could have lived much more easily with the other changes: elves at Helm's Deep, the decision to have Aragorn nearly die and appear at the last moment, and the back story of Arwen and Elrond (which ends, bizarrely, with Arwen leaving for the Grey Havens???!!! - I'm interested to see how Jackson extracts her from that), if the prior complaint hadn't made the other changes that more glaring.  Unlike some, I understand why Towers did not end with Shelob and the confrontation between Gandalf and Saruman at Orthanc - Return of the King is actually the shortest of the books in text (much of the printed book is actually appendices), and I find it plausible that these issues can be addressed satisfactorily in the next movie (though, if they are omitted at that point I will be sorely disappointed).<br/><br/>All told, this is a movie that is good for folks who do not remember the book well, have not read the book, and/or don't really care about Tolkien's vision one whit.  I plan to see it again to take it in without the horrified shock I experienced during my first viewing, but I really don't understand why Jackson strayed so far - in many places where the original story added much more depth and would not have detracted from the excitement of the movie or required any additional explanation.<br/><br/>I still hold out hope for the final movie, as there were so many pearls in this movie (the Ent's razing of Orthanc was spectacular, the actors portrayed the characters with passion and heart, Gollum was fantastically conceived, and the schizophrenic nature of the book was nicely woven together), but on the whole I was sorely disappointed."

","After seeing all 3 films, ""Towers"" is my favourite, mainly because of Gollum/Smeagol, brought brilliantly to life by Andy Serkis. The debate scene is the stealer but all his interactions with Frodo & Sam are laudable. (I was disappointed that the ""Sneaking!"" sequence was omitted. It's appears too late in the 3rd film & sadly pales in comparison to the animated version. And the written version, naturally.) I also like Pippin & Treebeard. Unfortunately the other characters don't share the same appeal & I've never been a fan of huge battles. Helm's Deep goes on forever! The Aragon/Arwen relationship doesn't excite either. But Gollum has been an hero of mine, ever since I saw him in the original animated film. Be sure to see that too. 8/10"

","I sympathise with contributors bewailing the changes made to the original text; I too am not completely happy about that! I accept, however,the film maker's right to make changes for technical and practical reasons. I have been most worried so far by the decision to radically alter the story line, vis a vis Frodo and Sam's dealings with Captain Faramir (my most favourite character in the book!); his character has been much diminished. More importantly maybe, I dislike the supposed need for Faramir to decide to send the Ring to Minas Tirith; and the scene which has Frodo actually offering the Ring to the leader of the Nazgul seemed ridiculous,I thought! I've read Peter Jackson's thoughts on the subject but am not convinced! Having read the book each autumn/fall for at least twenty five years, I confess to settled attitudes to the story, and gradiose plot variations do take some swallowing! Having griped, I must compliment all the actors, and production team on what is a truly wonderful film. Aragorn and Gollu seem particularly well realized.  It seems unfair to pick ANY characters from so many, but I thought those two particularly splendid!"

","...mainly that characters took a back seat to action and special effects to the follow up. Not once in this film did I get involved with the plight of any human characters in this film unlike the first one which provided ample characterization. Its almost like every critic who said that Fellowship was too long and boring was listened to. Action was piled upon action upon action leaving scenes like Theoden crying over the grave of his recently dead son, or Wormtongue's obsession of Eoeowyn unexamined. Scenes like Legolas predicting doom at Helms Deep or the death of Haldir amongst the fallen elves had little of the impact that it should have had. Even Christopher Lee who was very effective in FOTR was given little if nothing to do in this film. The only character I had any interest in watching was the CGI Gollum who with the combination of Andy Serkis's performance, writing, and computer wizardry turned out to be the best actor in the movie. Just watch the Spiderman like scene where he argues with himself over betraying Sam and Frodo, or the one after he is captured by Faramir and try to tell me any of the characters showed that much depth. I didn't see any. If Jackson is smart he will provide a different extended cut which builds upon the characters instead of the action sequences. Well to take a breath from my complaints, I still did enjoy the film. There is a lot of good action to be had throughout the film, including the use of Warg riders of Isengard, and the eventual attack upon Helms Deep. Of special note is the use of Gimli who effectively lightened the procedings just a bit, with some injection of humor. The visuals are still spectacular, with the attack on Isengard by the Ents a standout, or of course thousands of types of Uruk-Hai and Orks that are sent from Isengard, with special mention of the towering Oliphaunts who carry giant fortresses on their backs. The camerawork by Andrew Lesnie still impresses me. While the score is good, not as great and memorable as the first one. And the acting is generally good throughout with new standouts being Bernard Hill(Still the most overlooked actor in Titanic) and a particularly slimy turn from Brad Dourif as Wormtongue. One more small complaint, is anyone else tired of seeing huge amazing action sequences intercut with the most boring scenes imaginable. I hated it in Attack of The Clones, and even more so here since they cut back and forth with the confrence of the Ents. Thats a good idea wasn't it; huge dramatic battle, then a meeting between tree, back to huge amazing battle. And did anyone else kind of laugh( even thogh I guess they did show Rohan's hopelessness against Isengard ) the scenes where young boys no younger than eleven readying for battle against the six foot tall, massively buitlt uruk-hai. Now thats an action sequence I wouldn't want to see."
"film_tensai","Null","0","0","26 December 2002"," Good film, stop comparing it to the book.
","Why do people persist on comparing the films negatively to the books? It's so pathetic.  Peter Jackson is doing an utterly fantastic job given all of the problems presented to a director in the process of adapting a film: dealing with overzealous fans, average viewers (i.e. people who haven't pored over the books), and producers.  Whether you people want to realize it or not, there are many people to try please out there, and you complainers are the minority.  Unfortunately, you're also the most vocal.<br/><br/>I refer to grrrr97's poor review of TTT.  Five chapters are cut out? Does grrrr97 even realize that in Tolkien's original conception of the book, there was only one novel?  Only one.  It was broken into SIX parts, each of the three books we know containing two shorter ""books.""  THEREFORE, it makes NO difference, ZERO, where the cuts take place, whether it's five chapters before or later.  Of course the creature of which Gollum speaks will appear in the next part.  If you're going to complain, at least do so with integrity and an understanding of Tolkien's work and vision, at least complain about something that has merit, like the fact that the world presented in the films is much brighter than Tolkien's, that Tolkien's prose is not quite equaled in the cinematography.<br/><br/>And, by the way, her name is Eowen.  Some fan....<br/><br/>This film is another fantastic part in what will become one of our generation's greatest film epics.  Yes, Peter Jackson has made changes: anyone with intelligence and a moderate understanding of the books will understand why they were made, or why things were not included.  For anyone who has not seen the extended DVD version of FOTR, I highly recommend it as the extra 30 minutes of footage really gives a fuller sense of character to Boromir and Gimli.<br/><br/>People out there, ones who criticize so much because the film is not what YOU imagined it to be, I say this: GET A LIFE.  These films are Peter Jackson's vision of a work truly far too long to be presented in film version.  He has done an incredibly good job, and if you be so good as to take you head from your a%#, you would realize that.<br/><br/>For all others, enjoy."

","""The Two Towers"" the second installment of Tolkein's trilogy THE LORD OF THE RINGS, is different from the first, lacking, necessarily, the wonder of new characters and wondrous new settings, darker and more intense, yet, for the most part, equally enthralling and leaving the viewer ready for the last three hours and knowing that three hours will not be enough.<br/><br/>The first part of the film does seem to drag a bit and the introduction of new characters may be difficult for non-readers of the books to identify. In addition, I found the switch-back editing between the Ent council and the battle for Helms Deep to be distracting.  The Ent council is portrayed as a little ""too cute"" and detracts from the intensity of the Helms Deep sequence -- but only slightly. The Helms Deep sequence more than makes up for the cuteness of the Ent cut-aways and is, indeed, ""Biblical"" in proportion -- although I did miss the drama of close-up one-on-one battle scenes found in ""The Fellowship"" (ie., the death of Boramir and the battle between Aragorn and Boramir's executioner).  Tokien purists may be disturbed by the departure from the text, but, cinematically and dramatically, most of them work.  Being female and an occasional romantic, I appreciate the increased (although only slight) role of the women characters; the romance is suggested in the book and its appendices.  I do think the character of Boramir's brother was better portrayed in the book, but everything cannot remain, even in a nine-hour film.  And, of course, the character of Gollum is incredibly done, as most critics have agreed.  Jackson, et. al., may not have remained absolutely true to the text, but the spirit and essence are definitely on the screen and the loving manner in which the film makers took great pains to provide richness in every detail -- etchings on the weaponry, architecture true to the various races and species, costumes painstakingly produced -- all point to a work that will endure just as Tolkien's trilogy has endured."

","Although I really did enjoy the film, I must say that Peter Jackson could have done better in some areas. The role of Faramir, for example, was very 2 dimensional. In the book he wanted nothing to do with with the Ring, and was a true hero. In the movie, however, he decided to take the ring and Frodo with him to Osgiliath, and he DIDN'T DO THAT IN THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!! I was very disappointed because Faramir was one of my favorite characters, and now, whenever I read the book over again, I can't see him in the same light as before.<br/><br/>I don't want to keep ragging on the movie though. The scenes of the battle of Helms Deep were both amazing and terrifying, and it kept my adrenaline running (very few movies do that to me nowadays!). I was also thrilled when the Ents practically kicked the sh*t out of Isengard. That was nothing short of awesome!! I was very impressed with the character Legolas too. God, he gets hotter every time I see him!<br/><br/>I would just like to say that if I got to rate the film on a scale from 1 to 10, I would give it a 6. Sorry Peter, but you left out too much stuff from the book, and put in more of your own inventions! Tolkien should have gotten a little more respect like he did in the Fellowship movie!"

","Now I quite enjoyed 'Fellowship of the Ring'. I only saw it twice because I took my son the second time, but I have seen 'The Two Towers' only once, and am only likely to see it once. I was conned by the initial charm of the first film, but by the time of this second epic, the novelty has worn off for me. Now I understand why they only make Bond films every two or three years. One year was not enough distance to put between films like this, and the fact that they made all three at the same time also doesn't help. I know it's a trilogy but how many years were there between the three Godfather movies? Obviously the vast majority of punters totally disagree with me, but I see that the next Harry Potter movie will not be shown until 2004, which is sensible. Even that follow-up seemed too hot on the heels of the first film, but they've got an excuse. The actors will age. I don't really see the same problem arising with 'Rings' so there's no excuse. Anyway, at the end of the day, I would say that this movie in particular is vastly over-rated. I hate the way that Liv Ullman is on so many advertising posters and yet her role is so miniscule, if you blink you'll miss her. I was not particularly impressed by the battle scenes, because I'm not a great fan of CG effects. If you compare it to 'Zulu' it pales in comparison. I doubt if I will bother with the final instalment because these movies all have the same problem. They have to decide whether to take themselves fully seriously; or just be more fun. This film is neither gripping realism nor fulfilling fantasy. It's caught in the middle, with Gollom becoming not frightening enough to look like something from a Gothic vampire movie; and not pleasant enough to become your buddy. A disappointment. For trees with attitude, I'll stick to Macbeth or the 'Wizard of Oz' thank you very much...."

The battle at Helms Deep was by far the most impressive feature of the entire film. In fact if you take the battle away the rest is pretty unremarkable.<br/><br/>Gollum. He was done very well.

I know everyone raves about Aragorn and Legolas but I personally find them to be pretty bland individuals who get by on their brooding manner and handsome faces. They are not  very gripping characters and their continual moping wears on you after a time. Merry and Pippin are far more fun to watch.<br/><br/>As stated at the beginning I did enjoy the film but I felt it lacked the emotional impact of FOTR. There was no tear jerking moments like when Gandalf fell in Moria or the death of Boromir, it was just a big slugfest and special effects showcase. Frodo and Sam wandered about in circles most of the time and I felt a bit lost right along with them, like the film was wandering and trying to find its way.

There is not a miss-step or false note in the entire film. <br/><br/>There were a couple of scenes that looked as if they could have been lifted right out of that other modern fairy tale: `The Wizard of Oz' but for the most part everything seemed original and fresh.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's original score adds greatly to the overall feel of the film. It rises spectacularly at peak moments with a chorus of thousands' lending their talents and subsides quietly at moments of peace and tenderness.<br/><br/>The Production Design and Art Direction (Grant Major and Peter Joe Bleakley, respectively) add to the grandeur and range that the film reaches for. The luminous cinematography by Andrew Lesnie (not to mention the spectacular New Zealand settings) enhances the mystical and other-worldly' quality that the films strives for and achieves.<br/><br/>This is a tightly woven piece of modern film making that should inspire filmmakers everywhere to strive for the best and hopefully, achieve it."
"Sithlord-20","8","0","0","31 December 2002"," Flawed Where ""Fellowship"" Wasn't, but Still a Grand Epic
","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I thought ""Fellowship"" was as close to perfection as film gets.  A brilliant realization of the classic book, of which I am also a devout fan.<br/><br/>But unlike other Tolkien devotees, I will not criticize this adaptation simply because it alters certain aspects of the novel.  It is a necessary evil in converting a written medium to a visual one.  I did not have a problem with Arwen's expanded role in ""Fellowship,"" nor did I lament the loss of such characters as Tom Bombadil.  All the changes Peter Jackson made to the first book worked sublimely well on screen.<br/><br/>But he was not so wise in his adaptation of ""The Two Towers.""  Many changes he made simply do not work.  And by ""not work,"" I mean in a purely cinematic sense.  My reservations include:<br/><br/>1) Aragorn going over the cliff.  This is redundant in that the same thing happened to Gandalf.  It is not suspenseful because in every trailer and TV spot we have seen Aragorn fight in the battle of Helm's Deep.  It also dedicates far too much screen time to getting him back to the keep, thus slowing the film and accomplishing nothing save for forcing an unnecessary appearance of Arwen.<br/><br/>2) The Ents get tricked.  The oldest, wisest beings in Middle-earth yet they have no idea what's going on, nor do they offer to help until they are tricked by Merry and Pippin.  Defeats the whole purpose of the Entmoot scene and belittles their characters.<br/><br/>3) Shelob pushed to the 3rd film.  I don't care what anyone says, this was a huge mistake.  As written in the novels, the climax of ""Towers"" is a perfect, classic cliffhanger.  It would have been on par with ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" when Han is whisked away by Boba Fett and Luke learns a little about his family tree.  Now imagine if ""Empire"" had ended BEFORE the lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader and you get some idea of the error Jackson made here.  He instead gives us a brief, anticlimactic aside to Osgilath where nothing really happens that hasn't happened before.  Worst of all was Sam Gamgee turning into Sam Rockne with a ""Some things are worth fighting for"" speech that was so corny it made me laugh.<br/><br/>I also felt the film didn't flow very well and could have been edited together much better.  At several points in the movie I checked my watch and wondered, ""I haven't seen Frodo and Sam for about 45 minutes.  What the hell happened to that story?""  In comparison, watch any of the ""Star Wars"" films and marvel at how perfectly they balance and fade to several concurrent story lines.  ""Towers"" lacked this fluidity.<br/><br/>Aside from these flaws, however, I greatly enjoyed ""Towers.""  Its action sequences are unparalleled and the casting remains perfect.  For pure visual flair this series sets the benchmark for everything else out there.  I eagerly await ""The Return of the King,"" which will hopefully live up to ""Fellowship.""  The first film in this trilogy ranks a 10, but ""Towers"" falters slightly and falls to an 8.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10"

I've got past the Hornburg/Helms Deep bit and this doesn't happen. It appears Peter Jackson decided he wanted to concentrate on the Aragorn/Arwen/Eowyn love triangle and this was merely a device to focus attention on it.<br/><br/>Also in the book some dispossessed Men are allied with Saroman and the Uruk-hai whereas in the film Saroman is committed to destroying all Men. I just think that the screenplay shouldn't have deviated this much from the book.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant visually as was Fellowship, but it is just not as good as i thought it would be - Fellowship worked better as a film, and i'm particularly disappointed as the Radio play of Two Towers was by far the better of the three parts.<br/><br/>Maybe the extended DVD will be more satisfying....."

","*POTENTIAL SPOILERS<br/><br/>The smartest comments made so far here are pointing out that this movie doesn't deserve to be degraded by naysaying Tolkienites. Yes, Shelob is not in the movie (and guess what, in case you weren't aware: she's GOING TO BE IN THE NEXT MOVIE!!), the Elves are at Helm's Deep and Faramir takes the hobbits to Osgiliath. Please get over it.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful, grand, moving epic that I have now seen three times, and it improves with each viewing. When completed, I have no doubt that Peter Jackson's trilogy will be a defining moment in cinema history. We are watching the ""Star Wars"" of our time unfold before our eyes. I, for one, am really excited about that.<br/><br/>As a previous poster stated: if you want to see a movie that's exactly like the book, don't see this movie. If you want to see a great movie, see this movie. It's a shame to see some people putting the movie down for silly reasons, because ""The Two Towers"" is indeed a great movie. True movie fans are bound to agree."
"stuch","9","0","0","31 December 2002"," For godsake, it's a film, not a way of life.
","I have already commented on this film. But now having read other people's reviews, I feel I have to write another.<br/><br/>A film, I'm sorry to say, is not a book. Things must have to be changed to make it better for a film audience. Themes can be explored a lot more in books than films. For example there are many themes in the LOTR books. A film made from a book must focus on one or two of these.<br/><br/>I have read the book, all of it. And I have accepted that some things need to be changed to keep the pace of the film. The battle for Helm's Deep happens near the middle of the book. And films kinda need a big finish. And so a few things need to be removed, or pushed into the next film. *MINOR SPOILERS* The giant spider, Shelob I think it's called, WILL be in the next film, no doubt. Or were you all to busy getting annoyed to miss what Gollum said at the end? The theme of corruption was added to by Faramir taking Frodo to the besieged town. In both Frodo almost giving the Nazgul the ring, and the fact that Faramir took them there.<br/><br/>Films of this length cannot be all action, it would just get repetative, and granted Liv does have quite a large part. But a female attention stealer is needed. I do believe she was there to remind people of the elves, and what this quest is forcing their people to do.<br/><br/>And I will agree with wiskate, people shouldn't speak ill of this film just because everyone else likes it. It's kinda childish.<br/><br/>Woooo..... glad I got that off my chest."

","I had been waiting to see this movie for a long time, and, unlike most people, I actually read the book. Unfortunately, this is what ruined the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is so jacked up! It's like Peter Jackson didn't care that he was supposed to follow the book because he makes up his own story. Let me specify. (Careful! Spoilers straight ahead!)<br/><br/>First of all, there were no elves at the battle of Helm's Deep except for Legolas. Elrond didn't send a troop of elves to save Theoden's butt. The Rohan's saved their own butts. Cool as it looked, it just didn't happen.<br/><br/>Second, there was no Arwen in the second book! If she was in there, it was for such a short time, it didn't freakin' make any difference. I am so tired of Liv Tyler getting a bigger part in these movies than she was intended to! So Tolkein didn't have many women characters in his books. Get over it! Arwen shouldn't have been in the first movie as much as she was (Glorfindel saved Frodo and took him to Rivendell, remember), and she sure wasn't supposed to be in the second one like she was.<br/><br/>Third, Faramir didn't take Frodo to Osgilath. He took him to that waterfall place, was tempted to take the ring, didn't, gave Frodo and Sam some food, and sent them on their way. There was no big thing with the Nazgul at Osgilath! At least there wasn't in the second book.<br/><br/>And let's not forget that Jackson left the whole end of the book out of the movie. What happened to Sheloub, the big spider that almost killed Frodo, that led Sam to take up the ring and Frodo to get captured by Orcs. What about that? It was only a huge part of the book.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on how the Ents and Merry and Pippin were handled. They're pretty much forgotten for most of the movie, even though they were a big part of the book, and Pippin has to convince the Ents to go to war. The Ents knew what was going on. They knew their forest was being destroyed. They didn't need Pippin to show them.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are more things in this movie that were jacked up, but these are the ones that really rub me raw. If Peter Jackson wanted to make movie adaptations of books that are so much larger than himself, he should have had enough respect to keep them the way they were meant to be, or he shouldn't have done them at all. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the movie, but he ruined a big part of it for me. I'll bet Tolkein is spinning in his grave right now."

"joeebay3","Null","0","0","26 December 2002"," One Tolkien Fan's Observations
","Fellow Tolkien Fans:<br/><br/>Have you listened to Peter Jackson's commentaries in TFOTR DVD?  In it he states that TLOTR, as it stands, word for word and page for page, is unfilmable - and he's right.  While I'd gladly sit through a 36-hour marathon series that was exactly true to the book, I doubt enough other people would to make such a venture commercially viable.<br/><br/>PJ is also a longtime Tolkien fan.  The movies are his attempt to present the essence of Tolkien in visual media.  No, it isn't perfect - nothing short of that 36-hour marathon could be.  With only three hours per movie he has to leave a lot of material out, and what's left needs to be significantly edited to capture the themes of the book.  Keep in mind PJ had originally planned for two films and walked out on his original studio when they told him to do it in one.  How fortunate that New Line Cinema gave him the budget to do three!<br/><br/>Tolkien himself said that TLOTR was not allegorical, but was rather intended to be applicable to each reader's life in a unique way.  That is the great strength and timeless appeal of the book.  Each of us who reads TLOTR takes away a different mental picture of what the book's message is, and how the story takes place, and what each of the characters would be like in person. PJ's matched mine reasonably closely in most places.  In others they didn't.<br/><br/>Gandalf is the guide of all efforts against Sauron, and when the challenge is beyond mortal powers he takes direct action.  His charisma and power to inspire others are well portrayed by Sir Ian.  We see the hand of Gandalf in the background in TTT, telling Aragorn ""you must hold"" at Helm's Deep, and in the foreground when he heals Theoden and leads the charge that breaks the siege.  In the movie, Theoden's healing is portrayed as an exorcism, which I found to be a tad thick.  I feel that showing Theoden possessed by heartfelt despair, rather than by Saruman, would have captured Tolkien's message better.  The situation is hopeless, so why not meekly submit?  No - Gandalf reveals his power, points to a window of light in the sky and shows you there is still a chance, so hold fast.  Sounds corny, but I think Sir Ian's talents would have been equal to the task.<br/><br/>The message of Fangorn and the rise of the forest, to me, is that you can abuse nature for a long time but eventually it rises against you in wrath like you've never seen.  The film could have captured the LOOOOOOONG time it takes for Ents to act by showing more periodic cuts to the Entmoot throughout the movie.  The Hobbit trick of getting Fangorn to go south so he would see the forest's destruction and be moved to act wasn't how I would have done it.  However it does send an additional Tolkien message that in the struggle of good and evil, doing nothing will eventually result in evil coming to your door and burning down your house.  So take action now, Treebeard.<br/><br/>A chance to show your quality, indeed.  The scene with Frodo, Sam and Faramir is a terrific opportunity to define and shape these three characters: Sam the earnest-but-simple gardener who blurts out that his master has the Ring, Frodo the gentlehobbit, able to hold his own in words with one of Numenorean descent, and Faramir, who resists the temptation that felled his brother.  I don't understand why Faramir says the ""a chance to show my quality"" words first in the movie, but perhaps someone will explain it to me.  The detour to Osgiliath doesn't really bother me as much as the missed opportunity to develop Frodo, Sam, and Faramir.  Actually, in the book, Faramir does fight a battle at Osgiliath (after leaving Frodo), and the movie portrays what it might have been like.  This is an example of the little bonuses in the film - you get to see scenes that were alluded to in the book but never described in detail.<br/><br/>TLOTR is the greatest work of fiction of the twentieth century and ranks highly among the greatest literary works of all time.  PJ's movies, however, are not the greatest films of all time.  As movies, they're very good, but not excellent.  They can't be excellent because they're based on a thousand-page book with too many characters and events to allow for much time to be spent developing any single character or plotline onscreen. The real worth of the films, is that they serve to disseminate Tolkien's message (albeit in abridged form) to many, and hopefully inspire some significant number of people to read the book for themselves."

","Trying to compress The Lord of the Rings into three three hour movies is a herculean effort. Peter Jackson and his crew are doing an excellent job.<br/><br/>TTT was choppy in the original text, cutting back and fourth between the parallel story lines of the fragmented fellowship, and the movie reflects this as well.<br/><br/>As for the cgi I was very pleased with treebeard, and gollum was just amazing. The battle of helms deep was incredible.<br/><br/>The warg riders were a bit jerky, reminding me of the devil dogs from Ghostbusters...<br/><br/>I think Farimir was portrayed a bit more evil than in the text, but I've not re-read it recently.<br/><br/>The conservation overtones, present in the text, but amplified in the movie are a nice touch.<br/><br/>Some audiences may be alienated by all the white faces of the good guys, and the predominantly dark ones of the men in the legions of Sauron..."
"calacour","Null","0","0","26 December 2002"," Good movie but many plot deviations
","As a long time of the LoTR story I have a few comments.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that they nailed Gollum.  His actions and speech pattern was just as I had pictured it from the books.  The CGI interaction with the ""Real"" world was amazingly good, without looking at it closer than I did I could see no obvious CGI goofs.<br/><br/>I know they were using Gimli as comic relief since the story line was a bit intense but it made him look like a bumbling fool most of the time, this is not in charictor.<br/><br/>I was not too happy about the fact that in the movie that Theoden wants to go to Helms Deep and Gandalf warns against it because in the book it is Gandalf that tells him to go there.  And what was that about banishing Eomer, I know it supports the plot line that they have very few warriors at Helms deep but they could have used Erkenbrand's arrival at Helms deep to drive off the Orc's.  And the Elves at Helms is just wrong, if they wanted to increase the drama then have Eomer show up instead.  What about the Ent/Huron assistance in the battle?<br/><br/>The Entmoot was fairly good but I wonder why they changed the decision to having the Ents not wanting to help.  If it was so they could have Merry's ""there will be no Shire"" speech then they could have had them give it at the Entmoot instead.  But on a positive note the Ents were well portrayed except that they were too flexible.  At the breaking of Isengard the Ents flooding of the ring with all of the Ents still inside seemed a little irresponsible for beings that have lived for 10's of thousands of years, in the book all the Ents were out of harms way when it was flooded.  I did like the Ent dunking its burning head in the flood water to put it out.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Faramir was a little too much like Boromir in his desire for the Ring.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the Arwen plot deviations.  The arguments between Arwen and Elrond are not too bad except for being too long but the Aragorn/Arwen ""Dream"" sequences were superfluous and a waist of time.<br/><br/>I liked ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" movie more than ""Two Towers"" but it was not bad."

","i must say that i was disappointed in this second installment in the lord of the rings trilogy. two towers has none of the beauty of the first film that made it more enjoyable to me. this movie was much darker and violent, which will appeal to the violent videogame mainstream, but i've had it with being bombarded with such stuff. i feel that it's why people have become noticeably ruder in the last ten years. society is being desensitized.<br/><br/>i loved the 1st movie's lush visuals alot from the quaint hobbit countryside to the grandiose architecture of the elves. none of that is to be found in this movie. most of the visuals are of the dimly lit nearly monochromatic variety. after 3 hours of it, it began to become oppressive.<br/><br/>it seemed too that whenever people weren't violently hacking at each other in two towers, they were busy going on with tiresome long speeches. to be fair, golem has one heck of ""speech"" that is very entertaining and sheds new light onto his character. but, i felt that alot of the intrigue within the castle of the king that was under saurumon's influence could have been pared down a little. it started getting to be too much like hamlet for my taste.<br/><br/>two towers isn't a bad movie, i gave it a 7 even though i might have rated it higher had not an overwhelming majority given it a 10. it just wasn't my kind of movie. it was a nonstop depression/violence fest for the most part.<br/><br/>in it's favor, it has even better special effects than the 1st and on a MUCH larger scale. it has alot more action than the first, but i like lord of the ring's sentimentality just fine thank you. the fighting scenes in towers are great action pieces from the smaller wizard battles to the 3 or more full scale battle scenes.<br/><br/>the definite highlight of the movie for me was golem's part in the movie. he really steals several of the scenes he's in, and offers the closest thing to upbeat that this film has to offer. if you're a fan of movies like spawn, then this will definately be your kind of movie. i just found myself wishing for at least the slightest glimmer of beauty and romance, but it isn't to be found in this film. most people seem to love it alot, but i've never been into mainstream movies too much. your results may vary."

","Congratulations, Mr Jackson. You've done it again. Ever since I left the cinema at the end of last year (only to return twice again), totally stunned and bewildered, ready to take up my trusty sword to come to the rescue of all of the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth (Oops- sorry, got carried away...), I have been longing - yearning to see how you're going to make the rest of Middle-Earth come alive. There were moments during ""The Two Towers"" when I actually cursed myself for having read the books because it would have been even more breathtaking NOT to know what was going to happen next and HOW our heroes are going to escape that close call and WHEN the relief force would arrive. Last time I had this much fun, excitement and emotional involvement was about 2o years ago, when I was hanging on to the edge of my seat watching ""The Empire strikes back"". I always thought there would be a point when I would be old- grown-up- respectable(?)- NUMB enough not to get excited about a movie (or a book)any more and it's something I have always dreaded in my heartof hearts. Thank goodness, ""The Lord of The Rings"" proves I was utterly wrong in this respect. The biggest compliment I, for my part, can give to Mr Jackson, his exceptional team and the actors in particular (who - especially the members of the Fellowship - are sensational - how can you ever expect to top this?) is that I - like so many other in cinemas all over the world - was sad to be left out, to be unable to enter the screen and stand next to Legolas and Gimli on the walls of Helm's Deep, looking down onto the milling Orcs underneath. Alas, but one can dream. :) However, the thing I dread most of all, is the knowledge that after the third part ,""Return of the King"", I will forever have to part with the heroes and fiends of Middle-Earth. And that's very much like coming to the end of the book, knowing one now has to leave the characters, never to know what will become of them, like parting with a good friend at the end of a very exciting journey."

","Two down, one to go.<br/><br/>The middle part of a story is often the weakest - sort of an interim between the highs on either side (witness ""24,"" ""Murder One,"" ""Twin Peaks"" etc). ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" does qualify, but it's only inferior to ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" in the same way that drinking is inferior to imbibing.<br/><br/>The previous movie had the principals more or less united, with the storyline similarly concentrated; this time, with the main characters all over Middle Earth, the movie's a bit episodic at times and is also guilty of making Gimli into something of a comic relief character (and as for him and Legolas boasting about how many people they kill...). But it gradually hooks you in the same way the last one did, and there are ultimately plenty of reasons for you to continue the journey.<br/><br/>1.

","The Two Towers should not be considered as a sequel to the Fellowship of the Ring. It is the three-hour second act, with the upcoming Return of the King being the three-hour third act. That said, knowing what happened in the first film is necessary to understanding almost everything in the second film.<br/><br/>      I have read the Lord of the Rings books, and I was not disappointed that certain things were cut out of the first film. However, I was a little upset with a few of the changes that Jackson made in The Two Towers, notably the exclusion of the giant spider Shelob, which will apparently make it into Return of the King. Also, the order in which things happened in the books are not all similar to how they happen in the movie, and the back-and-forth editing hurt the flow of the film and consequently made things feel awkward. As a movie alone, however, The Two Towers is nothing but fantastic. Jackson's direction is quite skillful, especially at the much-revered Helm's Deep scene, which features the greatest ""silence before the violence"" moment EVER. The visuals certainly have outdone the first film in almost every way, mostly thanks to the CGI creature Gollum, who looks so very real. The acting was on par with Fellowship, but it could have been better if Gandalf and Saruman had bigger roles and more lines. <br/><br/>     A few things I was let down by were the sets and locations, which seemed a lot less inspired than in the first film; the writing, which strayed a bit TOO far from the books; and the musical score, which wasn't bad, but wasn't as great as the Fellowship score. The only other thing that bothered me was the lighting. I had hoped the Two Towers would have been darker, but much of it took place in the daytime. Even so, these small flaws could in no way bring down such a marvelous epic as this.

","The only caveat I have about this film is: DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT SEEING THIS ONE UNTIL YOU'VE SEEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. There is absolutely no ""things that occurred up to now"" in this film. It simply takes off where the first one left off. So unless you've seen the first, you'd be lost in this film. I think that was a mistake. There are approximately 38 people on the face of the earth who didn't see the first film and they wouldn't have a clue as to what it's all about. There's no explanation as to why the Hobbits left the Shire, why they're going to Mordor or what power the ring has. However, as one who has seen the first (many times) and read the books (many times), I can say this film was MAGNIFICENTLY done. Jackson has another great film to his credit, although this one had to have been very difficult to design, plan and film. Much of this is due to the way the books were written. The film would require significant adaption and revision. It simply couldn't be filmed as it was written. See the first one, then see this one!"

","While some ""reviewers"" revel in their power-tripping anonymity of the internet, all I have to say that TTT is a more than worthy second part to this so-far amazing trilogy. Having read the trilogy many times over the last 25 years, I appreciate both the written word of Tokien, and the screen interpretation/adaptation of Jackson. As many comments indicated, Jackson preserved the spirit of LOTR, as he necessarily adapted the story for the screen. Gollum/Smeagal is an amazing achievement in CGI, and Serkis's portrayal deserves to be recognized. The ""romance"" of LOTR is in the epic itself, as the characters are but pawns being pushed and pulled by the circumstances and dynamics of the greater story. LOTR is not a Harry Potter story that is so simple that it can be adapted word for word onto the screen. There needed to be some manipulation to fit the story onto the screen, and in 3 parts that made sense visually, and in its continuity of the story. All told, a wonderful job by Jackson and his team."

The locations, the actors, the dialogue, the humour and the music are all top notch. Both movies ooze class on all grounds, and we're too blind to see it. Even those who enjoyed the films may have been swept up in it all, and could come to love it even more if they are more observant.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for anyone that didn't enjoy both movies, your mind must be completely shut and void of all imagination. If you did your research into the magnitude of the story, you will know that no one could ever had directed, or made the movies any better. The sheer volume of material that had to be included would leave anyone for dead. But Peter Jackson managed to pull it off. Of those who don't care for a story of such brilliance and magnitude, at least have the intelligence to acknowledge the quality of the production.<br/><br/>We live in a world where everyone thinks they're movie experts. Clear and detach your mind from all preconceived notions, sit back and watch both films again. Only then will you be able to appreciate the splendour of the story and the movies.<br/><br/>I will be very surprised if anything even comes close to this trilogy in the next decade.<br/><br/>It is truly worth 10/10."

","Well it's taken a while but finally Peter Jackson has taken Hollywood by storm and actually shown them how to deliver an entertaining movie that keeps the storyline in tact and visualises the mastery, mysticism and grandeur that is J.R.R. Tolkien.<br/><br/>Gollum is nothing short of Breathtaking. The Academy need to add a new Acting Award to the Oscars in the very near future. Best Performace by a Digital Character. Gollum's presence in the film was felt in a way only human actors can deliver. ""Weta Effects"" should be proud of their skills and talents in bringing Numbers together on a PC to give life to a character that makes the human audience Laugh, Cry and Feel Compassion.<br/><br/>Although the movie was slow in places overall it was a great film. 9/10 is an accurate score.<br/><br/>On a difference note, my Friend & I do have a question to ask either Peter Jackson (Screenplay) or Mr. Tolkien's estate (Novel). Q: If Saruman has the technology for his troops to fire large crossbow catapults over the walls. Why then didn't they just simply fasten the gunpowder bombs to them and fire them over the wall. Seems it would have been smarter to do that then have an Orc run up to the castle carrying the Bomb.<br/><br/>Also in an earlier scene, Saruman let's Wormtongue know he has stumbled upon this new form of Weaponry. Wormtongue brings the candle closer to the gunpowder (Secret Weapon) and Saruman fends him off for obvious reasons. If this secret weapon ""GUNPOWDER"" is so secret or such a new threat to the kingdom of man, then why did Gandalf have a wagon full of Fireworks for all to see in the Hobbiton Shire. If Saruman was as clever as he looks don't ya think he would have invented the Gun. Even the Chinese used rockets in war when they discovered that Fireworks could be fired in a certain direction. Look at Mulan. I guess Saruman... I mean Christopher Lee is overworked from his appearances in two of the biggest franchises in Hollywood History. Hey I know maybe Christopher could take over the role of Dumbledore in Harry Potter."

","To all the obsessed Lord of the Ring fans who keep raving this movie as if it were the best movie ever made...<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I can't get over it. I""m just so disturbed with yall voters. I can't believe this movie is at the top of the TOP 250 list, with a 9.1 voting average. That's crazy, that's insane. I mean, I could understand that yall obviously loved the movie, but why such a high rating? This is crazy...it's not that good of a movie ( I personally didn't like it and suffered for three hours), but do you people realizing what movies yall are putting Lord of the Rings  ahead of?<br/><br/>ahead of the....<br/><br/>Godfather Trilogy Shawshank Redemption Braveheart Star Wars Original Trilogy Memento and other fantastic movies<br/><br/>I mean, these movies that I have just listed surpass Lord of the Rings by far, and to say that Lord of the Rings is better than movies such teh Godfather or Shawshank Redemption is atrocious, an insult to humanity.<br/><br/>Here are the reasons why I didn't enjoy Lord of the Ring- The Two Towers....<br/><br/>1. We don't get anything out of this movie...it's just a lame adventure fantasy sequel, nothing more. I mean, I understand there are symbollic elements in this movie like Good vs. Evil, the light and dark, and all that other crap, but after seeing this movie, I said to myself, ""Did I gain anything from watching this movie?"" The answer is no<br/><br/>2. shallow characters- once again, we don't get to understand or get into these chracters. Peter Jackson does an absolute horrible job of character development and we don't get to know anything about these people! I mean, because he failed to do so, I simply do not care if Froto or any of his hobbit friends die...<br/><br/>3. A showcase of graphics, nothing more- Peter Jackson concentrates too much on Computer graphics and cinemotagrophy that direction is lost...and the storyline just kinda rolls on without any real direction. The audience sees nothing but a bunch of random trees going around, a bunch of water gushing...blah blah blah, and a bunch of random slash- and tear battle scenes. I mean, I admit, the CGI and the cinematography in this movie was amazing, but the movie can't expect those to satisfy movie goers like me.<br/><br/>4. Crappy character interaction- Once again, like my comment #2, this movie displays poor and artificial character interaction. I just can't feel any sense of connection between the characters. I mean, I could really feel the interaction between Red and Andy Dufraine in the Shawshank Redemption, and the interaction between the Star Wars chracters...but the interaction and dialogue in the Two Towers really stink.<br/><br/>5. Too long, too boring, drags too much- Is this movie actually fun and entertaining?....no!!!! final answer. It's 3 hours for heavens sake! And it's too slow....and drags too much<br/><br/>6. Why do we get bombarded with annoying characters? - um, I don't even know his name, and I don't care to remember, but that bulgy eyed skinny mutant creature was so freaking annoying! 10 X more annoying than Jar Jar Binks, now that's an insult!<br/><br/>7. No humour- When a movie has absolutely no humor in it, it has a small chance of being good. Man...how stupid were the punchlines in this movie....really stupid!! It's sad when the only guy that's attempting to be funny is that dwarf dude with the ax. You notice that I don't even remember the character's names?...(that's because I don't care). Well, i do remember the names Froto, and Aragon, i think.<br/><br/>8. pathetic romance- man....what pathetic romance. Why can't the movie be more detailed about Aragon's romance. That's sad.<br/><br/>9. 10. 11. .......I could go on and on...but there's no use. You Lord of the Rings fans are just too crazy and hyped about this movie, that it's no use. I wish you could appreciate deeper movies like Brave heart or the God father, or more creative and aesthetic movies such as Memento, but no no no, you people think it's the best movie all time (that's pretty sad, I still can't believe that it's the #1 movie in the top 250).<br/><br/>i suffered through this nerdy pointless movie, and i give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for the cinematography... yes, that's the only thing good i can say about this movie, the nice scenery."

","the second part in the trilogy picks up from where the first left off, and i liked peter jackson's decision not to include any sort of retrospective of the fellowship of the ring. it wouldn't have felt right, and who didn't see the first movie anyway? that having been said, the movie does do a wonderful job of translating tolkien's novel to the screen, with some largely excusable (forgive me, lotr purists) alterations. cinematically, it largely works, though the relentless pace can get a little confusing. but the director had the difficult task in this movie of fusing together three independent storylines, and he manages it pretty successfully in the end. the casting was inspired. the actors all get into their characters and are really fun to watch, especially, of course, the one who doesn't appear on screen at all - andy serkis, who was digitized into the creature gollum on screen, turns in a simply remarkable performance as the schizophrenic gollum. the scenery and backgrounds are stunning, the battle scenes are choreographed to perfection, and above all, the movie manages to capture the essence (and not every nuance, but i'm sure the author would have understood) of the lord of the rings. the timeless struggle between good and evil, light and dark, free will and slavery, it's all there, larger than life. this is a movie that will remain with you for a long, long time. go ahead and watch it in theaters while you still can."

","As much as I'd love to rant about what was added and what left out (being very fond of Tolkien's works), that hardly seems worthwhile. For two reasons: anyone should know that all that can be put into film of a book like this is spectacle, and for filming purposes some things must be altered. One should never expect a movie to do complete justice to a book (what would be the point of reading it, then?). Secondly, so much was changed that it would be exhausting to try and discuss it all. Really, if you're going to re-write The Lord of the Rings (which is essentially what happened in this movie), call it something else, and do a good job. My criticism of this movie is based solely on its merit as a movie. I would give it 6 out of 10, for being incoherant, boring, and a really long non sequitor with a badly written script. The few things that are good about it (gollum being one) are so overshadowed by the absurdity of what goes on in the gruesomely plodding and confusing plotline as to be immemorable. I never want to see this again, not because it was dissapointing as compared to The Fellowship, but because it was simply an incredibly poor movie. Attack of the Clones was more enjoyable as far as being able to follow the action- and I like Star Trek! The proof that this movie was abyssmally bad: comic-relief Gimli hands it out in the form of getting an orc between the legs during a battle. Boo, Mr. Jackson, boo."
"lhseaglerunner","Null","0","0","25 December 2002"," A Towering Achievement
","Unlike last year, I am reviewing the new installment of the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Not that I failed to enjoy `Fellowship of the Ring'-I found it to be an excellent example of the re-emergence of the epic and it was just plain fun. I had similar hopes heading into `Two Towers' and you know what, I was pretty much dead-on.<br/><br/>`Two Towers' opens with proof that the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellan), my favorite character from the first installment, has not died a fiery death in the mines of Moriah, which certainly gladdened my heart. But that is just one of the four separate storylines that exists to enhance the plot (and make my summarization a much more difficult task).<br/><br/>In plotline number two, a pair of our plucky Hobbit protagonists, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his companion, Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are traveling closer to the ultimate destination-Mt. Doom, the only place where the frighteningly powerful Ring of Power can be destroyed. But in a deal that falls as close to a deal with the devil, Frodo and Sam enlist the aid of the schizophrenic Gollum (Andy Serkis) to guide them to the fiery mount.<br/><br/>The third plotline involves the other two Hobbits of the story-Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). After being kidnapped by vicious Uruk-Hai, the intrepid Halflings escape into the foreboding Fangorn Forest, where they are taken for a ride (literally) by an Ent-a tree-shepherd of the forest.<br/><br/>The fourth and most dwelled upon plotline focuses on the three remaining heroes-the human uber-warrior, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the waggish dwarf, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), and the talented elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom). To make what could be a long story short, this band of heroes comes to the aid of the embattled nation of Rohan, ruled by the wise (though sometimes misguided) Theoden (Bernard Hill). The quest of these heroes culminates in the spectacular battle of Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me the most about the movie was the jaw-dropping visuals. Combining amazing camera work and amazingly realistic special effects, the film was an absolute feast for the eyes. The only flaw that I readily noticed was in the shots of the two Hobbits riding atop the Ent-it seemed to be shot out of the 1950s, not the 21st Century, but one flaw out of three hours of film is a pretty good success rate.<br/><br/>I may sound masochistic to say this (especially after consuming a cup of soda), but I think that the film could have been easily stretched another half-hour. Too much seems to be crammed into a relatively short three hours-not that I'm being nit-picky here. The plot already is excellent, but if it could possibly be stretched out to allow more development to each character, I'd be ecstatic. Well, maybe I'll just have to wait and see an unedited version on DVD.<br/><br/>The acting was magnificent and I really had nothing against any of the performances, although if I were to pick out one weak point in the acting is in Sean Astin's character's speech to Frodo towards the end-a bit schmaltzy if you ask me.<br/><br/>Overall, I was breathless after the splendor of `The Two Towers.' This, despite the myriad of special effects (which actually WORK here-as opposed to other films), is what a movie is supposed to be. If a few flaws were corrected and the movie stretched out a little bit, it would be a 10; as is, I'll give it a 9.5 out of 10."
"Digital-10","10","0","0","25 December 2002"," Have you or have you not read the book?
","Hello, all!<br/><br/>I am in the FORTUNATE position to not only have READ all three LOTR books several times, and seen The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) NUMEROUS times AND The Two Towers (TTT) a few already, but ALSO loving both the books and the films. Listed below are a few ideas I think a few of you critics need to think about.<br/><br/>1) Cliche as it is to say, if LOTR was turned into a film COMPLETELY after the books, it would have been about 36 hours long, if not more. Impossible. Some things need to be cut.<br/><br/>2) LOTR are the best books I've ever read. THEY ARE STILL BORING AT TIMES. You cannot tell me that you want to see Sam and Frodo walking through Emyn Muil and the Dead Marshes for as long as they do in TTT? In that case you should consider seeing a shrink! I haven't seen anyone complaining about all the songs and poems being cut out in the films.<br/><br/>3) The films need to be presented in a way that not only introduces LOTR to people who haven't had the pleasure of reading the books, but to create a justifiable storyline and a visualization of LOTR to its readers and fans. That's a difficult job. LOTR: the films are NOT for its fans and readers only, NOR is it for the people who haven't heard of LOTR/read the books. It's for EVERYONE! And in terms of that, it could properly not have done better.<br/><br/>OK, now I would like to say that yeah, as a fan of the books I have my pointers to the films, Why wasn't Tom Bombadil in the films? Why does Aragorn almost die in TTT? Why doesn't Sam look into the mirror of Galadriel? Why does Boromir die in the first film and not the second? Where is Shelob? But the point is, NOBODY CARES!!! We know all this, cause we've read the books. It's what we call INTERESTING/ADDITIONAL information. The people who haven't, DON'T CARE, they'll never know! So in this way, everybody is happy. But it does create a loophole for another question I think is more interesting: Why all the made-up stuff? Well, it is simply necessary to gain as large an audience as possible, and as stated above, THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE FILM, to be for EVERYBODY!<br/><br/>I am sick of people saying that Peter Jackson is a bad director. The shots are fantastic, the actors (which have been directed) are doing a REALLY good job, the tenseness, which of course is different from person to person, is higher than in many other films, and the film has a feeling of art about it.<br/><br/>I am sick of people who have read the books and complain about the film being crap and not doing the books justice, when they themselves can't be bothered to spell characters' names correctly. Go be miserable on your own while we others have fun. It's your loss.<br/><br/>I am sick of people complaining about holes in the story when they simply haven't understood something. Gandalf becomes the white because he earned that title by killing the Balrog of Morgoth. DO SOME SIMPLE, FUN, EASY RESEARCH, read the books, or even easier: Listen to what the characters in the film are saying. Please don't put your stupidity on display like that.<br/><br/>Guys and Gals, in the end, if you read the books, and then see the films, you'll know everything, you should be able to appreciate everything, and if you only want to see the films, that's fine, you're in for a long movie which should entertain you till the end. If you only want to read the books, that's fine as well, but more than anything, Peter Jackson's films are SUPPORTING Tolkien's work, not destroying it, not building on it, not overshadowing it. Supporting it. Giving it a new glance. And that, they do magnificently well.<br/><br/>If you like the films, I feel sorry for you, for not being able to be done to, but  I also respect your opinion, just make sense. And make sure that it makes sense to you, and that you're not just trying to be different, or trying to be critical. The LOTR films are too good to be spoiled in that way.<br/><br/>The books are always going to be the ultimate work of Tolkien, and they will always be the best, if you need them to be. The films still complement the books, in the same way that the books complement the film.<br/><br/>Remember that your vision may not be the same as Peter Jackson's. That does not mean that either of you are wrong. It just means he had the money and power to show everyone his ideas, but that shouldn't matter to you. Keep yours, and make them what they are to you, but accept Jackson's as another vision, as fit to exist as yours.<br/><br/>I, for one, cannot wait until The Return Of The King (ROTK), when the trilogy will be completed, and in the meantime, I'll have fun reading Tolkien's masterpieces (while skipping over the boring bits, like we all do ;o).<br/><br/>Enjoy the art.<br/><br/>Monroe"

","Tolkien wrote a wonderful story; full of magic and wonder and valor and all those little elements that make an adventure book wonderful.<br/><br/>Now, Jackson has made a brilliant adaptation of the book into a motion picture, full of magic and wonder and valor and all the elements that make an adventure movie wonderful.<br/><br/>All the naysaying Tolkienites who criticize the movie need to get over themselves.  I'd like to see them do better.  True, the movie strayed from certain major details in the book, but what movie adapted from a book hasn't?  Plus, all of the changes are not profane at all to the ends or themes of the books.  If Jackson had spent as much time as most die-hard Ring fans would have him, the movie would be 9 hours long and would appeal only to those die-hard fans.  I actually reviewed the chapters of the books, and he never strayed from the central, critical idea at all.  I see a great culmination in ""The Return of the King"" coming together quite nicely.<br/><br/>Additionally, The CGI is unreal.  The Ents and Gollum are especially wonderful, and the battle scenes--although sometimes hard to follow--are especially elegant and crafty.  Jackson in no way sacrificed character depth for graphics and imagery in the character of Gollum.  In fact, Gollum's character deserves a nomination for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>Jackson knows what he is doing here.  He's cunning and brilliant, and to the distraught Tokienites who would have him beheaded, I say TTT is worthy of the ""Best Picture"" Oscar."

I found it extremely enjoyable - and not having read this book or The Return of the King I was somewhat apprehensive that I'd feel lost.  That wasn't the case at all - I was engrossed for the entire three hours, and I particularly enjoyed seeing the further development of characters not given much screen time in the first film - particularly Legolas and Gimli.  I found the characters of Merry and Pippin to have grown tremendously, as well. The absolute best part of the experience for me, however, was going to see the film with my husband and two boys, ages 16 & 12.  Our twelve year old read the book this past Summer and was really excited about the film going in.  For the entire three hours he stayed literally on the edge of his seat - I'm not sure his back ever touched the chair.

I can promise you I won't be in line for ""the return of the king"". First of all the whole movie was basically made on computer which takes out all the realism. Beside the action, the story was just boring. And that's not giving the action a thumbs up. You've got 10,000 of these huge beasts marching towards this ""fort knox"" type castle, against 300 or so people. Yet when the fighting starts, rarely do you see any of the 10,000 beasts killing anything. Instead, Aragon rides through them like a hot knife through butter without a scratch. Come on, that's just awful. The movie completely relies on eyecandy, which is not how to make a movie. What happened to great movies with a great story and great dialogue.

It's NOT a real tale, but based on real human qualities and flaws. By the way, ""The Godfather"" is good, but it's not REAL, either.

","Now that 2 of the 3 movies have been released, it is clear that the movie-going public is witnessing a unique addition to the art. Years from now, when the LOTR cast and crew are old or gone, these films will still be on any movie lover's short list. There are old favorites now, single films or a series, but I cannot think of any that I would mention in the same sentence. If the various awards' groups don't come up with some special honors for these movies then they don't know jack about their own art or what pleases the public.<br/><br/>Anyone who nitpicked the first movie about wandering from Tolkien's story will have even more to chew on this time. It all made sense in the end, though it was sometimes diquieting. There's also a couple of additions to the movie that you won't find in the books, all to the good. The pacing is frenetic, with 3 storylines going on at once. They could be called The Three Musketeers, Lost in the Wilderness, and the Magic Forest. There's much more action in the Two Towers, with the battle at Helm's Deep an awe-inspiring spectacle that must last about 30 minutes. I don't think I've ever seen anything like the Ents' assault on Isengard! The film-makers did such a good job with Gollum that he is possibly the most engaging character in the film, his twisted mind notwithstanding. I can't wait to see the DVD extended version!!"
"mcroyle","8","0","0","25 December 2002"," Great picture, but lacking of the first...
","As a fan of Tolkein's books, I may be the first person on the planet (that I've heard of) to say that I didn't like the second movie as well as the first. Don't hate me please.<br/><br/>As moviegoers, we can all understand the adaptation process, yet in the second film, Peter, Pilippa (Spelling?) and the rest of the writing crew fell short of the adaptation process (es.) Just my opinion, and I know some of you won't agree, but I feel that as a fan I deserve my two cents.<br/><br/>First point to make is the threat of war: At the end of the first film there is the threat of war...we realize that war is inevitable, but it's not on our heels just yet. Yet, at the beginning of the second film, it's as if war has taken us from the beginning of the picture. I know there's only so much you can do in a three hour span, but a lot of time in this picture was given to some more secondary things. (i.e.= too much chasing across landscapes for Merry and Pippin...and extremely long battle sequences during the Helm's Deep.) -- again some of you may have problems with me saying Helm's Deep was secondary...but that's not what I'm saying at all. But, the amount of time taken to visualize the scenes was too long.<br/><br/>Second point: The role of Faramir, Baromir's brother, was written almost totally different from the book. In the novel, Faramir is a very wise and accepting person, (as was his brother) yet it also explains that Faramir was quite different from his brother...and when he finds the true nature of the burden Frodo carries, he completely understands (even if almost instinctly) that he couldn't, and would not, bring such a burden to mankind. Yet, in the picture, he rushes Sam and Frodo off to Minas Tirith (by way of Osgiliath) to take the ring to man...which never even happens. I was disappointed with Faramir's character in the film, because even though Peter, Philippa, and the writing crew show that Faramir is different than Baromir in the end, the whole of Faramir's character (the way that Tolkien wrote it) is crushed by the screenplay.<br/><br/>Third point: I felt that the CGI characters in the film were something that could have been better constructed, although I am by no means anyone with skills enough even to create such amazing things on screen. There's one scene where the lion-like attackers persuade Aragorn and his crew...I felt like I was watching a he-man cartoon and Battle-Cat (if anyone knows who he is) was cloned many times and people were riding on him. I know that Weta, with the technology they have, could have easily bettered the outcome of the visual battle in these sequences...and I won't even start on gollum. (final fantasy was better. That's all I have to say about him.)<br/><br/>I was so excited going into this film and so dissappointed when the ending credits rolled. What about the Huorns? Where are they? The first of the trilogy was almost flawless, leaving out so little vital things to the story, but I was left speechless at the closing curtain to the Two Towers...and not a good speechless. What about more history of the Ents? You know...one of the oldest, wisest, most intersting parts of the second installment. Who knows.<br/><br/>All I know is that even though the movie did almost fulfill my need for a bridge between the first and third, it didn't include half the material (or even get included material right enough) for true fans to enjoy it as much as we would have liked. 7.5 out of 10 -- on my scale. The first -- 9.5<br/><br/>When did the elves fight with the humans during Helm's Deep too?<br/><br/>-Thanks for your time. :)"

Nonetheless, it did not bowl me over the way The Fellowship of the Ring did, and I suppose it's simply that the standard of the first movie was so high, wildly exceeding expectations, that it was hard for this movie to have the same impact. And somehow Frodo became less sympathetic in this movie, probably a reflection of the ring's growing power over him. Still, the battle scenes were wonderful, and I happily paid my money to see it.

I don't think I ever finished the trilogy when I attempted to read it in high schoo.  I didn't give fellowship 10 stars (only 9), but this movie is far superior to any other movie in so many ways.  Cinematography, acting.  For three hours I thought I was in middle earth.  This is probably the best I've seen ever.  Great piece of movie making."

","""Two Towers"" was very different from the first LotR film, which surprised me given that all three movies were shot simultaneously.  I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>It wasn't perfect:  Characters like Galdalf, Saruman, Merry, and<br/><br/>Pippen didn't get much screen time (the extended DVD will certainly<br/><br/>fix that problem to some extent); Samwise got a little talky near the end (in a way that Tolkien would have liked, though); and the Battle of Helm's Deep and Frodo's adventure unfolded in much different ways from the book, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I thought the Helms' Deep battle could have benefitted from some type of wrap-up.<br/><br/>But, like the first movie, Two Towers' flaws did not work to hurt<br/><br/>the overall film all that much.  It is an incredibly entertaining<br/><br/>movie.  The visual effects range from very good to over-the-top great. <br/><br/>Oftentimes, a truly great effects shot was placed amongst shots that<br/><br/>were not as good, but still enjoyable.  The Helms' Deep battle,<br/><br/>though, was extremely well-done (it reportedly took four months to<br/><br/>film).  Some have criticized the movie because it kept breaking away from that battle to show Merry and Pippen with the Ents, but the battle was pretty intense and probably needed a couple breaks, and I thought that breaking from a ferocious battle where everything was on the line to the slow-moving Ents who couldn't make up their minds added tension to the close of the film.<br/><br/>Gollum was amazing -- Serkis and the effects team should win some type of special Oscar for that character.  I was worried about whether the effects people could pull off the Ents, but I thought they did a great job with them, and the final scenes with the Ents contain some truly inspired special effects.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think it's a major accomplishment.  I did get the feeling at times that I was watching a sneek preview for the special extended DVD that is sure to be superior to the theatrical release. But what do you do?  For some reason, a three-and-a-half hour movie is out of the question these days for the studios, so I guess we just have to live with the fact that we are not yet seeing the final product."

","I was impressed with Fellowship and Two Towers in terms of cinematics, visuals, action scenes, and so on.  However, in both films, key elements are left out.  Two towers left out fewer though, and I liked the approach of skipping back and forth between Sam/Frodo and the rest of the group, whereas the book presents the rescuing of Merry/Pippin in the first half, and Sam and Frodo's quest in the second.  That said however, there are SO many details left out from both films so far that it is like watching a movie based on the cliff notes of the book.  If the viewer REALLY wants to know what is going on, he needs to read The Hobbit, and preferably also the Silmarillion, as both set the scene for the trilogy seen here.  Nonetheless, a great movie on its own, worthy of an 8 or 9."

","I liked the movie as it was, and I'd give is a pretty solid 8/10.  It woould have been 10/10 if PJ had just left bits out of the book that were unnecesary, but the addition of made up stuff and tons of changes detracted from it overall.  <br/><br/>It has a great many changes to the story and for the life of me, I can't really understand why.  As others have pointed out, if you take out the 45 minutes of made up stuff, you could have put back all the other stuff he left out.<br/><br/>But more importantly it seemed there were changes for changes sake.  I kept getting anoyed that the introduced material was making a long movie even longer.  I didn't go along to see this film, I was expecting Tolkien's story.<br/><br/>Tolkien's story was at the top of the list of books of the century.  I really think that qualifies it as having a pretty good story line to begin with.  Why the tampering.<br/><br/>Overall it was an enjoyable romp, without the classic appeal that Fellowship had.  Changes there were made to simplify the storyline, not alter it materially.  The altering of the characters though is what hurts the most. Their motivations and actions have materialy changed, and not, unfortunately, for the better."
"cruiseee","10","0","0","29 December 2002"," Breathtaking!
","I had been anticipating the release of 'The Two Towers' since watching 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and I have to say that it has exceeded all of my expectations!  This film is absolutely brilliant!<br/><br/>Unlike the first part of LOTR, this movie is a montage of stories - the ongoing journey of Frodo & Sam, the whereabouts of Merry & Pippin & the mission of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli.  This very collection of stories is what makes this movie better than the first & keeps us on the edge of our seats throughout!  <br/><br/>The scenery is breathtaking (what a great ad for New Zealand!), the casting is perfect, and the special effects are awesome.  Comedy relief in this movie came from, not Merry & Pippin, but Gimli & Gollum (probably not intentionally funny!) who comes across as both cute, yet frightening with his double personality.  Treebeard and the rest of the Ents were unexpectedly cool to watch, the Orcs and Uruk-hai were disgusting and menacing and Aragorn was just plain gorgeous (like I said, great casting! ;-D)!<br/><br/>There are bits that seem slow and dull, but then you can't have non-stop action for 3 hours straight!  Even so, the pace of this second installment of LOTR is a lot quicker and is action packed throughout.<br/><br/>The whole movie contains so many 'best bits' that it's hard to just pick one!  But I have to say the battle of Helms Deep is probably THE best battle scene I had even seen on the big screen!  <br/><br/>If you haven't already seen 'The Two Towers' then I recommend you go see it NOW!!!  This is a film not to be missed!<br/><br/>[Just for fun: Look out for the Ent extinguishing his firey head as the water comes gushing in towards the end of the film!]"

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","0","29 December 2002"," 2 TOWERS: Vast improvement over Fellowship
","With the Fellowship of the Ring, I felt I got my money's worth in effects and action, but the characters and emotions lagged behind all the scene-changing.  With the Two Towers, the balance has been restored.  Unlike the Fellowship, which feels like a very incomplete though incredibly epic film, the Two Towers has a certain beginning and end to it.  Also, the characterizations are well worth watching.  Strangely enough, though, the characters to watch are NOT those of the Fellowship: the two TOWERING performances here are those of Bernard Hill as King Theodain, and Andy Sperkis as Gollum, perhaps the strongest, most riveting and humanistic CG/actor creation since Yoda. <br/><br/>    The nighttime mono/dialogue in the forest between Gollum's two selves had me bent forward into my seat, peering with wonder as I only remember doing about 2 years back, hearing for the first time Leonard Shelby's bedside monologue in Memento about wondering how he can ever heal if he ""can't feel time.""  Meanwhile, King Theodain's slow and quite believable rise from a vegetable on a throne to a true warrior was just as inspiring, and Hill brings both subtlety and honor to his acting.  People in the theater wept as he wept, and cheered as he rode into battle.<br/><br/>   The story advances briskly, and though both Ian McKellen and Cate Blanchett are given short shrift, Frodo's relation to the ring is further developed.  I said in my review last year that Frodo needed to get a little angry, and uh...I got my wish.  The action sequences are incredible, but so are the little moments.  <br/><br/>   In short, this film IS what EMPIRE STRIKES BACK was to STAR WARS, a dose of extra adrenaline, humanity, darkness, character, wonder, and complexity to what was up until then a fairy tale.  I HOPE THE THIRD CHAPTER FOLLOWS IN ITS FOOTSTEPS!"

","And what a beginning it is. The Two Towers gives closure from the Fellowship of the Ring, and then whets the appetite for the stirring grand finale in Return of the King. Director Peter Jackson again manages to capture the wonder and magic of Middle Earth in this film and splay it on a reeled canvas for all to see, and he even makes it seem easy.<br/><br/>Just as it's predecessor, the Two Towers is filled with breath-taking cinematography, cutting-edge computer animation and stellar performances. The new cast members, primarily Bernard Hill as King Theoden and Miranda Otto as Lady Eowyn of Rohan, make powerful additions to the story. Not forgetting of course, the highly imaginative and troubled Gollum, who sets a new standard for computer animation in film. So much of what I had imagined when reading the books, Jackson brought to life on screen in an unforgettable way.<br/><br/>For the three hours I spent in the theatre watching this film, I couldn't tear my eyes away for a moment. It will keep you laughing, jumping and cheering from beginning to end. If you see any movies this holiday season, try to take this one in, your imagination will thank you.<br/><br/>""Let this be the hour when we draw our swords together!"""
"cacikra","Null","0","0","29 December 2002"," Better the second time around
","Just some thoughts on the film after a second viewing . . . As others have indicated here, the film takes two viewings to appreciate. Like many Tolkien fans, my expectations and anticipation are too high the first time around. The scale of the film is so huge, there is just too much to take in. As with FOTR, I think I'll like it more each time I see it. Another thought occurs after seeing Gangs of New York . . . the ""historicity"" of Peter Jackson's Middle-earth is more believable than the ""real"" history of Civil War-era NYC (operatic stylistic excesses taken into account). Another telling point (well, probably just tells about ME, but . . .): As I was returning from the restroom about an hour into Gangs, I had the overwhelming urge to ditch the whole thing and duck into the other theatre showing TTT. So kudos to Jackson for making it authentic to a past that never existed; there are sooo many ways he could have screwed this up . . . Let's make Merry a girl . . . let's pare this Fellowship down to some manageable numbers . . . let's change the names of Saruman and Sauron (too similar for the average viewer) . . . Ye gad. Let's just be thankful for what we have!"

","This second part of the Rings trilogy is better than the first installment, but that's not saying much. There is no excuse for a film that is so complicated and convoluted you must read the book before going to the film. Or, they should include a `Guide to Middle Earth' with each ticket purchase.<br/><br/> Just like the story's walking trees, the film lumbers along slowly and awkwardly. The editing is a bore, the dialogue is a bore, the characters, with a couple exceptions, are a bore. Gorgeous vistas, elaborate effects don't make up for such a dark, ponderous, pretentious and emotionally flat film. In three monotonous hours absolutely nothing brought me to the edge of my seat. Even comic relief was sparse for and adventure yarn. The much-touted climatic battle scenes are unremarkable. They are just plain cluttered with a godzillion warriors milling around like ants at a picnic. <br/><br/>
Unless you're a Toliken buff, this film is marginally entertaining if you've got nothing better to do for three hours. Just go find yourself a nice soft theater seat that *reclines.* You're in for a snooze between fight scenes."

","Well what can I say besides can anyone find anything in the movie that relates to the book besides names?  Ok I exaggerate a little, but they just appeared to be trying to use every hollywood trick at once to improve what would have been a great movie without them and in doing so ruin it.  Since when did Celeborn die at Helm's deep?  Where in the books did Aragorn go over the cliff?  It looks as though they just used the name ""Lord of the Rings"" in order to generate profit on this one, not something that should ever be inflicted upon purists.

"schappe1","Null","0","0","24 December 2002"," Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, James Bond and Star Trek
","It used to be that the big action films and their sequels came out in the summer but that seems to be changing. Recently, the latest entries in four of the most famous film series of all time were released and I decided to see them all and perhaps compare them. The two older ones, James Bond and Star Trek, have shown their age in recent years, both of them often rehashing old plots and situations. The two newer ones, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, have caught the imagination of the public and have produced some of the most popular and admired movies of our time. To my surprise, I liked the old geezers better than the now more celebrated newcomers. I just found them more exciting and more entertaining. Isn't that what you pay a ticket for?<br/><br/>I didn't care for the first Lord of the Rings, called ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". I was amazed by the special effects, which surpassed anything that I had seen before. The story, however seemed more like a protracted nightmare than an adventure. The heroes lacked any sense of esprit de corps. They looked more like the victims in a horror film, wondering if they were going to survive through the next scene. I just wanted it to end. Critics and friends said this one was better and I did like it more. There were more scenes that took place in the daylight. there was more humor, such as the Yogi Berraisms of the walking trees, (""You are small so you could be right""), and a fascinating character in Gollum, with his split personality paralleling the story of the ring, with the characters battling their darker natures. But it's still a three hour tour through a nightmare given by a cast of Lears. The battle scenes are spectacular, (the effects are even better than in the first film) and horrific. The army of Uruks with their Freddy Krueger faces and mounts that are described as wolves but snarl like grizzly bears are far more frightening than the Cylons of the Star Wars films but not much more effectual. Frodo Baggins has to be the least interesting epic hero of our times. I grew up with D'Artanian and Luke Skywalker. This is quite a comedown. Elijah Woods brings a worried look and little else to the role. Lord of the Rings has more meat on it's bones than other action films but it's not really entertaining in the truest sense.<br/><br/>
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was much more enjoyable than the first Lord of tthe Rings. It has plenty of action and was full of British whimsy and humor. The child-heroes had real charm. I looked forward to the new one, ""The Chamber of Secrets"". I liked it, too but not quite as much. The whimsy and wonder was more sublimated to fright-night horrors and an ending that seemed more like something out of Lord of the Rings. Perhaps they are trying to compete? They even have a dwarf character who is somewhat the equivalent of Gollum but not very similar or as interesting. I think Harry should use his wits and his magic to save the day, not a sword.<br/><br/>
The last James Bond film I saw was on a plane to Hawaii. It was called ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and gave me no desire to see another one. It was all chase scenes and violent students while a glum-looking Pierce Brosnan never seemed to ruffle his Arrow shirt. There was no discernible plot or characterization. the whole thing simply seemed like an ad for a video game. ""Die Another Day"" proved to be a pleasant surprise. Bond is humanized by being captured and tortured for 14 months in a North Korean prison. He then is accused of spilling secrets by his own people, from whom he escapes and goes on a one man quest for revenge. As the movie goes on, this promising beginning evaporates and we go back to the video game absurdities, including Bond wind-surfing a seismic wave. But Halle Berry is worth a look and the film is never boring.<br/><br/>Star Trek: Nemesis, while dismissed by critics, (as usual), proved to be the pick of the litter. It has as much action as the other series, (without overkill). It provides us with human characters we can really relate to and a story that is about something. In this case, it is about the very thing the film's critics complains it lacks: youth. The hero used to be a cocky, ambitious young officer wanting to make a name for himself. He's grown beyond that and now confronts a cloned version of himself with all the traits he used to possess, magnified by a childhood ordeal and now possessing great power. Captain Picard has to use what he knows about himself and what he has learned to win the day. He's helped by Data who effectively regresses to an earlier version of himself and will now have to retake the journey of experience and wisdom. There is more useful thought in this film than in the others combined and just as much excitement.<br/><br/>
But now I feel a great desire to see something about real people living real lives with real problems. It would be a welcome change."

","The second part of this epic trilogy has been masterfully crafted on film. I found myself deeply moved by the emotional richness of The Two Towers, though it be in darker spirits than the first.<br/><br/>Acting was high caliber (for the most part) bringing each character's strengths and frailties to life. Gollum takes my Best Actor award as well as compliments on FX.<br/><br/>Battle scenes were aplenty, if a little too fast-paced at times for my taste. Cinematography and score left little to be desired; though I wondered where ""Lux Aeterna"" resounded!<br/><br/>Do not attempt to compare the book and the film too closely. They are different media, each with their own inherent strengths and failings. I feel Jackson did an excellent job of stitching together the complexities of this story in the ever-so-short time alloted, balancing well struggles both epic and personal. Most importantly, he captured the essence of looming despair and the undying flicker of hope that made The Two Towers my favorite in the trilogy.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you do not shed tears when you see ""Arwen's Mortal Love"" sequence (as I like to call it), then you have not felt the movie, nor do you possess the capacity to appreciate pure cinematic bliss."

","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>In my opinion, FOTR was a brilliant film. I rated it a 10.0 here (the Extended DVD version).  For me, as for many others, it laid to rest any doubts that Peter Jackson could pull off the impossible and create a truly worthy, magnificent film version of LOTR, one which even Tolkien would likely have been proud.   I honestly must say that after viewing The Two Towers, those doubts have returned for me.<br/><br/>When I left the theatre after having viewed FOTR for the first time, I had a few quibbles about PJ's interpretation, but in general I felt thrilled and elated and raring to see it again. This time I came out feeling let down and a little short-changed and wanting to see it again just to give it the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Part of this reaction was because I had read too many advanced reviews which built my expectations too high.  And part of it was because, as so many others have pointed out, TTT is more of an action/battle novel while FOTR was very character/quest driven.<br/><br/>But these rationalizations are letting PJ off the hook too easily. In my opinion, he released a product that could have been significantly better, given the time he had to complete it.<br/><br/>Like others who have criticized TTT, I felt that Jackson gave short shrift to the hobbits, particularly Merry and Pippen. I loved the banter between M & P that existed in FOTR.  In TTT, the two basically just sat on Treebeard's arms with their mouths agape.  What didn't help was that the CGI quality of the Ent sequences was well below that of the rest of the movie. I've read that Jackson cut ou a lot of Ent material(the Ent draught scene in particular), material that will likely go back into the extended DVD, so this might help things. And he'll probably work on improving the quality of the animation renderings as well (he did that in the first movie).<br/><br/>I felt that Frodo's characterization was surprisingly weak.  At the end of FOTR, Frodo was resolute as he viewed the plains of Mordor. At the beginning of TTT, he appeared already half-delirious from the influence of the ring. The passage of time was not just rushed; it was non-existent.<br/><br/>Also as countless others have stated, I felt that Faramir was shortchanged to some degree.  He was a more noble, likeable character in the novel. But frankly, the change wasn't nearly as bad as I had expected. He was not a clone of Boromir. Having just reread the book, I would challenge anyone to prove that PJ's characterization of Faramir was that far off the mark. Yes he was portrayed as more cold and distant than he appeared in Tolkien's novel, but not by any stretch did he covet the ring as did Boromir. Nor did I find the trip to Osgiliath particularly objectionable.<br/><br/>IMO, these criticisms are relatively minor compared to my main criticism: that the ending was a butchered edit job.  A build-up of two hours to the battle of Helms Deep emphasizing the Rohirrim's feeling of despair and utter hopelessness of being vastly outnumbered, a great sequence of battle scenes, and then in the space of 5 minutes, it's over.  Gandalf appears on Shadowfax on a hillside, and the Uruk Hai basically run for their lives.  Ten thousand creatures that 'don't know pain, don't know fear'  turn tail at the site of 300 men on horseback. That's not the way it happened in the book. It was the Huorn (trees) that saved the day.  I guess Jackson felt that it was too much to ask the viewing audience to accept the Ents/trees saving the day twice (Helms Deep and Isengard).  That thinking in itself is OK.  But he could have drawn out the fighting sequences after Gandalf and the Rohirrim appeared. The battle was simply over too quickly.<br/><br/>Worse, the climax with Gandalf was treated almost as an aside. The scene of the wizard and the riders of Rohan charging down the mountain was not even presented in 'real time' in the movie. Instead it was simply a backdrop to Sam's hokey motivational speech to Frodo. The intermingled scenes of Gandalf and the Ent's flooding of Isengard played second fiddle to this speech, which frankly was so corny, I cringed a little in my seat.<br/><br/>
Even worse, the final ending scenes paled in their impact compared to that in FOTR. I don't buy the excuse that this had to be because TTT was the middle movie. The end of FOTR was beautifully and intelligently scripted and was very emotional. In particular, the scene with Frodo standing in silence on the banks of the river with the ring in his hand was one of the highlights of the movie for me, and one of the reasons why I could return to watching it again and again. In contrast, TTT just ENDS.  There's no sense of suspense or drama. To me, it came across as if PJ was editing the movie, realized that it was 2 hours and 59 minutes long, and said to himself ""Oh my god, I've only got one minute left!  I'll just throw in this quick pan of Shelob's mountain and be done with it!"" In my opinion, he should have continued the plot right up until the brink of the confrontation with Shelob.<br/><br/>Two other minor criticisms: the make-up job on the pre-exorcised Theodin was way over the top.  Yes, he was possessed. But couldn't Jackson had made the point more subtly?  It's like he didn't trust the audience's intelligence and had to hit them over the head by turning Theodin into a caricature.<br/><br/>
And the confrontation of Frodo with the black rider on the back of the flying creature (not nearly as frighteningly rendered as the black horses in FOTR): why was that necessary? It undermined one of the main sources of suspense in Tolkien's novels: that Frodo and Sam manage to stay just outside the view of Mordor.<br/><br/>For these reasons, I rate TTT an 8.0.  And I think that's being generous. In fairness, I am going to see this movie again (but probably only once again, in contrast to the fifteen times that I have scene FOTR), mostly to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if my opinion of it improves upon further viewing.<br/><br/>Also in fairness, I had let my expectations build to the point that the movie could not do anything but disappoint.  After all, these two movies together represent possibly the greatest epic ever to be filmed, and the third is hopefully going to be a return to the quality of the first. Though I must admit that I now have some doubts, something I would NOT have said after seeing FOTR.<br/><br/>Also, on the plus side, the animation of Gollum was IMHO just AWESOME.

","This second movie in the trilogy, can by no means match the first one. But as some people already stated, it would have been like comparing two different pieces of a jig-saw puzzle. But anyhow, the magic transfered from the books into the first installment is almost all gone in this second movie. The only thing that really shines through is the wonderful characterization of Gollum as well as the interpretation of Gandalf the White. Everything else is just a great Hollywood movie, excellent at it, but on its way it has lost the magic from the books. In fact; I no longer relate to this movie as a visualization of Tolkien's work. Perhaps it partly is because of the altered plot, as well as the exclusions of crucial parts. The Two Towers is my favorite book in the trilogy mainly because the wonderful description of the Ents and the Elves leaving the men behind to fight their war on their own. This totally disappears, but hopefully there is at least more scenes of the Ents in the upcoming extended version.<br/><br/>Never the less, this IS a great movie. Just a more mainstream one than the last one. A loss for the fans of Tolkien and a victory for Hollywood."

","Incredible and Brilliant! There are no other adjectives to describe the magnificence of this film! Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's truth to the screen, and I can't wait for Return of the King. This trilogy will quickly become one of the classic films of cinema history! I saw the flick three times on Opening Day, and will definitely be seeing it many more times! (And I obviously can't stop using exclamation marks!) The acting was superb! Elijah Wood just sucked all the energy out of me, because my heart went out to this poor hobbit over and over and over! What a talented young actor! Andy Serkis deserves any and all awards he receives in the future, because he brought Gollum to life in a way I never thought possible. The elves are just incredible. The Ents were just stupendous! I did feel at times that a few of them were a little cartoony (Dark Crystal-ish even), but who knows what real walking talking trees look like! I felt that the movie WAS sorely lacking in Merry and Pippin scenes and action, and yet it worked. However, I do expect more in the DVD! :) The stunning eye candy that this movie throws at you is just reason enough to see it a million times, and the story is another million. the cast and crew definitely deserve all praise they get, because they have accomplished a masterpiece. Although I found that the music wasn't as memorable as the first, it picked up on all the beautiful themes and underscored all the emotion perfectly. I sat at the end of the credits and just yearned for Return of the King to be placed before me. One more year??? Yeah...we can do it. Incredible...did I mention that?"

","This movie I give a 7 out of 10. After reading the book I was just a bit disappointed because they left a lot but added scenes to make up for it. I was extremely dissappointed when I found out there would be no scene where Pippin looks in the Palantir.<br/><br/>The characters have the same qualities. The comic releif goes towards Gimli, Gollum, Pippin, and Treebeard while the action aspects go to Legolas, Aragorn, Gandalf, Eomer, and Ugluk. The new characters are awesome and portray there wholes exactly like the book. Grima Wormtounge I have to say was the best.<br/><br/>The Scenes that left you at the edge of you seat the most include: Helms Deep, The Black Gates, The Wargs, The Olipaunt, The Ents taking over Isengard, and Gandalf healing Theoden.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was good but just needed the extra touches that Tolien describes in his excellent novel."

","WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I think it's silly and stupid that so many people think that TTT should follow the book so closely, HELLO!  ITS A MOVIE PEOPLE!  If Peter Jackson were to follow those books like you wanted him too it would make them even longer, and as far as I'm concerned they're long enough, (though still a good movie).  As for adding in scenes that were not in the book, Peter did this because unfortunately Tolkien did not think it would be good to have even a shred of an important female character, this would leave the female audience something sadly lacking if he didn't exagerate some of his parts a bit.  As for the unneeded river scene, although I don't care for it it's not like it ruined the movie.  If you guys have to be so stuck up and just look at the parts he added or deleted and think of how that doesn't follow the book you shouldn't even watch movies to begin with.  A movie should not follow the book word for word, it should have something extra that the director adds to make it his own.  I would be angry, actually, if he kept everything, it's not like he took out anything so major it wrecks the movie. TTT is, right now, my favorite movie of all time.  Yes, I've read the books and so have all my friends and it is still our favorite movie.  If you guys want to go trash it just because it didn't follow the books perfectly at least think movies need something a bit more that books don't have (and vice versa).  Anyway, I just had to write this down because it's really irritating me that so many people think movies should reflect books.<br/><br/>As far as this movie goes I think it is 10/10.  It really is a great movie, it has something for everyone.  Action, romance, suspense and even a bit of comedy.  I love how they captured the characters and I believe it really does follow the book nicely, as far as movies should go that is."

"wally440","Null","0","0","24 December 2002"," The characters are the story
","Spoiler Alert!! As a diehard Tolkien fan I know that my standards are a tad high, and I've kept that in mind while watching these movies, but Peter Jackson has gone too far.  Skewing the plot a bit, leaving sections out, changing some of the details of the story, all of these are completely acceptable to me.  I know the movies can't be exactly like the books.  But Jackson has changed the attitudes, perceptions, and the feelings of Tolkien's characters to the point where they are no longer recognizable to me.  The characters that Tolkien created in his books are most of what makes this story so great. Change the plot, skip some sections, add more action, I don't care!  But please please please don't destroy these characters!!!<br/><br/>
Things that were not right at all: Elrond has been portrayed in these movies as an angry, somewhat overbearing father who has a resentment for non-elves . . . men in particular. Anyone who's read the books ONCE knows that this isn't true.  Elrond was always a wise loremaster, kind in disposition, and grim only to his enemies. Aragorn was all but a son to him, as Aragorn basically grew up in Rivendell.  He never forbade the love between Aragorn and Arwen, he only told Aragorn that he would not give his blessing until Aragorn had achieved his kingdom.<br/><br/>Theoden started off well, but after Gandalf released him from Saruman's spell, Theoden continued to act almost belligerent towards Aragorn and Gandalf.  Again, this goes completely against the original character.  An argument here or there would have been ok, but they made him almost seem cowardly, at least until the very end of the battle at Helm's Deep. Theoden, in the books, was still an old man when Gandalf released him, but he was eager for battle with Saruman.  Yes he encountered difficulties and nearly was defeated at Helm's Deep, but he was never afraid or even ill-tempered.  Grim, determined, and full of spirit is how I would describe Theoden.<br/><br/>Faramir was an absolute failure in my opinion.  In the books he is seen as a grim captain who, although younger and less esteemed than his brother Boromir, had a greater wisdom.  He never coveted the Ring and did what he could to help Frodo.  Yes he was suspicious of Frodo and Sam at first, and likewise they were fearful of him, especially when they learned he was Boromir's brother.  But neither Faramir nor anyone in his company was ever seduced by the Ring.<br/><br/>
Things that were not quite right: I think they did Eowyn an injustice by making her pine so much for Aragorn. The most prominent thing about her character is her will to fight. Basically they gave her one small dialogue to explain that in her heart she was a warrior, and then for the rest of the movie they made her swoon over Aragorn.  I believe that they could fix this in Return of the King, but based on what I've seen thus far they probably won't.<br/><br/>I was a little disappointed with the ents and Treebeard's unwillingness to fight, but I suppose that Peter Jackson wanted to work on Merry and Pippin more.  It did not go against character for Merry and Pip to encourage the ents to go to war.  This didn't happen in the books, but I can understand Jackson's development of Merry and Pip over Treebeard.  At any rate, they all came through fairly well by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>
Things that were right: I do want to congratulate Jackson on the portrayal of Gandalf in The Two Towers.  No real complaints there.  On a sidenote, Shadowfax was a dark horse, not white.  I know I know, minor detail.  Shadowfax is a character of his own though and I feel that he deserves some mention.<br/><br/>Bar none, the thing that stands out as the biggest success in this movie is the portrayal of Frodo, Sam and Smeagol/Gollum.  The interaction of these 3(4) was all but perfect.  The Ring's increasing hold on Frodo and how that plays into his relationships with Sam and Smeagol took some good acting from Elijah Wood and he delivered.  I was even more impressed with Sean Astin's performance.  He played the ever-devoted Sam to perfection and his suspicion of Gollum was right on.<br/><br/>The truly astounding thing was Gollum and the emerging Smeagol.  CG rendering aside, this character was a work of art.  The way the 2 personalities emerged and interacted was incredible.  Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar.  Not only did he do the voice acting but he modeled the animation of the character as well.  I'd be hard pressed to find another performance that was so true to the character.<br/><br/>Well I've already taken way too long.  I wanted this to be a short review. So here it is in a nutshell.  On its own this is a great film.  Wonderful acting, superb effects, and a mesmerizing world.  Beware though, you are not seeing The Two Towers that Tolkien wrote, too much has been done to change the characters.  I think many fans of the books will feel betrayed by this movie, despite the success of many of the individual performances."
"bryanlaszlo","9","0","0","24 December 2002"," A worthy second chapter!
","I must begin by congratulating the cast and crew- especially Peter Jackson- on a magnificent job.  Bringing one of the most analyzed, beloved and discussed book-trilogies to cinema is a true feat.  The Two Towers continues what began as a masterpiece and pushes it to legendary status.  I firmly believe the final installment will make the series a true classic.<br/><br/>The Two Towers begins pretty much where FotR left off.  I'll spare you the synopsis as so many have been given already.  The movie does a remarkable job in tying together the widespread events that form the second book of the Rings trilogy, and of course the director had to make several adaptations to make the journey enjoyable and sensible for the viewer.  Also, the story becomes less intimate as the characters are swept up into events larger than themselves (though, naturally, their contributions weigh heavily in the outcome).<br/><br/>I say this because purists are howling and gnashing teeth about the numerous story changes.  Where they all 'necessary'?  Maybe not, but if you judge the movie on its own merits, it is an amazing triumph.<br/><br/>The effects are incredible.  Gollum, the much-mentioned CGI character voiced (and motion-acted) by Andy Serkis, is the new standard for such characters. The battle for Helm's Deep is intense and epic in scope.  The Ents are enjoyable and a nice take on a Tolkien's vision.  Overall, the picture is technically superior to FotR largely because of Gollum.<br/><br/>Pacing-wise, the movie will need a little help that hopefully will be addressed in the inevitable 'extended-cut'.  There are scenes between Aragorn and the elves which seem a little disjointed and negatively affect the flow of the story.  These scenes are a minor blemish in an awesome overall effort.<br/><br/>See the movie, enjoy it, and make a note to never, ever tick off the Ents!"

When I initially heard he was directing, I was horrified (just watch The Frighteners).<br/><br/>My only complaint would be the Ents were less than awe inspiring.  If they took the time to make Gollum mind blowing in looks, spend some time on the Ents.  Also, the end battle sequence was a little long.

","My wife did, and she was the one who dragged me to this thing against my wishes. Ok, I'm admittedly not a fantasy fan, and I'm probably the only person back in my high school in the 70's that didn't have any desire to read the novels, and still haven't to this day. With that said, the special effects were brilliant, and the cinematography superior. But for the life of me, I cannot understand the affection for the main Hobbit characters, they're boring, boring and more boring. The only thing I found entertaining besides the effects was Smeagol, or whatever its name is, that thing stole the show. I was also forced to see the first movie, and I thought that one would never end. Ditto for this one. Can hardly wait for the next one in a couple of years.

","Although not an LOTR fan, this was an incredible movie. I saw some of the digital effects on TV prior to going to the show and the movie held up to its end of the bargain: it was rich in stunning special effects, with realistic CG characters that offered life-like AI. Indeed, the massive combat scene towards the end was well worth the wait. While many of my fellow movie goers felt the need to wander out into the lobby, I was compelled to watch the entire thing. Spellbinding, I was glued to my seat for most of the entire 3 hour ordeal. The ending, which is really a beginning, left me feeling cheated and wanting more. Sadly, this movie will probably fade away in a few years due to its length, but I look forward to watching sequel in this (trilogy?). Elija Wood makes a great lead character into a device that compels the audience into the story even further than the original.<br/><br/>

I am tired of movies that are really terrific including cheesy filler in the dialogue--which occurs frequently between Gimli and Legolas during very serious battle scenes.  Moreover, the pitiful attempts at romance were strained at best.  The battle scene, which was one of the best I have ever scene on film, was interrupted several times to delve further into the parallel stories.  I felt that this detracted from the battle, which was the climax of the movie and should have developed uninterrupted. So--right now I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I loved the first one, and I am trying very hard to endorse this one.  Overall, it is definitely worth viewing at the theater, and I will definitely buy the DVD.

","Contains Spoiler While definitely taking the story on from the reins of its predecessor, the Two Towers is a movie where the good of the original is twisted. Helms Deep is awesome, as is the added character development of Gollum.  The Two Towers book is cut down the middle, the first part being the Rohan part, and the other about Sam Frodo and Gollum.  The way the movie is shot is expected, however, cutting up a battle scene takes away its intensity. And it was never over.  They never finished.  They never finsihed a lot of things in this movie.  The entire film, in my opinion, was never finished. The film would have been utterly spectacular if it were recut, reedited, to be more fluid, then have the battle of Helms Deep be the climax, the victory and Frodo's release from Faramir to go to Mordor would do well to be the aftermath.  Even that would have sufficed as an ending. Still, if it were an excellant film, Saruman would have been disarmed by Gandalf, and Merry and Pippin would have been reunited at the end.  Yeah. On the other hand, Frodo would start his trek into Mordor. I will wait for a reedited film.  The director really didn't understand the Two Towers, how the middle is SO important to the LOTR as a whole. Tampering with a plot line and a plot structure after 40 years of utterly enchanting millions of readers is no way to immortalize these films. Just as an aside, I heard that the spider scene was saved for the Return of the King.  I have also heard that there will be no scouring of the Shire in the Return of the King."

","Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers is for this trilogy what The Empire Strikes Back was for Star Wars.  I don't know that The Return of the King will manage to be quite the film that this one is.  The forboding and intensity is something that the finale by its very nature simply cannot be. I am a big fan of the middle chapter of any work because that is where the soul of the work lies.  True drama lies in the characters and their struggles. Gollum is a wonder to behold.  And despite the claims of many critics, The Ents are an awesome screen presence (They are my favorite characters in the novel).  Their final attack on Saruman's Tower is one of the film's most incredible sights. The only real issue I have with the film is the meandering middle section.  The Gondor/Rohan scenes are a bit of a drag.  I personally enjoy films like this when they are showing me new and wonderful sights.  The human story is a bit blah at times.  Though it does culminate in the awesome battle of Helm's Deep, which is probably the best battle scene I've seen. Gimli the dwarf makes for perfect comic relief, especially as he tells Aragorn ""Don't tell the elf you tossed me"". The opening is wonderful as we hear the voice of Gandalf echoing through the stunning Middle Earth mountains and delightfully recognize where we are in the story. A fabulous movie that surpasses The Fellowship of the Ring."
"SpaceMonkey928","10","0","0","24 December 2002"," Stop comparing the movie to the book!
","It bothers me that all these extreme Tolkien fans swarm the message boards complaining that the movie is too different from the book. First of all, Peter Jackson warned that TTT would differ from the books more than the other movies. Obviously, some things have to be changed in the translation from book to screen. Film is a completely different medium and doesn't allow for all the information a book provides. Because of this, we don't get the full background on Faramir and whatnot. Also, remember that the movie is three hours long! This is obviously why Shelob was cut out - to be moved to ROTK.<br/><br/>People obviously are liking TTT a lot - it has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and currently is number 9 on the top 250 films on the IMDB. But it still bothers me that Tolkien purists dislike it so much. Judge the movie on what it IS, not what it's based on. The movie has a life of its own, and although it may not be exactly the same as the book, that's not reason to curse Peter Jackson and everyone who worked on the movie, who I'm sure love the books as much as you do, if not more. Jackson and the gang have put an immense amount of care into the movies, and it shows on screen. To strike down all the work that they've put into it with one sentence - ""THIS MOVIE SUCKS AND PETER JACKSON IS THE ANTICHRIST"" or something to that effect - is terrible. Every change that has been made has been made FOR A REASON. If you want something as perfect as the books, then go read them again! But, if you want to experience an incredible film that is every bit as magnificent as the book it's based on, The Two Towers will not disappoint."

","Well, roughly 720 comments in ... there probably isn't much I can say that hasn't been repeated a few dozen times in other posts.  But, oh well, I've always enjoyed redundancy (and I do have a few new things).  Not to mention I also enjoy redundancy.<br/><br/>First off, let's get one thing straight.  This is a good movie.  A VERY good movie.  Compared to any other movie you'll see this coming year, chances are they won't come close.  It was action packed, the cgi and setting was engrossing, and the 3hr or so running time went by very quickly.<br/><br/>HOWEVER!<br/><br/>This movie simply was not as good as the first one.  There were many things that either broke up the flow, or undermined the amount of suspense that could've otherwise been built into the movie. This movie could've been perhaps among the best of all time, but due to some planning errors it turned out to just be extremely good.<br/><br/>Cases in point:<br/><br/>*spoilers throughout*<br/><br/>1. The Gandalf fight with the balrog at the beginning.<br/><br/>This fight was cool as hell, and was a pretty good way to open the movie, BUT one of the coolest things about experiencing the story the first time (reading the book) is thinking that Gandalf is probably really dead and then when he does finally make his appearance as the White Rider, he's the coolest thing on 2 legs.  In the movie this is spoiled since we know he's most likely alive from the outset, and then when there's talk of the White Rider and Gandalf does finally show up it is something we've just been sitting around waiting for, not a shocking surprise that adds to the legend that is (or should be) Gandalf. In the book you don't really even know how the hell he got out of that extremely sticky situation, and it almost adds to the awe.<br/><br/>2. Aragorn's fall down the cliff.<br/><br/>Waste of time.  Happened to Gandalf and we knew he was okay.  What was the point of doing basically the same thing over again with Aragorn? Totally redundant and unsuspenseful.<br/><br/>3. Gimli the Disney character.<br/><br/>After reading many posts I see I wasn't the only one annoyed with his complete demotion to comical sideshow.  On the plus side he WAS often funny. On the minus side, he was no longer Gimli the bada** from the book, he became Gimli the stooge.  What's worse than this however, much worse, is his jokes constantly undermined the tension and danger that should've been building with the Helm's Gate battle. More than a couple times things were looking bad, we were getting worried about our heroes and their present situation, and then Gimli says/does something goofy that totally takes us out of the story and reminds us these people are really in no peril at all because they're the heroes and this is nothing but a movie. A basic rule is: When people are engrossed in a dangerous situation, it's usually not a good idea to make them laugh.  I know they were just trying to lighten things up due to the darkness of this second film, but Jackson should've just gone with the darkness.  Sometimes things are dark for a reason.<br/><br/>4. The cuts to Treebeard<br/><br/>Treebeard was pretty cool, but everytime they cut to these scenes I could feel the movie go straight into a pile of sludge. Pip and Merry on his shoulder, Helm's Deep, Pip and Merry on his shoulder, repeat, etc. I don't think they could've picked a worse point in time to put the Treebeard thread. Add in the Gimli distractions to these cuts to Treebeard and to me it really hurt what could've been an amazing sequence.<br/><br/>5. Orcs WAY too wussy.<br/><br/>The first movie also suffered from this pretty badly, but there I don't think it hurt the story.  Here it does.  Orcs apparently are easier to kill than flies, and therefore why should I worry about these people at Helm's Deep?  Seeing Aragorn and Gimli alone on the bridge against the entire orc army and not being completely over-run was excessively lame, almost unforgivably so.  That scene shouldn't have ever made the movie, and once again took me right out of the story.  The horses splitting through the orc army like water as they sped out of Helm's Deep was also lame. In the actual fighting scenes from Helm's Deep I never really got the feeling that a BATTLE which could go either way was occuring. It just looked fantastic, and that's all.<br/><br/>6.  Intrusive music.<br/><br/>For all of you that will buy this movie and watch it a million times (like I will probably), watch for this. There are scenes of dialogue and events where not much is happening really, but this dramatic music is just blaring, almost drowning out their speech.  I got the feeling that if Jackson was to film 2 regular people drinking coffee and reading the morning paper it'd be accompanied by a 50 piece symphonic orchestra playing the most dramatic and emotionally charged music they could find. I found this very annoying.<br/><br/>7.  The revamped Faramir<br/><br/>While this scene was going on I was thinking back to the book trying to remember if Faramir ever took them back to Gondor. I didn't think so, and I know exactly why ... because it'd be dumb.  Up to this point we'd been following Frodo, Sam and Gollum go through Mordor, head up to the black gate,etc ...  They are on this supposedly dangerous trek and then suddenly... oh wait they're back in Gondor now. So they get to do everything over again?  Guess we just wasted our time watching them all this time.  Hell, let's just stick em back in the shire again and start the movie over.  I couldn't see anything that added to the movie by this little stunt of Jacksons.  If you wanted to put our triumvirate in danger or show the weakness of men or whatever, there's ample opportunities to do so without trivializing trekking through Mordor, as if going in and out is like going outside to fetch the mail.  Plus they treat Faramir as a dolt basically, instead of the very cool character he actually is.  I found it pointless. Unless they've got plans for him in the next movie, they might as well have just cut him out completely and not ruined the vibe Sam,Frodo and Goll had going.<br/><br/>
That's about it for my peeves tho.  Overall I did think it was a great movie, there were just a bunch of little things like those above that kept interrupting the flow for me, or that seemed pointless. Because of that I have to give the nod to the first movie, since I thought it did what it was suppose to do a bit better than this film."

But as for overall effect when *first watched* Fellowship tops TTT. As a movie, Fellowship is better. It develops the characters better (especially the 3.5 hour extended DVD version) and sets the stage. TTT has a slightly more blockbuster feel to it, but retains enough of the original Fellowship's style to remain true to the series. Lord of the Rings now comes close to tying the original Star Wars trilogy as the best movie series in my all time favorite movies list."

","A bit of this might be considered a **SPOILER** - so avoid it if you haven't seen it yet, or you don't want even the tiniest clue as to what might be in the 3rd film!<br/><br/>Is kevinm-4 serious? So Aragorn points with his left arm, not his right - oh, no! And what, please, is the difference between a yell and a bellow? I think kevinm-4 is winding up the geekier contributors and I treat his remarks accordingly. This is another great film, visually, technically and in the breadth of its vision. I don't like some of the plot deviations, either, but I do take the point about having to balance the various plot strands. But I still think Arwen's departure for the Grey Havens is an unnecessary twist - although if you know the story, the reasons for it, filmically, are apparent - and I think Faramir's brave speech in the cave, rejecting the Ring, would have come over well, made a great, stirring moment and contrasted well with his brother. That apart - go and see it, suspend disbelief, and immerse yourself for 3 hours in Middle-Earth.  Revel in a truly great cinema experience that has no swearing, unnecessary and irrelevant nudity, or sickening cynicism and depravity (apart from the orcs, and they're not human, so that's all right).

From the opening scene of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog, I could already tell that this was going to be one of the best movies of this decade.

"aidangill","5","0","0","24 December 2002"," Epic but deeply flawed, but that's mostly down to the books
","Peter Jackson has clearly rushed through the middle instalment in the Lord of the Rings cycle, with heavy over-use of CGI effects that may satisfy some but leave this observer mostly cold. In some ways, spending less time on The Two Towers is justified - after all, it is the weakest link in the original books (the first half of The Two Towers book is a very weak and ponderous piece of fantasy writing). However, the immense revenue and over-hype surrounding Fellowship (the film), along with the indulgence shown to Jackson in being permitted to release the 'director's cut' DVD so soon after the original film release, has taken the edge off his directorial skills. Three hours is way too long, for a start, particularly in a film which has little in the way of deep dramatic substance. This is really the Aragorn-character's film - he is centre stage and what little solid acting has been allowed by the director is usually on view through Aragorn. Jackson is not helped by Tolkien's wandering, skeletal plot - he has done well to bring Gollum to the fore and beef up the dialogue for this character (the vocalisation for Gollum is excellent - more evil and snivelling I haven't heard in a long time!). It is regrettable, though, that Gollum is wholly CGI - it's quite a feat of computer engineering but it is a very long way from being convincing. How many times do the lips truly move in sync with the dialogue, for example? (Not many!!) I have read reviews that rave about the Helm's Deep battle. Well on this point, the film couldn't have won me over just because I find extended close-up battle scenes increasingly depressing - does every 'epic' film these days really have to do all this over and over again? But that's my personal subjectivity; as battle scenes go it is rather splendid, but the epic scale is somewhat marred by the anonymity of most of the combatants, and some flawed CGI (though nowhere near as weak as the parasurfing incident in Die Another Day ...). Gladiator made much more impact on me. Another area in which the original text is weak, thus hampering the film, is the lack of a visible, Darth Vader-like enemy. Here in the film, Saruman is relegated almost to a couple of cameo scenes - what a waste of Christopher Lee! - and of course we never get to see the dreaded Sauron (true to the book but Jackson has taken welcome liberties with the text this time around, so why not more big bad guy?). The noble exception is Brad Dourif's excellent Wormtongue - he is truly creepy and was, for me, the high point of the film. Relegating Gimli to a comedy walk-on role, a la C3PO in Star Wars Ep 2, is a good thing after the messy performance in Fellowship. Rhys Davies get's a meatier role by far in the voiceover for Treebeard - I thought the Ents were well realised but almost looking like they were in the wrong film (i.e. would have looked great in a cartoon or a Final Fantasy-type CGI-only effort). I realise this will be a huge film in terms of popularity and takings, and good luck to Peter Jackson and the whole team - who, all things considered, are carrying off a marvel in terms of cutting-edge filming techniques. But as a film, it just didn't absorb me; I found the storyline tenuous and much less coherent than in Fellowship; I thought the CGI dominated the film, usually not to its benefit; and I left feeling impressed but a long way from being thrilled. It's a money machine now, and the books really don't stand up to critical scrutiny sufficiently to carry off the 'epic' tag for the film that many are lavishing on it. A film to reflect on in a few years' time - after the hype - to see just how it stands up in the hall of fame."

","Other viewers have made many comments, criticisms and comparisons and each are equally valid.  Rather than reiterate what they've said, I'll leave most of the praise/criticism aside.<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed this movie both times I saw it, and more so the second time.  Every movie I've ever seen has its faults, and this is no exception. The exception here is that I didn't care.  The faults disappeared amongst everything else that was transpiring on screen.<br/><br/>A number of viewers have commented on how ""different"" the movie is from the book.  However, having seen a number of movie adaptations of books (and read a number of novelisations of movies) I enjoy it more when the director takes a few liberties and throws me a surprise or gives me something to challenge me mentally.  A strict telling of the novel can often be boring and mundane. Nor may it translate to the silver screen well.  How often I've thought that I would love to see entirely different endings to the book.  Wouldn't it be radical to see evil triumph just once?  Jokes aside, let the director take some artistic licence.  Movies are not books, and nor are books movies. Enjoy each for its own accomplishments.  I've thoroughly enjoyed Tolkien's books and thoroughly enjoyed Jackson's movies.  They are both amazing in their own right, not exactly the same, but that makes them more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the DVD to come out and breathe even more life into Middle Earth."

"CGanim8t0r","Null","0","0","23 December 2002"," Remarkably well done
","OK I just got back from seeing it and unlike the first one this one had a much more epic mood, throughout is nothing but extreme battles to save mankind. THe Beginning was amazing ..and the middle was incredible .. the ending was astonishing. The graphics were beyond what your imagination can take you to - certainly a kick in the balls to star wars. The textures the dynamics  the realism ... will leave CG freaks like me drooling speechlessly.<br/><br/>The main reason why this movie kicks ass is cause there are three battles going on at the same time at different parts of the country. I loved the pacing of the movie this time, Eisendor got their ass kicked just in just enough time for their last hope to come in. The realism of Gollum takes alot more then just motion capture, and for that I REALLLLY acredit the special effects team and Jason Schleifer  since Gollum reminds me of this anorexic bitch I know from school. His role is of a bipolar schizofrenic( split personality) which in some parts is very humorus.For the ENTs, it's pretty obvoius why guardian Trees would fight for their 'kind' but when you get to see battle ......that @#%$ing  just owns. There is a specific group of bad guys that took part in the book in the Hobbit (if you've read it) they are called the Goblin Scouts, I wont ruin that part for you, cause that part I was really anticipating how PJ was gonna pull that off.... and yes that blew me away too. Legolas is still a bad ass elf, and Gimli plays a great comical role, Aarogon is becomign more noticed by his people, and Sam still fat yet faithful to his friend that is slowly being consumed by the ring. Excellent plot modification of the sequence of events.:rollin   certainly something no one should miss.<br/><br/>For those of you that like to so called 'analyze' the comparison between a book and movie...well analyze this... MOVIES ARENT MADE TO BECOME EXACT DUPLICATES OF THE BOOK.  NO ONE CARES WHICH PART THE DIRECTOR MISSED OUT. If its missed out and modified, its done for a perfectly GOOD REASON (ie film time, and broken down story telling for the feeble minded illiterates) If you read the trilogy, GOOD FOR YOU  NO ONE CARES. Movies are INTERPRETATIONS. If you are going to judge a movie derived down from a book judge it on how well the director tried to meet percisness and credit its actors, its script, and special effects to enhance the signitured parts of the story interpreted.<br/><br/>::COnsiderations you must take in hand before judging::::<br/><br/>1) NOT ALL PEOPLE READ BOOKS like we do..WE may very well be the last of the literate beings- seeing how the majority youth of the new generation  is falling due to television, which is the main part of the general public. This is One reason why the movie has to be well modified without the complex transitions minor events leading to the major events on after the other -- specifically modified so the general audience can have a piece of the fun too (as well as LOTR gurus) with out derailing off-track into the confusion of the true series of events but more or less a main general plot.<br/><br/>For example, Why do you think the  high vocabulary filled WALL STREET Journal isnt our daily newspaper? BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE SPEAKS 'Business and the fluctuation of the World's Economy' the main language of Stock marketers-brokers etc.. Face it! Thats just too many 'big' words for the general public, henceforth the reason why the METRO section was created for everyday public newspapers. They dilute such insane high intellectual knowledge into something more convenient and basic for everyone.<br/><br/>2)BUDGET and FILMING TIME- If they were to  accurately transfer the ENTIRE book (including the emotional detailed elongated parts to capture the audiences deep emotions and the transitoin parts to explaing the connection of certain events) into a movie, it would be as long as that gay ass DBZ series. Then people will complain that the movie was TOO LONG. ..But wait what if they fit the Entire book into the filming time Peter Jackson provides for each of his movies (3 hours per) for 3 movies ---then many emotional parts would be played too quickly enough for the audience to capture the real feeling for the developement of the characters.(ie Hobbit the cartoon- sucked major ass too @#%$n quick)(book obviously better)<br/><br/>So the main point is.. dont expect too much.<br/><br/>Be happy PJ so far has done a great job of interpretting this epic trilogy from an extraordinarily imaginative point of view. I dont think he's senile enough to pull a 'george lucas' move anytime soon."

","I am not a Tolkien-freak, though I read LOTR about once a year (about 20 times now, including once reading it out loud for my kids). I do like the book, and the world it is anchored in. It is simply great. And so are the movies, both of them. If I would have to pick I would take The Two Towers, simply because of the massive scenes at Helm's Deep. Truly amazing, if asked beforehand I would branded the task impossible, and even after hearing reliable eye-witness accounts I went into the theater quite sceptical. Not anymore, this film (and in all fairness probably the whole trilogy) really is a masterpiece, a milestone in the ever more shallow movie industry and something for future filmmakers to strive for. I was again transported to Middle-Earth, and though only for three measly hours I will still forever be grateful to anyone involved with this epic trilogy (I am quite convinced the third installment will be on par with the two other). Brilliant: 10/10.<br/><br/>I also think all nitpicking critics are plain wrong. And right, seen from another angle. JRR Tolkien wanted to create something that would serve as a sort of myth, an epic, a cultural backbone, something the anglosaxon culture really doesn't have (the Arthurian legends are mostly ""imported""). And what is a myth/epic other than a long storyline broken into shorter stories. Even LOTR is but a part (or actually six parts, considering) of the Middle Earth myth. The way stories are told are influenced by the teller, in this case Peter Jackson and his team (and the constraints placed upon him). And my honest opinion is that he succeeds marvelously in his telling. He simply brings Middle Earth alive in a way I could never even have hoped for.<br/><br/>Nagging about why he tells the story his way (and not some other way, of which there are myriads of alternatives) is irrelevant to the story, both for the teller and the audience. He is, and should be, telling A STORY, not delivering a carbon copy of a book. Just consider how many ways of (re-)telling the Iliad (and the parts thereof) that exists in print and film. What PJ as a director should do is stay true to the story, not the way it is presented in print. And I think he does precisely that, and magnificently! Discussing why some part of the book is important to the printed version is both interesting and fun, but should not be used to critique the film.<br/><br/>I honestly think PJ and his team handles the legacy of Tolkien with much gentler hands and more respect than all those imbecil idiots who since the publishing of LOTR have tried to convert the story into an allegory for this or that or something even worse. Am excellent example of this is the way CGI and SFX are used throughout the film (both of them), ONLY to serve the story, NEVER for it's own purpose. This, for me, shows beyond any doubt that what PJ and his team have tried to do is tell (their version of) the end of the Third Age of Middle Earth. And for that they should be both richly commended and rewarded.<br/><br/>So, the short version of all this is, pay your dues and go see the The Two Towers. But only after watching The Fellowship of The Ring first. And, of course, if you haven't already, read the (unabridged) book."

I saw it with a large group of friends and we were talking about it for a long time afterwards, but when I got home and my parents asked about it, all I could do was make a series of grunts to indicate I couldn't describe it yet. It needed to all sink in. After more previews than I've ever seen in one movie, it began. There was no recap, I was glad I'd recently re-watched LOTR: Fellowship SE on DVD, but the lack of a recap doesn't hurt the movie and serves to quicken the pace because that is truly what this movie is about: a faster pace. From the first scene of Gandalf and the Balrog to the final scene of...well that would be a spoiler, wouldn't it? This movie grabs you and doesn't let go EVER. At no point was I sighing and saying ""Come on! Come on! MOVE!!"" The only time I checked my watch was in distress because there wasn't much of the movie left. This whole cast amazed me in the first movie. Everyone seemed like they were born to play the roles, although if you check the trivia section of the site, you'll see that Viggo Mortensen was not the first, or even second choice of Aragorn. The second movie doesn't add many major characters, save Gollum and Theodred, but everyone is perfect, especially Gollum. Andy Serkis captures the voice and movements of Gollum PERFECTLY and to a tee. The special effects crew who created the CG ""skin"" for Serkis did an equally amazing job, making a CGI that was not only believable but able to express immense emotion and blend in almost seamlessly with the world around him. The battle of Helm's Deep was the most intense combat experience I've ever had at the movies. The battle rages for about 45 minutes and never drags. It amazingly incorporates computer effects and blends them with live actors, much like the first did with the battle at Mount Doom. The Ents are another amazing piece of CG work. Now, these are not so much complaints as they are observations. For book purists, this movie may disappoint. It's not faithful to the book in MANY places, but it never truly hurts the movie. They added something here, took away something there, changed this around and in the end, it is rather different but that does not mean inferior. Quite the contrary, I was happy to see the Wargs return for a scene and thought it was tastefully put in. In the end, this movie is truly a successor to Fellowship in every way. It is an amazing achievement and is sure to become a classic movie in years to come."

","I'll start with the best: the portrayal of Gollum and his interaction with Frodo and Sam was brilliant: better than the book! I'm still trying to figure out just what the Aragorn/Warg/Brego the wonder horse scene was suppose to contribute: it added no tension, nothing to the plot (other than asking us to believe Aragorn's horse, who now sports someone else's name, could wander down from the north and find Aragorn in his hour of need -- we might as well have been watching Free Willy), no excitement, and no character development. And then there was Farmir, who in the movie was nothing more than a pale shadow of Boromir. And again, for what purpose? And then the major plot hole, for which the bastardization of Farmir was apparently done to set up, where Frodo shows the one ring to the ringwraith, who then flies away because someone shot an arrow at it. Even if we are to swallow this lump of cinematic lard, there's now a little problem of Sauron now knowing WHO has the ring and WHERE it is, which is going to take some significant stretching of the plot to cover over in the Return of the King.

Elijah Wood has done a great job of transforming from the innocent Frodo to the Frodo becoming more and more seduced by the power of the Ring.  These movies have been wonderfully casted.

Who cares if Jackson did not follow each and every page of the book. He has given us all a movie which none will ever forget and it would be a shame if he were not recognized by the Academy for any of the 3 films. Not to mention Andy Serkis whose Gollum deserves the best supporting actor award this year.  It doesn't matter if what we saw on screen was CGI character. Behind the scenes it was a human being who was doing the acting and the voice. Too many movies are made nowadays to wow the Academy voters.

","SIGNIFICANT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:<br/><br/>Here's the deal:  compared to the Fellowship Of The Ring, this movie has more adrenaline, but less heart.<br/><br/>Breathtaking, spectacular, and the fastest three hours I've ever spent in a movie theater--and yet I left the theater wishing I cared about the characters as much as I did after seeing the first movie.<br/><br/>
Jackson took a LOT of plot liberties in this one.  Everything seems compressed...which is understandable once you realize he's going to spend a third of the film's length on what was covered in one chapter of the book--the battle of Helm's Deep. Sure it's breathtaking, groundbreaking, etc., but it's a battle.<br/><br/>All kinds of things happen to folks in the movie that never happened in the book.  Aragorn falls off a cliff (?) and is restored to life by the quasi-visionary kiss of Arwen (??).  And in the strangest departure from the book...Faramir declares that ""the ring will go to Gondor"", and takes Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath for a showdown with an airborn ringwraith.<br/><br/>Well, it's a movie, and the results are, as previously noted, awe inspiring. Within its own world, the movie makes complete sense.  Only the purists will quibble...and who cares about the purists (except other purists)? Jackson is always true to the spirit of the book.  His love of the material can be felt throughout.<br/><br/>The only genuine flaw in the movie comes right at the end.  After doing an excellent job of building up Frodo's growing surrender to the power of the ring, Jackson subjects Frodo to an inspirational Zig Zigler-style talking-to by Sam, which suddenly turns Frodo into sunshine and happiness at the end of the movie.  If you buy the premise of the ring's growing power, you can't just throw it all away because Sam says ""C'mon, Mr. Frodo sir...buck up!""<br/><br/>It's a minor point, but it bugged me.<br/><br/>Anyway, Gollum is as good as everybody says.  As for me, I'm going to see it again this week, and probably the week after that.  It's a movie that sticks with you for a long time after the final credits roll.<br/><br/>
Is it as good/better than the first one?  Are apples better than oranges? They're two different movies...in the end, more different than I expected. I can't weigh in on the as-good-as-or-better discussion, but I can affirm that both movies are very, very good."

","If you have any doubt as to the greatness and critical acclaim this movie is receiving, then take a look at this site.  If you just click on any movie, and then look at the left side, you will see all the years movies, with wide release movies on top, and limited release movies on the bottom.  TTT had a average score of 90.  The only movie that scored higher was Lion King. But if you click on it, you will see it has a pathetic 3 reviews (it was probably shown on IMAX or something)  Anyways, is Lion King anywhere near the best movies of this or any year?  Of course not.  Hey, I like animated movies too, but Lion King?  Come on, gimme a break.<br/><br/>It is quite surprising that no other movie even scored in the eighties. In fact, the next highest rated movies were 8 Mile with Eminem and Punch Drunk Love (have no clue who's in the movie), both with 78.  Catch Me If You Can scored 75. Lilo and Stitch scored 76.  Solaris and the much ballyhooed Gangs of New York both only scored 70.  Those are the ONLY movies in the 70s.<br/><br/>
TTT is not just the best movie of the year.  It was the best movie BY FAR. I think the stupidity of those who have a low opinion of this epic masterpiece is made even more evident now.<br/><br/>http://metacritic.com/film/titles/twotowers"

","While I can understand that books must be modified when made into a movie, the changes in the Two-Towers are generally worthless. The acting is very poor and wooden, the story-line changed in ways that actually weaken the plot, and the over-reliance on CGI makes Gollum almost a parody. I found it almost painful to watch, not because changes where made to the book, but because this is simply bad movie making almost to the level of Ralph Bakshi. Basically Peter Jackson owes us all an apology for not just bad movie making, but for trashing such a wonderful book. Such a waste of money..."

","a year ago, i came out of Fellowship desperately wanting more.<br/><br/>this week i came out of Two Towers feeling empty.<br/><br/>there were just too many changes from the books this time.  not just omissions (like the trip to bree/tom bombadil in Fellowship) or enhancements of character (Arwen in Fellowship), but complete changes of the story. parts were added that i'm sure jackson thought were necessary, but will only serve to alienate the Tolkien loyalists.<br/><br/>
***  spoilers follow  ******<br/><br/>i know they wanted to play up the arwen/aragorn romance and maybe even upgrade eowyn's crush on aragorn, but why add the scenes where aragon apparently dies?<br/><br/>elves at helm's deep?<br/><br/>where was the ent council?  as if merry & pippen could really trick the ents into battle.<br/><br/>they completely changed the character of faramir and foolishly took frodo, sam & gollum to osgiliath.  faramir was to be the counterbalance to boromir, but looked like he was cut from the same cloth (yeah, i know, they're brothers).  maybe they're setting something up for Return of the King, but Tolkien did just fine with all that.<br/><br/>would have preferred they cut the new scenes and taken the movie as far as the 2nd book does - including cirith ungol & shelob and gandalf facing saruman at isengard.  presumably these will be the beginnings of Return of the King.<br/><br/>i was also expecting a flashback to lorien and the giving of the gifts by galadriel.<br/><br/>********<br/><br/>not that this was a BAD movie or anything.  maybe by design it would be the hardest to fall in love with.  Fellowship had the advantage of developing most of the main characters.  Return will have the advantage of the climax(es).  TT was stuck in the middle without either.  Jackson further burdened it with the story changes.<br/><br/>i loved gollum (most of the time).  i loved the internal debate between slinker and stinker.  i liked the humor they added with gimli (except the dwarf tossing reference...it worked in Fellowship but seemed forced in TT). the battle scenes were good.  i liked the physical transformation of theoden after grima had been sent away.<br/><br/>i gave the movie a 6 because of the changes they made.  maybe not a true rating of the movie itself, but a story this well known must be judged against the book it came from."

There were places where I cried and places where I laughed and screamed.

","This movie has a darker edge to it than last year's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" but is still worthy as a holiday movie for those of us with children, 11 or older. The psychological development for the character Gollum is both tragic and funny. If this part doesn't get a best-supporting nod at nomination time, something is really fishy in Hollywood!  This character provides some light heartiness to this episode of the TLOR trilogy and I found myself actually rooting for this character at times. Make way for good to overcome evil yet again... This is a great movie and already I can not wait until ""The Return of the King"" next December!  I'm anticipating that the attack by Shelob on Frodo & Samwise (that Gollum alludes to) will take place in the ""Return of the King"" episode despite this being a deviation from the book. But I guess that since Return is the shortest of the books that it was saved for that reason...  If you haven't seen this movie, WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  GO NOW!!!"
"xxparxx","9","0","0","23 December 2002"," An objective review to a very good movie (not enough words in body to say I DID think it was good :) )
","I will do my best to sum up my feelings and observations about this movie. To start off, I consider myself one of the most avid Tolkien fans in the world.  I know that is a self-proclaiming thing to say, but this story has had a place in my heart for over 20 years and without having any role models as a young man growing up in a terrible situation, I placed many of my beliefs and philosophies in the honor that Tolkien portrayed in Aragorn's character (think what you like... everyone has something they believe in, I chose this).<br/><br/>Enough said, on to my review:<br/><br/>Knowing the books as well as I do, I was disappointed in some of the liberties Jackson took with his vision.  In both the first and second films, he made some director decisions that I believe were unnecessary.  I also think that he loves the story enough to be faithful in the majority, but his ego gets the better of him when he has the power to impress his vision when he wants.  (I say this because during his award acceptance, he never once thanked the man who made this whole thing possible... Tolkien).<br/><br/>**** START OF THE SPOILERS---BOOK/MOVIE COMPARISON ****<br/><br/>As with the first movie, the changes made could be attributed to many things.  It's such a long story to put onto the screen that many allowances must be made to make it appealing for large audiences.  I agree with not making the audience sit for 5 hours for 1/3 of a story, just to make it true to the books.  BUT... the following list of changes is unnecessary ...<br/><br/>
1) Aragorn:  Jackson's portrayal of Aragorn in the TT starts to evolve more into the character that Tolkien created.  In FOTR (movie), Aragorn is made into a self-pitying, unwitting hero.  This is NOT who Aragorn is.  In the books he knows who he is, and not only accepts it, he IS it.  Throughout the story he acts as the King of men he will one-day be, the leader of the Dunedain... men of Numeanor. As in the book, Aragorn should have been portrayed as ""The kings of past, come again"", not a reluctant hero.<br/><br/>Ok... side tracked a little --- Two Towers problems with Aragorn: Why on earth did they make him go over the edge?  To me they should have been more true to the books in other areas (mentioned later) instead of forcing scenes with Arwen.  Doing flashbacks and all is great.. but over the edge, make him seem dead, and then save him by a horse that comes out of nowhere and appears to give him CPR.  Sorry but this wasn't in the book.<br/><br/>2)Theodin:  Theodin's character before/after his ""affliction"" is very questionable.  I sat in the theatre embarrassed with Gandalf's exorcism of Theodin.  It was laughable.  Same complaint I have with Aragorn, in the book, when Theodin is woken up and confronted with Grima's subversions, he sees the destruction of Rohan caused by his actions and then does everything a king should to protect his people.  Why was he portrayed as a weak king during the trip to Helms Deep and his ruling of a besieged fortress?  He DOES send riders to Gondor, not fight with Aragorn about it.  In the movie I get the feeling that Jackson was trying to fix his errors with Aragorn and show that Aragorn really is a true leader by making Theodin look like an idiot.<br/><br/>3)Faramir:  Here is my 2nd largest problem with the movie.  Faramir is my 2nd favorite character in the whole story.  He is noble, honorable, decisive and (as stated in the books) ""a mirror of Gondor's rulers of old"".  He lives his life and makes decisions with honor and what is best for his people. Unlike his brother (and their father Denethor) whose character is based on pride, Faramir is confronted with Frodo and the ring and handles the situation like a true hero.  He is cautious, occasionally ruthless because of his leadership and responsibilities, but he realizes what Frodo is doing and what the ring really is.  He is faced with a decision, makes Frodo do what he did with Gollum, and comes to his own realization as to what must be done for the best of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>4) Helms Deep:  This I think was a total disappointment.  Don't get me wrong, the special effects are the best I've ever seen and if this was not based on a story so well loved, I would have thought it absolutely the coolest thing I ever saw.  To keep it simple, Eomer is cast out with some of his most trusted followers (40-50 horsemen, not 2000).  Helms Deep is a hopeless confrontation that has no outcome other than total destruction of the people of Rohan unless some other race helps them.  The elves don't help them; the ENTS with the hurons (spelling not sure of) help them.  Hell if Jackson was worried about effects cost, the true story would have been cheap AND true.  A massive blackness, darker than the night amasses behind the orcish hordes.  There is confusion, the fighting stops and all defenders wonder what new hell they must face.  Amid the silence, screams and the sound of battle erupt on the other side of the invading army and after some time, all is silent.  As the first rays of morning sunlight break over the mountains above, a massive forest appears in the place of the besieging army, silent, feeling of anger, and Gandalf appears as promised.  --- NOT 2000 mysterious horsemen with Gandalf at the head of the charge... lame...<br/><br/>
My gripes are meaningful and if I had 500 more words I could tell more.  I don't.  Overall as a movie I really liked everything else.  As I watch it more and more I think Ill like it as much as the first one.  But true to the books it is not."
"stu9003","9","0","0","28 December 2002"," I was blown away
","My overall impression of The Fellowship of the Ring was that I thought it was a technical masterpiece for bringing Middle Earth to life but I was a little less than enthused with the story. I can't say I ever really got totally absorbed by the story or character is in Fellowship of the Ring. So while I looked forward to seeing more incredible cinematography in The Two Towers I never expected to be blown away in quite the way that I was.<br/><br/>The very first scene totally grabbed me in a way that few movies have ever done before. I was expecting a fairly standard recap with a narrator explaining what happened in the last movie and where we are now. Instead, the movie opens with some stunning vistas of the Misty Mountains. We hear the sounds of shouting and fighting echoing through the mountains and then we suddenly zoom right into the heart of the mountains where we see a thrilling fight between Gandalf and the Balrog.  When this happens, its like the viewer is suddenly thrown right into the story. It's a feeling that doesn't leave until the closing credits. Because of the way it immediately immerses you in the story I think this scene was the best in the movie and considering what followed that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>What followed is the truly awesome Battle at Helm's Keep, the climax of the film. It is a truly grand spectacle that I can't really put in words except to say that you just have to see it. On a big screen. The view of the approaching army is firmly planted in my mind. <br/><br/>Some characters who were fairly peripheral in FOTR get much bigger roles this time, particularly Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. In some ways, Aragorn is the main character of Two Towers and Viggo Mortenson turns in a terrific performance. That said, the very best character of the Two Towers is Gollum. I've never been a big fan of 100% CGI-based characters but Gollum is truly exceptional. He seems so hopeless, pitiful, horrifying and dangerous all at once. There's just no telling what he's going to do.<br/><br/>I was absolutely blown away by The Two Towers. It's easily the best movie I've seen this year. In fact, it's one of the best movies I've seen in any year. I eagerly look forward to The Return of the King."

","The 2nd movie of the series does not disappoint.  It was non-stop adventure and excitement  The few parts that did seem to slow down were long to sit through but helped give you more background or information on the characters.<br/><br/>The battle between good and evil is even more overpowering in this movie. Gollum/Smeagol was such an unusual character. The real actor is never seen but knowing he was actually being filmed and CGI altered later made his part even more difficult.  His face was ugly at first but his eyes were mesmerising after the first few closups.  Obsession was running wild for him, Frodo and others.<br/><br/>So many characters are being Tested during the movie.  Do the right thing or take the easy way.  Turn on Frodo or not.  Steal the ring or not.<br/><br/>A more than worthy sequel in the series.  We are so glad they decided to put in the ENT's."

Gollum was very well done, especially in his schizophrenic monologues, in which his dark side debates against his good side, the remaining part of his personality that was once the Hobbit Smeagol.

","A splendid continuation of Tolkien's magical trilogy is again brought to the screen by Peter Jackson.  Jackson, certainly deserving an oscar either this year or next, once again displays his directorial adeptness by faithfully following the text, bringing difficult characters and subject matter to life, and producing wonderful screen images of beauty and terror.  This second installment, generally what I have always considered the weakest of the books, is brought to life with more gusto and life than the first one, which had the onerous yet necessary chore of exposition and characterization on its shoulders.  I briefly glanced through the reviews and saw some people post negative reviews because they are not intelligent enough - or only functionally literate - having trouble understanding the story.  It is complicated and certainly having read the books prior to seeing the film is a huge bonus.  Nonetheless, if one watches the Fellowship a few times, the plot should become very apparent.  The acting in this film is first-rate, and John Rys-Davies as the dwarf Gimli really shines with his humourous interpretation.  Mckellan is again in this film, yet his role is small in comparison to the first outing.  He DESERVED the oscar for that performance. What's not to like about this film?

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","28 December 2002"," Intoxicating for some
","If you've not read ""Lord Of The Rings"" or seen the first film, ""The Two Towers"" will be totally bewildering to you, because director Peter Jackson offers no summation of the earlier work but plunges immediately into three new segments. I've not read the book but I have seen the earlier film, so I had some idea of the plot, but I confess that - 12 months on - I can't really remember where the Ring came from and why Frodo Baggins has it. But never mind, like the other movie this is a visual treat and, unlike the original film, we don't have to put up with all that twee stuff in The Shire. <br/><br/>Of the three adventures, the least satisfactory is the wanderings of the Hobbits Merry and Pippin. Personally I could do without walking, walking trees but I suppose that, if they're in the novel, they have to be in the movie. Then there's two more Hobbits - the central hero, bug-eyed Mr Frodo, and his ever-faithful Sam, the gardener - who encounter a strange, schizophrenic creature called the Gollum, brilliantly realised through computer graphics but voiced by and based on the British actor Andy Serkis. By far the best segment is that centred on the warrior Aragorn, the elf Legolas and the dwarf Gimli which climaxes in a stupendous battle where thousands upon thousands of the hulking, clanking Uruk-Hai lay ferocious siege to the fortress at Helm's Deep. <br/><br/>Even more so than ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"", ""The Two Towers"" totally marginalises its (very few) female characters and it's clear that Middle Earth is even more of a man's world than this one. Again the landscapes are stunning and the aerial shots breathtaking, while the special effects reflect immense credit on the New Zealand creators. All in all, intoxicating for ""Ring"" readers, but less than totally satisfactory for the rest of us."

Having not read any Tolkien I will have to review the movie as a film in its own right.<br/><br/>Although I have seen TFOTR (which I gave 4/10) I still found TTT somewhat of an overload of characters, races and politics.  If you like the books and you liked TFOTR then there isn't any point in reading a review that doesn't declare TTT as the best movie ever...but for those fans of films I will try and point out the main flaws.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for those not fans of the books is that we simply don't care about the characters and nothing is done to make us care.  People are introduced to us and 10 minutes later when they are killed/revealed as having unrequited love/had their lands taken from them, we are actually supposed to care.  But why would we?<br/><br/>The other criticism would be the overuse of trying to make you believe that the main characters might actually die, only to reveal later on that *gosh* they haven't.  To my count this was done three times and is rather cliche and boring.  Quite childish to be honest.<br/><br/>To make it on its own strengths as a movie it needs to lose an hour at least, but I realise that would simply disgust people who avidly boast at the number of times they have read the books.  I said about the first one what I'll say about this...if you need to have already read the books to like the movie and care about the characters then it is *not* a good movie, and this is not a good movie.  I gave it 4/10 also.<br/><br/>On the plus side, yes the scenery and computer effects were all wonderful. As were the effects in Terminator 2 but I don't hear anyone claim that as being the best movie of all time.  TTT is just childish nonsense that fails to appeal to children due to the running time and the fact that nothing really happens."
"Dockelektro","10","0","0","28 December 2002"," One of the vastest movies ever
","""The Fellowship of the Ring"" introduced audiences around the world to a brave and admirable new world. It was an epic movie, that gathered fans and awards all around the globe. But when compared with the second outing, the first movie fades like a modest memory. ""The Two Towers"" is probably one of the greatest and biggest fantasy pictures ever. The plot of ""Fellowship"" was straight, following nine characters on their journey to cast the ring in the fires of Mount Doom. This movie catches up where the other one has finished, taking us through three separate journeys of three sets of characters, and establishing a kind of rivalry among which adventure is more epic. The stage is set for an unmissable and certainly unforgettable ride, with countless highpoints, too many of them to pick one - from the initial hair-raising ride with Balrog, to the climatic battle of Helm's Deep. Served by the best special effects this side of Jar-Jar  Binks (Gollum is one of the greatest achievements ever in the CGI world), the movie is a fantasy-fest, that succeeds almost at hypnotic level. Served by a powerful score by Howard Shore, ""The Two Towers"" is set for another bunch of awards - and makes us expect a bone-chilling final third. Without a doubt, the most spectacular film of the year."

","As a seasoned film buff and voracious reader, I don't suppose that I was silly enough to imagine that a literal adaptation of the books was forthcoming. Taken on its own cinematic merits, The Two Towers is undoubtedly a spectacular follow-up to The Fellowship of the Ring. Wide sweeping camera movements, action-packed scenes and meticulous visual effects. No, my quibble with the film-makers is not with the visual as the visual elements are, without a doubt, suitably Tolkien-esque.<br/><br/>
1. The portrayal of Faramir as an ambitious, impetuous warrior in the film goes against the grain. Tolkien's gentlemen soldier with profound insight seems to have gone astray. That particular thread seems unnecessarily rushed.<br/><br/>2. The choice of Helm's Deep as the film's focal point has shifted the attention from the Hobbits (the real heroes of Tolkien's narrative) to the plight of men. Whether that is ""good"" or ""bad"" is cause for much discussion I'm sure. The focus on Helm's Deep, in my opinion, takes away from the greater role of the Ents and Hobbits in the whole affair.<br/><br/>Overall the film is watchable and the sense of urgency and bleakness is well portrayed. I await the third instalment with much anticipation."
"marcyg68","10","0","0","27 December 2002"," Superb second chapter to the Lord of the Rings trilogy
","This absolutely breath-taking piece of work is a worthy follow-up to the critically lauded and award-winning ""The Fellowship of the Ring."" <br/><br/>
It certainly has its faults (especially in terms of changes made to the book), but anyone who has seen this film at least once cannot deny that this film is visually stunning, superbly crafted and utterly majestic. It deserves to be considered one of the top 5 films of the year (personally, it is one of my favorite films of all time and certainly is tops for me this year).<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson has already acknowledged that, of the 3 films, this film departs most from the book. The treatment of the character Faramir certainly bothered me (what I like to call ""the rape of Faramir"") and I still could not (even after repeated viewings) come to grips with the scene involving Frodo and the Nazgul in Osgiliath. However, these small ""gripes"" are minute compared to the film's many ""hits.""<br/><br/>For one, Gollum is fantastic!  Andy Serkis deserves to be recognized for his amazing work on this character. He infuses Gollum with the perfect amount of creepiness and sensitivity. I actually felt sorry for Gollum (which I never felt in the book). Must I also say that the Helms Deep was stunning! And that the Ents storming Isengard was my favorite scene of all!  I was also extremely pleased to see that characters who were ""slighted"" in FOTR (Sam, Gimli and Aragorn, for one) finally come to the forefront in this film. Whereas Frodo dominated the first film, we actually spend a bit more time with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli this time around. The entire cast is superb - from the creepy Grima to the cynical King Theoden.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I CANNOT (cannot!) wait until ""The Return of the King.""  It is my favorite book of the trilogy and Peter Jackson and producer Barrie Osborne have declared it their favorite film of the trilogy...it is going to be AMAZING! If the battle of Helms Deep is any indication, then the Battle of the Pelennor Fields is going to blow us away!!!"

","The easiest way to sum up The Two Towers is this. If you haven't seen Fellowship, avoid this, rent Fellowship, THEN see this movie. If you liked the character development in Fellowship, this film may dissapoint you because there isn't really any character development. If you thought Fellowship needed more action, this is right up your alley.<br/><br/>I will say this film is entertaining, but far from Best Picture worthy, simply on the fact that it NEEDS for it's viewers to have seen Fellowship of the Ring to understand or care about any of it.<br/><br/>Everything you loved about Fellowship is back, the sights, the costumes, the actors who ARE their characters. But the film does lack major character development. The only person who seemed to change is Gimli, who provides the comedic relief (very well I must say), which is understandable considering that Merry and Pippin's time has been cut back. Aragorn is still the dashing hero, Legolas is still the cunning elf who pulls off all the bitchin' stunts, Frodo delves deeper into the Ring's evil power, and Sam is still worried about him.<br/><br/>The plot is so well told and entertaining it makes this 3 hour movie seem like an hour and a half. The battle at Helms Deep is a HUGE wild spectacle, it gives a great feel of a midieval battle. It was just as crazy and entertaining as the Clone War in Star Wars: Episode 2, but was full of more drama. <br/><br/>I could rant and rave about how good Gollum looked, and he did look good, close up, but from afar he looked like a special effect, what  deserves the real praise is the actor who put the performance in him. The really great characters in the film were the Ents. All of the designs for them are so elaborate and imaginative. People who say that Treebeard looked ""jerky"" and ""stiff"" when he talked must lack a sense of logic. He's a living TREE, his skin is made of bark, of course he is going to have more stiff rigid movements, bark sure isn't as flexable as flesh. The scene in which the Ents take on Isengard is just a fantastic spectacle, and is one of my favorite scenes.<br/><br/>To sum it up, The Two Towers is a worthy, entertaining follow-up to The Fellowship of the Ring, but only if you have seen The Fellowship of the Ring."

","I recently just got ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" for Xmas and so it had been the second time I'd seen it since January at the cinemas. After finishing, I couldn't wait until I saw the next installment, and I surely wasn't disappointed with ""The Two Towers"".<br/><br/>*Possible spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>We continue on where we left of with Frodo and Sam going to Mordor to destroy the ring. Some say that the beginning should have been a re-cap of what happened in the previous installment but if anyone really noticed they were recapping things. For example- what happened to Gandalf (the Grey) when they thought he died, explained how Boromir died, what the love story was between Aragon and Arwen. I mean if you wanted to add recaps, then that would probably take another 15 minutes to do!!<br/><br/>I didn't feel that there was enough of Frodo and Sam, but I suppose they wanted to focus this time on Aragon, Legalos, Gimli, Merry and Pippin. We are introduced to some new characters King Theoden and Eowyn (Shieldmaiden of Rohan). I know that they are trying to introduce Eowyn as part of some love triangle with Aragon and Arwen, but it doesn't work. There's something enchanting about Aragon's love story with Arwen, how there love keeps the both of them going.<br/><br/>Gollum/Smeagol was an interesting character and for once the CGI effects were believable, just like the character of Dobby in ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"". His mental fight between good and evil was good to watch, with an ending making you want them to hurry up the process of ""Return of the King"" for at least June of next year!<br/><br/>I give it a 10, I haven't read the books so I can't really agree or disagree with those who believe Peter Jackson has changed the story. People say it's too much about fantasy, my question is what would you liked to have been? Why can't people escape the strangeness of this world and get involved with a whole other world that conveys a whole different way of life? I've also read that some believe this glamourises war, I believe that to be UNTRUE. It's a book that was written a long time ago, little did Tolkien now how screwed up the world would be now but I do not think it was on purpose. Nor do I believe that Peter Jackson is encouraging it either! He's doing what the book has written, nothing more or less.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just fantastic as Frodo and Sam, there's something warm and truthful about the way they convey the characters. There's something about Viggo Mortensen's acting that makes people wonder why they didn't acknowledge him before as an actor, he show's Aragon's torment between his duty and his fear. Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies are classic as Legalos and Gimli, showing the vast difference in thinking between the elf and dwarf. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd are fantastic to watch as Merry and Pippin, we got to see a more emotional side to their characters as opposed to their cheery and fun dispositions in ""FOTR"".<br/><br/>I recommend the ""Lord of the Rings"" installments for those who enjoy these kind of genres. If your critical of it, by all means you are going to be bored and not really see the value of the storylines."

","I know, I know...everyone loves this movie.  Everyone loved the last movie too, right?  Other than myself, I have only found 2 other people that did not enjoy the first of the LOTR trilogy.  I went into the second one with high hopes - I mean, I disliked the first one to such an extent that I was SURE I would enjoy this one more.  I was right!  But just barely! <br/><br/>With apologies to everyone who liked the film (and please remember, this is my opinion, you can have yours...), I found the film to be slightly painful. I don't know why!  I can't fathom my not liking these movies.  Maybe I found it too long.  Maybe I found the fighting scenes to be disjointed and uninspiring.  Maybe I don't like the numerous scenes involving wilted dialogue and sub-par acting.  Maybe it was the seeming attempt at making it a huge, long movie so that it would be considered an epic.  I just don't understand why I don't like the first two movies of the trilogy so far. <br/><br/>For my money, the original Star Wars trilogy trumps this one.  Yes, that one had a lot of lame elements, in retrospect (the stupid Ewoks almost ruined it all, no?). It's lonely not liking a blockbuster movie.  I'd almost rather watch the Matrix, and believe me, I hated that movie too. Sorry!  If you liked The Two Towers, I'm happy for you!  Just don't bring me.  Please.  Please?  Please???"

Anyhow... there's plenty of the Creature Gollum to substitute.  He's definately my favorite character.  Who would have thought a plot so grim could be made so funny?  It's a movie that leaves your sides aching at parts.  The Comedy relief is definately needed at some points, and it's such a stress reliever.  As I said, Gollum is my favorite.  I can't help it.  He has the funniest part.  He sings, talks to his ""evil"" side, and argues about how Sam and Frodo shouldn't ruin a rodent by putting it in a stew.  ""Give it to me raw"" he says somewhere in there. And why not?  He is a creature after all!<br/><br/>In all seriousness, go see the movie!!!!!!!"

Mined and Wrought The World's Greatest Movie, <br/><br/>My Humble Gratitude and Joyful Admiration. <br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings will forever set the standard for cinematic entertainment. Henceforth you cannot help but ask: was watching some other movie, TV show, sporting event, etc., a better use of your leisure time than re-watching a couple of hours of LotR? Probably not, especially once we get hold of the extended DVD versions.<br/><br/>
* * * * *<br/><br/>
To the naysayers out there: <br/><br/>Yeah, yeah, yeah -- I know the film's not perfect. Neither, for different reasons, is Tolkien's book. Get over it. [Just one example:  in the book, Sam's speech is shot through with maritime references, natural to an Englishman, but no Shire hobbit had ever seen the sea.]<br/><br/>
I give 4 derisive 'Bree Belches' to Roger Ebert's delicately fatuous and thoroughly erroneous critique of The Two Towers's supposed lack of faith to the trilogy, which he acknowledges he has never read. Well, I *have* read the books, about a dozen times in the past four decades (starting with the hardcover first edition in my high school library, when that was still the only edition), and I believe that Peter Jackson's movies are true to the heart, soul, and characters of the story, and that the liberties he took with the plot were warranted by the translation to film, and some are genuine improvements (e.g. replacing Glorfindel with Arwen). Ebert pompously claims, ""The last third of the movie is dominated by an epic battle scene that would no doubt startle the gentle medievalist J.R.R. Tolkien,"" but the Battle of Helm's Deep is in fact just as big and dark and violent in the book as it is in the movie, and both are tame compared to what Tolkien would have experienced firsthand as a line officer on the Western Front in the Great War. <br/><br/>For a much more perceptive review, from another critic who has not read the books, check out Joe Morgenstern's column in the Wall Street Journal of 12/20/2002. <br/><br/>* <br/><br/>For others who like to obsess over details, consider this:<br/><br/>Six of the eight Middle-Earthly members of the Fellowship are princes of their people. Aragorn is heir to the throne of Gondor; Boromir the eldest son of its ruling steward. Legolas is the son and heir of Thranduil, king of the Mirkwood elves. Gimli is nephew to Thorin Oakenshield, dwarf king under the Lonely Mountain, and cousin (and therefore potential heir) to Balin, late lord of Moria. Merry is heir to the Thane of Buckland, while Pippin is in direct line of descent from the Old Took. Only Frodo and Sam are commoners -- a rich eccentric country squire and his devoted gardener, nostalgic timeless English characters singularly resonant for Tolkien's own shattered generation. <br/><br/>Jackson essentially omits this set-up from the movie. In the book it does not become important until after the fall of Sauron. Alas Jackson has stated that ""The Cleansing of the Shire"" will not be part of his Return of the King, though he was careful not to reveal what *will* be included. Narsil re-forged will play a part, one hopes. Elrond does set this up. And would zombie-master Jackson dare to delete the Paths of the Dead? One hopes not."

","...and will continue to do so throughout the course of movie history. Yes, I've said it before and I'll say it again. Peter Jackson is a genius. I was as much in love with Kate Winslet in ""Heavenly Creatures"" as Melanie Lynskey was. I fought my way through legions of Kiwi zombies in ""Braindead"". I saw the lamest show on Earth in ""Meet the Feebles"". I went bananas with Derek in ""Bad Taste"". I accepted the daunting task of taking the Ring to Mordor with Frodo. And now, I have partaken in the struggle that will save or doom Middle-earth. Nothing in this world can prepare you for the cinematographic orgasm that is ""The Two Towers"". In many fantasy/adventure films, you never really get to see the gravity of the situation. When a planet is saved, you're like... ""yay, but you know, what else is gonna happen?"" In this film, you really have the sensation that the heroes might not make it. They're fearful and doubting, yet you know that what they are doing is right. You know that they are heroes. What they do, what they embark upon, makes them heroes.<br/><br/>""Maybe this is all just way too big for us, Merry. Maybe we should do what he says and head back to the Shire. We're just little people after all.""<br/><br/>But Merry and Pippin persevere. Just like Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and the rest. Even Sméagol does. Perhaps the most tragic thing of the film (and the entire saga) is that Sméagol is the only one who fails. His conflict is the most internal, less showy one of all three, but this is the one that is also the most poignant of all the storylines in the film. What happens when you're caught up in something as massive as the War of the Ring, but you're really not evil, just weak? In the final restaurant sequence in Pulp Fiction, Julius says to Honey Bunny something to the extent of how he thought he was the good man and Honey Bunny was the evil man, but now he realises that he is the ""tyranny of evil men"" and Honey Bunny is the weak man. Well, in The Fellowship of the Ring, we thought of Gollum as some sort of Hannibal Lecter, killing everyone who will get in between him and his precious. But in The Two Towers, we see he's really just Spud from Trainspotting. A lovable dope, trying to get some smack. It's the evils of this world that have turned Sméagol into his malevolent alter ego Gollum, and it's the evils of this world that keep him alive. The monologue/dialogue scene between Gollum and Sméagol might be one of the most powerful moments in film I have ever seen, together with Tarantino's ""Madonna speech"" and Yoda's ""Do-or-do-not-there-is-no-try"" thing. Oh yes, and did I mention Helm's Deep is an engrossing battle sequence, Brad Dourif was a slimy little c***sucker as Grima Wormtongue (bravo Chucky) and Sam's speech at the end is absolutely epic? Haven't I? Then find out for yourself by paying a measly 7 bucks for Peter Jackson's masterpiece at your local cinema."

Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film and the special effects scenes easily surpass the ones of the original, but I just thought the story wasn't with this one as much as it was with the original.

"tevanson","8","0","0","27 December 2002"," Slightly disappointing, but the best film of 2002 anyway
","Maybe my expectations were too high.  Maybe all the critics' hype of the film set me up.  But while ""The Two Towers"" is head and shoulders above everything else this year (including Spielberg's awful ""Catch Me If You Can"" and Scorcese's flawed masterpiece ""Gangs of New York""), it's not a perfect film by any means.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest flaw in the movie is the failure to maintain narrative speed.  The film does a truly admirable job of picking up the story ""where we left off.""  The superb special effects of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog are eye-popping.  But from there, the film stumbles a bit.  The Fellowship's chase of the Uruk-Hai across the plains of Rohan lacks much of the spectacle and blow-you-away visuals that were typical of the first film. The introduction of Eothain's horsemen seems sudden and jarring.  The special effects of Theoden's transformation from ensorcelled king into hale-and-hearty middle-aged man are too shocking to be believed.  The scenes with Merry, Pippin and the Ents in the forest are cut into the film almost as afterthoughts, and are not well-integrated, not well-written and not lengthy enough to really stand up well.  The animation of Treebeard himself is rather poor, and looks more like a sad version of a Disney animatronic creature than the astounding, realistic being we have come to expect from Weta Film.  And the middle-of-the-film segments with Elrond, Arwen and Aragorn are poorly paced, poorly conceived and don't fit in well with the rest of the story (or what is to come in the next film, either).<br/><br/>But most disturbingly, the script too often takes the audience out of the real of Middle Earth and back into the present.  The villian here are the silly jokes that appear throughout the film.  Gimli's ""oof""-ing moments when the Isengard wolves fall on him is something out of Chaplin, not Middle Earth.  The brief, joking exchange between Aragorn and Gimli as they attempt to sneak out of Helm's Deep and attack the Uruk-Hai on the ramp are similarly out of place (they would have fit in had the scene been better-written).  Indeed, the film turns Gimli from a full-blown, honest, realistic character into the ""joking little dwarf"" character of the film. It's something to be expected of lesser films like ""Willow"" or TV shows like ""Hercules"" -- not LOTR.<br/><br/>But overall, the film is outstanding.  While the pacing of the narrative leaves something to be desired, the overall story is terrific (a major accomplishment, given the huge amount of source material).  The character development is much stronger in this film than in the first one, and the acting -- particularly by Christopher Lee, Brad Dourif, Ian McKellan, Bernard Hill and David Wenham -- is quite good.  The battle for Helm's Deep ranks with the opening segment of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the snow-battle of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" as one of the great war scenes of all time.  So is the battle of the Ents at Isengard (although one wishes there had been more of this segment)."
"Aien","10","0","0","23 December 2002"," Awesome. left me speechless.
","When I left the theater after I saw TTT for the first time I was totally speechless. This movie blew me away. One review somewhere said: this movie is less true to the book then ""the fellowship of the ring"" was, but it was more true to Tolkien. And I think thats so absolutely true. There were indeed quite some changes to the story but most of them didn't bother me too much. But Tolkiens hate for industry and all the messages from the story of lord of the rings (power corrupts, you cannot get peace without sacrifice) were so well done. That was all really great.<br/><br/>Spoilers in the next part: I loved the elves at helms deep. I'm a great fan of Haldir and it was SO sad that he died, but also very, very beautifully done. An immortal elf seeing he is a mortal as well, in a way. Aragorn was great in this movie and so was Legolas. It was great to see him with more emotions, something I thought lacked his character in the first movie. Gimli became the comic relief and I thought he was very funny indeed.<br/><br/>And Gollum... I can't say much more then: WOW! He looked so amazingly real, and the Gollum/Smeagol dialoges were great.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't liked was Frodo almost giving the ring to a wraith. It was very unlikely that the Wraith didn't take the ring to Sauron at once.<br/><br/>
But other than that the movie was awesome. I will watch it at least 4 times more in theaters (but I'm hoping on t least 9, once more then I saw the fellowship) and I have given this movie a 10. It will probably become my most favorite movie of all."
"AlastairDavie","9","0","0","23 December 2002"," Good film, flawed adaption *** spoilers ***
","Translating a book to film is entirely the art of the compromise, what made FOTR such a great film was the quality of the compromises made, the choice of scenes cut from the book, the characters collapsed into one while preserving the essence of both the narrative thread and the integrity of the characters.<br/><br/>TTT fails to meet these exacting standards set by FOTR and most of it's failures stem from the effort to have the remaining eight characters in the fellowship be the driving force for all the events in the narrative.<br/><br/>PJ made compromises in the confrontation of Gandalf and Saruman, by including it in the healing of King Theoden from his evil influence, an excellent choice to collapse two events into one to impart all the necessary information and keep the narrative flowing.  My suspicion is that those hoping to see more of this in ROTK will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Treebeard and the Ents deciding not to go to war against Saruman and then being tricked into it by Merry and Pippin significantly failed in all aspects.  The length of time to cut back to Treebeard stating that Saruman had been cutting down trees for too long and needed to be short would have been less than the substitute reason for their attack and having established the Ents as being non-hasty to suddenly burst into a fit of rage diminishes them<br/><br/>The now rejuvenated Theoden changes from a man with his courage restored who goes out to face his doom to a coward who runs with the women to hide in the hills and allowing Aragorn to take the lead in the defense of Helms Deep. A compromise that lessens the film for those knowledgeable in the book. Conversely the elves turning up to help under the lead of Haldir, is easier to explain and insert into the narrative than the troop of Rangers with the two sons of Elrond as occurs in the book.<br/><br/>*** potential spoiler for ROTK in next paragraph *** Faramir's transformation from the noble man in which the line of Numenor runs true to one that succumbs to the temptation of the ring on his first sight of it was probably done to add drama to the journey of Frodo and Sam, which it does, but will probably end up being the part that most fans will hate the most.  Keeping Shelob in TTT would have served the cause of drama far better but then would have ended the film with the 'death' of the main hero, not something you can do in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The threads of Aragorn fake death, the Warg attack and  Arwens leaving middle earth are again changes to the book aimed at increasing the drama of certain portions of the film and by themselves they achieve more or less that (though some of it drops into melodrama) but when combined with the other  deviations from the book it reinforces the other failed compromises.<br/><br/>Overall I still liked the film, the brilliance of FOTR probably inflated my expectations for TTT so I'll go back and see it again with my expectations suitable modified and  see how it goes from there"

Don't worry if someone is kicking your seat, coughing, or crunching candy next to you.......missing any of this dialogue doesn't matter.  As a matter of fact, I wore earplugs through the second half of the movie to save myself from the headache that the endless parade of battle scenes was giving me.  I guess when the producers lay out so many millions they want the surefire draw of bombastic Hong Kong kung fu broadsword swinging noise that will bring back 11 year old action patrons over and over.  I suggest you rent it on DVD so you can skip forward past much of the battle scenes which should have been cut to shrink the movie by 30-40 minutes.  But you would be better served to buy and read the books instead. Authors don't have to resort to noise and battle scenes to sew a great story together.  And movie producers only think they can."

","I saw this movie earlier than I usually see movies because of the hype surrounding it, and I must say that it doesn't live up to its potential. Despite what most people say, I think the first movie was more solid and well done than this one. The Two Towers is too choppy and disjointed, and many scenes are just unbelievable and ridiculous. Also, I feel that many boring scenes could have been removed without affecting the narrative too much. Finally, many effects are simply laughable. Don't get me wrong--this was a good movie compared to most--but it is not excellent, nor is it better than The Fellowship of the Ring. I give it an 8/10. The first one was a 9.5."

","The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is everything the Star Wars Prequels are not. Unlike the First Star Wars Trilogy, they will not be recognized as classics in motion picture history.  LOTR will! Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Episodes I and II, but they will not go down in history as movies that transcend generations for decades to come.  The Two Towers, like the first movie, is virtually flawless. The script, acting, Special FX, directing, cinematography, sets, location, and overall vision are magnificant.  Some may argue that the Two Towers doesn't embody the ""spirit"" of the books or that Peter Jackson doesn't place the appropriate emphasizes on certain story lines in TTT.  This may or may not be true, but it's all about perspective. Millions of kids and adults alike have read these books and formed their own vision of how this rich story should play out of the big screen.  Jackson ultimately has to make these movies work for the masses without straying from the heart of the story, and I believe this vision is what is most endearing about the first two LOTR movies.  This movie has everything a movie lover can ask for.  Fast pace, character development, solid relationships that are not forced and an climatic ending that leaves you begging for more.  In addition, this movie takes motion pictures to new heights with it's state of the art special FX.  The CG character of Gollum is by far the best CG character every protrayed on film.  Lucas's ILM wasn't even close with Jar Jar or the various EP II CG Characters. Oh well, hopefully Lucas will take note of LOTR for his own SW prequel finale. Any ways, when all is said and done, The Two Towers is a wonderful movie experience, which will stand the test of time."
"osleraar","10","0","0","27 December 2002"," I tried, but couldn't find a flaw worth docking points.
","I am highly critical of movies.  Perhaps my criteria are a little different, since I notice that I don't like a lot of movies that are blockbusters. LOTR2 however is a blockbuster that I liked.  Here's how I rated it: Story - Tolkein spent his life creating the world that this movie is based in.  You can't beat that. Acting - Wonderful semi-popular actors that still have to prove themselves. The acting is top notch. (anyone remember Star Wars ep4?) Directing - Is it quite apparent that the directing was done with great care and dedication.  I was unable to find one scene that could have had a better cut. Music - The musical scores in this movie are clean, flowing, and quite moving, but do not get in the way of the movie itself.  LOTR1 had a few scenes that could have used a little less musical volume, but LOTR2 did not suffer the same flaw. Sound effects - Do you ever think, ""Hey I've heard that EXACT same bloop/slash/scream before""?  Well I have.  I think someone made a universal sound database, and everyone uses it.  Everyone except the LOTR crew. Special effects - Easily my most critical area.  LOTR2 stopped me cold on this criterion.  Well, I did find -one- flaw in the SFX, but it was water, and water is just given to be bad in any movie.  Not that it was bad, but it was certainly not perfect.  However, the unprecedented computer graphics such as the Ents, and the other very believable CG scenes made up for the brief scene with the rushing water. Furter notes - The movie had intense action, and breathtaking CG, but did not use those as a crutch for poor acting, and lackluster directing (as the new Star Wars movies are doing).  Furthermore the CG far surpasses the quality of even ILM(Lucas). That earns bonus points."

"LebowskiT1000","9","0","0","27 December 2002"," A good movie, but a bit over-hyped and over-rated though.
","I honestly don't know what it is, but I'm really not all that impressed with these movies.  Don't get me wrong, I think they are good movies, and the special effects are nothing less than mind-blowing, but there is no way I could put either ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" or ""The Two Towers"" in my favorite 50 movies or so and they're both in the top 10 highest rated films on this site (at the present moment).  Maybe it is because I've never read the books, but then again I have a number of friends that haven't read the books and absolutely love these films.  So, I'm at a loss for answers.<br/><br/>  The cast in the film is very good and everyone included deserves some notice.  Most notably: Ian McKellan, Christopher Lee, Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, Miranda Otto, Cate Blanchett, and Bernard Hill. They all did great jobs and pulled off great performances.  Director, Peter Jackson, deserves a great deal of praise too, you can definitely tell that a great deal of work went into this film.<br/><br/>  I must say that Gollum looked truly impressive, in a special effects sense.  But, I have to get something off my chest.  He was SOOOOO ANNOYING!!!  I wanted Frodo and Sam to just kill him or leave him somewhere. If I hear ""My Precious"" one more time I'm going to scream!!!<br/><br/>  The high points for me in the film were the different animals and beasts in the film.  Some of them looked really cool and were done quite well, where other had some serious problems (if you ask me) and could have been done much better.<br/><br/>  Another complaint I have about the film is the length.  I'm sorry, but this movie is just too long.  There are a number of things in the film they could have easily cut out (although I'm sure they didn't to please the hard-core fans of the books)...but I guess you can't please everyone, so I'll just shut up and deal with it.<br/><br/>  On last thing I have to complain about that just didn't make sense is: How on earth did Gandalf and the Balrog end up fighting on top of that tower? One scene they're falling through the mountain, and then they're on top of this tower?  Did I miss something?  Oh well, maybe when/if I read the books it'll make more sense.<br/><br/>  All in all, I thought it was a good film, but not as spectacular as everyone makes it out to be.  I'd still recommend seeing it though, but only if you've seen ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" first.  You are going to REALLY lost if you don't see the previous film first.  In any case, I hope you enjoy the film.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"Zod-2","5","0","0","26 December 2002"," Over-long and dull.
","I have a sneaky suspicion that many, not all mind you but many, of the people going to see The Two Towers are watching it with blinders on.  Seeing only what they wish to see and not seeing what is being presented on the screen.<br/><br/>For years we have been told that The Lord of the Rings is the defining work of fantasy fiction.  It is no doubt very thought out and well written but when you come right down to it the novels are very often quite dull and over-long and that is brought out magnificently in the second installment The Two Towers, which is itself quite dull and over-long.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a great looking movie and very well acted, the problem is it isn't very well paced.  Overall the movie doesn't even need to exist for all it accomplishes.  As has been pointed out it bridges the gap between the first and third films however it doesn't justify a 3 hour running time. <br/><br/>
Is The Two Towers an action picture?  I certainly hope not!  If it is the film makers need to take another look at the first two hours of the film which are only lightly peppered with action sequences and to make matters worse contain fewer pieces of important/interesting plot.  The final 45 minutes is loaded with action footage and does pick up the pace of the rest of the movie quite nicely.  The battle at Helm's Deep is a magnificent spectacle but alone cannot save the movie.  The battle of the Ents is also visually impressive but, as with the Helm's Deep battle, ends rather unsatisfyingly.  Instead of being climactic battle scenes both battles instead play as saviors to an otherwise dull movie.<br/><br/>At 3 hours The Two Towers is over-long but even with an hour shaved off the running time I don't think this movie has what it takes to be truly ""great"". Although I do think special notice should be made of Gollum as he is very well done and the most interesting character in the movie and makes the otherwise enormously dull Frodo and Sam portions of the film worth watching.<br/><br/>I throughly enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring but The Two Towers fails to entertain.  This, however, is not necessarily the film makers fault but due to the flaws in the source material.  When watched with blinders off The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers receives and deserves a 5 out of 10."

","I am one who has never read more than just The Hobbit. I really enjoyed LOTR 1 because it was truly interesting. There was character development, and a rather good introduction that helped you understand what was going on. You cared about the adventurers and felt the emotions they did as they escaped perilous circumstances. <br/><br/>However, this movie was extremely boring and hard to follow. Many new characters were introduced, with no character development. I don't even remember the names of the people from the first one, and they continuously rattled off all these new names, when we had no idea who they were, or why we cared about them. <br/><br/>We had no idea why Gandalf was so interested to help a King whose subjects were a bunch of poor dirty-faced peasants. There were too many groups of men wandering around, and no attempt was made to establish who they were and why we should hate or love them. <br/><br/>I kept waiting for it to get good and it was only mildly entertaining, maybe 20 minutes in 3 hours. They could have easily made it in 2 hours.<br/><br/>
Gollum was extremely annoying to watch. He reminded me of Dobby in Harry Potter, and was as annoying as Jar Jar Binks. Seeing him beat and chained was also extremely abusive and hard to watch.  <br/><br/>The main characters were obviously distracted in this movie and did not give as good of performances as they did in the first and as they will in the 3rd."

","When one peruses the comments contained within this forum, it is immediately noticeable that many ""critics"" fail to see the forest for the Ents.  The term ""milestone"" is frequently tossed about as an adjective denoting superior quality, when in fact quality is not the point. The real achievement of LOTR will be whether or not it succeeds in translating one of the world's most beloved literary masterpieces into a cinematic experience that, like the books, transports its audience into another realm.  Hence, it will become a ""milestone"".  If LOTR made for an easier translation, I've no doubt Spielberg or Lucas would have grabbed it and tried it long before now. The fundamental problem for them, had they chosen to do so, would have been the  absolute restraint placed on them by having to work within the strict confines of the story, and retain the magic without the benefit of the freedom of the written word. It is not a dominion that either have shown any pre-disposition towards, and one suspects that they have recognised the enormity of the challenge, both for its scope, and complexity.  And as far as this current endeavour is concerned, TTT takes the baton from its predecessor, TFOTR, and maintains the magic, the wonder and the story. Comparisons with TFOTR are both odious and pointless.  Complaints about the use of CGI's are irrelevant (how else would you create Gollum, Ents, Orcs and iconaclastic battles?). Perfection in any field of human endeavour is both subjective and impossible, and should not be used as a touchstone. TFOTR built the foundation, TTT has put up the walls....and no doubt TROTK will complete a majestic cinematic achievement that will be watched for generations as an epoch defining moment in movie making. Those that feel the need to nitpick should perhaps confine themselves to Austin Powers."
"S_Rhea","10","0","0","26 December 2002"," What movie did YOU see?
","I would like to know what movie some of the nay-sayers saw, because evidently I didn't see the same movie. Let me say that as someone who has read the series no less than five times (and the Silmarillion twice), it is very hard for me to be objective about what I still consider to be the crowning glory of fantasy literature. As such, I was EXTREMELY cautious when it came to giving any seal of approval to these movies.<br/><br/>That Jackson made a believer out of me (and several others I know who are even more inflexible in their visions of what Middle Earth should and should not be) speaks volumes about his directing ability. Yes, upon first viewing I saw some definite divergences from the book. However, upon careful analysis I can honestly say the changes are not gratuitous. Some roles have been subsumed by others (Glorfindel by Arwen, the Rangers of the North by Haldir and the Lorien bowmen, etc) and there have been some omissions and even a few minor embellishments. However, the end result is a movie whose spirit is very true to Tolkien and translates visually what must have been a monumental task given all the collected prose, elaborate notes, and art of Tolkien's beloved world. Nevermind the expectations of the fans which hinge on how closely these movies match the internal direction of their own imaginary adaptations of probably the most beloved series of all time.<br/><br/>It is my opinion that those who were disappointed by this (and the previous) movie fall into two categories: 1) the nitpickers; those who would not be happy even if Tolkien himself had directed. I have heard all the arguments: Tom Bombadil was missing from the first movie, Faramir wasn't supposed to take Frodo to Osgiliath, the first movie cuts into chapters from TTT and the second movie ends before the literary ending of TTT. To which I respond with a rousing WHO CARES??? Do those divergences detract from everything that was done right? Do they really change the story? No. 2) those who have never read the books and who are essentially mundane in scope of imagination, inflexible in their views of what fantasy should be, or don't understand that LoTR was the defining element of fantasy literature...yes it's a bit clichÃ©, because so many other stories have been based on this story.<br/><br/>So, all that being said, I think this movie is stunning and its director very worthy of getting a nod as best director. It did everything I could ever have hoped it would: primarily by recreating the sense of awe and wonder I got when I first read these books. And it has also drawn so many people to reading the books for the very first time. And lastly, it has successfully delivered an epic fantasy to the big screen...something Hollywood has tried and failed at for years and years."

","So much opportunity so much waste. Many friends who are not fans of the book liked the film. However they liked it for the wrong reasons - ""What a great action movie"" they said. That is exactly what it is. I have accordingly marked it better than Conan and Beastmaster because it is far better executed than those movies of that genre. I however think the film should have been an ongoing tale of heroic romanticism based on the work of J.R.R. Tolkien. This it is not. Anybody expecting as much will be disappointed by the character portrayals and the plot devices which so cruelly savage the original storyline.

","Two down and One to go...and so far Jackson's adaptation of the Ring trilogy shows no signs of diminishment. I won't go into heavy plot detail since others have covered it here quite well,but I did want to point out some high points. First off the film is smooth...it moves quite well with no lulls in plot,action or characterization. Some outstanding new performances come from Miranda Otto as Eowyn,Brad Douriff as the creeepy Grima Wormtounge and especially Bernard Hill as the conflicted King Theodin.Hill is by far one of the most welcome additions to the cast...always showing you a real human being beneath the crown.Hill's most moving moment is his ""So it Begins"" speech about the futility of war. Returning actors Sir Ian McKellen,Sean Astin,Hugo Weaving and Christopher Lee continue in their finely tuned portrayals and Orlando Blooms Legolas and John Rhys-Davies' Gimli are at last given more to do. Their relationship is well presented. The way Jackson presented the voice over speeches by Galadriel and Elrond was quite effective,and Blanchett sand Weaving use their wonderfully emotional speaking voices well.  Here is looking forward to Return Of The King with great anticipation!"

","Rating:  9.5 The missing .5 that would make this movie a 10 comes from the fact that it is a transition film that respects the original material.  It moves the plot along smoothly and with gripping drama but it can't get Frodo to Mordor any faster than the book does.  Again the acting is absorbing, particularly Gollum's fight with his split personality and Aragorn giving battle commands in Elvish on the walls of Helm's Deep -- speaking fluently and powerfully. Again the visuals are spectacular and monumentally astonishing.  Again there are some changes to the plot, at least one of which is perplexing because it seems to serve no purpose, but the movie's integrity holds.<br/><br/>
Elvis Mitchell criticized Jackson for not recapping the first book for the benefit of new viewers.  I applaud him for not wasting time when he has so much else to show.  If you want to know what happened in the first film -- watch the DVD or read the book.  Just don't ask the guy sitting next to you because he already knows."

","TTT is an excellent continuation of FOTR and sets up what we all hope to be a monumental conclusion in ROTK.  For me, its function as the ""bridge"" in the LOTR story is TTT's weakest and greatest achievement.<br/><br/>TTT continues the story seamlessly from the first film.  Without any sort of recap, we are thrust right into all of the protagonists' storylines within minutes of the opening title.  At the same time, the film introduces a host of new major players: Gollum, the Rohirrim, Theoden, Grima, Eowyn, who begin to interact with & deflect the trajectories of FOTR protagonists.  New expositions, surrounding the state of affairs in Rohan, Gondor & Fangorn, quickly set the table for the drama of TTT and beyond.  We are completely engrossed in the new dramatic environment, leaving the FOTR behind as valuable backdrop for the new action.  It's remarkable how efficiently this is all accomplished.<br/><br/>TTT's weakest moments are at its end.  The film must somehow provide a climax to resolve the 3-sided plot threads that have been engrossing us for over 2 hours.  What happens to the defense of Rohan & the ""world of men"", to Merry & Pippin's recruitment of the Ents to fight, and to Frodo, Sam & Gollum's attempts to enter Mordor?   While all three story-arcs do have great climaxes, in particular the battle at Helm's Deep, there is no real dramatic resolution.  There is even less than in the book, where at least a certain closure is achieved in the confrontation with Saruman & Grima at Orthanc.<br/><br/>I guess what all this indicates is that TTT is a masterful ""prequel"" for ROTK.  We have so many ""loose ends"" that require resolution!  In addition to the three major plot lines of the broken Fellowship, we still have the Arwen/Aragorn question, as well as new ones like Faramir's fate and Eowyn's dilemma!<br/><br/>I should add that, as has been said by many, that most everything about the film, the cinematography, acting, CGI, special effects, art direction, casting, musical score, etc. is top notch & at least the equal of FOTR.<br/><br/>So, all in all, while it really cannot stand on its own in the way that FOTR was able, TTT acts as an excellent appetizer for the grand finale, ROTK. Cannot wait!<br/><br/>
P.S. - I should add that a minimum of 2 viewings is required, especially if you had titanic expectations, as I did, from loving the 1st film or Tolkien's books.  The 1st time around, I just could not take in the picture as pure cinematic experience, and not worrying about the deletions, changes, additions, etc. to the novel, of which there are admittedly many and of varying value.<br/><br/>_____________________________________"

","This movie is typical of how Hollywood is transforming their 'big budget' movies to a CG masterpiece in which the audience becomes more focused on the 'creations' rather then real human actors and oddly the characters dialog sound quality is extremely tough to understand at points.  The lack of new character / plot development is awkward with old plot line being longwinded. It seems, I would have been better off reading the book first.  The 'epic battle' that everybody is probable talking about at the water coolers reminds me of computer games graphics about 3 years ago when everything was darker so the designers did not have to make everything perfect and sadly the main characters get lost in the overwhelming mass of the war.<br/><br/>Overall, the complains do not take away from the movie and it is enjoyable from moment one.

","To everyone who gave a negative review,<br/><br/>Would you please comment sensibly? Look, this is the second part of a trilogy. You are really watching a 9-hour movie shown to you in 3 parts. All the character building is done in the first installment. The second movie is more to advance various characters' relationships and moving the story of the war further. <br/><br/>Do you see the frailty of humans, dwarves and elves (who are supposed to be immortal)?? Do you feel the heroes clinging on to their hope in the impossibility of their situations? Do you see the variety of personalities that made up the people in Helm's Deep? The commoners? The warriors? The knights? The defenders of the weak? Or do you just see a story that has been dragged for 3-hours? <br/><br/>I believe some are critical about how Peter jackson omitted out or changed certain portions of the story. People, he is trying to do his best to give us the best interpretation of the very lengthy and often long-winded story written by J.R.R. Tolkien. Believe me, going through the length of the 3 books was quite torturous (even though I think it is a modern classic). If he were to be as true to the books as some of you want it to be, he would probably be better off making the nine segments that made up the 3 books!! By then most of you would have lost much interest over some of the very exhausive and boring parts of the entire story.<br/><br/>Be very grateful Mr Jackson has given us the best fantasy epic yet!

Perhaps this is the way many interpret the book and for that matter, that may be the very core of the way it is supposed to look from the words on the original pages.  I just don't see anything that shines through that makes you care that the good guys win.  Films like 'Star Wars' and 'Braveheart' (although the good guy lost here it was still still fun when he was winning) have much more feeling and sentiment combined with booming action and terrific characters. I just see 'LOTR' as bleak, too dark and too under developed in its characterizations and I found some of the creatures to be inaudible when they spoke.

The Ent parts of the book were excellent and the they suffer in the fast paced movie Peter Jackson has put together.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the special edition DVD!!!"

The New Zealand scenery however was absolutely breathtaking.<br/><br/>Now as for the rest of the movie , very hard to follow the story line.

","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I waited about 4 hours in line on opening night with high expectations and left absolutely dumbfounded. I couldn't speak. The plot, acting, landscape, props, costumes, and special FX were astonishing.   Gollum, for instance, was always one of my favorite characters and was a bit worried about how he would look. This frequently happens when they make a movie from a book - you have your own mental picture of someone/thing in the story which differs dramatically from what the director, writers, and animators have and that thing turns out to be physically warped beyond any recognition. It could also be too ""Jar-Jar"" like, off-colored, horribly animated...a number of those kinds of things happen all the time and it's always a pain in the neck. This was certainly NOT THE CASE for Gollum. He was exactly as I had pictured him in the books. I loved the scene where he was fighting with himself...it was so powerful and so sad because Gollum himself is an incredibly sad and pitiful character, though he also has a wicked side. I think they portrayed that wonderfully in the movie.<br/><br/>
Also was the case for Treebeard and the other Ents. Their voices and sounds were spectacular. The scene where they re-rooted the river Isen to flood Isengard was incredible. You could see them straining against the sheer power of the waters. It looked so real. <br/><br/>And the Battle of Helms Deep?? I mean, come on, people, even if you're not into the whole fantasy thing or hated the first movie, it's worth going just for that!! Can we all say ""Thrill Ride""?<br/><br/>Yet another BRILLIANT job by Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>Oh, and GO GIMLI! Hehe...I loved him. I guess Merry and Pippen (who, I might add, are great in this - Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd were the perfect casting choices) sort of handed the comic relief over to the dwarf."

","A long time Tolkien fan, I arrived at the theatre with a bit of apprehension (or was it excitement?).  The Fellowship of the Ring had not disappointed me, and was wonderful.  So it was with hope in my heart that the same would be provided by Two Towers as I awaited the curtain to go up on this second installment.  It surpassed my expectations.<br/><br/>To say that Rohan was an indescribable splendor on screen would be an understatement.  The residents of Canterbury, NZ are lucky indeed to have such a pristine and beautiful place in their backyard.  Peter Jackson did a wonderful job bringing the people of Rohan alive as I felt they were not in the books.<br/><br/>Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are developed well here and their actors put on an unforgettable show.  Astin's character of Sam shines as does Wood's Frodo. <br/><br/>But Smeagol/Gollum!  If this portrayal of character (not just the animation) doesn't win an Oscar, I don't know what should.  Superbly done.<br/><br/>My only criticisms may be the treatment of Arwen, Elrond and Galadriel as they seemed a bit out of synch with the rest of the movie.  Also, Faramir seemed a bit harsh compared to his character in the book.  Some of my friends and colleagues found the Ents disappointing, but I did not."
"janqb","6","0","0","24 December 2002"," Choppy and Uneven
","I don't know what compels audiences to sit through ""The Two Towers"" (TTT), especially when Peter Jackson's directing is uneven, the storyline choppy, and the movie endlessly long (nearly 3 hours). In the book, many events unfold simultaneously, but to depict Tolkien's finely crafted synchronicity takes a directorial finesse that Jackson just doesn't have in TTT. Though the special effects and musical score are very impressive, when a film relies heavily on these elements rather than narrative drive to evoke emotions and to move the story forward, you know the film is floundering. Several vistas of New Zealand's majestic geography are accompanied by equally evocative music. But whether the shots of the landscape were ill-timed or just too numerous, most of these scenes failed to convey any emotional intensity. In fact, the audience is left feeling a bit bored by it all. An example of better use of music and landscape shots is in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" (CTHD). It wasn't that CTHD had better scenery or more dramatic music, but that these scenes came at appropriate times and did not look awkwardly placed. Jackson's camera work also leaves much to be desired. The camera pans in and out at breakneck speed, naturally taking advantage of the immersive experience of a large movie screen, but the camera moves so quickly at times that the audience doesn't get a chance to form an emotional bond with characters. The sense of intimacy one tries to develop with characters is crippled when the camera zooms out precisely at the moment when we are starting to get to know them.<br/><br/>Though the directing is nothing to brag about, TTT does have a few things to applaud. The special effects are truly amazing and several characters are well-developed in the script."
"vrillusions","9","0","0","24 December 2002"," Best movie I've seen in a long time
","First off, I just want to say that I have not read the actual books, so can't compare them to the movie.<br/><br/>This was the best three hours I have had in a movie theater, period.  The cinematography was great and the acting was excellent.  Gollum, who was focused on a lot of the movie, was done very well.  I was afraid we would have another ""Jar Jar Binks"" character.  Fortunately he isn't annoying, and is intriguing enough that you can't help but watch.  Although I'll admit some of his close-ups were a little overdone (too drawn out).<br/><br/>As for the numeric rating, there are a few things that I take into consideration; variety and intelligence are the main two.  When I talk about variety, I am talking about all the different elements that are in a movie. Not everyone enjoys the same thing in a movie, so to me variety is key to have something everyone will enjoy.  This movie does just that.  There is comedy, action, suspense, romance, sentimental moments, fantasy, and that's just what I can think of right now.  There will be at least one point in this movie that practically everyone will enjoy.<br/><br/>Intelligence can be described as the think-ability factor; do you have to think a little when watching it?  Very few movies out there are like this. The majority of films present everything to you and leaves you, the viewer, with nothing to really think of.  The movie is presented in an interesting way, there are three main story lines happening throughout the film.  You basically are following one story line for a while, then it moves over to something else.  Other's probably describe this as ""jumping around"".  I personally enjoyed it when after a few minutes into the movie I realized that's what was happening.  It makes you think.  You have to almost construct three stories happening at the same time.  I also liked the fact there was no recap at the beginning of the film, it just starts.  That being said, if you haven't seen the first one, you will not enjoy this at all.<br/><br/>Since both of those rated really well, and I enjoyed it, that's why I'm giving it a 10 out of 10"

","HUGE SPOILERS<br/><br/>If I were to list all the problems I had with this film, my review would be 5000 words long. TTT is much faster paced than Fellowship, in fact, it's probably paced too quickly; it starts to feel choppy. This is not helped by the fact that only one of the storylines winds up working all of the time (Gollem being the most consistently well-written character in the film), and that one storyline (the Ents) could probably have done with being stuck off-screen for more of the movie, with some scenes being blended into one. The final battle in Helm's Deep suffers from vast tone problems; the arming of the children during the buildup suggests that PJ is going for helpless dread, but during the fighting Gimli constantly spouts comic relief, and there's a frankly ludicrous bit with an orc that carries the Olympic torch (Orcs having apparently not invented matches or fuses). It doesn't help that whenever the battle really gets going, we always seem to cut away to the Ent storyline.<br/><br/>The script is patchy to say the least - there is a whole subplot involving the ""common folk"" of Rohan which contains not one single good line (at one point someone says ""Where's mummy?""). Theodin gets some inferior character development, but I loved the 'exorcism' scene. <br/><br/>One major story problem is that throughout the film we encounter Sauron's forces only four times (two Nazgul attacks, two columns of troops), with the majority of the fighting being against the forces of Saruman. This means that the weight of the impending doom comes entirely from Saruman. By the end of the film, Saruman has been almost completely defeated, and because Sauron's might simply hasn't had enough screen time (bizarre fact: all the troops Sam and Frodo see seem to be marching AWAY from the goodies) the characters throughout the film are forced to constantly remind us that all is probably lost. This culminates with an extended speech from Sean Astin which unfortunately just winds up being corny - by that stage only in the Sam/Frodo/Gollem storyline are there any enemies immediately threatening the heroes. <br/><br/>I was disappointed to see only an incomplete version of Gandalf's fight with the Balrog - the part we see at the beginning is in all ways absolutely first class, but when it is concluded later it misses a huge section and skips straight to the top of the mountain. It should have been one of the most awesome fight scenes ever filmed. Generally, I thought the film used too much footage direct from FOTR to represent memories and flashbacks - not enough was filmed from different angles to make it fresh, even when the scene itself was great. And did we really need TWO dream sequences involving Arwen? <br/><br/>What is most astonishing about this film is how we get hardly any distance into the story. At the end, Saruman is still in his tower, and Sam and Frodo are yet to set foot in Morgul Vale. Unless Jackson is extremely careful, ROTK risks winding up a bullet-paced mess as he attempts to fit all the remaining story into the film. Nevertheless, this episode is often hugely enjoyable and even exhilarating; especially, any scene with Gollem is wonderful, despite the occasional tendency to make him look 'cute'. It might have a list of problems as long as my arm, but this is still rousing stuff."

","After I saw the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, I was so astonished inside that all I could think of was the great battle scene and part of me wished I was in that battle scene myself (someone who made it out alive, of course).  The second installment of the Lord of the Rings was even better than the first one.  That is very rare for a second installment to be better than it's predecessor.  It had everything that I said in my comment for the Fellowship of the Ring and even more.  Gollum was excellent everything that I hoped he would be.  What I really liked about Gollum's part was the argument between Gollum and Smeagol.  The camera cut at two different positions to make it look like there was two of him to show is ""split personality"" and them arguing.  The Battle at Helms Deep was one of the greatest battle scenes I have seen in quite a long time.  It beat Episode 2 in so many levels especially that Episode 2 was pretty much a video game and was not that good but... I'm supposed to be talking about The Two Towers. The Two Towers was definitely one of the greatest and most triumphant movies of this year.  I can't wait for the third installment, The Return of the King.  Once again Kudos to Peter Jackson and the cast for a great second installment of Lord of the Rings."
"Sabbe-","9","0","0","23 December 2002"," Great entertainment.
","Alright, the movie was very good. I voted 9 for it.<br/><br/>Two towers was a very different movie than FOTR, it had much more changes compared to the book and it had lots of humour (sometimes too much: for example the legolas skating scene, but other than that the humour was ok). I've struggled in my mind for long time about the changes.. most screwed up was the Faramir-fiasco, but I've found in my mind the good things about it, with help of IMDB user comments and threads.<br/><br/>First I though that Faramir was made weaker, but actually I think it made him stronger. The ring's power is great and Faramir had other troubles, Gondor in trouble and his brother just died. But in the end he decided to let Frodo & Sam go so that made him strong. And it was a pleasure to see the ruined city Osgiliath which was in the book only hinted at.<br/><br/>There were many other changes that irritated me too: Aragorns fake-falling, the fake allience between elves and men and lots of other things. But none of the changes changed the overall-plot of the movie. For example the osgiliath-scene made Sauron believe that the Ring is in Gondor so he will launch his great attack there.<br/><br/>It was a much worse translation from the book than FOTR was, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I loved Gollum, he deserves an oscar :)<br/><br/>
The battle scenes were great, I can't wait to see the Mordor's army surrounding Minas Tirith. Saruman's army looked so great that the army of Sauron must be something worth waiting :)<br/><br/>I'm sure that mostly the ones who haven't read the book enjoyed TT more, but it was well made, though it could've been edited better.<br/><br/>I think FOTR was better than TT, but not much. FOTR was 10, TT 9. I hope that Return of the King will be as good as the first movie. We'll see."
"Servo-11","10","0","0","23 December 2002"," Stunning, gorgeous, and impossible to look away from -- and I'm not just talking about Viggo Mortensen
","There is nothing I can add that hasn't been said by many others, but I'll just say that this movie blew me away like the first one did, yet in a different way.  The first movie introduced the sweeping scenery, the grandeur and majesty that will be the tone of the entire trilogy, but this movie introduced the brutal and desperate fight to save Middle Earth -- the raw emotions of the players to defend what is theirs and insure their survival.  I can only imagine what the final movie is going to be like as the tension is only going to get greater as Mount Doom gets closer and the final battle for Middle Earth takes place.  Wow.  It takes the breath away.<br/><br/>I was most awestruck by Gollum and the realism of this little creature, as well as the way in which he wrapped you up with his struggle to split away from his evil side.  The whole Smeagol/Gollum scene made me cry like a baby even though I was trying to block out the laughs of the ignoramuses around me who thought he was some kind of comedic spastic muppet.  However, *I* had *my* laugh when the oodles of fangirls gasped and squealed over Orlando's (face it, Legolas doesn't enter into it at all) two shining moments of derring-do.  Which were cool, I won't deny, but there's more to the movies than a butt like granite, however delectable it might be.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen was amazing as Aragorn and his character is unfolding more and more.  I loved the scene where he screamed in frustration at the pile of burnt orcs.  I imagine he was wondering what type of king he would be if he couldn't even save 2 hobbits.  And the subsequent intercutting between Merry and Pip's escape and him tracing their steps was very thrilling.<br/><br/>I was pleased that Arwen wasn't in it more than she was.  There was just enough, but not too much.  The scenes with her and Elrond was very poignant and I'm glad that they were put in rather than just have her pop in and out to suck face with Aragorn.<br/><br/>I've heard complaints about the abundance of Gimli humor, but I didn't think it demeaning in the least.  It was great and the banter between Legolas and Gimli was great.  I was so psyched to see their number competition at Helm's Deep retained.  The Elf-Dwarf friendship is one of the most beautiful things in the books.<br/><br/>Finally, I was really taken with Brad Dourif's performance as Grima. I've only seen him in a Babylon 5 episode (where he was awesome) and in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, so this was completely different from anything else I'd seen and I was amazed that he imbued so many facets in a character that we sadly saw so little of.  I've read an interview with him saying that Grima won't be in the third movie and I hope that is wrong!  It would be a bummer to not have my second favorite character make his rightful appearance at the end!<br/><br/>10/10 and the rating for the extended DVD will go through the roof"

I think this movie is putting too much effort on action and view (I do like the view though).Many main characteristics are no longer colorful such as gandolf, fordo ....(on the contray, some minor characteristics took over the attention). The long war scene is splendid but lack of details. It is impossible for them to beat so many enemy but they could play it more clever such as set some snack or use fire or water, which could make their final victory make more sense. But in the movie, there is just fight and blood, no wise, no trick, no really moving story. And finally, I don't believe gandolf can find such a large army. Watch the two forces of army running towards each other, I felt unreal, and somewhat just like playing a silly game."

","*** SOME SPOILERS *** Unlike some reviewers before me I do NOT think The Two Towers is as good as or even better then The Fellowship. The good for me included Gollum (who offered the best CGI ever but really came to life through the superb acting performance by Andy Serkins), the suffering of Frodo, the preparations for the battle of Helms Deep (the sheer desperation of the people of Rohan sending their children to war is spine-chilling), Grima Wormtongue (deliciously evil but still very human) and Aragorn (the role of a lifetime for Viggo Mortensen). The bad (as far as I'm concerned) lies mainly in some of the changes that have been made to the original text. The presence of Arwen(Elrond and Galadriel) is far too big, I can understand the need to remind viewers of the presence of Arwen but this is simply too much. The ""death"" of Aragorn (what is the point of letting the audience think he is dead when half of his scenes from the trailer are yet to come?) The depiction of Faramir (for 99% of the time he seems to be a evil version of Boromir while in the book he is actually a better version). Theoden's ""exorcism"" (you have GOT to be joking !!!). Don't get me wrong, I loved the film but I cannot help but feel that with a few changes this film would have been the match or even the better of FOTR."

I fail to see the need for the large deviations from Tolkien's original plot. Best: Ents trash Isengard (superb), Gollum, Frodo-Sam relationship development, Aragorn-becomes-King, Grima Wormtongue, Helm's Deep (esp arrival of Gandalf & Riders of Rohan).

","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)<br/><br/> Rating: 10/10<br/><br/>Well, yesterday (Sunday, December 22nd) was finally the day I had the chance to see the most anticipated motion picture of the year - The Two Towers. I loved the first part of the play and as I had my fears and doubts before marching into the theaters for The Fellowship of the Ring the first time, this time I didn't have any doubts. Only uncomfortable feeling was because I had read so many negative things from you on these message boards. There are few minor spoilers given below, so if you haven't seen the movie and want to know as little as possible about it, I recommend you stop reading right now.<br/><br/> -----SPOILERS AHEAD-----<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is just amazing. One funny thing was I had listened the soundtrack all over again multiple times in the past few weeks and had all the songs in clear memory and now I was able to catch those melodies from the movie. Balrog is just one of the most incredible creatures I've ever seen and the fight between Gandalf and Balrog is just --- awesome..<br/><br/> The Plot: There have been huge complaining about the changes made for the movie and I agree that the changes are a venture, indeed. There were almost six chapters left out from the movie including those chapters considering Saruman and the fate of Isengard, but because of fact that the movie tried to tie up the timing, which is very different in the book, I know they had no other choice. Who knows what they are going to put on the extended edition or what they are going to leave for The Return of the King. Anyway, I was a bit frustrated at first because I couldn't get involved from the very beginning --- and the problem was that there was no such a thing. That is why all of it was a bit confusing for me at first, but then it just sucked me into Middle-Earth. Now I am just too eager to just see it few more times in theaters --- I saw the first one five times and I just might break my own personal record with this one...<br/><br/>The Acting/Characters: Well, what can I say. Acting was just superb as it has been in the first movie. New characters were introduced quickly, but they all seemed to have what we call talent and ambition to show us what they've got in a hurry. Especially the performances by Brad Dourif and Miranda Otto were brilliant. One of the characters, who's a part which was changed almost completely, was Faramir. He was presented in the movie as a patriotic hero, which didn't quite work out for me, because it only left with the desire to know and see more of him. I hope they are putting some extra footage of him in the extended edition.<br/><br/>All right, who haven't appeared in my review yet? I must say that Sméagol is one of the most astonishing creations in the history of cinema and the performance of Andy Serkis as a disturbed, schizophrenic mind is just real and emotionally very affective. I felt pity and empathy for it from the first frame I saw it onscreen. One of the things I hated with other people with me that almost the whole audience was laughing during its personal struggle, by myself I just have to say that Serkis' performance was indeed superb and actually delivered very scary moments sometimes.<br/><br/>Complains I've heard about the appearance of Gandalf can be put aside by me; it just as in the book: he returns, he disappears and then he returns for the last time. Sir Ian McKellen is a wonderful actor, especially the moment he revealed himself to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli is one of the most memorable moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Gimli was one of the funniest characters. Yes, sometimes it went over the top, but I actually enjoyed his lines and jokes because it brought to me something that is about all dwarves; it is like these problems aren't still completely theirs and that he is just 'passing by'. That wasn't the best way to put it but I can sense carelessness in his personality and the times such as Aragorn falling off a cliff and their fear of losing Meriadoc and Pippin brought Gimli's emotional side forward.<br/><br/>Treebeard. He was fabulous. One thing I just wanted to see onscreen was his home and more of the Fangorn Forest, let's hope they put up some footage for the extended edition.<br/><br/>Directing: I cannot say that there weren't moments I didn't like as much as I would've liked, but considering the movie as a second act of the play the movie was awesome and Peter Jackson did his job well, bringing Middle-Earth in front of us again with huge threat of war upon them. Solutions he had made for the story, I accepted them because I know (after listening 220 minutes of him watching the commentary track of the extended edition for The Fellowship of the Ring) he knows what he's doing and I know that he will astonish us again, first with the extended edition for The Two Towers and then with the final chapter of the play, The Return of the King.<br/><br/>Music: Howard Shore's score is yet again amazing work and the movie works out well with such a musical extent involved; it tells you how to feel and it moves you emotionally. I was surprised Shore was not nominated for Golden Globe Award for this one, because the movie has although turned to be much darker and the score much different than the first one, brining Shore's talents yet again in front of us. I am just thrilled to find out after one very long year (again) what he does with the finale.<br/><br/> The movie was extremely violent compared to its predecessor, but the movie really is a war movie --- and most important an adaption from the book of J. R. R. Tolkien. At first I had problems with this movie but after all, I loved it. I cannot say if this one is better than the first and there are three major reasons: 1) The visual deluge onscreen was just so huge I have to see it multiple times, as soon as possible, 2) The mood of the film was just so different from the first movie and 3) I still consider them as a one movie cut in three parts.<br/><br/>This is going to be the greatest movie trilogies ever made. Let's just stand for each other to survive through the year 2003 and let's just enjoy the last year we can be together waiting for what's to come."
"BernhardtFrance","9","0","0","23 December 2002"," Great but battles too long
","The movie is more than great in terms of effects and pictures - maybe the best you've ever seen before. Forget about all other Sci-Fi or Fantasy pictures. Peter Jackson's direction is magic: He managed to combine three separate stories but the audience never get really lost. Maybe because of the quite poor story contend ?? Unfortunately you may tell the story of this 3 hour picture in only two sentences. The separated groups are following their ways and are meeting some creatures. By the way they help to win the different big (at Helm's) or small battles of the humans against the armies of Sauron. The Merry & Pippin plot is a very weak element in the film. Speaking and running trees are very hard to imagine for all of us humans and therefore the look of these scenes is artificial. Here we reach the limits of putting written words in moving images !? It reminds me of the creatures in ""the neverending story"" and it just doesn't fit in these great epic picture which looks so real - although the moving trees' effects are not really bad the scenes look childish and you see in every second that Merry and Pippin are filmed in the studio. The battle scenes in Rohan are far too long and maybe a little too violent. The best part of the movie is the Gollum-Frodo-Sam plot. Gollum is definitely THE star of this movie. The best animation ever realized in film history. This creature LIVES and has a torn schizo-character ! Unbelievable !<br/><br/>All in all - big fun and stunning pictures. You never get bored - anyway 8 out of 10 ! But the first part was better !<br/><br/>Mike Bernhardt"

","The two towers is a very emotional movie. Battle of Helms Deep was nerve wracking, i thought they were goners. The ents were cool. The battle of helms deep is very well depicted. It is really a site to see... quite possibly one of the best battle scenes ive ever seen. i give it a 10/10"

","I saw this movie on opening day and waited 2 hours to see it and i work at the theater i saw it at, the number of people alone ensured me that this movie would blow my mind the same way as the first.<br/><br/>This movie has no beginning and no end so it feels incomplete at first which was a problem i had coming out of the film because the last thing i remember about the movie was nothing.  But the bad ending aside(we all knew it was coming anyways) this movie was spectacular.  The battle scenes were like nothing ever seen before and just a tastse of what we will be seeing in the third film. The only drawbacks to the film were the few peices of comic relief because it seemed so horribly out of place, mainly because in the first film the comedy was just feel good stuff that made you comfortable with the charachters and made you truely care for them so that when they are put in danger you worry more.  But in two towers they just make wise comments which seem to mock the movie, i think the comedy should have been left out because it was hard to feel the emotions of certain scenes because of a generic one liner, in parcitular the beginning of the battle of helms deep gimli is waiting next to legolas in the fort for the uru kai charge and while i started getting that powerful feeling of dread for the danger the characters were in it was quickly shot by the camera goin to gimmlis head not going over the wall and he cracked a rediculous joke about not being able to see and the audience cracked up and i laughed but the scene was dead and the uru kai charged and a truly powerful scene was lost for me.  I want to view this movie again in a smaller crowd and truely expirence it for myself which i advise everyone to do because when theres a crowd laughing hysterically during a battle scene it because very hard to get into it.<br/><br/>But enough gripes dont get me wrong because this was more than an amazing movie because it made me realize that if a film can be this good and there are three of them and they are each different and the next one will be better then i am proud to be witness to what in my opinion is the greatest event in cinematic history.  Movies like the these are the movies that will truely inspire you, because it inspired me. Sorry for the long review.. here this is for those of you who wont read the whole thing<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS MOVIE IT IS AMAZING AND FAN OR NOT ULL EITHER STAY ONE OR BECOME ONE YOU CANT LOSE.10/10"
"Coilean","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," Excellent
","Full of heart, everything that Star Wars tried to be, and failed so miserably at, this movie simply is as near to perfect as you can get.  I will not compare it to the fellowship because realistically this is not a sequel but just another part of one long movie.  I can say that Lord of the Rings (fellowship, two towers, and no doubt return of the king) is the greatest movie of all time."
"ijahamran","Null","0","0","22 December 2002"," Did it, at least, match your imagination? It surpassed mine.
","Almost all of my friends know that I read LOTR only when I found out that the book was voted as the greatest book of the century. Prior to that I've never even heard or give a sh*t abt Tolkien. I haven't read any single book in the top 10 list and was determined to at least read the book that tops the list even if it kills me. Yes, I was motivated to read LOTR out of vanity. It took me close to a year to finish it the first time around. It was laborious. Honestly, LOTR is a difficult book to read. It took me so long because I would stop every so often to re-read every sentence until it made sense in this little mind of mine.<br/><br/>But the genius of the book didn't hit me until much later. I was reading the part when Frodo said ""It's getting heavier"" when I decided I couldn't stand it any longer and hurled the the book against the wall (which will explain why my copy of the book is in such bad shape and why it has been scotch-taped in so many places.) I didn't continue until weeks later. THAT was how powerful the book is. Frodo's burden became my burden. I didn't even realise that it was taking over my life until I came to that precise moment.<br/><br/>For the longest time Middle Earth existed only in my head (of course today we all know that it is also known in modern times as New Zealand). I couldn't even talk about the book because no one else I know have read it and even when I tried I found that I could not convey the awe and respect that I feel towards the book and its writer. It's now 2002 and since then I've read the book maybe 20 additional times. 2 movies from the trilogy have been released. Today, everyone (unless you've been living with your head up your a** all these while) have at least heard of Frodo the blue-eyed hobbit and the delectable Arwen Evenstar.<br/><br/>Well I have been of the opinion that it is impossible to bring the book to celluloid. IMPOSSIBLE. So when FOTR came out, I suspended all hopes and expectations. I told myself it doesn't matter -- even if FOTR tanked to high heavens I would already be so grateful for the effort to bringing it to life. Bring it on.<br/><br/>And I was grateful. I still am. Honestly, there are very few things that I don't like abt both movies. And 'don't like' is such a strong phrase. I'd rephrase that to say that there are very few things that I thought could have been handled better. My initial reaction to the FOTR stands -- the fighting scenes were incredible but were not captured well enough -- and the same feeling came over me in TTT. The close-ups were disturbing and messy but didn't convey the urgency and desperation of war. But battle scenes have always been difficult to film anyway and very few directors have managed to do this gracefully (I can only name Kurosawa, no one else comes to mind at this point of time). The second one is this, I still think Aragon should be taller and statelier (he is from the race of kings, after all) and more tormented -- for someone who's forced to reclaim his throne and lead the last great war of the Third Age -- somehow I didn't think his pain and solitude came across very well in the movies. But, what do I know? It's probably a  tactical strategy on Peter Jackson's part so that the focus of the film remains on the hobbits.<br/><br/>But apart from that, there are many things to love. In TTT,  Gollum is a wonder. The scene of him singing at the Forbidden Pool is priceless and when he was brutally captured by Faramir's soldiers - although you know it's just CGI - you can't help but feel sorry for it. The CGI is excellent. I gladly revoke my loyalty to Squaresoft and pass the torch to WETA. In the book I hated Gollum and couldn't understand why Frodo didn't kill it; just as I felt no sadness for Boromir when he died. Watching the films made me see the other sides of these 2 unfortunate characters -- I only saw the evil when I read the book but the films brought out their humanity.<br/><br/>My favourite scenes are actually the ones that PJ added into the movie ie the scenes at Helm's Deep between (i) Legolas vs Gimli when Gimli complains that he can't see any of the battle.. the only scene where Legolas smiles voluntarily and (ii) Aragorn vs Gimli when they are about to ambush the orcs using the side door.<br/><br/>What can I say? If you haven't watched TTT -- go! Not because it is a great fantasy fiction flick but because it is simply Lord Of The Rings -- the book from which, in my humble opinion, all fantasy fiction books/movies were born from. If reading is not your thing (and the book is more than 1,000 pages long the appendices alone can kill you) the movies are worthy substitutes. They are not 100% JRR Tolkien... no one can achieve that I think, but the heart and spirit of the movies are very close the what was conveyed in the book.<br/><br/>And of course, the Legolas in the movies is so much cuter than the Legolas I had in my mind :-)<br/><br/>TTT is an excellent piece of work and a worthy successor to FOTR. Miss this at your own peril!!"

","This movie was so good it made 3 hours seem like 5 minutes.  The time flew just as fast the second time I watched it.  In fact, I enjoyed it MORE the second time.  Peter Jackson and Company put so much detail into this movie that it seems you see something new every time you watch it. <br/><br/>
In that way, one may say that the movies are as good as the books.  I've read the books many times and I still enjoy them every time I read them.  So far, the movies are living up to that level of quality as well.<br/><br/>Memorable moments from the movie include Gandalf vs. Balrog, Gollum's torment, Grima's passion for evil, Legolas & Gimli's growing relationship, Aragorn's courage, the last charge of the Ents, Rohan's last stand, Eomer's charge, Gollum's fish song, Sam's unfaltering strength, and many more..."
"matlock-6","9","0","0","23 December 2002"," Not as true to the book as the first film
","While certainly a very good movie, visually appealing, dramatic and awe inspiring in many ways, The Two Towers is not as good as The Fellowship of the Ring for many of the same reasons FOTR could have been better.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson takes some liberties with the characters here that weren't taken in the first film. Faramir, while ably portrayed, doesn't seem quite right. And the scene in which Aragorn falls into a coma and dreams about Arwen (conveniently providing a heavy kiss romance scene) is a good scene, but also wasn't a part of the original story.<br/><br/>All these are acceptable, as many of them make the film better than it would otherwise be, however, there are two glaring omissions, both involving orcs.<br/><br/>The scenes which involve Merry and Pippin being held captive by the two different bands of orcs, and fought over by Grishnak and the Uruk-hai leader (I forget his name). Some of the arguments ans conversations here were among the best in the book and are missed. <br/><br/>Also, as has been mentioned by other here, the orcs, while certainly vile, frightening and mean looking, are far too puny during fights. Especially the Uruk-Hai, who are supposed to be a kind of super-orc, are mowed down left and right simply by Aragorn and Theoden riding their horses through them. While we see orcs being slain left and right, we rarely see the orcs defeating any humans, elves or whomever. The orcs were vicious, formidable fighters in Tolkien's book, and instead, are portrayed like the storm troopers in Star Wars, whose primary role seems to be to continually lose fights. They should lose, since that's how the story goes, but they don't have to be routed. <br/><br/>Probably not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable."

","What can I say? As much as I would like to enjoy these LOTR <br/><br/>movies, I just can't seem to get into the spirit of this series. I found<br/><br/>the first one beautiful to look at, but ultimately dull and not<br/><br/>involving. Even gave it a second chance by watching it on DVD.<br/><br/>Nothing. Glowing reviews and the promise of a ""better film"" got me<br/><br/>into the theater for this one. Well, Gollum ""is"" a technical wonder.<br/><br/>This CGI marvel is by far, the most engaging character in the<br/><br/>movie. The battle near the end of the movie is also wonderful to<br/><br/>look at. Lots of good ""eye candy"" there. But the rest of the movie?<br/><br/>(Yawn!) Why would director Peter Jackson, spend over two hours<br/><br/>building to the climax of this movie, the battle, and then keep<br/><br/>cutting away from it to show us the two Hobbits and Treebeard<br/><br/>walking & talking? For me, it kept grinding the film to a halt.<br/><br/>And extended DVD's? Are you kidding me? These movies are<br/><br/>plenty long enough as is, thank you very much. One thing's for sure, I don't care how good the reviews are for the<br/><br/>next chapter. I won't be rushing off to see Return of the King. 6/10"

","So I finally got to see The Two Towers and during the first half hour the pace slowed down, but it later picked up and got better by the minute.<br/><br/>Summary: The story continues with 3 different tales, Frodo and Sam journey alone towards Mordor to destroy the ring, but are lost. They finally catch the annoying Gollum, who has been after them since the Mines of Moria. I got so tired of Gollum, the annoying gibberish and screaming. His only mission is to get back the ring, but as the movie progresses we learn that Smeagol, Gollum's real name needs a shrink due to his split personality. Anyways, Smeagol decides to help them get to Mordor, but instead they run into Boromir's brother Faramir, who seems to have the same intentions as his dead brother. <br/><br/>On the other end, Pippin and Merry escape from the Uruk-Hai and end up in a forest, where they meet treebeard...who is a tree, that talks and walks....right...<br/><br/>And behind them are Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who take the path to Rohan to find Pip and Merry, but after Gandalf re-appears now as Gandalf the white they are sent to help the king of Rohan who is under Saruman's spell and the annoying Wormtongue, who has a schoolboy crush on the king's niece is there working undercover for Saruman, one look at him and you will know he is a bad guy. There, Aragorn meets the fine Éowyn, who is the niece of the king and a major tom-boy. Anyways, she falls for the elegant and charming Aragorn, let's face it, who wouldn't fall for him? But Aragorn's heart belongs to Arwen, the elf, whom he seems to have broken up with...whilst Arwen is forced to choose between her immortality and her love for Aragorn, the guy who dumped her.<br/><br/>Whilst Frodo is going under the spell of the ring, he fears he won't make it, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli lead the refugees of Rohan to the great fortress of Helm's Deep aware that they have at least ten thousand Uruk-Hai heading their way for war, Merry and Pip are hanging around on trees literally, Middle Earth seems to have no hope left and all that, you can actually see in the trailer as well.<br/><br/>This movie is much darker than the one before, I even read the books, they took a whole to read, they are packed with each character singing and dancing through out all 3 books (no joke) and with the books you can't really visualize the surroundings of each character and scenery much, it's great to see that Peter Jackson's imagination really brings life into the characters and the whole story. There's also quite a bit missing from the books to the movie, but I guess that's to be expected.<br/><br/>In this movie the only person who had a comedy part was Gimli (John Rhys-Davis), a lot more Elvish is spoken in it between the characters and my favorite scene was when Gandalf rode out of the stables, that was great. There was a lot of hard work put into Helm's Deep and it was truly worth watching and as for Gollum, he seemed nice and innocent at times and that was cute. I do hope there will be an extended version of this movie and the cast are really breath taking in their roles.<br/><br/>I'm rating this 10/10. All Lord of the Rings fans will love it."

","If you expect to see the continuation of fantasy saga of Epic battles of Good Vs. Evil, a hero struggling against  the powers of darkness, decent not-wooden<br/><br/>acting showing at least a bit of emotion, exotic and mysterious locations,<br/><br/>Christopher Lee playing a memorable villain and at least one believable digital character... forget George Lucas and his miserable attempt to win back his<br/><br/>crown in the field he once ruled. This is it. The Two Towers is an expectable of such overwhelming force, you'd shed a tear of pure joy as one of the (evil) movie characters did in one of the many<br/><br/>memorable scenes. I can't even decide which is my favorite. One thing which will keep this movie for being properly praised other than<br/><br/>annoying Tolkien geeks with its inaccuracies, is that it doesn't feel like a<br/><br/>complete movie. Its beginning looks as if you entered the theater five minutes after the movie started, and the ending doesn't have the chapter-closure felt in Fellowship. Yet movies can't get any better than this. From the scary scenes at the swaps to the heartbreaking love story between Aragorn and Arwen. Gollum is the first CGI character in a live action film I can say has a soul. This has to be one in my opinion, of the best movies ever made."
"danthemovieman","10","0","0","23 December 2002"," A masterpiece of its time!
","Truly this is one of the great movies ever written. ""The Two Towers"" is a wonderful film, filled with dazzling special effects and awesome battle scenes.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Gandalf falling with the creature that dragged him down when they were passing through Moria. It shows him battling the creature in the air and later shows how the battle turns out. The story then switches to Frodo and his loyal apprentice, Samwise Gamgee. As Frodo becomes more controlled by the ring, Sam is getting more worried of his master.<br/><br/>When Gollum sees them sleeping, he attempts to take the ring, but fails. The special effects on Gollum are astounding and the creature steals the show. He agrees to help Frodo and Sam find the Gates of Mordor.Meanwhile, Aragon, Legolas, and Gimli are searching for their two friends that were taken captive, Merry and Pippen.<br/><br/>This is just as good (possibly better) than the first one. Warning: If you haven't seen the first one you will be completely lost so before you see this see the first one. Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, John Rhys-Davies, Ian McKellen, and Sean Astin all give superb performances and the new characters are a treat (especially Gollum and the Empts) The empts are fun to watch, they are basically talking and walking trees that don't like to be pushed around. This story has a lot more humor in it, especially when Gimli (Rhys-Davies) is around.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece of its time and its got my vote for Best Picture of the Year. This story is good vs. evil is very well written by the brilliant writer J.R.R Tolkien and Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job in translating this wonderful book into a wonderful movie.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

"kevinm-4","Null","0","0","23 December 2002"," Not like the book...
","I am a ""Tolkien geek"" who thinks Tolkien would hate Peter Jackson and his films were he alive today and watching them. I live and breathe Middle Earth and I cannot even begin to fathom the injustice that Jackson has done with his movies. For example, in the 89th minute of the film, Aragorn lifts his left arm and points off into the distance. When I saw this I thrashed about in my seat because EVERYBODY knows that in the book, Aragorn raises his ""right"" arm and points. Why can't Jackson get that right? And later, in the battle for Helm's Deep, Gimli bellows for the foe to ""come at me."" In the movie he yells ""Come at me"" to the foe but quite clearly (I've now seen the film three times already since Wednesday) you can hear that it, indeed, is a yell and NOT a bellow. At the beginning of the movie, when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are tracking Merry and Pippen, Legolas stops and stares off the west, but in the movie, due to the position of the Sun, he appears to be looking more southwest. And in another scene, Aragorn is seen with his sword shackled to his left hip when in the book his blade was described to be scabbered to his ""right"" hip. And right before the battle of Helm's Deep, it states in the book that the enemy stomp their feet and then their spears, but in the movie only the spears are ""beaten."" Why is this? Was it too much to ask for the actors to stomp their feet, too? <br/><br/>I know Jackson should be praised for doing what nobody has ever done, or even attempted to be done. I know this could have been two films, or even a lone film. Or even worse an ABC Mini-series. I know this movie is doing to the fantasy genre what ""Star Wars"" did for science-fiction. And many people have told me that Tolkien, were he alive, would be thrilled and tickled pink at the attention that has been lavished on his epic, exhilerated by the movies and his imagination brought to life on the screen. In fact, my best friend told me the other day that Tolkien would probably pull a ""Shatner"" on guys like me, telling me ""to get a life"" and not psycho-analyze this movie. Perhaps he's right. But then again, I've read the ""Lord of the Rings"" at least 1,000 times since age 12, and so my usual retort is that ""I know more about this trilogy than Mr. Tolkien himself does.""<br/><br/>But why can't directors simply film pages from the book? Just start at page 1, roll camera, read the dialogue straight from the pages, and film a movie? If the story can thrill countless millions in the minds of its readers, than surely this same UNALTERED story can do the same through the lense of a camera? Why has Peter Jackson made so many subtile changes from the book? Yes, yes, yes, obviously the worgs that aren't there or Aragorn's plunge over the cliff are huge deviations from the book, but what's gotten me so vexed are the ""small"" changes as well. It makes no sense since the action IS RIGHT THERE IN THE PAGES OF THE BOOKS!<br/><br/>Don't see this movie. Mr. Jackson is dropping the ball with these movies and Tolkien is obviously spinning in his grave. Like that Helm's Deep scene when the rain begins to fall. It obvioulsy started falling 'after' the battle had commenced, not before as it was shown in the movie. And what about Merry and Pippen?

","This was a truly awesome movie. I knew it was going to be awesome before I even walked into the theater. I knew this because (1) it is the sequel to Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings and (2) the book is awesome. I had read about half the book when I saw The Two Towers, and I must say it followed the movie very closely. The pacing of the book and movie is different in that the book tells all of Aragorn and friend's story first then Frodo's story. The two plots parallel each other in the movie, but I'm cool with that.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the good things in this movie. Once again, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Morteson, and all the rest provide us with great acting jobs. I guess they just really get into their characters. The script was great also; it was faster, funnier, darker, and more intelligent then the original.<br/><br/>Second: Howard Shore and his brilliant score. I love his use of themes here. From the fiddle for Rohan to the tried-and-true Lothlorien theme, it was all great. It wasn't all fast paced drums, strings, and brass for the battle sequences either, although the music certainly got your pulse throbbing at some points. <br/><br/>Third: Gollum. I didn't know what to expect of this creature. I had heard great things about him, but I had not read his part of the story when I saw the movie. I still wasn't sure what to think of him after the movie. But I'll be damned, that is the finest piece of computer generated acting I have seen.<br/><br/>And of course, the cinematography and special effects were awesome. If you've seen the first movie, expect more of the same and then some. Case in point: the Battle of Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>*SPOILER!*SPOILER!* Now for my one complaint. It left a very important scene from the book out of the movie. I won't go into great detail for those of you reading the book, but there is a scene in the middle of The Two Towers (it would be at the end of the movie) where Gandalf and Saruman have a confrontation, only this time the tables are turned. It would have been awesome to see these two wizards duking it out once again, but alas it was not to be. Hopefully it will be included in the third installment of the series.<br/><br/>That is the only reason I do not give this movie a perfect 10. I wanted to see more Saruman and Gandalf, but Jackson did an awesome job with this movie anyways. From the opening shot to the last reel, it is a spectacle to behold.<br/><br/>rating: 9/10"

","There is a movie called The Dark Crystal. It begins with a narrative voice telling ""In a different time...In a different place...In the age of Wonder"" Long have I wondered what it would be like to live in that age. Well, with this movie gathering masses of exited cinema goers and in  the darkness binding them with pure Magic I believe we somehow are, living in the Age of Wonder.

","First, Faramir. While you couldn't exactly say I'm HAPPY about the changes to Faramir's character, I do nevertheless understand and accept its necessity to the film. The Helm's Deep sequence is so incredible, it's utterly distracting from the Frodo side of the story, especially for the average viewer. PJ needed to concoct something that could compete with this, and creating doubt over the fate of the ring was the obvious choice.<br/><br/>All of the changes in this film improved the story in terms of drama and pacing. Any of you expecting a direct translation of the books obviously no nothing of film, or what makes film work best. You need to get into the real world, where people accept that the books are VERY difficult to translate into film, and extensive changes must be made."
"seventh_samurai54","10","0","0","23 December 2002"," A grand epic.
","Before going to see this film, I had doubts that Peter Jackson could match his fantastic first chapter to this grand epic trilogy. Boy, was I in for a surprise. Not only does the Two Towers match the Fellowship of the Ring, it absolutely shows it up. With this film Peter Jackson has created a epic worthy of the book, and a brilliant film on it's own.<br/><br/>The Two Towers introduces us to a handful of new characters. Most notably is Gollum, wonderfully played by Andy Serkis. By far Gollum is the greatest and most realistic CGI character ever brought to the screen. Andy Serkis should be rewarded for bringing such depth and emotion to this troubled creature. Also amazing are Treebeard and the Ents.<br/><br/>LOTR: The Two Towers is a stunning achievement and a benchmark of special effects in film. If the Return of the King is half as good as this film, then it will complete the greatest trilogy in the history of film. Next December can't come soon enough."

","I have read the books several times and remember their messages.  Peter Jackson and his team have not lost those messages or what the peoples of Middle Earth represented in Tolkien's time.<br/><br/>In the first movie the messages where:<br/><br/>""Not how much time you have but what you do with the time that you have.""<br/><br/>""Even the smallest person can make a difference.""<br/><br/>And there is, of course, temptation and corruption.  Sarumon fell to corruption.  Borimir fell to temptation.<br/><br/>The Two Towers main message is about isolationism.  Treebeard will not help. ""It is not our problem.  This is a war of men.""  Much like the times Tolkien lived through in World Wars I and II when the United Sates did not want to fight a European War.  When the hand of evil can stretch across the globe it affects all the world and thus all the world must stand up against evil as the United States eventually did.  Genghis Kahn.  Napolean.  Adolf Hitler.  Mussolini.  Stalin.  Khadafi.  Saddam Hussien.  Osama Bin Laden. The times change.  The names change.  The evil remains the same.<br/><br/>Of course there is the burden people must bare throughout history.  Frodo bares this burden by carrying the Ring of Power to see to its destruction.<br/><br/>There are many more messages in this film and in the books.  I challenge all to find them.<br/><br/>The movie itself is breathtakingly filmed and very well acted.  I would like to put in a word for best supporting actor for Andy Serkis as Gollum and the animation team.  They would rightly deserve the honor.<br/><br/>This film will definitely take home an acadamy award for special affects for the Battle of Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>I cannot say more.  No words can really describe the granduer of this movie. It is a must see and one of the best movies I have ever seen."
"witch king","10","0","0","23 December 2002"," A ringing success!
","It is the rare film which is an improvement upon its original. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" has eclipsed ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in sheer cinematic story-telling. Perhaps its only serious rival in this regard is ""The Godfather, Part Two"" [1974]. Director Peter Jackson opens ""The Two Towers"" boldly--without plot summary or other device and plunges us into the tale. He risks much at the outset--the fight to the death between Gandalf and the Balrog, but this ratchets up the tension from the outset, and for nearly three hours, Jackson never loses his grip. As in ""The Fellowship,"" Jackson has taken certain liberties with Tolkien's original; I thought I would find them annoying and disturbing, but he really has done an admirable job compressing the labyrinthine complexities of Tolkien's story. After many readings of the tale, there is still no character I love more than another. The acting in ""The Two Towers"" impressive. Viggo Mortensen's Aragon is heroic in a brooding way. Legolas [Orlando Bloom] and Gimli [John Rhys-Davis] are less easy to cast, but both actors give their characters life and, more importantly, strength. I was deeply affected by Hugo Weaving's [Elrond] and Liv Taylor's [Arwen] discussion of her fate if she marries Aragorn. In Tolkien, I think it is obvious that the elf lord loves Arwen, but the scene in ""The Two Towers"" is overwhelming. The heart-breaking scene gives a human dimension to the cinematic tale that only hard-core Tolkien readers know about from reading ""The Tale of Aragon and Arwen"" from the Appendices following the end of the book. The violence in the film cannot be discounted and unsuitable though it may be for the very young, it is implicit in Tolkien. Use your imagination. Gollum is a wonderful creation. Jackson plays it close to Tolkien's original without its being a mere copy. The only incident which I didn't care for was Frodo's drawing his sword on Sam, but I also understood it. Tolkien could spin out his tale of Frodo's slow enslavement to the ring, but Jackson cannot. This great film's virtues are many and its flaws minor, almost irrelevant. Howard Shore has proven to be a master musician in darkening his score to underscore the action. Jackson has painted a gorgeous portrait of a most difficult theme...and he's not finished yet."

"ilovedolby","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," Epic sequel lives up to ""The Fellowship...""
","Well here we are, one year after THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. I know that many of you out there are all very excited about this release, as you all should be. After all, if THE TWO TOWERS is anything like THE FELLOWSHIP. then it will undoubtedly be good. This is the obvious case. That's what happens when you have a director, Peter Jackson, who is more than just an avid fan of J.R.R Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. Jackson has created two motion pictures that are epic beyond proportion to anything that we have ever seen before theatrically. They are visually stunning, filled with incredible action sequences, and a story that reaches into the very foundations of all of our imaginations. When THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING opened last year on December 19, it was a huge success with an opening box-office weekend upwards of $45 million. What's more, it didn't really fall out of the public's attention after the Christmas holiday; rather it held on. With talk of Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations, strong word of mouth from film patrons, critical appeal, and a huge fan base that was already established from the amazing series of books, THE FELLOWSHIP. proved to be a huge success in every aspect. Now, after one year of waiting we have THE TWO TOWERS. George Lucas, creator of the STAR WARS Trilogy and INDIANA JONES said it best during an interview about the original STAR WARS Trilogy. George said that every play has three acts. In the first act, there is a small victory. The second act puts the main characters in the worst possible situation. And in the third act, the hero saves the day, and all's well that end's well. That's the case with THE LORD OF THE RINGS Trilogy. THE FELLOWSHIP. set the stage with a small victory at the end of the film, but establishing the idea of hope and that there is more to come in the story. THE TWO TOWERS pits its characters in the worst possible situation. Naturally, we can expect some fantastic ending to come next year in THE RETURN OF THE KING. As for THE TWO TOWERS, Frodo and Sam are off in the land of Mordor, trying to get to the gates of Mordor to destroy `the one ring.' However, they notice that they are being followed, and who should it be but Gollum, the deformed creature that originally had the ring before it came into the possession of Bilbo. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum and make him lead them to the gates of Mordor. Meanwhile Aragorn, Gimly the dwarf, and Legolas the elf are off to find the two hobbits who were kidnapped during the final battle of THE FELLOWSHIP., Merry and Pippin. But the lands of Middle Earth are in more peril than ever, and Saruman The White is sending his army of Uruk-hai against the lands of Middle Earth. In this case, it is primarily the land of Rohan. It is up to the three companions of the original fellowship to unit with the people of Rohan, and with the help of Gandalf The White, formally The Grey. They lead the people of Rohan into an immense battle in a place called Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>Obviously the plot is far more intricate than that, however, fantasy, at least for me, is a bit difficult to explain. And I'm sure that those of you who haven't seen THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are probably confused by the plot explanation in the above paragraph. If you are, then watch the first film or read the first book in the trilogy. But THE TWO TOWERS is equally as good as THE FELLOWSHIP. was. I can't really decide which film is better, or which I would prefer to watch. THE TWO TOWERS is more action packed, and there are the occasional jokes that one can't help but be amused at. The acting in the film is good, what would be expected for such a film. But the acting isn't phony either. In fact, the characters seem very heroic you find yourself and other audience members rooting them on. It's a wonderful film, and what a gift for the holidays to have in theaters. If you were not able to see THE FELLOWSHIP. theatrically, I urge you to see this one theatrically. Especially in a digital sound theater if you can. The film is huge and filled with splendor; it needs to be seen on `the big screen' to be truly appreciated for all that it is. It's become more than a film. Rather, the release of THE TWO TOWERS is an event. I was fortunate enough to see it this morning in Albany at Hoyts Crossgates Cinemas 18, which in my opinion are the finest digital theaters around. And believe me, I've been to many megaplexes from here to Florida. The show was sold out, and the crowd cheered, applauded, and rooted the characters on. Like seeing the original STAR WARS on it's opening day reissue back on January 31, 1997, the crowd was half of the fun of going. These films are amazing. See them and love them for all that they are, extraordinary motion pictures. ****"

","There is not much that can be said that hasn't already been chronicled in other viewers comments. I was incredibly surprised at how moving the film actually was. During the sequences leading up to the Battle at Helms Deep I was riveted to the screen. Not really being a fan of cgi I had been afraid that the portrayal of Gollum was going to be nothing more than a lame computer generated graphic. How wrong I was. It was Gollum who probably had more depth than any other character in the film. Watching his conflicted discussions really brought home the insidiousness of the Ring for me. I had read LOTR probably 25 times over the last 20 yrs and Follum was never as vivid as he was on screen.<br/><br/>I have never before seen a battle filmed that can hold a candle to Helm's Deep, even the Ents storming Isengard was amazing. Its true that Peter Jackson took some serious liberties with the story line. And although I consider myself a Tolkien purist at heart the film was simply amazing. This interpretation complements Tolkiens work well and I think that JRR would be pleased with how it has come out so far. I cant wait until they release the extended version of TTT like FOTR, I could have used an extra 30 minutes."

","Really, I did enjoy the movie.  Honest.  There were great moments here:<br/><br/>1) Aragorn's grief at the ""deaths"" of Merry and Pippin. 2) Aragorn's comic delight at seeing the Elven archers 3) The counting match between Gimli and Legolas 4) Sean Astin--let's just give him the award for Best Performance in a Supporting Role and call it done. 5) Best new way to mount a moving horse award to Legolas 6) The Orc Army 7) Pippin and Merry's delight at ""getting it right"".  (I understand this wasn't in the book, but it was nice to see the two little trouble makers growing up a bit and coming into their own.) 8) The battle between Gandalf and the Balrog 9) Just about everything at the Battle of Helm's Deep (even the Elven archers who aren't in the book)<br/><br/>But--<br/><br/>1) Who's idea was it to have Legolas go stair-surfing?  It didn't look cool, it looked anachronistic and dumb. 2) Some of the dialogue (including Sam's lengthy spiel about heroic stories toward the end) was cringe-worthy. 3) So was the dwarf tossing business.  I know we needed some comic relief, but why Gimli every time? 4) Gollum's unfortunate Donald Duck voice--I'm sorry, but the argument between Gollum and Smeagol brought the house down with laughter when I saw it.  Instead of being a tense and heart tugging moment, it became a cause for laughter. 5) The lighting of the bomb at Helm's Deep looked a lot like the Olympic Torch lighting.  Please! 6) It really wouldn't bother me a whole lot if Peter Jackson went outside cannon and killed Arwen.  Now.  Please.  Before I toss my pasta. 7) Also let the Nazgul get Eowyn instead of the other way around. 8) Some of the things taken out ""because of time constraint"" were replaced by things that took up more time than the things they replaced. 9) Was anyone else besides me and my friends waiting for the army at Mordor to start singing ""Oh-wee-oh"" from ""The Wizard of Oz""?  I would not have been at all surprised to see Sam, Frodo and Gollum grab three orc soldiers, smack them on their heads and then reappear dressed in their armor to march inside.  Oh, but that would have ended the movie early, wouldn't it?<br/><br/>But I liked it.  It made me cry in the right spots and it didn't have two things that make me want to scream whenever I see them: Jar Jar Binks and Princess What's Her Name of Naboo.  Also I appreciate that none of the females (Elven or otherwise) resorted to wearing lots of revealing clothing. <br/><br/>That said, this was weaker than the glorious first film and I hope Return of the King redeems and clarifies the changes made."

The liberties taken with the book in translating it to the big screen are numerous, pointless, and damaging. There is no tension, no character development (Gimli is simply there for comic relief; he even axes an orc in the crotch, that never gets old), and no single rousing performance (with the notable exception of the CGI-generated Gollum/Smeagol).  The battle of Helms Deep is convoluted, unsuspenseful, and ridiculous, and Arwen seemed to be thrown into the movie to try and create a strong female lead (and something of a love triangle) where there wasn't one in the book.  Other things (e.g. the oiliphants) were included almost as if Jackson were going down a list checking things off before moving on to the next disappointment.  Where the book contained suspense, insightful dialogue, and yes, humor, Jackson has substituted some inferior jargon meant only to fluff the audience into thinking that this is somehow a masterpiece.

"NORWOLF1","9","0","0","21 December 2002"," Filming the ending of an Age
","Darkness. Bleakness. Age. The final mustering of strength of a weary warrior and of weary, ruined kingdoms long past their splendor. The end of an Age of the world. That is what the Two Towers invokes.<br/><br/> Watching this film reminded me in a way that Fellowship did not that I am witnessing before my eyes the end of the Third Age. That is what this film is about. The darkness is not just the darkness of Mordor consuming Middle Earth, it is the darkness and bleakness of the end of an Age. Yes, elves are leaving Middle Earth. But, men and the kingdom of men also seem at their end, long past their glory. These ancient, worn kingdoms of men seem called upon to master their last strength, strength that is long past its glory; their kingdoms seem shadows, ruins, remnants of their former glory. Even when Theoden is no longer ""possessed"", Rohan and Theoden still seem past their glory, weary warriors, Rohan seems a weary kingdom, devoid of life, at the end of its days, gray and worn, devoid of many people. There are no teeming multitudes in Rohan. It seems an empty cold, windy chilled plain, a barren land. Osgilath, the ruined city of Gondor is in decay. Even the sky throughout the film is gray and bleak, like a gray, depressing November or December day at the end of a year, the dying season, winter. Sams words at the end of the film (pulled directly from the book) echoes this theme, what will there be left to save at the end? Will anything that once was remain the same? All will be transformed, and much that once was will be lost, by its last stand against darkness, as PJ has already hinted at for the Return of the King and as readers of the books already know.<br/><br/> This is a movie about war. In this, it is much different than Fellowship of the Ring. Fellowship of the Ring seemed much more fantastical and much more of an adventure movie. Two Towers, as PJ said, is a movie about men, about warfare. The movie, for me, at least, centers around Rohan and Theoden and Aragon (and Faramir) and the war of men (Rohan and Gondor) against Saruman and Mordor. This movie is much less Frodo-centric than Fellowship of the Ring. I remember in the DVD of Fellowship that Phillipa said that Fellowship was rewritten to make all the story Frodo-centric, centered around Frodo and the ring. While Frodo is still important in the Two Towers, it seems that the movie's focus is on Rohan and the plight of men (the plight of Osgilath and Farmir also reaffirm this), who seem worn, their kingdoms near desolation, yet expected to fight one last time, though at the end of their days. Gondor and Rohan seem shadows of their former glory, children and elderly fighting, their people dirty peasants, their cities in ruins. When the banner of Rohan falls before Aragon arrives, blown by the wind, truly that is the state of men and of Middle Earth at the time of the film.<br/><br/> To me, the main characters in this film are Theoden and Aragon, the old king of Rohan and the future king of Gondor. In Theoden we see the passing of the Third Age, a former warrior-king (similar to those in Germanic tales) past his prime as is his kingdom. He is torn about leading his people to war. He knows he may be leading what people are left in the kingdom to their end. He might be leading his kingdom to its final breath. I found his character wholly engaging, thought-provoking, and empathetic.<br/><br/> Viggo again does a wonderful job as Aragon.<br/><br/> As for the rest of the returning cast, they all do a wonderful job. John Rhyss-Davies is hilarious as Gimli. I love that this time his character is given more screen time, which was cut out of the theatrical version of Fellowship and not returned to Fellowship until the extended DVD.<br/><br/> As for Gollum, I did not find him as believable as many people have stated. Throughout he seemed to me CGI. However, in close ups of his face, he did look like Andy Serkis. Truly this was an actor acting Gollum when we focused on Gollum's face. I felt pity for Smeagol and terror of Gollum. PJ does a great job at the turmoil of Smeagol/Gollum and the difference between the two personalities and, most of all, at showing how Gollum is what Frodo is already becoming because of his ""addiction"" to the ring.<br/><br/> I did not find the changes to Faramir's character jarring. I had always found the Faramir section of the Two Towers rather boring, so I liked that there was more tension involved. In the end, Faramir is the Faramir that we know from the books. He doesn't give in to the ring. > The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was some of the scenes with Arwen. I did however think the scene where we see Arwen and Elrond together and Arwen has to make the decision to stay or leave definitely was a worthwhile addition to the film.<br/><br/> As for the Ents, Treebeard was rendered wonderfully and much of his dialogue came directly from the book. Some of the other Ents however looked a little ""cutesy"". I did have some misgivings that the Ents did not after Entmoot say right away that they would attack Saruman, but having Pippin and Merry lead Treebeard toward Orthanc to show him the desolation Saruman had created does give Pippin and Merry a more important role to play. We do get to see Pippin and Merry begin to take on more responsibility, though their role in the film is small compared to the other two major storylines, the major one being that of Theoden/Aragon and the other of Frodo/Golllum (again the old and the new, the old ringbearer and the new ringbearer).<br/><br/> Gandalf is given very little time in the movie also. Again, I think because the script was written toward focusing on the Aragon and Theoden comparison and the Frodo and Gollum comparison.<br/><br/> On the whole this is a very different film from Fellowship. Fellowship was about Frodo. This is about the ending of an Age and the trials of the weary kingdoms of men in the end times.<br/><br/> Did I like it? Yes. But for different reasons than Fellowship because this is a very different film than Fellowship as PJ has said."
"soccerguy578","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," Brief response to criticism of film...
","I already posted, but, after reading some of the other posts, I must post again.<br/><br/>I truly believe that whomever has serious problems with this film must look into themselves to find the real problem. I've heard people complain about pacing, about being too violent, about poor acting, about being too different from the book, about changes from characters in the book, about too much CGI, and more.<br/><br/>First off, if I ever see anyone compare this movie again to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, I'll seriously consider ramming my head into a brick wall. That is the worst insult you could give a film that is deservingly among the top 20 films ever made. I am personally offended that any comparison can be made with Lucas' absolute catastrophe. I seriously feel sick to my stomach having read anything remotely similar to that. It makes me question why I'm letting myself get so upset about a movie. Oh well.<br/><br/>First off, the Computer Graphics in TTT exist to tell the story, whereas the garbage Star Wars film was built around the special effects, probably to mask the fact that the acting was so bad, the story was written so poorly, and that Lucas had forgotten his original or run out of ideas. The dialogue in TTT is so much more meaningful and worthwhile even in its worst moments. Especially when compared to the best moments of The Clones.<br/><br/>This movie DOES have a different feel to it. It doesn't leave you the way FOTR leaves you. After the first movie, I was dying for the next movie. I couldn't wait to see it. After The Two Towers, I wished it didn't end. While this may seem the same, it is different to me. Three hours seemed like 20 minutes to me. The Two Towers flew by in a world of beauty and tragedy and... man, these words don't do it justice.<br/><br/>You know, you can't win. The same people complaining about Gimli's comic relief because it's too light-hearted are the same ones complaining that the violence was too gruesome for their likes. The only acting that can be categorized as poor was Sean Astin's. I will admit it freely.<br/><br/>I do believe more of the book will be revealed in the extended versions. I don't like the way Hollywood sells movies. I don't. And, if you end up liking the extended version better, you should stand up to Hollywood... not Peter Jackson. His hands are tied on so many issues - if you knew how Hollywood works.<br/><br/>Did it feel like there was less plot? I think so. Did this get my panties in a bunch? No. The stories that were presented added more information to the state of Middle-Earth. The plight of every single woman, child, man, main character, creature... was all very heart-felt. Even in this movie, there were so many political, philosophical, emotional undertones for those of us who hate action movies. To me, this wasn't an action movie. It was so much more. Would I like there to be some more dialogue and depth in ROTK than in TTT? Yes. I hope there is. But, these are dark times. It felt dark.<br/><br/>Like another poster said... I could feel my face making expressions. I could feel my awe. I could feel my pain dragged right out of me. And, this was all with an annoying man next to me making comments about the movie through too much of it. I knew how good it was because I could block it out. When the movie was done, I just wanted to sit there and think about what just happened... and, about life... and, the current state of the world... and myself... and soul... and, so much. Just like Fellowship did to me. But, in a different way. Unlike other people, I can accept the variety of emotions a brilliant story like this can give you.<br/><br/>Trust me also, I am a computer generated image critic. I think FOTR had too many scenes with mediocre graphics. I could sit here and tell you where they fell short, but, I don't want to spoil anything for people skimming through. This movie has far, far fewer failures.<br/><br/>Someday..."

","It was hard to rate this movie because it doesn't seem like a separate movie. Although I'm a huge fan of lord of the rings i gave this one a 9. The only real drawback was that it skipped around way too much. Every time I started to get into one scene it would switch to something else. Of course the scenery, special effects, the attention to detail, costumes, weapons, armor, the CGI , and the list goes on was the best of the best the only drawback, like i said, was that it just skipped around as soon as i got into it.

"Carnimirie","10","0","0","21 December 2002"," Peter Jackson, have mercy. . .(SPOILERS)
","I knew that I had been sitting in the theater, watching ""The Two Towers"", for a very long time --much longer than the usual time a modern person's body clock allows for watching a single movie. So when a certain blackout occurred on the screen --despite the fact that I knew that there was more story still to go in the book of ""The Two Towers"", that Frodo and Sam had still to meet ""Her"", that Gandalf had still to confront Saruman and both Pippin and Aragorn to look in the Palantir of Orthanc-- despite all the story left to be told, I eyed this particular blackout on the screen with trepidation, and drew back in my chair, holding my breath. And then, came the words I knew must come and yet hoped might be delayed just a little longer. They were the first words of the ending credits, telling me that the film I had just seen, which was now over, had been directed by Peter Jackson. I let out my breath. Yes, I thought. It is over.<br/><br/>And then I thought: I AM GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE I SEE THE REST OF THIS FILM.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, couldn't you make a nice Summer 2003 release of The Return of the King? Huh? Please?<br/><br/>I won't even bother to rave and gush about how great this film was. Everyone else is already doing it for me, and it kind of goes without saying. However, I wouldn't be the true LOTR geek that I am if I didn't quibble just a little bit about a few minor things. In no order of importance: (1) the Jackson-fabricated bit where Aragorn falls over the cliff and is telepathically ""resurrected"" by Arwen was completely unnecessary. Also, between that bit and what has already happened to Gandalf, there is a danger of oversaturating and therefore desensitizing the audience. How many more characters can we expect to fall a great distance and be given up for dead, only to make a spectacular, emotional comeback? Speaking of which, (2) the return of Gandalf, and particularly the revelation of Gandalf to the others in the Fellowship, is treated with very broad swift strokes in this film. (3) By eliminating the character of Erkenbrand, and making Eomer disappear from the film just after meeting Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, so that Gandalf brings him and his men (instead of Erkenbrand, as in the book) back to Helm's Deep, the film is missing Eomer as a character --and misses the development of the bond of loyalty and devotion that, in the book, form between Eomer and Aragorn (not to mention the friendly rivalry between Eomer and Gimli). (4) Eowyn is far too sunny and ""girlish"". All that ""poison"" that Wormtongue spits at her in the film is what her character should actually be thinking. She's not supposed to smile like she does until much, much later. (5) While I understand the cinematic and, in some ways, story-enhancing value of having Faramir (who does not do this in the book) drag Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath, intending to bring the Ring as a weapon to Gondor, I wish Peter Jackson had been able to accomplish his ends in some way that did not cast Faramir in such a bad light. In the book, Faramir ""shows his quality"" by rejecting the Ring straightaway, in the cave by the waterfall. Why must he be so much weaker in the film? And finally, (6) Huorns!! Where are the Huorns? Don't tell me, Peter Jackson, that you can make CGI mallorns and armies and volcanoes and giant statues and underground caverns and flying lizards and Gollum and Ents and whatall else, and you can't give me one walking Orc-swallowing demon forest??<br/><br/>But seriously, a summer release for Return of the King. Think about it."
"therover007","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," The Perfect Film?
","The answer is no, but extremely close to it.  Going into this movie I hoped they wouldn't botch the Ents or Gollum.  Both elements of the story were done with fantastic CGI and were close to the books.  I think that Serkis, Gollum should win an award for his convincing perform as Gollum.  The only gripes I had were these three things.  BEWARE Spoilers to follow!<br/><br/>They made Faramir much different than the Faramir in the books.  They did not include Shelob.  Finally, they have Elves at Helm's Deep.  I do see the reasons for these changes, and they are all justified in my eyes, but it still is a gripe, for me anyway.  Other than that I liked it better than the Fellowship, my former favorite movie.  Way to go Jackson! 10/10"
"bvswivel","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," Outstanding sophmore effort
","Jackson has done it again. Keeping as true as possible to the book and the characters. The story flows easily, giving each character it's due time without dragging on any certain storyline. The 3 hours length is well spaced out and you will sit through without thinking twice.  The special effects are spectacular without being a burden on the senses.  10 out of 10.

"robertclarke77","8","0","0","22 December 2002"," Visually Stunning but ultimately overrated
","Simply put, The Two Towers is an extrodinary accomplishment in cinematography and visual effects.  This trilogy is so impressive, it makes the latest Star Wars trilogy look flat and uninspiring--with Peter Jackson, George Lucas has met his creative equal.  However, as a realist, I must say that cinematography cannot carry a film alone.  The only problem I have found with Two Towers is that I don't feel that it carries enough momentum to its climatic ending.  This may have to do with the several stories the director is trying to juggle, but there isn't enough build-up to the final battle scenes.  Nevertheless, this is a good movie, but perhaps not a great one.  The third and final part of the trilogy will likely be the best."
"Zulu_King","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," A great and grand epic of incomparable perfection
","I purposely held off reading anything on IMDB (except for a NYT review) on this film by wanting to experience this film-as its predecessor-as `clean' as one can view a film without any preconceptions. I have not even read the novels the film is based on as half the world has. So, I come to this epic unadorned but enthralled.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, this second installment is a powerful-perhaps even more so-than the first. This story itself is not burdened with set up and character development, as the first was, and opens where the last stops-with the band of brothers separated and scattered to the four winds. Jackson very quickly establishes the scene and moves the film forward, culminating in the battle at Helms Deep. There are few wasted moments as the film continues at a frantic but never rushed pace throughout. When Merry and Pip end up with then Ents, only then does the film slow a bit but not to its detriment. The film crosscuts between the separated principles but the viewer is never confused. The actors all seem to be defined by their characters (as opposed to the other way around) and a very comfortable in the company of others. Truly amazing considering all three films were shot concurrently and out of sequence.<br/><br/>There are many, many outstanding moments in this three-hour film starting from the first, where we see what happens to Gandolf after his fight at the bridge and as he falls into the abyss. The second is the visualization of Gollum. The third would have to be the Ents. And the four-oh boy-the battle at Helms Deep is quite simply a stunning, excessively violent exercise in cinematic genius. And it is only genius that can make a complicated battle and all its confusion accessible. And it is nothing short of genius to be able to deal with seven years of pain and deliberation, passion and art, actors and actresses, crew and extras, artists and artisans. I wish my father were alive to see this epic. LoTR was a favorite of his as a novel. Alas, he died just a CGI effects where really starting to make a tremendous impact in the world of cinema and missed many-a fine film-from Twister's kitsch to Titanic's operatic doom. But LoTRs would have particularly pleased him.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has left an indelible mark and permanent mark on cinema, making what was regarded as impossible possible. But look how he achieved this-this was no mere achievement by a single studio but by a whole country. To the Kiwis, LoTR became akin to a national obsession by marshalling casts and crew of thousands for years and years, using the entire country as a backlot. Imagine most of Hollywood working on a single film for five years! Mind boggling and now legendary. We will never see anything like it again. The Harry Potter films could have approached this (in that there are seven novels with four give green light) but are laughably inferior and infantile to a fault. Perhaps, now, the green light could be given to some other long series such as Asimov's Foundation saga or CS Lewis's Narnia series."
"mym-uk","9","0","0","22 December 2002"," cinematic jewels
","My view that the films are aimed at the 'Tolkien Sensibility', to the spirit rather than the letter of the books if you like, is becoming settled. I still shall not fully judge the work until I have seen the final third. Much of this film was making even me (in my long-sundered relationship to the storyline) somewhat uneasy. I could not recall what actually happens in the book in the places where there were changes, but I still /felt/ those changes. The music this time was /far/ too intrusive. There were also somewhat more touches of cheesy cliché than in the first film - one of the distinctive features of Jackson's directing style seems to be an ability to use Hollywood tricks without letting the films become Hollywood films. It stands on a knife-edge though ;)<br/><br/>Anyway. Uneasy as I was, there were cinematic jewels in this and I shall list those I particularly recall (comments about plot and character changes I will leave to other threads):<br/><br/>
The moment during the fall with the Balrog where the camera draws back into vast distance and we see the battle in the flames falling into the waters.<br/><br/>
Arwen at the tomb of Aragorn. A simply ravishing scene - utterly beautiful and haunting. It was the first thing in the film that overpowered my conscious thinking and dragged me away from watching it 'critically'.<br/><br/>
Edoras. This worked in spades. Those of you lazy reviewers going on about ""vikings"" should note that everything about the Rohirrim is anglo-saxon, not norse - and they live hundreds of miles from any sea. The vast views from the portico of Meduseld were sublime.<br/><br/>
The rise of the winged wraith above the parapet of the tower in front of Frodo (someone last night pointed out that this is almost an hommage to a similar scene involving a helicopter in Apocalypse Now).<br/><br/>
All these pale into near-insignificance however beside the section<br/><br/>comprised of the ride of the White Rider and friends down that slope into the batle at Helms Deep and the Storming of Isengard by the ents.<br/><br/>
I did not think I would ever see such things.<br/><br/>I still cannot /quite/ believe that I did."

This is an epic. From now on, I know that if I ever call a movie, ""crappy"", I will never have to question that assessment. I have seen what movies are supposed to be and what they should strive towards. This sets the bar. Apart from minor diversions from the book (which I don't mind), an average performance by Sean Astin (In all fairness, it's a difficult task when you're around such brilliant actors), brief moments of mediocre special effects, and some suspect dialogue choices, this movie is perfect. New Zealand is beautiful. And, this movie sets the new standard of visual and special effects. 90% of the special effects are inconceivably realistic compared to almost anything done before. I have to believe that anyone who has voted below an 8 on this movie has some prior vendetta they wish to settle with the story, fantasy epics, or people involved."

","You've all heard about it. You've all read the books. You've all seen the first movie. You've all 'wowed' at the $800 million FOTR made worldwide. You've all waited a bloody 11 months to once again, become lost in a world of Tolkien, where Elves, Hobbits, Orcs, Dwarves, and more reign.<br/><br/>The Two Towers, film two in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, was said to be one of the biggest challenges filmaking would ever come upon. First, there was Fellowship, which, needless to say, was absolutely magical. How could any film follow that up? And there was Return of the King behind 'TTT', so that meant that this movie would not even have an official beginning nor end. Almost as if it were doomed to fate, TTT stood on the brink of anticipation for almost a year.<br/><br/>The anticipation is over now, and Tolkien fans will definitely NOT be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Two Towers, once again with Peter Jackson's magical touch, immediately draws the audience into Middle-Earth within the first breathtaking scene of the Cahadras. It has a darker, more dangerous side than of Fellowship, while still maintaining the rich magic of Middle-Earth. TTT is packed with action, deceit and doubt. The plot, wicked and black, definitely sets the mood for an extremely tight three hours. Surprises leap from every scene in all circumstances. Much as I wish I could, I'm not here to spoil anything, so we'll go right into the realistic side of the film.<br/><br/>Yet again, the actors and actresses of this film give stunning performances. Orlando Bloom, Legolas, actually does useful things instead of constantly saying, 'Oohh.Orcs!' like in Fellowship. Gimli becomes the comic relief, with all the mirth directed from the Rohirrim toward his height. A big shock was Aragorn, portrayed by Viggo Mortensen. In film one, he was the quiet, brave warrior. However, TTT reveals a side of him that's passionate. Aragorn, burdened with the loss of his love and yet another possible woman, is faced with many situations in which death mocks his face. Viggo was every bit of Aragorn as anybody could be, and definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for supporting actor. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and the other hobbits also give entralling performances.<br/><br/>Then, there's the new characters. Gollum, Treebeard, Theoden, Eowyn, Eomer, Grima, etc. are all introduced. Each character is protrayed exquisitely, through his/her choices and actions. However, one disappointment was Treebeard. He, personally, did not look like a 'tree' to me. But Gollum's performances makes up for Treebeard's lack of. Although at times one can see he is definitely a fake, there are others when the audience questions his reality or not. His movements, snakelike and crafty, give the perfect image of what Smeagol is.<br/><br/>And now, the big question. Is TTT better than FOTR? I say, YES! There are some weak points, but there are more strong ones. There's more depth, more failure, more reality. The Two Towers has lived up to FOTR, maybe even surpassed. Anybody who has ever imagined or dreamed should go and see it. As for those who despise fantasy, this movie should change your opinion, because it's probably as good as any movie will get during this era.<br/><br/>

","The difficulty with filming one story in three sections, released in cinemas at one year intervals, lies in maintaining interest through the middle section.   The first section of any story introduces us to the main characters and sets the scene for what will unfold thereafter.  The concluding section brings to culmination that story, usually through a rising crescendo of events converging together in climactic fashion.<br/><br/>The middle section is the one that causes difficulty because, of necessity, its purpose is to move the plot along to the point where the convergences of the final section begin to happen.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has done a remarkable thing.  He has managed to make the middle section of the story come alive and, in my humble opinion, surpass the superb effort shown in FOTR.   The film is remarkable in may ways: the creation of Gollum is a demonstration of what the fusion of human acting and cgi can achieve if applied intelligently and with integrity: The battle scenes are wonderful, awesome and incredible: the epic scale and feel of the film is glorious and inspiring:  the acting is uniformly good and in some cases excellent.<br/><br/>I have no difficulty with the aspects where Tolkien's books have not been followed religiously.  Their spirit is intact and honoured.<br/><br/>All in all a magnificent realisation of Tolkien's epic story.<br/><br/>Others seem to have quibbled with the film somewhat.  I believe that some people have still not grasped the essential truth that this is NOT a sequel. It is part of a single ongoing story and I very much look forward to December 2003 when I will get up early one morning, stick on my DVD of FOTR, followed by my DVD of TT, and then proceed to my local cinema to sit back and marvel at ROTK."

The Two Towers does just that. The Two Towers glosses over lengthy sections of the book that would have been less than cinematic and enhances elements that reveal characters' motivations more clearly.<br/><br/>I found only one section--from the reappearance of Gandalf to the exile of Grima--to be anything less than exceptional. Perhaps a little consolidating there would have helped. But otherwise, the movie grabs you at the start and never lets go until an ending that left my companions who saw it with me and had never read the book begging me to tell them what comes next.<br/><br/>The multitude of stories going on at once flow together seamlessly and the character development that never quite established itself in the The Fellowship of the Ring came through with a wallop.<br/><br/>The combination of amazing acting and mind-blowing CGI that made Gollum a character that truly engages both our sympathy and our disgust is an incredible achievement in itself.

"leonardo-24","8","0","0","22 December 2002"," Entertaining, but ultimately not a great film
","SPOILERS INCLUDED<br/><br/>Let me start by stating that I enjoyed the film, but was disappointed with several of the choices made by the film makers.<br/><br/>First the highlights: the striking debut of Eomer (played wonderfully by Karl Urban) although sorely underused, King Theoden (Bernard Hill, very good) the Elves fighting at Helm's Deep, and Gollum (a true cinematic feat). I was mesmerized by everything about Gollum, but especially his face and eyes, I really felt like I was looking at a real living breathing being. Other high points include the stunning New Zealand scenery, the armor and swords of the Rohan people, and the fortress at Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>
Disappointments: 1) Considering the meticulous planning that went into the Battle of Helm's Deep, I was not pleased with the editing of the battle sequence. The constant cutting back and forth between the battle scenes and the other story lines, especially Merry and Pippin, diminished the sense of excitement and dread it should have invoked. Why not spend a good fifteen straight minutes just on the battle, and really allow the audience to be drawn into the events.<br/><br/>2)I was also disappointed that we did not see a longer sequence showing the Rohan horsemen battling the Uruk-hai when they rescue Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>
What I disliked: 1)The entire sequence involving Aragorn's fall from the cliff and the implication that anything terrible had actually happened to him. These scenes were obviously designed to further explore his relationship with Arwen, but it felt out of place and seemed like a cheap way to wrangle an emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>
2)I understand the importance of the Ents, but I found the scenes with Treebeard and the two Hobbitts to be almost unbearable.<br/><br/>
3)The voice over by Galadriel describing the war raging in Middle Earth, as much as I love Cate Blanchet, her scene was unnecessary, since we as an audience clearly know what is already transpiring.<br/><br/>4)The treatment of Eowyn's character, after a great initial introduction where she demonstrates real strength, she is then relegated to pinning for Aragorn. Why not focus on her frustration at not being able to fight along with the men and being cast aside with the other women and children.<br/><br/>

"John Doe 316","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," This Is How Film's Should Be Made
","The day before going to see ""The Two Towers"" I watched ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"".  This movie is truly a masterpiece, better than all of the original Star Wars movies put together.  Watching it, I thought to myself, ""The Two Towers can't possibly be any better than this!""  Well, it was.<br/><br/>This review does have some mild **SPOILERS**, but nothing that will ruin your film viewing experience if you read it.<br/><br/>One major complaint among many, myself not included, was that nothing much actually happened in the original.  Well, no one will be saying that about this movie.  Three hours isn't enough to cram in all the action, and that's with the beginning and the end of the book moved to ""The Fellowship Of The Rings"" and ""The Return Of The King"" respectively.  In terms of excitement, the opening alone matches the original's most thrilling moment.  In fact, it expands on it.  I won't explicitly spoil it.  I'll just say one word: falling.<br/><br/>Of course, things get more and more exciting from there, with things most definitely building up to a thrilling climax.  The climactic battle for Helm's Deep takes up the best part of the film's last hour, and is worth the wait.  Quite possibly the greatest cinematic battle ever.<br/><br/>
In between this great opening and climax are countless fantastic set-pieces and some great acting of a calibur rarely seen in such big-budget movies.<br/><br/>The story of the ring, following Sam and Frodo, is surprisingly the film's secondary story.  Of course, Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are on top form as Frodo and Sam.  We can see the ring is gradually beginning to overcome Frodo, and how this is tormenting him.  Sam, a comic relief of sorts in part one, becomes the more heroic of the two this time round.  Astin is a wonderful subtle actor.  However, both get mercilessly upstaged by a computer generated character.<br/><br/>Gollum, trying to regain the ring, his ""precioussss"", is caught by the two Hobbits, and forced to act as their guide.  We see the struggle betweedn the two sides of Gollum.  One is Smeagol, the friendly Hobbit-like creature who wants to help his new-found master, the other is Gollum, the evil, vindictive creature whose only love is for the ring.  The arguements Gollum has with himself are amusing and disturbing in equal measure, and actually display the best acting of the whole film.  Andy Serkis, who voices Gollum, definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and could maybe even win where Ian McKellan couldn't.  I'd love to see a computer-generated acceptance speech from Gollum, but that sadly won't happen at the boring Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The acting is also top-notch in the film's main storyline:  the battle for the people of Rohan.  Viggo Mortenson has emerged as quite the action hero this time round, with Aragorn playing a key role.  He has the charm, the acting chops and, yes, the fighting skills to become the next big thing. In this film, Orlando Bloom actually deserves all the teary-eyed admiration he gets from 8 year old girls everywhere.  Being male, I was seriously skeptical of Legolas last year.  However, in ""The Two Towers"" he actually kicks some ass, making mundane things like getting on a horse and going downstairs something thrilling.  As Gimli the dwarf, John-Rhys Davies really comes into his own in this picture.  Gimli takes up the role of comic relief in this film, and, unlike many comic relief characters (I'm not going to mention Jar Jar Binks's name) he is actually funny, relieving moments of severe tension by providing the audience with something to laugh at.  It goes without saying that Sir Ian McKellan is great as Gandalf.  It's a crime he didn't win an Oscar earlier this year.  The three main new arrivals are Miranda Otto, Bernard Hill and Brad Dourif,  as Eowyn, Theoden and Wormtongue respectively.  All are great, but the best is Dourif. Wormtongue is a walking ball of slime, and every time you see him you want to reach your arms into the screen and ring his puny neck.<br/><br/>Special mention has to go to Christopher Lee, a true screen legend.  As Saruman, Lee provides the audience with a tangible villain in addition to the lidless eye of Sauron.  While in the books Saruman was quite a pathetic character, in the movies he is a genuinely chilling villain, one of the best of recent years.  In part one, by merely sitting on a throne with an evil look on his face, he established himself as one of the best villains of recent years.  In part two we get to see a lot more of the wizard.  Not only does he have a chilling monologue, but he also has the film's best line: ""There will be no dawn for men.""  While he does get a comeuppance of sorts in this film, I look forward to seeing what he gets up to in ""The Return Of The King"", and I don't know how Sauron (in physical form) will top him in terms of villainy.<br/><br/>The only point at which the movie slows down is when the action returns to Rivendell, with a teary-eyed Arwen trying and failing to do some scene-stealing.  But even this adds depth to the movie.  Before you know it, you will be left with a cliffhanger ending even more agonising than that of ""The Fellowship Of The Ring.""  2003 is gonna be a long year.<br/><br/>Okay, its different from the book, but in my opinion, the first two movies have been better than the books.  And by all accounts, ""The Return Of The King"" is set to be even better.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I thought that it was amazing. In my view, it rated higher than FOTR because of Gollum. The only 2 things i think should have been included were 1. A bit more of Gollum/Smeagols background, and how he became the ring bearer in a bit more detail. I know it said in FOTR that he 'found' it in the River Anduin, but it doesn't go into any detail like that it was actually his cousin, Deagol, found it and Smeagol murdered him for it.<br/><br/>2. The fact that Gollum did not name the other path they were to take instead of going past the Black Gates. The other path is infact something like 'Cirath Ungol'. In the book, Frodo tells Faramir that this is the other path to take, and Faramir warns Frodo against it and explains that there are evils worse than they can imagine in there. This shows Gollums treachery. They did not include this in the film, but it does show gollum talking too himself about it at the end, which i s'pose is a substitute"

"bigcountry55r","Null","0","0","22 December 2002"," Did Peter Jackson read the Two Towers at all?
","Peter Jackson has made an art out of taking artistic liberties. Mr. Tolkien must be sitting straight up in his grave.<br/><br/>""Fellowship"" was great, despite all the problems related to adapting an epic story to film. ""Two Towers"" was a travesty.<br/><br/>And before all you non-Tolkien fanatics start clenching your fists-I don't think the problem is that Jackson left out too much. We all understand that he couldn't include everything. The real fault with this movie is that he added too much that was never in the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>
The opening scene was spectacular. The scenes with Gollum were superbly done. Edoras was magnificent. But the portrayal of Faramir as being seduced by the power of the ring was 100% wrong. Aragorn's MIA scenes were ludicrous. The mass exodus of the elves did not occur until years later in the books and where did the argument between Legolas and Aragorn in Helm's Deep come from. That was out of character for both of them, as was Gimli's comedy routine and Merry's bullying of the Ents.<br/><br/>Wargs attacking the Rohirrim? Did Jackson include Wargs in the Two Towers to compensate for leaving them out of Fellowship? I wouldn't have missed them.<br/><br/>To be honest I think Peter Jackson betrayed Tolkien fans. And for those that dismiss Tolkien fans as a small part of the audience: just look at the book sales for the LOTR. More people read Tolkien than have actually seen the movie.<br/><br/>I won't rush right out to buy this DVD nor will I break my neck to see the Return of the King."
"bullions27","10","0","0","22 December 2002"," The legend continues...
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I'll say this right off the bat. Whatever problems I had with this movie (and there were a few), I nevertheless was impressed deeply with Jackson's handling of CGI and camera. I don't care if you're a naysayer of the series, or a fan. If you're not impressed with the choreography and direction of the battle of Helm's Deep, you need some serious help. No director, to this date, has done what Jackson has done on the screen. He doesn't just throw rambunctious CGI as you would throw a bucket of paint on a murel and call it art. He has a formula. He knows what fits, and what works. Call it good instincts, or maybe he's just a genius. The most important trait for a director is being able to tell the story without the script. Can the audience understand the feeling, or the gist of the story just by looking at the scene, and the actors, and the lighting? Can you integrate CGI into this and still achieve the same effect on the audience? If you mention Final Fantasy, or Star Wars, you'll probably say ""Heck no"". This movie stands alone. The Two Towers, if not going to be recongnized for its good storytelling, is cinematic masterpiece by biblical proportions. That said, I believe Andy Serkis needs some serious, serious consideration for the best supporting actor role as Gollum. It's not just Jackson's employment of some of the most realistic CGI ever used, but the script and acting was done perfectly. We're not just looking at a mindless talking CGI, like Jar Jar, for that whole moment. We really believed we were actually seeing a living, breathing Gollum.<br/><br/>Now on to the story itself. Some dedicated Tolkien purists will probably have a few beefs with Jackson for the myriad of changes in the characters. For those who have never read the novels, these changes are only additional subplots for the audience to remember. These aren't detrimental to the actual storyline (to some degree), but nevertheless not very subtle and made rather obvious. I'm a bit on the neutral side in this, but I thought Jackson could have done a lot better. Two things that stand out:<br/><br/>1) Legolas - I find it disturbing that fangirls seem to like this character only because Orlando Bloom is ""cute"" despite the horrible dialogue Jackson and Walsh provided for him. This only cheapens Legolas. If he were any other movie character concocted by any other writer, it can be excused. Not Legolas. I thought Jackson should've given more thought to him. Give him one personality (he seems to bounce back and forth between optimism, and pessimism at the whim), and make him kick more butt. He's an Elf. His combat prowess and reliability should be paramount. Why make him act and look ridiculous (the surf scene with the shield bugs me to all Hell)? I'm not saying give Legolas the powers of Jet Li, but at least enhance his fighting abilties if you are not going to give him good lines. Just wishful thinking. This brings me to the next point:<br/><br/>2) Legolas / Gimli - I can somewhat see the need of comedy relief in something as dark and morbid as the Two Towers would eventuate towards the final hour of the movie. I have no problem with that. However, because Legolas seems to shift between personalities, and Gimli seems to be more focused on creating comedy relief, their friendship is virtually non-existant. As a result, their whole ""how many can you kill"" little adventure in Helm's Deep is out of place, and awkward.<br/><br/>
Not exactly detrimental. None of this detracts me from enjoying the movie, but it stuck in my mind even at the closing credits. Oh well.<br/><br/>
The Two Towers succeeds in telling the story, and that's important. Not exactly Tolkien's story, but Jackson interpretation of the novel series. He provides enough, without going overboard, or cutting too much. The dialogue isn't exactly top-notch, or memorable (in fact, it's actually quite subpar in my opinion) but it gets the job done.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not going to go anymore deeper. For me, I'm not going to remember this movie for the story. I'll leave that to my leather-bound collector's series (yes I am a Tolkien fanatic). I'll remember this movie for its technical achievements, and the way Gollum stole the entire show.<br/><br/>8/10"
"kuchen_kruemel","3","0","0","22 December 2002"," Great movie, but it has some flaws...
","I really did like ""The two Towers"". However, I can't help wondering how amazing that movie could have been, if Peter Jackson hadn't had the chance to alter it after the huge fuss everyone made about ""The Fellowship"".<br/><br/>I guess there have been a lot of changes. Gimli for example is joking throughout the whole movie. Even in the most serious moments, he doesn't seem to realize, that his life is in danger. I guess Jackson noticed, that dwarf-jokes work well on the audience - so why not expand that to 'a-joke-a-minute'? But that's not the worst thing about ""Two Towers"".<br/><br/>I totally loved the first part of the movie. Everything was just great. Gollum was superb, the whole movie was splendid. But then, it started going wrong. Why did Aragorn have to fall off that cliff? Why did Jackson have to include Elrond and Galadriel again? In a really stupid scene, anyway. I didn't mind Aragorn's phantasizing about Arwen though. I think that was nice.<br/><br/>But why in the world did Jackson make Faramir such a bad character? He doesn't take Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath in the book, why should he in the movie? He supports them in the book and is a purely good character. That whole Osgiliath scene was just totally annoying.<br/><br/>The same goes for the Ents. I was afraid that they would look stupid - but they didn't. They looked great. They were just like Tolkien described them in the book. But why did they have to refuse fighting at first after a long period of thinking. And then, when they see Isengard, they decide in two seconds to attack - Treebeard just has to shout and out they all jump. 'Cause they're so fast... Yeah, sure!<br/><br/>The Helm's Deep fighting was good, but what on earth was Haldir doing there? Just included to have another hero dying, I suppose. And the counting thing between Legolas and Gimli is included and then again not really, because it ends just after it began. No caves to discover for Gimli either.<br/><br/>I know of course that you can't include everything in one movie, but there was some 'additional' crap in ""The Two Towers"" (meaning that it was not in the book) that could have been left out and a lot of original scenes that were left out.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: ""The two Towers"" was a great movie. But it's not as good as ""The Fellowship"". I wish I could see the original version, before Peter Jackson changed it..."
"PhillipWhite555","9","0","0","22 December 2002"," Almost as good as the first movie
","Let me start of by saying that I really did like the film, but I had some complaints about it.  I would have to say that the movie is not quite as good as the first movie.  The real difference for me was that a few times during the TTT I thought to myself, this is a long film and that was an interesting change to the book, while I never thought that once about fellowship.<br/><br/>As noted in umpteen other comments director Peter Jackson made some interesting changes to the movie from the book.  Most of the changes I could accept as needed for transforming a lengthy and complex novel with oodles of characters into something that is halfway comprehensible.  The Arwan sequences, the cool warg cavalry battle, Galenderial(sp?) appearance and the elves at helm deep all fall into this category.<br/><br/>In fact I didn't mind almost any of the changes at all, it was when wholly new elements were introduced that I began not to like PJ changes (Frodo + Sam being taken into Gondor, Merry and Pippen tricking the Ents to help).<br/><br/>I also had a few qualms about some of the overall directing on the film. I felt that the climatic battle scene did not achieve the full effect it could have by the constant cutting away to other events, I mean after a good 20 min of build up I was ready and excited for the battle to get rolling, only for it to be start and stop and really seem to drag on.  Also,how many rotating helicopter shots can occur in one film and way too much Gimili as comic releif.  I also felt that the movie was a little too long, maybe 10-15 min shorter would have been perfect.  I would of cut out the Aragon near-death scenes and the stuff with Hugo Weaving (not all the Aarown stuff) but added more to the relationship between Merry and Pippin and the Ents.<br/><br/>
On the other hand I felt that the Gandalf-Balrog fight was awesome and better visually than as described in the book.  PJ also did a good job interspersing the various plot elements from what in the book are nearly 2 different stories.<br/><br/>I must admit that my expectations were through the roof for this film, so it was a bit of a letdown, but overall a fine movie.  I f you haven't read the books very, very"
"maerelysium","Null","0","0","22 December 2002"," Tolkien geek here...
","And I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I agree with others that, at times, the scenes changes were too rapid, but perhaps that can be corrected in the extended version. (Fellowship's extended actually made that movie flow better.)<br/><br/>As for differences between the two movies: It is a sequel (by the definition of the word), but unlike other sequels it has a different feel than the first movie. This is the same as the books.<br/><br/>FOTR was more personal and suspensful (which Jackson translated well on the screen) while TT is more epic.<br/><br/>Now, I noted all the changes in the story in both movies, and generally the reasoning for such changes is as follows:<br/><br/>1) The necessity to cut down on named characters. Jackson et al could only choose from so many of Tolkien's characters. And remember there were quite a lot of them. Examples: Arwen replacing Glorfindel and Eomer replacing Erkenbrand. Both examples show Jackson replacing a character that only occurs once in the book and giving that spot to another character. Erkenbrand, even in the book, is far more important than his character. The reader knows who he is through dialogue and only sees him once. Why not banish Eomer instead of imprisoning him and let HIM be the force that comes to the aid of Helm's deep, not some character that won't ever be mentioned again.<br/><br/>The only problem, is that Eomer and Aragorn bond in the book through the fighting at Helm's Deep. Jackson, instead, gave much of those lines to Theoden, giving his character more importance and more strength.<br/><br/>
2) To draw in those viewers who've never been able to read the books. Most people who haven't read the books attempted to and were not able to get through them because of the archaic, and generally poorly written (not poorly conceived or plotted, both of which Tolkien did an outstanding job on! And remember I AM a Tolkien geek!) narrative. If TT had been done exactly as written, all the action would have taken place in the first half of the movie and the latter half would have been, mostly dialogue. I don't think even a diehard Tolkien fan could have sat through that.<br/><br/>The movie does away with that because you don't describe the people/places/things with words. You use images. And you can make the movie sets/costumes/items as visually detailed as the books were verbally detailed without overwhelming the viewer. This also explains the Rivendell scene with Elrond and Arwen. It drives home the point that is hinted at in the books but is not spoken. The Elves don't really want to get involved. In fact, when Elrond finally commits he send a small contingent, which in the books only has a few elves. The others are actually Men. As for his trying to separate Arwen and Aragorn, it makes sense for an elven father to think that way, especially one that descended from such pairings. And it also explains to the new viewer why it's bad for Arwen.<br/><br/>3) Time constraint. This one is pretty easy to understand. There's a lot of stuff in the books and to get it all on the screen (but not, necessarily, do it justice)would take a movie that is a lot longer than three hours. And if you produced a movie that is just like the book, who would watch it? Tolkien fans only. Those that could not sit through the books would not sit through that movie either.<br/><br/>4) One of the most important reasons for any changes is to add more urgency to the movie and to drive home the point about the ring. For example, in FOTR the book there is something like 40 years between Bilbo's party and Frodo's escape from the Shire. And when he actually does leave, he doesn't run and leave everything behind, he puts his house up for sale, buys a house in Buckland and SLOWLY arrives in Buckland to action finally start. If that had been done in the movie, people would have walked out. The moive adds urgency but shortening the time and having Frodo make a sudden and panicked escape. In TT the movie, Faramir is drawn in by the ring just like Borimir and others, to drive home the point of its power. This reason explains many choices made in the movies: why the ring was packed away and not kept on Frodo's person; why Frodo stands before the Nazgul in Osgiliath; why Faramir is a different character in the movie than the book. (Also note, he doesn't go into his family trouble in the movie the way he did in the book. This was done because of time constraint, I am sure.)<br/><br/>Now, for those of you who are upset about missing chapters (especially Shelob) go get your copies of the books, and put your finger in RotK where the story actually ends. Now compare the size of the actual story in that book to the other books. Notice something? RotK is much shorter than the other two, once all the publishing padding of appendices is removed.<br/><br/>Go see the movie again and listen closely to Gollum. You will find your answer to where's Shelob in his words.<br/><br/>Now, I have to admit I was a trifle disappointed with some of the changes until I came home and flipped through TT to see the original way it was done and realized, that in order to make a GOOD movie, those things had to be changed.<br/><br/>One has to remember that, for the most part, movies and books are totally different things. A reader has time to read pages and pages and pages of background stuff. A movie viewer does not.<br/><br/>And even if this had been a mini-series for TV, there still would have been changes. Anything not necessary to the story would go. (Like Tom Bombadil.)<br/><br/>I saw this movie with people who'd never read the books (some of them who don't even really like or understand fantasy)and this is where Jackson's work paid off, they all loved it. They could, more or less, follow the plot. And, more importantly, they all want to go see it again.<br/><br/>In summary, Jackson's movies are very faithful to the spirit and plot of the books and basically treat the story in the only way a movie can."
"MyDarkStar","8","0","0","22 December 2002"," Bridging the trilogy
","I needed a little bit of time to ponder upon this installment of Lord of the Rings after seeing it. I wanted to think about how it would be viewed in the grand scheme of things for this trilogy years from now. Because basically, I don't view Lord of the Rings so much as three different movies, as much as one giant 9 hr movie that we just happen to see in three 3hr segments. Looking at it from that perspective, I think this ""segment"" had two main goals :<br/><br/>1) have more action than Part I 2) set up Part III as the mac-daddy ending-to-end-all-endings<br/><br/>
This one does have more action scenes than Part I - though the majority of the action scenes are grouped together towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>
As far as setting up Part III to be an ending-to-end-all-endings, well, I think this film accomplishes that because it really kept some key parts from ""The Two Towers"" book. Because of that, Peter Jackson is basically going to have a ton of material to put into Part III. I mean, there's probably about 45-60 minutes worth of material that's going to have to appear in the movie ""The Return of the King"" that is from the book ""The Two Towers"". So, the third part should be pretty interesting.<br/><br/>So, I'll admit it, I was slightly disappointed at first - but when I started thinking about what Jackson has set himself up for in part III, I realized that it's all a matter of telling the tale in a way that will make for the most successful trilogy possible.<br/><br/>Part I : has to be awesome, make sure the entire audience wants to come back for Part II Part II : give everyone their action fix & those big battles that movie goers love Part III : make sure the audience leaves this one thinking it was a home-run on all levels<br/><br/>Knowing what all material Jackson left for Part III, he definitely has set up the trilogy to end with a home run.<br/><br/>I will have to say this : The second time was much better than the first! MUCH BETTER! Somehow, the movie seemed to move along much smoother & the pace was more tolerable & balanced.<br/><br/>On the other hand, certain aspects of the film that caught my attention in a negative way stuck out even more noticeably the second time. The best example of this was Aragorn's ""dreams"" that he was having of Arwen (which were NOT part of the book). Because of the awkward change of pace to the rest of the film, these scenes felt slightly out of place - and the fact that they are not part of the book makes it look like a bad call on Jackson's part to add them. I'm convinced Jackson is viewing this whole epic as a giant stew that he wants to be able to look at 10 years from now and never have to worry about saying to himself ""hmmm...I should have put this in there when I had a chance"". I mean, after all, is anyone going to care that there are 10 minutes of mushy dream scenes between Aragorn & Arwen when they view these films back-to-back on DVD on a 11 hr Super Mega Platinum Edition years from now ?<br/><br/>Gollum was especially impressive to me the second time around. They just couldn't have done a better job with him. They don't overuse him in the scenes and they make sure that when he says something it's memorable. Inevitably there will be comparisons to Jar-Jar, but in reality there really is no comparison. I think this is another example of how LOTR has shown up the new Star Wars in yet another way. Lucas was determined to have Jar-Jar be one of his shining accomplishments with the new trilogy (have a completely CGI character play a supporting role in the movie). Instead of having Jar-Jar viewed as a great cinematic accomplishment, Lucas has people begging him to get rid of the character. Gollum, on the other hand, is actually a very interesting character that actually brings something to the story, and you enjoy viewing on screen.<br/><br/>I'm a little worried about what all Jackson has left for Part III, though I do understand why he left it for Part III. However, he has so much material to cover in that movie that it could be quite overwhelming to those that didn't read the books. ""Return of the King"" is definitely going to have to be the longest of the three films if he is going to cover the material the way it needs to be covered.<br/><br/>When I wrote comments on ""Fellowship"" on IMDB, I said it was a good start for what could potentially be the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. I think this installation of LOTR does a proper job in bridging the trilogy & setting us up for what should be the proper ending to the greatest trilogy of all time."
"boldelmo","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," If you're going to base a movie on a book...
","I think that there is no argument that Jackson has a lot of technical skill. The movie was extremely well done, was acted well, and had great special effects, Gollum especially. It's also plain that in order to fit these movies into three hours, a lot of editing had to be done, not only to make it fit, but also to modify the story for the silver screen. Having said that, I have to say that I was not happy with the changes that Jackson made.<br/><br/>What's the point of claiming to be based on a book if you're not going to be faithful to the spirit of the original? If you go to see something being touted as a James Bond film and the main character is a five-year old girl, you have a right to be upset. Not that Jackson went to this extreme, but my point is that there is certainly grounds to complain about the changes. One of the things that I love about Tolkein's books is the depth of the detail. I feel like I KNOW Tolkein's world. I was upset, then, when I realized that what was on the screen was no longer Tolkein's world, but Jackson's. If you haven't yet seen this film, I would say go ahead and see it anyway, but if you're a purist, be prepared to get p***ed off. I managed to keep myself from booing until the end. Barely.<br/><br/>*********SPOILERS AHEAD!!!***********<br/><br/>There are parts of Tolkein's mythos that Jackson completely ignored. For instance, one of the themes of Lord of the Rings was that the age of the elves was coming to an end. There's a reason why they do almost nothing as a race throughout the book. Why then, do they show up in the movie at Helm's Deep? Perhaps so that Elrond, Arwen, and Galadriel can have more of a reason for showing up in the film at all! I wonder if a certain amount of screen time was written into their contracts.<br/><br/>Also, the magic in Tolkein's world, both wizardly and elven, was a subtle kind, except perhaps for Gandalf's fireworks. Jackson got a bit ham-handed with his magic. Saruman's possession of Theoden not only didn't make sense (between raising an army and talking to Sauron, where did Saruman get the time to keep Theoden senile and old-looking?), it was nothing like any other magic in the book. At one point, Frodo throws an elven cloak over himself and Sam, making them look like a big rock, down to the rough surface and rocky shape. In the book, Pippin actually makes a point of asking if the cloaks are magic and is told that the cloaks just tend to change hues with the environment. Nothing is said about magical shape changing.<br/><br/>I could go on, but let me just finish by saying that I would still recommend this film, if only to make the bridge between The Fellowship of the Ring and the (hopefully better) Return of the King, but if seeing a movie that's faithful to the book is particularly important to you, get your booing muscles ready."

"cephorn","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," Some rationalization
","After I saw Two Towers on opening day I was definitely disappointed.  Plot and characterization changes were getting to me.  But after being so completely impressed with Fellowship, I didn't understand how since TT was made at the same time, by the same people, how it could be so different. So I tried to rationalize the seemingly abundant liberties taken by the film makers.  Everything made sense once I put myself in their shoes.  On the second viewing I enjoyed this movie on the same level as I did Fellowship. Here are some of my justification for the more major changes made:<br/><br/>*Faramir is such a steadfast and comforting character in the book(possibly my favorite character).  He's a man we all could serve under, respect, and love.  But he is static without much development at all.  He would add no tension or conflict to frodo and sams journey.  If the ring is tempting to all men, including Aragorn, he would add an inconsisteny as well. Although I dont like this change, I can see why they would decide to do what they did.  In the end he does turn true to character although I hope in ROTK he really shows his virtues to the fore.<br/><br/>*When the Nazgul sees frodo at osgiliath-that took awhile for me to justify. It takes away sam and frodos biggest advantage in their trek-that Sauron doesnt know where the ring is.  But he does assume it will be taken to gondor and men will attempt to use it against him.  Well it has been seen in Osgiliath (in GONDOR) by people who are retreating to minas tirith.  It still appears to be heading in that direction.<br/><br/>*Warg riders are mentioned by Tolkien, just not in TT.  So its not like they are using something of their own invention.  This also gives them a way to bring in the relationship with arwen through flashbacks.  And the material used for that is overwhelmingly Tolkien's from the Appendix.  I like it a lot.<br/><br/>*Cutting the movie after helms deep and after frodo's and sam's release-well if you look at Book 6 there are only three chapters till the climax of the story-this gives them more to work with in ROTK.  Shelob WILL be there. Book 5 is mostly fighting as well, this will give them more variety of material to use.  (And ROTK is the shortest book once you take out the couple hundred pages of appendix)<br/><br/>*Rohirrim-many of the details were switched around, but this was probably good in that it eliminated some minor characters and places (Dunharrow) which could add so much confusion to mostly all firstcomers.  In the end nothing of overall plot importance was changed.  Hopefully Eomer will get to do a little more and Theoden will continue to grow as a leader of men in ROTK.<br/><br/>*It was hard to care about the new MEN introduced in TT in comparison to Boromir.  We got to watch him and feel for him through his journey.  Cant say that for faramir, eomer, and theoden (not as much though) yet.  I want to care for them more.  But there is room for this in ROTK.  They could be excellently contrasted to Denethor (the only major character yet to get screen time).<br/><br/>A couple other comments: Gollum-WOW!  they showed so many various and honest emotions through a CGI character.  WOW! Performances-I thought were even stronger in this installment-there were a few ackward moments in FOTR, but can't remember any in TT"

In the ""Two Towers"" they are just as skillfully directed and edited, but they are SO MUCH GRANDER from the technology and money of today's Hollywood.

"hobie0","5","0","0","21 December 2002"," Great Movie!!! But, I think the first was better.
","Spoilers to Follow!!!!<br/><br/>Good Points:<br/><br/>1.  Peter Jackson again did a fantastic job with visual effects and scenery.<br/><br/>
2.  Gollum/Smeagol was perfect.<br/><br/>3.  The Ents were also done very well.<br/><br/>4.  The scene with Gandalf and the Balrog was awesome.<br/><br/>
5.  The first half of the movie was excellent.<br/><br/>Questionable Points(reasons I didn't give this a 10 like a did the first movie)<br/><br/>1.  Battle of Helms deep was Good, but a little unbelievable at times. Legolas riding down the stairs.  Aragorn and the king riding over a hundred Uroquis without getting so much as a nick.  PJ needed to take a couple of notes from Braveheart on this one to make it more believable.<br/><br/>
2.  Gimli-- I think Gimli had some good comic relief.  But, Gimli seemed to be portrayed as a weak fighter.  He is suppose to be quick, strong, and deadly with an axe.  I came away thinking he was pretty much a weakling who relied on other characters to protect him.<br/><br/>3.  Aragorn falling off the cliff and trying to make everybody believe he is dead.  Well, we already did that once with Gandalf, why do it again with Aragorn.  Especially when it is not in the book.<br/><br/>4.  Faramir-- is portrayed as a mean person in this movie and actually kidnaps Frodo and Sam.  Why??? Faramir in the book is the good and reasonable person.  He is very much like Aragorn.  In the movie, he is portrayed exactly like Boromir.  The whole kidnapping scene should have been deleted and Faramir should have offered to help Frodo just like in the book. Why put that whole extra scene in the movie and complicate things with Frodo confronting a Nazgul.<br/><br/>Maybe I will be more won over by this movie when I watch it on DVD in 9-10 months."

It appears as though they were mainly interested in comparing this film to the book and not looking at this as part of a film trilogy.<br/><br/>What they seem to forget is that Peter Jackson is a huge fan of Lord of the Rings. He has adapted the books and I have to believe that he has stayed faithful to his experiences of the book.<br/><br/>One of the beauties of novels is that they allow you to create your own landscape and vision of the characters. I have known of two people reading and loving the same book, but when they discuss it, they have what seem like completely different ideas of what the book was really about.<br/><br/>All I am trying to say is that this is Peter Jackson's vision of the books and I am sure the changes he made were forced upon him through the difficulty of trying to adapt a complex novel into a film.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, a film is mainly the directors vision of the action, whereas a book allows us to create our own experiences.<br/><br/>I will only suggest that no adaptation which was made to pander to the experiences of the reader has ever made a good movie. The point of adapting a book into a film is to share your experiences of the book with others, not to collect their experiences up put them all together and release them back to the people that gave them.<br/><br/>Oh, I thought the film suffered through the limitations of the story which will end up creating a ten hour masterpiece but judging it on its own means that it will suffer<br/><br/>9/10 (in anticipation)<br/><br/>If you got this far, thank you and sorry for the rant."

Though Peter Jackson has not followed the book precisely, the film is absolutely amazing - I believe even to people who have not read Tolkien's works. I can understand why some parts were left out of the film, but Peter Jackson has not 'invented' any storyline, nor betrayed any Lord of the Rings fans. Certainly there have not been 5 chapters omitted as this other comment suggests.<br/><br/>

","After the wonderful job that Peter Jackson, cast, and crew did on LOTR: The Fellowship of the Rings, I eagerly looked forward to seeing The Two Towers. Unfortunately, all is not well in Middle Earth.  Much of the magic of part one of the series has vanished from part two, leaving in its wake what is for the most part a medieval epic.  There are some fantasy elements still present: Nazgul riding dragons, Treebeard, etc., but much of the film deals with the realm of men battling with swords and with arrows.  The Two Towers is, to be sure, amongst the finest medieval epics ever made, but it lacks the charm of The Fellowship.  Still, it is worth viewing and forms a necessary part of the saga that is The Lord of the Rings, and I would recommend that people who enjoyed the earlier film watch The Two Towers if only to prepare for The Return of the King -- just be prepared to take the film on its own merits, not on expectations based upon its predecessor."

Sure there is added scenes, but the movie wouldn't make sense without them.  If you want to see The Two Towers word for word, I suggest you pick up the book and use your imagination.<br/><br/>And to the people who said there was missing chapters at the end...I say they have not even read the book.  If they followed the movie correctly, and the book, they would realize the story went in chronological order from chapter to chapter.  They left out chapters AT THE END and was stated that they would be in The Return of the King.  I don't know if people have corks in their ears, but I heard Gollum say, ""she'll kill them for me.""  If you don't know who ""she"" is ... you have not read the book.  It is apparent that some people writing their reviews have claimed to read the book and seen the movie, but obviously have not.<br/><br/>The general feeling from book to movie was the same, it stayed true to the mood, and the general themes were the same.  For people saying PJ did a horrible job, I'd like to see you, or any real director in that same sense, do a better job.<br/><br/>I rated this a 10/10, and all the people who have voted a one have not seen the movie.<br/><br/>See this movie.

","There have only been a few sequels that I have seen that have been better than the first: TERMINATOR 2, SUPERMAN 2, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and THE GODFATHER PART 2. Chalk up another film to that list. While FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING introduces us to the characters and begins their journey, THE TWO TOWERS is a 3 hour breathtaking ride of filmmaking enjoyment.<br/><br/>While Roger Ebert (who I lost all respect for after he gave that piece of garbage BLAIR WITCH PROJECT four stars) complained there is too much action in the movie, my response is so what? The Battle of Helms Deep was the greatest battle I've ever seen in my life onscreen.<br/><br/>This is the movie that George Lucas wanted to make. Like ATTACK OF THE CLONES, this movie splits up the main characters into separate adventures and the transition between the stories is done exceptionally well. The Battle of Helms Deep makes the Clone War battle in ATTACK OF THE CLONES look like a schoolyard brawl. The Battle of Helms Deep itself is worth the nine dollar admission.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked about THE TWO TOWERS is Liv Tyler's role is substantially reduced. I saw no reason for her to even be in the trilogy, especially since Arwen plays such a minor role in the book. She was just put there as eye candy for the horny teenage boys.<br/><br/>Overall, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece of modern filmmaking. True, it doesn't follow Tolkein's story to the T, but THE TWO TOWERS is a film that should not be missed. Maybe George Lucas can see RETURN OF THE KING and base STAR WARS EPISODE III on that.<br/><br/>I give LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS four stars. (out of four)"

","See the movie. It is beautiful. The rage of the ents is amazing. Gandalf's fight with the Balrog is awesome.But if you've read Tolkein, get ready for more and more departures from the awesome original. Faramir is no longer a wise man who passes the test that Boromir could not. He is now just a smaller version of Boromir. Elves come to the defense Helm's Deep!<br/><br/>Aragorn has an entire added sequence, where he is mortally wounded but Arwen sort of calls him back from the brink of death and perhaps telepathically sends a horse to help. Perhaps to remind us of his link with Arwen. However, the sequence adds nothing whatsoever to the story. It simply wastes time.<br/><br/>The movie stops after victory in Helm's deep and after Gollum decides to let HER have the hobbits and then get the ring for himself. I hope this means we will eventually see Shelob, etc. And I hope this also means we might see the very important face to face meeting of Gandalf and Saruman. The movie stops nearly 2/3 of the way through where the book goes. I assume this means ""The Return of the King"" will skimp in places and perhaps end at the moment the war of the ring ends rather than back at home for the hobbits...(?). But why not end at cirith ungol and after Gandalf and Saruman meet at Orthanc? Why not make a cliff-hanger ending like that in the books? It was successful in the serial movies of the 30's.<br/><br/>It is still quite a good movie visually, but it is losing some of the more important themes Tolkein originally put in the story."

","I saw TTT this Friday and it was great. I suppose that a fear/criticism of this whole film trilogy was whether or not it would uphold the book's integrity. For the most part it did which was nice (you'll recognize some slight changes when you see the film). It is a great supplement for me as it gives me a more vivid picture of Tolkien's imagination a picture that we as fans try to capture when we read the books.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the whole world that Jackson has created and the wardrobe is excellent. But I suppose the 2 things that set this movie apart from many other epic dramas/myth is indeed the battle scenes and of course Smeagol. I can only say about the battles that they are spectacular and that any description one could give would bring them shame-you must experience it. As for Gollum, I hate to admit it being a die-hard SW fan, but perhaps he surpassed Yoda as CG character of the year. And as Jackson has learned some things about action and battle from GL, I looking forward to SW ep.III to once again set a precedence in epic film making.<br/><br/>Coming into it, Aragorn and Mithrandir have always been my favorite characters and they really showcased their skills. I really like how they are portraying the love story, Miranda Otto looked beautiful and her role as a ""Shield-maiden"" was very believable-she had passion, class and strength but also a tenderness which is exactly the way Tolkien wrote it and intended it to be.<br/><br/>My only criticism, it ended- believe me you'll be on the edge of your seat for 3 hours and time will fly but truly it was wonderful well except for some scenes with Frodo, Samwise and Gollum that may have dragged. However my verdict: Give this movie 10/10.<br/><br/>As an endnote there is this really funny scene with Gollum,(you'll recognize when you see it) this I think was the kind of comic relief that GL hoped for with Jar Jar, but failed miserably as the scenes with Gollum were subtle- first time I saw him, i thought not another CG disaster but by the end, i was very satisfied with Smeagol's portrayal. The ents also looked awesome, they were a treat to watch. Hard core fans of the book will not be disappointed, nor will the general fans of action and adventure."

","Gollum was really impressive in this movie but did you know there is a real actor behind this excellent performance? Indeed, Andy Serkis is not only providing Gollum's voice in the movie, he's also providing the facial expressions and the moves of the creature. So at first, a human Gollum (Andy Serkis) was on the set with the actors, playing the scenes, providing the voice and so on. This way other actors could know where the character was and it was a lot easier for them to interact with him. That is why it's so BELIEVABLE! After the shooting, Serkis (the actor playing Gollum) dressed in a special black suit with some kind of silver balls distributed all over the suit. These balls became sort of way points on his body, so that the computer could integrate his body and all his moves to be able to generate the CGI creature! Serkis had to repeat ALL the moves he did in the movie in this special suit, after the shooting! And this process was really complicated for Serkis: it took about one year to achieve! To create Gollum's face, they used Serkis' facial expression but obviously they enlarged his eyes. The final result his really impressive, thanks to technology and to Andy Serkis!! Peter Jackson found the best compromise: a part CGI character played by an actor. Brilliant. Andy Serkis certainly deserves an oscar nomination: he was both excellent as well as really patient to work on this character for one year!<br/><br/>The movie is really GREAT, even though I think it's less feeric and artistic than the first one. But this movie have other forces. There's so much stuff in this movie that it appears clearly that several parts of the movies have been removed for the theater version. Even if this movie has a runtime of 3 hours, I thought that it was not long enough! It never stops!! You can't really integrate all of this in your mind the first time you see it. That is why you got to see this movie several times! And each time you'll see it or think of it, you'll find it even more great because you'll be able to integrate ALL events! I heard that Peter Jackson just begin to work on a SUPER-EXTENDED version of The Two Towers to be release in DVD... this confirms what I just wrote: Jackson got to cut several parts of the story in TTT , even more than in the first film. The extended version of Fellowship contained an additional 30 minutes...and the additional scenes were just excellent and reinforced the movie a lot.  Imagine a SUPER-EXTENDED version of The Two Towers!!! This being said, obviously I cannot wait to see it again, and again, and again!!"
"voxaltorum","9","0","0","21 December 2002"," Excellent movie with a couple major deviations from the book.
","Overall an excellent movie.<br/><br/>I was concerned about the CGI character Gollum.  I was afraid that it was going to be another Jar Jar Binks (God save us from ever having another of those).  I was happily surprised.  The character was nicely done.  It was easy to forget that he was not real.  He was an active part of many scenes, but was also just there in others - not contributing to the action, just reacting to it, which made him seem real.  Nice job on that!<br/><br/>The Flooding of Isengard was fantastic.  I have heard people say that they thought the Pippin/Merry/Treebeard thread in the movie was boring, but it really was done well.  It was needed to help counterpoint the otherwise very dark overall story.  The Ents were flawless.<br/><br/>The addition of the elves at the battle at Helm's Deep was an interesting change from the book.  I guess that it was done to more integrate the world of the elves into the story so that Liv Tyler can have a bigger role.  OK. Fine.<br/><br/>The deviation from the book where Faramir tried to deliver the ring to his father is not needed.  Faramir was never tempted to take possession of the ring.  I have no idea why this choice was made.  I feel is unfair to the character and really lost the idea of the ""difference"" between Faramir and Boromir.  This difference is very important, and will be difficult to regain in The Return of the King.  There was just no reason to do this.<br/><br/>Despite the Faramir thing, I am impressed with the movie.  Not quite as well done and true to the story as The Fellowship of the Ring, but still an excellent effort."

Also, when Frodo almost gives the Nazgul the Ring in Gondor-doesnt happen in the book! AND...I did not see the point of Aragorn falling off the cliff~was that just to make it more dramatic? They could have used the time it took to make that part up to devote it to more time with the Ents. Despite all of this, I still rewarded the movie with a 10/10, simply because as a movie it was awesome! The battle of Helm's Deep was wonderfully done (even if those Elves didn't really help in the book)! All of the cast did an awesome job, including those who did not appear in Fellowship. The music continued to complement the film in a great way! The Edoras set was also good-just as I imagined it! GOLLUM did an excellent job, especially in portraying the inner battle between Smeagol and Gollum. I do wish however, that the incident with Shelob had been included in this film as it is in the book. Guess I will have to wait until Return of the King! In conclusion, if you are a reader of the books, don't have high expectations or else you may be a bit disappointed as I was! No matter what, however, The Two Towers was a highly entertaining excellent movie that deserves many many awards!!! Superb job to everyone involved in making the film, and good luck at the Oscars and Golden Globes!"

Star Wars are lightyears away.<br/><br/>The whole movie is just great and the battle of Helms deep is the best fighting sequense in the history of film.

The Ents are particularly misrepresented with Treebeard positively hasty in his decision to attack Isengard. Faramir is seen as nothing more than a clone of his brother and the character is totally sold out by the fact that he considers sending the ring to Minas Tirith to be used as a weapon against Sauron.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is not the Lord of the Rings.

Now that I have seen The Two Towers  I will tell you that it surpasses the first in alot of departments. First, since we are already acquainted with most of the key characters in the film we have more of a chance for some heart pounding action sequences, sure there were some in the first but nothing like the battle scenes in this movie. Second, even with all of this action we still have plenty of time realize the beauty of the themes in the books. Hopelessness, heart and determination, friendship and many other themes give this movie a great sense of ideals. Not only that but we get to see our favorite characters go further in a perile of good vs. evil which grabs us even more into the film. Of course the acting is great. Its almost like these people were fit for the roles since birth. One great newcomer to the acting scene in this movie is Gollum. While he had somewhat of a part in the first, in this one he gets to shine as the best CG character I have ever seen. Overall this movie was everything I wished for and more. Thats why this great acheivement in film gets a 10 out of 10. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of movies. Go see it whenever you have the chance."

","The Two Towers took my breath away and surpassed even the first film in the series: The Fellowship of the Ring. There were several moments which sent shivers down my spine and other where i was almost in tears. The film largely remains true to Tolkiens masterpiece give or take a few scenes, the only real criticism was that Farimir didn't really come off as well as he should have, other than that what we have here is one of the greatest movies of all time."

","Well I liked this movie a lot. I guess all who like fantasy movies would too. Except maybe some of you who would claim that it isn't exactly as in the book. So what? I read the movie as a kid and enjoyed it, and a few years later I let myself enjoy the movie as well without comparing the two under a microscope. For all of you who like fantasy, and even for those of you who don't, this movie is highly recommended."

","tiny SPOILERS<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was VERY worried that TTT wouldn't be just as good as FOTR, but just as the film started, and Gandalf went down with the Balrog, I was thinking ""aaah, that looks so fake"", but WAIT! Ten seconds later, there is a shot where you see the Balrog and Gandalf ready to fall into the water, you see it from far away. It's in slow motion, and with the music and all, I just got shivers ALL DOWN MY BACK, and I was thinking ""aaah, it's ok, nothing to be worried about"". The beginning is abit slow, but as soon as Gandalf comes back (as Gandalf the White), the story follows on nicely.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Gollum is GREAT! I know you've probably heard this before, so did I, but I wasn't expecting a computer-animated character to be THAT GOOD! There's this part where he starts arguing with himself and the whole cinema was cracking up! I had tears because it was so funny! After a good 3 minutes of this, you pass to another seen where he starts arguing with Sam and that's just HILARIOUS!!! As well as the little jokes between Gimli and the Elf, to tell you the truth, this film is REALLY FUNNY!<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam are so cute together (sorry about that, it has to be said), and Gollum - or Sméagol - is really sweet most of the time, saving Frodo and all... The Ents are fun because they're so slow, you really get the feeling that they're magic folk. The actors are all wonderful...<br/><br/>BUT (da-da-dum), I'm really ashamed/sad/sorry to say that it isn't as good as the first. WAIT now before you start telling me I'm MAD, between yesterday and today (I saw the film yesterday), I've come to the conclusion that it's not because it's not as good it's because well, let me take you one year back: It's my sisters birthday and they all want to see FOTR and I'm going ""No, let's go see Harry Potter"" but in the end, we go to see FOTR. So I'm sitting all grumpy and all, and then you hear ""I am prestar aen"" woooooooosh, that sent gripped right through the stroy from start to end. I was crying and (yes) laughing and when I came out all I could think of was ""FOTR FOTR FOTR, MORE MORE MORE!!!"" I was so hyped because I'd never seen ANY movie like this, EVER! I watched it over and over (and over) again, and loved it even more. I know that TTT is as fantastic as FOTR, it's just that, since I'd seen something like that before (FOTR, duh), it didn't leave me with the same feeling as I did last year, and that makes me really, really depressed.<br/><br/>Still, to conclued, I give it 10/10, because it's just not fair to compare movies to others. Thanks for reading btw ;-)"

","Parts of this movie were great, others were annoying and I disliked the deviations from the book.  Faramir was all wrong, and taking Frodo to Osgiliath unnecessary.  I didn't see the point in Aragorn falling off the cliff.  These things ruined it for me somewhat.  Gimli taking over the role of the jester was also a little disappointing - Pippin suited that better. If you haven't read the book, you'll love it.  Otherwise the changes could really irk you, as they did me.  I'm hoping I'll enjoy it better on subsequent viewings, once I get used to the 'butchering'.  I didn't enjoy it nearly as much as the first.  I'd give it, however, 8/10."

","Contains Spoiler My wife and I went to see THE TWO TOWERS last night and I can't tell you how excited I was to be able to see what I had waited so long for.  I did enjoy the movie very much.  It was captivating, enchanting and full of action, but I cannot say I don't have my criticisms too.  I can well understand that Peter Jackson must take certain steps to cram this fantasy classic into three bite-size chunks for the general public's viewing.  I also understand that certain omissions must be made and that we cannot expect to savor certain story-lines as a careful reader can, but I'm quite disappointed with certain elements of the story that, in my opinion, need not have been changed.<br/><br/>Elrond, as far as I can remember, did not try to press his daughter into leaving Aragorn nor did he express such pessimism as to the success of Frodo's mission to destroy the ring.<br/><br/>As far as the Battle of Helm's Deep, it was very impressive, although it was often difficult to follow (I'm sure as such a real war would be, but I'm in a theater and I need to see and understand a bit better than if I were actually there.)  I was completely thrown off as to a troop of Lorien Elves coming to the aid of Theoden in Helm's Deep.  I would have been far more impressed with the Huorns appearing the next morning to finish off the Orcs.<br/><br/>Speaking of Huorns, I was also dismayed that Treebeard and the Ents didn't decide on their own to take action against Isengard before being ""tricked"" into seeing the destruction Saruman had caused firsthand.<br/><br/>I was probably most bothered by the actions of Faramir.  In the book, he was briefly torn about what to do with the Ring-bearer and the One Ring, but he quickly resolved this and showed himself much more honorable than Boromir. Since the movie had him act 180 degrees in the opposite direction, and only changing his mind after the Nazgul episode at Osgiliath, I lose a great deal of respect for the movie version of his character.<br/><br/>Finally, in the book, Aragorn was far more respectable to Eowyn in making her understand that his heart, in no uncertain terms, belonged to another. To me, his movie-self was ""leading her on"" when he should not have been.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I've stepped on anyone else's toes with my comments, but I just would have thought that there would have been omissions or briefer versions of what happened and not introducing behavior that Tolkien himself was careful not to display in the novels.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie really was great and I heartily encourage anyone to watch it, it's just that from a more purist's standpoint, I was disappointed with the directions taken.  If you haven't read the books or don't remember them that well, you'll probably tremendously enjoy the movies and think that I'm off my rocker."
"ginog","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," Great ""Mooovie""! Horrible Adaptation of a Novel.
","I would start off by saying I think this is a brilliant work of Cinematography. This is one of the best, and most visually stunning action movies ever made.<br/><br/>Most people childishly fault the inaccuracies in this movie vs the book because it may or may not have changed the detail of certain events, when and how they happen, and by whom. I do not fault the artistic license to do this, especially in such a mammoth story like LOTR. And I will say that the events as described in the book were fairly well told, if not BETTER told in this movie. The Ents sacking Isengaurd was brilliant!<br/><br/>
However, the grandeur of LOTR as a novel comes not from the specific events as they happen, but through the relationships of the characters that spur such events. In this way, the film ""The Two Towers""  barely resembles the novel.<br/><br/>Whether it's the fault of the screen writers, the director, or the actors themselves, none of the characters retain the humanity which made their actions hold meaning. The heroes and villains act seamlessly without intent in the absence of specific details which made them so real in the novel. In this film they become absolute ""plot-slaves"" and work only to prove that the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Other relationship details that were fabricated for the film, for example, Elrond contempt of Arwen's (otherwise nonexistent) relationship with Aragorn, very much change the characters' functions in the story. In this case, not only Arwen and Elrond are changed, but in a sense the entire race of elves as envisioned by Tolkien.<br/><br/>The result is a super fast paced, cinematic action film like no other, and, admittedly, an enjoyable one. But it is a far different experience  than the one supplied by the original author. If the producers of this film made the bold, and daring step to keep LOTR as a story about 2 tiny hobbits on their way to the end of the earth, caring the destruction of the world, they could have made one of the greatest films of all time. They could have offered the insight of this post World War 2 novel in a time when we ourselves should be paying attention to the kind of impact even the smallest of creatures can make on our world.<br/><br/>Instead they made one of the biggest blockbuster hit the decade. What would you do?"

","Try as I might, as a fan of the books I can't get over the silly changes made in this second film. I do not think the changes made to the first book detracted from the overall film.<br/><br/>Not so the second installment. Peter, you blew it.<br/><br/>Nice film, just not what I was hoping for. They added a few things I am thankful for. And they did a lot of it well. But the additions and character revisions blew it for me. I'll see it again, but not with the excitement of seeing the first one a second time. One good thing though, It won't be so hard to wait for the next release.<br/><br/>7/10 (could have EASILY been 10/10 had they stuck to the story)"

","++++++++Possible Minor Spoilers+++++++++ There was so much hype for this film that at the very end of it I was not left with that humongous regret on waiting another 12 months to see the conclusion. Please don't get me wrong, This movie was superb and had a lot of great scenes that surpassed the fellowship movie and I loved the fellowship of the ring, as a matter of fact it still is my favorite LOTR movies between the first 2 installments, This movie has great moments, Everyone is very involved in it, Frodo and Sam on their quest, This time they travel with Gollum, who was played in a wonderful way by Andy Serkins and stole every scene from the hobbits, at first it gave me some sort of vibe to be like that little servant `Dobby `from the Harry Potter movie, but later on Gollum became a very likeable character and I hope to see him at the Oscars next year. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli did their job very well and Merry and Pippin just helped in their small way to the film, The wolves of the Orcs and the Ents and the Olifants look great, CGI have come far now a days, The last battle scene is very interesting and long, only some few surprises and a lot of action made The Two Towers a second chapter worth it's time, Now everything's set for next years grand finale, I don't want anyone to hate me for saying this (I know it's going to sound mean) but Starwars: Episode 2 did kept me at the ending waiting for more, anxious to see the last Episode, This movie kind of lacked in that department.

","""Fellowship"" is difficult to live up to.  Although ""Two Towers"" is an enjoyable watch, it probably won't get another one out of me until all three are released on DVD.  The first movie flowed better.  The narrative style and structure of this sequel falls short, and there seem to be too many quick disjointed cuts.  <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was a little weak and I did not like the ""episodic"" feel the flashback/dream gave.  This flashback explanation of Gandalf defeating the demon and ""coming back"" was not a great place to start.  At least it was a dream of Frodo's... a good script-writing trick (one of a few in this movie).  <br/><br/>We all think Gollum's character was superb, the movie had nice graphics, good enough acting.  But the first was a better movie because it had better flow, camera, etc.  Someone on IMDB also noted the ""cliche"" Hollywood tricks placed in this movie... I won't repeat them, but they sure do exist. (But what do you expect in a blockbuster?  Ahhh, how to appease such a critical generation...)<br/><br/>Anyhow, I feel much like Gollum.  We like it!  We don't like it!  We don't know!  OK, no, I like it... but perhaps the final cut was a bit off.  I mean, it's not like I sat in the theatre thinking these things... they are just after-thoughts.  When the final third installment is included, the movie will work better.  But I feel it is always important for a movie in a trilogy to stand up on its own.<br/><br/>Who knows, maybe a super-amazing-o-ramic-super edition will be released!"

","Reading the comments of my fellow viewers I remark that having seen the film in the first days after the release I shared the experience with the hard core fans of the series. Not being one of them (until now at least), I can just comment of the quality of the film making. In my opinion, it is an extremely well directed film, superb camera work, and greater effects I have ever seen. If anybody doubts that computer effects became an art of its own, her/his doubts will be dissipated by this film. The complexity and perfection of some scenes looks like a big work of art, and the comparison coming to my mind is to Brueghel's or Bosch's paintings.<br/><br/>However, the story is very complex. The director decided that the whole film will be just one piece of art, broken into three slices of three hours each only by commercial reasons. This median series starts and ends in the midst of the story telling. Well, having been busy the last year with a few other things - among them seeing many other movies - and not having read the book, I had problems in getting much of the action and characters development. A short recollection of the previous series action would have helped, and I recommend it to distributors for the next  time. They can of course, take it out for the big nine-ten hours screening in cinematheques of the future times :-) <br/><br/>People who read the book were mixed in their reactions. Some say that the book is richer in characters and philosophy, and the movie loses something. Well, this happens with most books adaptations. I think that in this case, there is a lot the screen adaptation has added as well. But I will certainly buy and read the book now! <br/><br/>It is still a good movie, one of the best of the year. I said good, but not great - only 8/10 on my personal scale, which I think will end being close to the real and deserved average mark of this film, after the initial fans enthusiasm cools out."

","I'm one of the three people in the world who watched this movie without having first seen or read the Fellowship.  The film is unsympathetic to this possibility, as it launches into the story with no explanation of anything. Through the course of the next three hours of dialogue and action I got the gist of the plot down, and felt the epic nature of the story.  The movie was very good, with the siege as a highlight.  Easily the coolest siege I have ever seen, it was lengthy but exhilarating throughout.  Also, the mood of the movie, though grave at times, was lightened by humor sufficiently to make me ignore the fact that I just saw 10000 people dying by sword or arrow.  There is a subplot with the conscious trees, and while essential to the overall plot, it was a nuisance and totally broke up the action of the rest of the movie.  As a whole, a very good movie."

","I must admit I was a bit pretentious and anxious prior to seeing the second installment of Tolkien's epic adventure. So much so that I was shaking severely when the film started. I knew I was in for a treat. I was in it for the high adventure. I really wanted to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I saw the first installment of Jacksons LOTR TFOTR. Having read C.S. Lewis and John Tolkien's works throughout my life I have come to the realization of just how ballsy these authors portray real life. Yet it is done in a mythical Norse-like way. Now don't get me wrong, this is fantasy right? Seeing how our world today mirrors much of these themes, it is almost scary! Can you say ""Iraq""?<br/><br/>The beginning...<br/><br/>As it first unfolds, the film depicts a rich sweeping arial view of the Mines of Moria. As the camera pans around the beautiful New Zealand mountain-range the camera fades into a recap of the battle that we all saw in the first movie between the Balrog and Gandalf the Grey. Looking back to that point (about 3/4 of the way in the first film) we are presented with an exact visual of Gandalf's cane being cast brilliantly to the ground. The Balrog has fallen yet the tip of the flame whip is ensnared around the wizards leg. Frodo screams out, but it is too late... Knowing what a good sevant of the gods must do, the wizard makes a split-second and wise decision to fight the evil Balrog in his own game. The Wizard is locked into mortal combat with this child of shadow. Gandalf and the beast fall through a chasm of forevermore depth towards the highest peak of the underworld. The victory is won, but is Gandalf unscathed?<br/><br/>Thoughts...<br/><br/>Ironically, the actors altruistic revelation of internal mythology is carefully interjected throughout the movie by Tolkien and is well translated by Peter Jackson for the big screen. It is a unplayed mindgame of Tolkiens designed to be an Easter-egg of sorts. For a movie, that is hard to do. This blatant outward realism of the books actually being present in a film is extraneous at best. Is this literary style prevalent in the films thusfar? Emphatically yes! It is quite a film. Dogmatically speaking, this film was an awesome visionary adaptation worthy of Tolkien and is well worth a few Oscars without a doubt. Well done Mr. Jackson!<br/><br/>You want the climaz, anticlimax or just plain plot? Go see the movie!! I don't do spoilers out of respect for Peter Jackson and John Tolkien."

For my birthday I saw The Two Towers with about ten of my friends.<br/><br/>Never before have I seen such an unbelievable spectacle of cinema<br/><br/>accomplishment. My biggest problem with the whole movie was some of the<br/><br/>shots of the hobbits on the shoulders of Treebeard. That's about it.<br/><br/>Gimli, the stout little dwarf who was pretty much in the shadows last time, is now out in front with his quirky and very funny scenes. There was hardly a scene in which the surly ""man"" didn't give a laugh. Dead wargs piling on top of him, his complaint of a lack of a view at Helm's Deep, and his unbelievably humorous<br/><br/>shot of him gouging a berserker Uruk-Hai in the crotch with his axe. THAT'S<br/><br/>funny.<br/><br/>I was so pleased with Gollum. He interacted so perfectly with the live actors it was hard to looks at him and remind yourself he wasn't real. The close-ups on his face are what give him such a dimension of a real, physical character. Yes, Dobby and Yoda did look quite good in their respective movies (Harry 2 and<br/><br/>Star Wars 2) but Gollum not only looked better, he performed much better. See the movie to understand what I mean.<br/><br/>Well, I have found two other complaints. Merry and Pippin were virtually<br/><br/>forgotten in this movie. Their scenes were almost as if they were put in only because they had to. Also the overall feel to the movie made it drift away from the first, and sometimes, even though I have read the books and seen the first movie quite a few times, I found myself somewhat lost or puzzled by the movie.<br/><br/>However, this movie was filled with scenes that more than made up for the weak points of the movie. Depending on what kind of movie you prefer, this movie is better than the first. If you like the first one better, that's because these two movies share almost nothing in common, and I understand why some people<br/><br/>liked the first one better.<br/><br/>However, other than the first movie, there is one thing that I have never heard in a movie theater, and I've seen nearly every worthwhile movie since Gladiator. Applause. The theater erupted in applause by the film's end. That is the<br/><br/>testament of the strength of this series, and may The Return of the King prove us all wrong that movie making can't get any better than this. 10/10."

","I thought that this was a great movie, but there were 2 changes from the book that bothered me. First, Arwen didn't need to be such a big character. I think this movie would have done just as well or better without her. I think she slowed it down more than anything else.<br/><br/>Second, Faramir's character was completely changed. In the book he shows the strength of his character by letting Frodo, Sam and Gollum go on their way while in the movie he leads them to Gondor. The problem is that the movie portrays him as being just like his brother Boromir rather than a man of greater strength and the will to do what is right and best for Middle Earth.<br/><br/>I also found the beginning to be a bit confusing because of how they jumped right into the story without any real recap. However, I understand that it had to be done this way and am glad they didn't have any sort of re-cap. Eventually you get into the flow of things and everything falls into place. I think it would be neat if after all three movies are out they make a DVD edition with all three movies edited into one great long movie with no pause between the three original films. You would be crazy to sit though it all in one sitting (and would likely end up with bed sores or something) but I think it would be interesting.<br/><br/>However, despite my complaints I thought it was a great movie - much better than the first. I thought that Gollum stole the show. They did an excellent job of portraying his internal struggles and contradiction. I would like to have seen more of then Ents. It's unfortunate that Merry and Pippin didn't get to drink his nectar and grow taller, but that scene would have likely slowed the movie.<br/><br/>Despite my complaints I plan on seeing this movie at least once more while it is still in the theaters and I can't wait for the DVD to come out."

","Entrancing? Inspired? Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious? How else can you describe Two Towers? When completed, these three movies will permanently change the way people view film possibilities.<br/><br/>That said, I do think Two Towers had a one or two rough spots. Peter Jackson smoothed over the scant few jagged Fellowship edges with his extended cut. I have confidence he'll do the same here. The Two Towers still stands as a wholly enjoyable theatrical experience.<br/><br/>But speaking as a more casual LotR reader, I've enjoyed all of the story changes that Jackson ultimately ran with. I see the Lord of the Rings epic in the same way I view Arthurian Legend. It's like spoken word: mutable and open to interpretation ... so long as the epic's roots aren't forgotten. That's not going to happen anytime soon.<br/><br/>When great stories are ""re-imagined"" by someone who actually has imagination, it only enhances the original stories.<br/><br/>I only wish Jackson had more freedom to play fast and loose with plot possibilities and characters ... without risking the wratch of a hundred million Tolkien fans. And speaking selfishly, I wish Arwen played more of an pro-active role in Two Towers; I liked the heroic Arwen from the Fellowship better than the 2-D character in the books."

","The best thing about this movie is Gollum. Gollum has always been my favorite character in the books, and they did an amazing job with him. The movie itself is bla. I don't mind that it doesn't stand on its own as a movie (it is a series and the director shouldn't have to waste time reviewing), so I thought it was good to just jump into it. But it never quite jumps. It kind of skips, and then you have this feeling that it is about to fall. It adds things that aren't necessary (Arwen and Galadriel), and subtracts things that are important (Deagle). It expands the battle of Helm's Deep into this huge thing, what Peter Jackson doesn't realize is that Battles are so boring. Wow more Orcs attacking! The only time when battles are interesting is when you feel for BOTH sides, and I'm sorry you can't feel for the orcs (now this is not Peter Jackson's fault but it is his fault to think that what the story needs is more battles). Also I can't believe he actually put a bomb in it.<br/><br/>The battles are my main problem but also he destroyed Faramir's character, making him just like Boromir, and I must admit to being in love with Faramir in the book so I was just a little upset about that. <br/><br/>Where the movie really shot itself in the leg though is the ending (don't worry I won't tell you what happens). The end of the book is one of the most suspenceful moments in the book, I actually started The Return of the King at Book II to find out what happened to Frodo and Sam. Well the end of the movie is completely different from the book just ending the movie on a low note.<br/><br/>Eiowyn was cool and just how I imagined her though, so I'm happy about that.<br/><br/>So you all probably hate me now for giving it a 3 star rating, but you guys are entitled to like it if you want (just not more than the original Star Wars Trilogy which I think is heavily based on Tolkien and actually is a better transfering of the books onto film)."

","I think TTT is *much* better than the Fellowship with the sole exception of Gandalf who doesn't get nearly enough screen time. Other than that, TTT is pitch perfect. Who cares if PJ ""deviated"" from the written word? Translating something from one medium to another always results in changes, and there are always purists who complain - I'm sure when Tchaikovsky wrote ""Onegin"" the purists were screaming he was murdering the poem, but it's still a great opera. If you want LOTR as Tolkien wrote it, then go read the book. Frankly, I really didn't like the book much at all and thought it was a complete bore (what's with all these unnecessary and irritating characters like Tom Bombardil? And why do they have to declaim a very long and bad poem every time they decamp somewhere? And it takes the Hobbits friggin' *20* years to leave the shire with the ring, after they've told just about everybody who wants to hear they're setting out on this adventure, and packing enough provisions for the entire army of orcs - come on!!). So when The Fellowship came out, I went in there reluctantly, expecting nothing in particular, and came out so captivated with Gandalf that I saw the movie 7 times. And TTT is even better. Is there anything like the battle at Helms Deep in movie history? I'm going to have to see it again a couple more times to take in the whole thing, because it's a wild movie, and almost overwhelms the viewer, but it's simply great. Stop flipping through the pages of the book to see what PJ changed and just enjoy yourself."

","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is very much like the first film, ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"". It is a little less personal, because the danger much of the time involves huge groups of people and a war, rather than individuals. Additionally, some of the personal interactions and dramas (Thorien, the Ents, the humans of Rodan) didn't come across as powerfully as in the first film. And there was perhaps a bit too much plot crammed in. For all these reasons, I think I prefer the first film over the second. <br/><br/>Least impressive were the Ents, the tree creatures, who seemed a little like comic relief rather than real creatures. Most impressive was Gollum, the best animated character we've seen yet in movies, and who is used stunningly for dramatic effect, unlike his predecessors (Jar-Jar Binks in Star Wars I and Jurassic Park's dinosaurs) who were eye candy with no depth.<br/><br/>Despite being a die-hard LOTR fan, I did find the endless war scenes a little long and repetitive. During one scene, there are two cute kids who are supposed to be frightened to death. But one child actor (the boy) is sort of smiling impassively rather frightened, yet the camera lingers on him. Why? I think those are the director's kids.<br/><br/>All summed up, this is a must-see. If you're only going to see one fantasy film in your life, this series is the one. A warning, though -- it is very long, so be ready for that.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Everyone (but not tiny children), a must-see<br/><br/>-- Nasty little hobbitses<br/><br/>I'll give LOTR II a well-earned 10 out of 10."

","Last year, I said that ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was a ""decent adaptation"" of the original book. I can't be that generous with ""The Two Towers.""<br/><br/>
I could tell from the trailer that Jackson was planning to beef up the battle at Helm's Deep and the Arwen-Aragorn-Eowyn triangle--and I recognized the cinematic wisdom of both those moves. I hadn't anticipated that the second film would end so much sooner than the second book did; that too, though, I can see the wisdom of.<br/><br/>But Jackson took too many liberties for me to enjoy this film as an adaptation of a minor classic. There's too much new material lifted from pulp fantasy, too many Hollywood cliches: the attack of the wolf-riders, the surprise eleventh-hour arrival of elvish troops, Pippin's strained scheme to rouse Treebeard from his apathy, the detour to Osgiliath, the confrontation between Frodo and the airborne Ringwraith (what was that supposed to show, anyway?). <br/><br/>Viewers who have never read the book will no doubt enjoy the film as an entertaining, action-filled, special effects bonanza--though I must say it does a gross injustice to Tolkein to turn his work into merely that. As for the D&D geeks who camped out in theaters on the night of December 17, they will no doubt forgive Jackson his infidelities because the film has cool monsters and sword fights and elvish dialogue--which has always been the way to that crowd's hearts and wallets. There's no question that the film deserves another round of Oscars for sets and costumes and special effects. But the film is still a disappointment."

","It's Christmas time and Peter Jackson has brought us a most wonderful present with the second installment of The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. Is it as much of a present to fantasy fans as last years Fellowship? Most definitely.<br/><br/>(possible spoilers)<br/><br/>As the first movie ended, the fellowship had been broken into three separate groups. Merry and Pippin had been captured by Uruk-Hai Orcs, Sam and Frodo had continued their journey to Mordor to destroy the ring, and the remaining members; Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn had begun pursuit of the captured hobbits. Pretty exciting way to start a movie if you ask me. The three stories are seamlessly interweaved throughout and the jumping back and forth doesn't harm the continuity of the movie in the slightest.<br/><br/>Sam and Frodo meet up with the most exciting CGI character in years in the presence of Gollum. Gollum is devoted towards retaining his ""precious"" yet through some coaxing from Frodo his original personality does surface occasionally and aid the hobbits.<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin's story is the slightest part of the movie. They escape from the captors when the fabled Riders of Rohan attack and find themselves saved from further injury by Treebeard the Ent. Fans of the original series will be excited to see the addition of the Ent's to the battles.<br/><br/>The main storyline focuses on the final three. Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn begin their quest for the captured hobbits but find they have lost the trail after the previously mentioned attack. When they meet a ""lost"" friend, they realize that they must turn their attentions to aiding Theodan, the King of Rohan. The grand moment of the movie centers on the Battle of Helm's Deep as the hero's attempt to defend against an army of 10,000. It was simply speaking, breathtaking.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson ably repeats his success in this movie. It clocks in at just about 3 hours and the time seems to truly fly as you are watching it. There aren't many slow moments at all during the filming and there is definitely the appropriate amount of development throughout.<br/><br/>Even though the films have been shot back to back, it seems that the actors have grown much more comfortable throughout the process. My favorites by far have to be those of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Aragorn is the born leader of men and his companions have developed a friendship and rivalry that amuses during the battle sequences. Some of the moves that are done during this almost hour-long scene of carnage are spectacular.<br/><br/>The computer generated Gollum is a wonderful addition and, as voiced/acted by Andy Serkis, is almost as believable as the others. The addition of Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) as Wormtongue is perfect. He slimes his way through all his scenes in a most disturbing manner. My only complaint casting wise is with Elijah Wood. He is doing a fine job as Frodo but for my tastes would have been better cast as an elf.<br/><br/>It has been a year since I read this chapter in the story and I don't remember it perfectly. I know this was a relatively well done adaptation which stands on it's own as a truly entertaining piece of filmmaking."

"Anaisnine","Null","0","0","20 December 2002"," Visually arresting, so-so on the scrpting.
","No doubt about it, TLOTR will be an epic franchise. Everything about the films is BIG- big landscapes, big battles, big score, and TTT is no exception. Its a big movie that impresses us with its grandeur. So, why so small on the script? The plot is fine as the movie starts off with the gang as each doing their part to help defeat the forces of Saurumom & Sauron. But I have to say, the flaws that I felt were in  FOTR are still present in TTT- namely the heavy handed, over serious, stilted dialogue, and for the most part zero character development, and lack of character depth. Now, if you just judge LOTR as an action film franchise(along the lines of say Indiana Jones) then sure, its good fare. But for all those who claim these movies are(and will be-ROTK) the epitome of great filmaking, Im sorry but with flaws like these, that cant be the case. But I will say this, I did enjoy TTT more than I did Fellowship. TTT was better paced and more focused since Peter didnt have to bungle his way through the se- up of the story and character introductions. Second, the mood of the film is more desperate and intense, as all the major characters do their part to fight the forces of eeevil. And thirdly, the fight sequences are far far better this go round, better filmed and better directed. I gather that this is due in fact b/c the overall quality of the CGI is so much better that Peter can take the time to really let the scenes develop, and not just cut and slash his way through scenes so that the questionable cgi is just glossed over. Helms Deep just kicked major butt, as well as the Ents rampage. The only letdown I can see is the other cities of Middle EArth- if they are supposed to be the great human cities (Roham, Gondor) then maybe Saurumon is right to get rid of humans, b/c they looked like some backwater village. But, the character of Gollum made up for this, he was by far the best and most realized character in the movie....sad to think that, considering he is a cgi creation, but oh well. Overall, I think the tighter pacing, vast cgi improvements and epic battle scenes saved the film and I could enjoy it regardless of its flaws. So, I deem TTT( and so far the whole LOTR franchise) as a great action flick, great fantasy flick, decent bit of cinema- 3.5 out of five"

Yes, he tried to keep true to the characters in the book, but ended up focusing too much on the wrong ones for no good reason.<br/><br/>In general i give the movie 8/10, but it wouldn't be fare to compare this to the first one, since at least it has a beginning.

"Brunel","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," Don't read this if you are unaware of what happens in Return of the King!!!
","To begin, let me state that I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and have been ever since I first read the books at the age of 16. Now, having read the books multiple times and thoroughly enjoying the first installment of Peter Jackson's epic adaptation, I was more than eager to see what the second would have to offer. And I was NOT disappointed. Words cannot do justice to this film, it has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>
My initial impression on leaving the cinema was that it was truly a fantastic film. There were, however, some small areas which I would love to be able to question Peter Jackson over. They were not failings within the film but I am intrigued as to why some scenes were there whilst others were not.<br/><br/>Why did we have Aragorn going over a cliff and then being presumed dead? Not part of the book and it doesn't seem to contribute anything to the story. The only reason I could think of was to illustrate the firm friendship between him, Legolas and Gimli at that stage and possibly to emphasise that Eowyn is falling in love.<br/><br/>Why did Frodo and Sam go with Faramir to the city? I can't think of a single reason for it other than to increase the screen time of David Wenham.<br/><br/>
Why were we missing several crucial chapters towards the end?! I was sitting on the edge of my seat, convinced that there was more to come when the final credits came up! Where was the reunion between Pippin, Merry, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli? Where was the episode with Gandalf facing Saruman? And Pippin looking into the palantir? I can only guess that these chapters will be covered in the next film; I can't imagine that they will be left out entirely. If this is the case then the third film will have a lot of ground to cover. We have yet to meet Shelob and witness the final battle where the Nazgul is slain, not to mention the destruction of the ring. Does this mean that the film will end abruptly when the war is won? Will we fail to see Frodo and his friends return to Hobbiton and what happens there? Or will they somehow manage to fit it into those 3 hours and still see Frodo passing away to the Grey Havens? OH the mind boggles!!!!<br/><br/>My main point of contention has to be with Faramir. He was always one of my favourite characters in the book but in the film he appears to be a replica of Boromir. This is not true of the character. ""Unlike they were, and yet also much akin.""<br/><br/>Please don't misunderstand me; none of the things above lessened my overall enjoyment of this film, they simply intrigued me and I would love to know why certain decisions were made by the production team.<br/><br/>The Two Towers stands apart from any other film. It is a visual masterpiece and a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend 3 hours; I do not begrudge a minute of it and I can guarantee that I will be going to see it again. The battle sequences were simply amazing and I can't possibly end without mentioning how completely fantastic Gollum was! He was absolutely hideous but then completely pitiable at the same time; perfect characterisation.<br/><br/>
Thank you Peter Jackson for this film! I loved the books long before the film and I love these films just as much. I can't imagine anyone doing more justice to Tolkien than as has been shown in these two films. I can only hope that Return of the King will be just as good, I have very little doubt that it will be.<br/><br/>p.s. The Ents are awesome! Oh how I love Treebeard!!"

"david_jay","Null","0","0","20 December 2002"," More action, less acting makes TTT very good, but not great
","What to make of TTT? For over a year now I have been listening to the arguments about whether and where The Lord of the Rings trilogy will justly rank among the pantheon of all-time great movies. Unlike so many of the most impassioned reviewers of these films, I had never read any of Tolkien's works before the movies began arriving (and am now, sometimes reluctantly, holding out until after being surprised by each of the films). In short, I am a movie buff but not a `ring nut'. That being said, one year later I am still in awe of the accomplishment of FOTR and wouldn't hesitate to rank it as one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, particularly the extended version. In the year since its release I have heard Peter Jackson and others repeatedly say that they expected the first of the movies to be the least appealing of the trilogy, so it was genuinely hard to temper my expectations before seeing TTT. Now I have seen it, and the sentence that kept forming in my brain as I watched TTT was `this is a good movie, but I cannot believe it is nowhere near as good as FOTR.' Here, in my opinion, is why.<br/><br/>Consider, for a moment, Shakespeare's Hamlet. It shares some elements with fantasy and action movies - ghosts wandering the night, murder plots, sword fights, poison, and one heck of a body count at the end. Is that what makes it great? It is ridiculous to even suggest this - Hamlet is a masterpiece for its words, its soliloquies, for the opportunities it gives to each generation of actors to express universal human truths and reveal just how good they truly are as actors. No matter how imaginative the sets or exciting the final sword fight, any production of Hamlet will succeed or fail based on the emotion the cast pulls out of Shakespeare's masterful dialogues. As wonderful and amazing as Peter Jackson's visualization of Tolkien's world has been, what made FOTR great in my eyes were Tolkien's poignant words (often helped by Jackson and his co-writers' skillful editing) and the moments of acting brilliance they inspired. Even after a dozen viewings certain scenes still make me ache with emotion: Ian Holm contemplating mortality `like butter scraped over too much bread', Sean Bean transfixed by the nature of tragedy `so much fear and doubt for so small a thing', Cate Blanchett expressing the potentially crushing evil of beauty `all shall love me and despair', Ian McKellan on the perils of rash judgment `many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them?' and continuing soon after, hopefully, `all we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us'. All of these moments utterly move me, every time. (And for you `Tolkien purists', do you realize that Jackson et al transposed three out of four of these scenes? And to great effect - I would daresay Jackson the editor has actually improved upon Tolkien in these instances, giving these memorable lines added impact, so give the man some well-deserved credit.)<br/><br/>And what about TTT? In my opinion it has only one scene that holds a candle to all those riveting and heartfelt speeches from FOTR, and ironically it is pulled off by partially computer generated Andy Serkis as Smeagol/Gollum wrestling with his dual nature. I get the feeling some of the other scenes should have been electrifying, but somehow fell short. Theoden's speeches were just good. The sad chance of Arwen long outliving Aragorn was rendered in a visually stunning way, but its narration seemed cold and pitiless, never reflecting how much Elrond should care for Arwen and respect Aragorn (compare it to the virtuoso range of emotions Blanchett hits while narrating the prologue in FOTR). And Sam's speech near the end about the good things worth fighting for had me actually cringing in the movie theater for all its sappiness. Not yet having read the second book of the trilogy, I don't know whether TTT the movie's shortcomings stem from the writers not uncovering the gems, the actors not delivering, or Tolkien saving his best stuff for other parts of the trilogy. So even as Peter Jackson's breathtaking visualization of Middle-earth holds constant across both movies, for me FOTR transcends its genre to achieve movie greatness, while TTT seems merely a very good action/adventure movie featuring a strong cast. It looks good (so good!) but lacks the soul of FOTR.<br/><br/>The LOTR films will no doubt be long-cherished by many viewers. But are they among the best ever? If it hadn't followed FOTR I would never even consider TTT for such a boast, but if viewed as part of a trilogy one could at least give it credit for not dropping the ball entirely between epics. Hopefully ROTK will rise again to FOTR's lofty levels; if so, the LOTR movie trilogy will deservedly be critically hailed by future generations too, not just for technical achievement, but as one of the all-time greats. And for those of you that would belittle the Lord of the Rings as mere fantasy and not to be taken seriously as either literature or movie, remember that Shakespeare himself used to deal heavily in ghosts, kings, witches, sword fights and midsummer night's dreams, and his works are no less masterpieces for it."

","A gift to Tolkien geeks and fans of cutting-edge moviemaking everywhere.<br/><br/>I think that there will be quite a few people who won't like this movie at all, and even some who might go to see it not even understanding it's supposed to be a middle installment, and not something with a definite beginning and end. But for most of the Tolkien fanatics, I feel this movie delivers the visual goodies. Whether or not it delivers the heart--well, I say it does, but I can see where others might reasonably differ with me on that. It had a bit of the chopped-up, overly pruned quality in certain sections which I noted in the theatrical version of FOTR. Those missing sequences were restored in the extended-DVD, and it made for a much better film. I'm sure that will be the case with TTT as well. I have a feeling a lot of Fangorn Forest and Karl Urban ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Still, I gave it a ""10"" for the many things about this movie which were either groundbreaking, or soul-satisfying.<br/><br/>Briefly, the high points were the acting of newcomers Bernard Hill and David Wenham, CGI Gollum, the exquisite score including the beautiful Rohan theme, the heartbreaking beauty of Shadowfax, and the overall complex, demanding, textural richness of the movie as a whole. It will take several viewings to really absorb it all.  There is so bloody much here, and the money spent on it is all right there on the screen.<br/><br/>The Battle of Helm's Deep IS the most impressive battle sequence ever brought to the screen.  Not only was the effects work impressive, and the agile athleticism and physical heroics of the actors up to the very best action/adventure standards, but someone involved here must have really studied Medieval warfare and seige tactics.  This engaged the brain as well as the viscera.  I think it will bear up extremely well under repeated viewings.  I was entertained, thrilled, AND educated by it.<br/><br/>I'm glad everyone seems to have enjoyed Gollum as much as I did. One thing that struck me was that when he first came on screen, I was so repulsed by him that I seriously wondered if I was going to be able to stand looking at him for as much screen time as I expected him to have. But by about five minutes in, I was utterly fascinated by him, then charmed, then amused, and began to look forward to his next appearance. A real credit to all involved in his creation for the screen. BTW, my 9 year old son LOVED Gollum.<br/><br/>
True delights for the Tolkien fan included the magnificent realization of the ""fell beasts"" and the use of Gimli, the Warrior Dwarf.  Dwarves as comic relief were certainly a part of The Hobbit, and Gimli in this one manages to deliver both the comedic goods, and be a real stud in the battle scenes. The lack of chemistry between Gimli and Legolas and the underusage of the Gimli character was one of my few complaints about FOTR, but all that is a thing of the past here, as John Rhys-Davies gets to show his chops as both Gimli, and the voice of the venerable Treebeard. Oh! What a life!  I have seen an Oliphaunt!<br/><br/>All the actors were excellent in this installment, and there were only three cringeworthy moments:  Legolas' X-games staircase surf at Helm's Deep, the Maxfield Parrish Faux Romantic Interlude between Aragorn and Arwen, and what immediately followed--did anyone else find it funny when Aragorn was dreaming of being kissed by Arwen, only to wake up to find his horse nibbling on his face?  I hope that was inadvertant.<br/><br/>I want to use the rest of this review to address two areas of controversy:<br/><br/>1) Elves coming to Helm's Deep--I liked the Elves coming to help out. I think it was done for those viewers who aren't steeped in Tolkien. It's not established WHY the ""Time of the Elves is Passing"", and it just looks like they are cowardly rats leaving a sinking ship if they don't try to help. In this time, when we expect allies of ours who have not been targeted by terrorism to lend us their support, I think Galadriel's sending some of her Elf archers to help the men was a hopeful message.<br/><br/>2)Faramir--Faramir has the same issues as Boromir did in the first movie, with the addition of knowing his brother set out with a company which included hobbits, and was later seen dead. He has NO idea how his brother died, and for all he knows, the hobbits might be responsible or at fault. He did not have the benefit of being at the Council of Elrond, where it was established how dangerous the ring would be for anyone other than Frodo to bear. So I found that his attitude towards the Hobbits AND the ring were both realistic and rational. Seeing with his own eyes, though, the power of the ring at its evil worst, and getting a good dressing-down from Samwise, he altered his position and agreed to let Frodo and Sam continue on, EVEN though it was against the laws of Gondor. How could you not get a shiver when he said ""then, my life is forfeit""?<br/><br/>Movie Faramir IS different than Book Faramir. Different AND more interesting and BETTER. I can hardly wait to see where this character is going in ROTK. I like this arc, and want to put my trust in PJ and Co, because I really do believe they know how to make a movie that will stand the test of time."

","that this ""interlude"" type film would be a fudge and a letdown. Oh ye of little faith! What a cracker. Just 2 hours since I left the cinema and I am counting every minute till the final instalment. I am so impressed by Peter Jackson's reverence for Tolkein's great trilogy, which when I first read it in the 70's I thought was unfilmable - sorry to use such a crass word. His depiction of Gollum is breathtaking, deserves a dozen Oscars by itself, and the 30 minute battle scenes are worth the entrance fee alone. 98% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, so its not just me who's overwhelmed."

","By far Peter Jackson, has outdone himself this time!! His has been on cue with every aspect of these movies so far..<br/><br/>CAST:- the cast are excellent in this movie, Elijah Wood and Andy Serkis play excellent roles as main character Frodo, his quest he was apointed to destroy the 'One Ring' and his own inner struggle to stop the 'One Ring' destroying him, and the most realistic CGI character Gollum, who is amusing yet you have to sypathise and simply love. Viggo, Orlando & John (aragorn, legolas & gimli) characters are even stronger and you can sense teh bond between them, i also loved the humour that legolas and gimli brought. These also supported by outstanding actors Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Sir Ian McKellan and many more who i just cannot name. It's great to see a director go for a unique talent rather than the Actor's ""Name"" or how much of a ""Star"" they are.<br/><br/>WITH REFERENCE TO THE BOOKS:- As a J.R.R Tolkien fan i think Peter has done a fantastic job, of keeping the story alive and even though changing it slightly, it's adds to the drama of the movie and i have no problem with it.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS:- The special effects in this movie are umcomparable to any movie ive ever seen. In a sense that they seem so realistic. Weather it be the amazing battles, gollum or the absolutely stunning Ents. the special effects are out of this world. and will certainly take the OSCARS for it this year.<br/><br/>MY OPINION:- There is nothing i can say which can come close too how amazing this movie is, there is not a word in the dictionary big enough. but if i were to reccommend 1 movie this year it would be THE TWO TOWERS and indeed THE LORD OF THE RINGS TRILOGY which in my eyes will be the Greatest Story Ever To Make Print and The Big Screen.."

","Once again we are brought to the realm of middle earth as the fellowship is out to to complete its mission.  Sequels are always a double edged sword, they either maintain our interest in the characters we were introduced to in the past, or they seem to re-hash the same thing with little interest. Luckily for us in Tolkiens world, there are still more interesting stories to tell, new people(creatures) to meet, and worlds to explore.<br/><br/>I have never been interested in reading the books, but I will have to admit after seeing the 2nd film that it has really sparked my interest.  2 Towers is a monumental achievement in film-making.  Director Peter Jackson manages to create an amazing world out of this novel, and choreograph some amazing battle sequences.  The comparisons to Kurosawa's 'Ran' are well justified, but Jackson's vision here is much different and the end result is spectacular.<br/><br/>Much like I had noticed in the first film, what seems to be the key to making this film a winner is how it describes the battle inside ourselves basicaly between light and darkness.  I also found more things and issues that this movie brought up than the first such as the dilema between Sam and Frodo over Smeagle which hinted at the arguments for and against capital punishment, then there are things about pacifism, and envriomentalism to some extent, and of course the pure corruption of power.  So I got even more out of it than the first.<br/><br/>Certainly one of the best films of the year<br/><br/>Rating 9 out of 10"
"rtypos","Null","0","0","22 December 2002"," A masterpiece, but . . .
","Another brilliant effort by Jackson. Gollum was worth the price of admission alone. The special effects were entrancing and mind-blowing, the battle scenes were probably the best ever filmed, the scenery was spectacular . . . but I liked the first one better for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>a) In the Twin towers, action comes at the expense of character development. This is my biggest complaint with the movie.  In the first installment the characters were real, heroic, in the second they often seem too much like Hollywood superheroes and they become less interesting as a consequence. Gandalf appearing like the Lone Ranger on the horizon, rearing back on his horse and then charging into battle wielding his staff like a sword.  C'mon, we don't need those cliches. When Aragorn looses an arrow, 10 orcs die. When 1,000 orcs shoot at him, they all miss. Ironically, the one character who really comes alive is the computer created Gollum who manages to be evil, innocent, pitiful and hateful all at once. If only Jackson would have spent equal time developing the other main characters this movie would have been a masterpiece, or rather more of a masterpiece. Special effects are fun, but I liked it better when the heroes appeared more mortal and their development as friends and warriors helped drive the movie's pace.<br/><br/>b) Faramir should sue for character assassination. In the book he was as wise and intuitive as his brother Boromir was boorish and insensitive. In the movie he comes across as stubborn and dense. Tolkien's Faramir was able to guess Frodo's quest without being told, as he was able to surmise Boromir's treachery. I wish Jackson wouldn't have fooled with his character.<br/><br/>c) The ents are mostly boring until the climactic scene at Isengard which is a lot of fun. (The ents are a weak part of Tokien's trilogy too.)<br/><br/>d) The steeds ridden by the ringwraiths weren't very impressive."

","After a year of anticipation, increasingly intense with each day of waiting, each spoiler revealed, and each rave early review read, the second part of LOTR has finally arrived. As a wary filmgoer who seldom wastes money on current cineplex junk, I was naturally concerned whether this colossal undertaking will live up to my expectations, let alone its equally collossal hype.<br/><br/>Perhaps, The Two Towers is an easier book to adapt cinematically, because it is more action-based, and its main events occur during a more condensed time period - weeks as opposed to months or years. On the other hand, it creates greater challenges in terms of intercutting between three separate storylines. Peter Jackson does a near-flawless job facing up to these challenges, and largely succeeds. The flaws are still there, but they are less jarring. The ""gloom and doom"" yet hopeful spirit of Tolkien's second book is present in spades, and again - painstalking detail is lavished on all visual aspects of Middle Earth.<br/><br/>Now, the usual discussion of strengths and weaknesses - and the latter are definitely fewer this time around.<br/><br/>WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!! -----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>THE GOOD:<br/><br/>1) My favorite character in the entire book was always Gollum, and Jackson's team along with Andy Serkis absolutely nail him. He is best acted and most complex of all, a feat for a CGI creature. As another reviewer said, ""Jar-Jar is not fit to lick Gollum's ass"", a view which I wholeheartedly agree with. When Gollum/Serkis remembers his past as Smeagol, the moment alone is worth the price of admission. Personalit(ies) indeed go a long way. Nearly every scene in the book that featured Gollum is reproduced here, with great accuracy, even the ""rabbit stew"" scene! The final scene of the film is extremely effective, possibly one of the finest.<br/><br/>2) Gimli - yes, he is largely relegated to necessary comic relief, but he is funny, not laughable. His character is actually well realized, because a Dwarf would truly feel like a fish out of water in such foreign surroundings. He also gets to save the day more than a few times. I have a feeling he'll have even more to say and do in the Extended DVD.<br/><br/>3) Merry and Pippin display passion and wit, taking their development further.<br/><br/>4)The movie is historically/geographically minded, and handles various new places and concepts well. The fans even get references to the Bombadil Story omitted from FOTR - the Old Forest and the Barrow-Whigths (Gollum sings their song). All of the landscapes are gorgeous, and 100% Alan Lee.<br/><br/>5) Of course, the epic feel is tremendous and the action spectacular. It is unneeded to even mention. At times it seemed like I was watching something out of the Iliad.<br/><br/>THE NOT-SO-BAD:<br/><br/>1) Arwen and Aragorn came off well, at least non-distracting. The sequence of Arwen mourning and wandering the woods alone was starltingly beautiful.<br/><br/>2) Faramir I never cared much about, so his motivation changes did not bother me. The actor playing him was not very strong however, and didn't impress me. Good thing he had little screen time.<br/><br/>3) Treebeard was decent, not quite as I would have liked but in the context of the film, the ents worked. I know that they will get additional scenes in the DVD from Jackson's interview. Their scenes appeared choppy. The Destruction of Isengard, though, was magnificent - goosebump-worthy.<br/><br/>4) The music was still excessive, but better. The Rohan theme was more pleasing to the ear than any pseudo-Titanic pap.<br/><br/>THE NOT-SO-GOOD:<br/><br/>1) The Rohan ""women and children"" storyline. Used purely for dramatic purposes, cheesy and worn-out. Could have done without it.<br/><br/>2) Sam's long speech about heroic endurance at the end needed some editing. Jackson is not a director known for subtelty.<br/><br/>3) Haldir's real death and Aragorn's fake one were overdone (slow-motion bathos syndrome) , but that is a fairly minor complaint.<br/><br/>4) CGI was spotty in places (the wargs and oliphaunts come to mind), but not enough to ruin the scenes. In fact, none the action scenes falter much.<br/><br/>
------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>In closing, I am pleased that TTT not only lived up to the hype/expectations, but managed to exceed them on almost all accounts. A gleeful smile has hardly left my face in all 3 hours, and my expression changed to an annoyed cringe only once or twice - far less than during Fellowship. I have to say that this film was the one (in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy genre) that I enjoyed the most ever since the good old days of the original Star Wars Trilogy, and I do not say that lightly."

The characterization of his schizophrenic tendencies are filled with humour, goodwill and horror. Really GREAT!<br/><br/>Last but not least, we are shown what the ents look like, and how they destroy Isengard, the fortress of the treacherous wizard Saruman.<br/><br/>These three plots are brilliantly mixed together so that we see a bit of each plot, which give a good variation as you don't get tired of one scene/plot.<br/><br/>I can only say(as I said with The Fellowship of the Ring): Go see it, and if you already have seen it, go see it again and again and again..."

","Yes there are points where the movie diverges from the book, but WHO CARES!!

I still loved this movie.<br/><br/>And when we saw Legolas swing up onto the moving horse with Gimli, my 6 year old son, 14 year old son and I, were just AMAZED.

My family will go see this movie again, as there is just so much to it. Read the books, see this movie (in sequence from the 1st movie). This epic will be around for a long time to come as nothing has come close to it.<br/><br/>

Gimli's too many jokes and some unnecessary slapstick-like scenes as Legolas surfing on a shield take out the dramatic of the battle scenes, too. Unfortunately the question ""More Saruman hasn't to offer?!?"" that somebody expresses during the fight is justified.<br/><br/>At the end the battle is suddenly over and I didn't have the impression that there was an intensive fight before.

"divaclv","Null","0","0","20 December 2002"," Towering achievement
","Near the end of ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,"" Sam Gamgee, the ever-loyal companion of Frodo Baggins, talks about stories: the ""great stories"" about darkness and despair, courage and triumph, the stories that help us find hope when we think we've lost it.  When he wonders if Frodo will ever be the subject of such a tale, the audience laughs knowingly, because ""Lord of the Rings"" is indeed one of the great stories--the folklore of our culture, if you will.  There is a quality about the tale that is marvelously fantastic and yet at the same time, deeply relevant to the world we live in.  And it's fitting that so great a story be given so glorious an interpretation as Peter Jackson's film trilogy of the books is turning out to be.<br/><br/>""Two Towers"" essentially picks up where ""Fellowship of the Ring"" left off: the Fellowship is splintered, and the various factions are doing their part to prevent the ultimate evil from engulfing Middle-Earth.  The one fault of the film various threads of the story become difficult to juggle, at times interrupting each other with something just this side of abruptness.  But with a high-caliber cast and a world that nearly bursts from the screen with its vivid grandeur, it's hard to complain too much.<br/><br/>Most of the film follows Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) Legolas (Orlando Bloom), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen)--who has returned, almost Christ-like, from seemingly certain death--as they attempt to guard the equestrian-based people of Rohan from the armies of darkness.  The threat is internal as well as external: an oily agent of the wizard Saruman, aptly named ""Wormtongue"" (Brad Dourif) has insinuated himself into the house of Rohan's king.  The performances from the returning cast are excellent across the board, and are complimented by the newcomers: Dourif, Bernard Hill as the king, and Karl Urban and Miranda Otto as his brave nephew and niece.  The fight for Rohan culmitates in the climactic battle at Helm's Deep, where rank upon rank of vicious orcs throw themselves at the outnumbered heroes who fight with nearly superhuman strength and courage.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the Ring which has the power to enslave Middle-Earth.  Guiding them is Gollem, an emaciated creature and a previous Ring-Bearer, who has become twisted by years of exposure to its corruption.  A highlight of the film, Gollem is arguably the most impressive CGI character in a live-action film, both on the technical and the character levels.  Creepy yet pathetic, the schitzophrenic Gollem wavers between eagerly helping Frodo on his quest and plotting to kill the `nasty hobbitses' and reclaim his precious Ring. In a film teeming with special effects, the subtle changes in Gollem's face and manner as his personality shifts are probably the most effective.  The remaining two hobbits, Pippin and Merry, spend much of their segments among the Ents, mobile, sentient trees who all but equal Gollem for technical merit and potency.<br/><br/>In all fantasy films, the visual element is a key factor, and `Two Towers' repeats the awe-inspiring brilliance of `Fellowship.'  Along with `Harry Potter' and `Spirited Away,' this ranks as one of the most beautiful sights of the screen this year.  There are `oooh' moments aplenty: characters trudge through magnificent landscapes, enormous towers stand threateningly over vast wastelands, huge armies stretch to the horizon in seething masses of humanity (or more frequently, non-humanity).  But when we zoom in for a closer look, we find stunning and meticulous detail-a flourish of the architecture, the shape of the weaponry, the trim on the costumes-which truly gives Middle-Earth a sense of depth.  Tolkien also had such an eye for detail, painstakingly creating the histories and cultures of his characters with loving artistry.  And this is perhaps one of the many reasons why `Lord of the Rings'-both books and movies-stand out as landmarks, not only in the fantasy genre but in literature and film in general."

","There are down sides to this film.  The acting is not Oscar worthy, the script is no way near as good as the original book and the story can seem fragmented at times.  But for pure visual glory, this film has to ranked right up there with the best.  If you take out the absolutely massive battle scenes, you still have the wonderful Smeagol/Gollum character.  If you take out the breathtaking views of middle earth you still have the breaking of Isengard.  Rarely, especially in these times does a director so clearly belong to the telling of one story.  With Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson this is true in spades. Bring on the Return of the King."

"Tin Man-5","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," A step back from Fellowship--flawed, but engaging **MAJOR SPOILERS**
","*SPOILERS* I've seen it, I've sat on it, I've thought about it, and I'm going to go see it again tonight. For now, here is my verdict:<br/><br/>There are a lot of things I can forgive for the sake of poetic license. Among them:<br/><br/>1. Faramir. My FAVORITE character from the books. Period. At first, I was pissed off. Now, I understand that poetic license had to be taken to make the character and his interaction with the movie for tense. In the end, he resists the ring, and his character was shown having the integrity and strength that Boromir lacked. Not exactly the brilliant foil for his older brother and father that he was in the book, but the tension helped with Galadriel's monologue about the ""sons of Gondor taking the ring.""<br/><br/>2. The different ending. Or rather, the cut-off point being different from the book. They killed Boromir at the end of FotR anyway, so having also altered the beginning, I can see why they would save Frodo's capture for the beginning of RotK to maintain better story arcs.<br/><br/>3. Aragorn's fall off the cliff. A little pointless, but for purposes of dreaming about Arwen, I guess it works.<br/><br/>4. A three or four page passage taking forty-five minutes in the movie: Okay, for purposes of being climactic, Peter Jackson did a similar exension for the ogre battle in Moria in Fellowship. Sure, it would take longer than the book described, and focusing on this for the film worked.<br/><br/>5. Reduced role for Frodo. After all, they cover the most significant parts. At first, I felt like they did not focus on the ring and that it played second fiddle to the human story, but I realized this was necessary to see HOW powerful the ring and Sauron's influence really was. By focusing on Helm's Deep, we realize the stakes were higher. In FotR, we understood that the ring was dangerous, but all they did was talk about it and search for it. It was buildup for the war. In TTT, we see the battle that the ring is causing in full-throttle. Frodo's reduced part was necessary, and they still got his mission and temptation across. The way he stroked the ring, and his fall into the lake because of its influence were very effective moments. So is his obsession with Gollum (after all, he sees himself, doesn't he?). At first, I'd have liked to have seen more, but now that I have considered it, they portrayed it as much as was necessary. Galadriel's monologue was also necessary to remind us just what was at stake, and that this entire battle was about the ring.<br/><br/>What I cannot forgive:<br/><br/>1. The lack of characterization in Gandalf. Where WAS he?!!?!? If I hadn't been familiar with the original story, I'd have been completely confused as to why he was now ""the White."" I can understand McKellen's (wise) choice to play the Grey and the White as two seperate characters. But I cannot forgive the emptiness of the role. How was he different? How were his powers different? How was his personality different? These ideas are never explored. He just comes in, has a few lines, and disappears. GANDALF IS LORD OF THE RINGS! Couldn't we have at least seen a little character development.<br/><br/>2. Lack of characterization for Saruman. Again, just a few lines, and he's gone. No sense of forbidding and power that he had in the first film. In fact, they could have used archive footage from the first film for his part (though the ""exorcism"" from Theodin was well-done). The scene where he watched the Ents destroy Isengard was laughable...he just stood there and looked p***ed off. At the very most, they could have developed the reltionship between he and Grima a little bit better. Which leads me to.....<br/><br/>3. Grima's character going nowhere. If Saruman was POSSESSING Theodin, why was Grima needed at all? He just uttered a few lines, looking imposing in the film's first act, and then disappeared. I understand that Peter Jackson sees the Lord of the Rings as a nine-hour movie and that we'll see more of Grima later, but he could have given us some sort of sense of completion for the purposes of waiting one more year. Though I did like that single tear fall from his eye as he beheld the army (a sly reference to his role in Exorcist III, as the film already referenced The Exorcist anyway).<br/><br/>4. Some lazy storytelling. I enjoyed the Exorcism of Theodin scene, but I had a hard time figuring out if Saruman was in his domain or if he was actually thrown out of Theodin and was with the others in the castle. There are also a number of plot holes. How could Boromir fight in the woods and get shot with arrows quickly, and yet Aragorn and Gimli could fight on the draw bridge fifty times the number of orcs that Boromir was fighting and remain unscathed? I just don't understand this. It's just lazy story telling. Some of the pacing was a bit off, too. WAY too much time was spent with Merry and Pippin with the Ents. I love the Ents as much as the next fellow, but speed us up already. By the time they're in the woods deciding whether or not to join the war, we've having enough exposition and decision making from all the other characters. I for one would have rather seen them cut to the chase.<br/><br/>What I liked:<br/><br/>Fortuntanely, I loved all the rest. The development of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas was wonderful. We get a better sense of these characters (I especially enjoyed the competition between Legolas and Gimli). Gimli served as the comic relief, but it didn't take away from the character's integrity. Aowen and Theodin were wonderful additions, as was Faramir, even though his change was controversial. Treebeard was inventive, and Gollum was the most convincing CGI character I have ever seen. The battles were epic, and every square inch of the screen is loaded with detail.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has taken a fantasy story and has filmed it like it was a historical World War II film. The realism and the stakes presented works, and most of this approach blew me away the same way an effective historical war film (""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Longest Day"") would. If Fellowship belonged to the Hobbits, Towers is the story of the humans' continuing battle, and they all must make important choices. Does Aragorn stay at Helm's Deep and fall for Aowen? Does Theodin lead his people into an attack? Does Aowen love Aragorn? Does Arwen leave with the elves or stay for Aragorn (she's a elf, but she wants to be human, after all)? Does Faramir do the duty of his position to please his father, or does he do what it right? All of these questions are strongly developed. And the payoffs are wonderful and show the power of the human spirit, much like war films.<br/><br/>I trust Peter Jackson, and I look forward to Return of the King. That said, The Two Towers was overall a step backwards from Fellowship, and I hope that Jackson does not get over confident in his ability. He had to PROVE himself with Fellowship. Lord of the Rings in arguable the greatest fantasy series ever written, and it has harbored millions of fans. There were a lot of expecations from fans. Perhaps too many. He had to prove that he could look past all of the weight of the trilogy's momentum and make a great film out of the books we all love. And he did. He brought us a masterful film which, like The Godfather, made us appreciate the original text even more and also spun the ideas in new directions. This does not give him permission to slack off with the rest of his work. Develop those characters more. Keep the pacing interesting. Don't compromise getting a film done quick and making money over quality. In other words, DON'T PULL A LUCAS!!!!<br/><br/>But I love you, Peter. And I know that Return of the King will be a satisfactory wrap-up to this wonderful series of films that you're making.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Seven out of ten, *** out of ****.<br/><br/>(Fellowship: 9.5 out of 10, **** out of ****)"

","Well, it's only happened all over again, hasn't it? I see the movie at the cinema on opening night, this time with a 12-strong personal-company force - and it blows me away. So much that when we all talk about it afterwards, everyone comments on how I seem not to have too much to say about it and that perhaps, shock - I ""didn't like it as much as I thought I would"".<br/><br/>Well, the reason is that I was computing it all - everything I had just seen, in my head. In short, I loved it and blah blah, but I realised as soon as I stood up at the end that I needed to see it again to give a truer personal reflection of it. So, just like last time, I went and saw it again the very next day. And, just like last time, it cemented my thoughts on the film and lo and behold, I can talk excitedly about it in great detail, and talk non-stop...back to my normal self, then.<br/><br/>So, the movie? Well...after viewing it once, my initial thought was....very, very brilliant, but not quite up to the first installment. Everyone else I went with (that's 11 others) said it was better than FOTR, all except for one other than myself anyway. But I'd seen FOTR so much, grown so attached to it that I doubted I could like another movie more.<br/><br/>Seeing as I honestly cannot say anything I didn't like about the movie (other than the way it leaves me wanting more is so painfully great), let us pass on to what was good about this movie, shall we?<br/><br/>Let's see....Immediate, dramatic and fiery start - very welcome and shot brilliantly. I will not go into zealous detail about the effects of this film - the whole world KNOWS they're good. Even my dead hamster knows they're good.<br/><br/>The acting was flawless, not one noticeable dipping performance. Special congrats to the actors responsible for Theoden and Gollum. Touching and frightening, in that order. Frightening as in, sheer believability rather than scary. You actually end up feeling sorry for that wretch, which is amazing given the look of him. Oh, and Miranda Otto as Eowyn positively shines.<br/><br/>The music - one of the highlights of FOTR - was again emotionally-driven and all that it should be - triumphant, sad, dramatic, moving. Faultless. And I totally love the theme of Edoras and Rohan.<br/><br/>Scenery - well, again, my dead hamster knows that this was also breath-takingly well executed and made the most of. It's beautiful. The set of Edoras on the hill (the Golden Hall) was fantastic.<br/><br/>But the real high-light of TTT for me, like many others, was the 50 minute battle of Helm's Deep. Won't go into all of that here - I'm sure you've all read it many times before this, but suffice to say, for me it stole the show and I would argue that it is the best set piece I have ever seen in the cinema. See the movie, even if you missed the first one - for this alone. Disappointed you will not be, I promise.<br/><br/>SLIGHT SPOILERS***: Brief personal favourite bits: Gandalf releasing King Theoden from Saramun's grasp and the shot where Gandalf and Eomer charge down the slope at the very end into the flank of the Orcish army to save the day - the camera work swooping over the hill and down it gave me thrills I never knew existed outside the bedroom. END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Of the party I went to the cinema with, my two best friends only came with me because I made them - they did not like FOTR. However, they both found this one far more enjoyable, largely thanks to the increase of pace and action.<br/><br/>I am going to see it again tomorrow, though whether my trips to see it at the cinema match the 9 I made for FOTR remains to be seen. Regardless of that outcome, by tomorrow evening I'll be a third of the way there.<br/><br/>And I can't wait."

","New Line Cinema's latest installment in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's `The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is a very pretty thing to look at, mostly. Those who know me, or are just seeking out `Radical Purist' views on the differences between the books and the movies need to scroll down a bit because I promised myself I would start this review from the standpoint of the filmmaking it's self.<br/><br/>The boldness of Jackson and New Line in starting the film as they do, sans any prologue or synopsis of previous events, is admirable as the brilliant, glistening white mountains we are treated to demonstrating why these films have contributed almost as much to the tourist dollars flooding into New Zealand as into AOL/Time Warner's coffers, they being the owners of New Line.<br/><br/>We are treated to a greater understanding of the closeness between the Ring Bearer and his ever stalwart Gardener, which is a blessing and goes a long way to backing up the inkling we get of their friendship and mutual respect at the end of the previous installment. Alas though the comic relief is stripped for the most part from the characters of Merry and Pippin and bestowed instead upon Gimli and Legolas, but the good natured ribbing is preferable over the constant grousing, complaint and general mumbling that pass for Gimli's lines in most of the first half of the film.<br/><br/>There is a disjointedness in Jackson's employment of `Dream Sequences' which cause a general disorientation and I felt detracted from my ability to see where the story was going and what was actually happening. Was Arwen really leaving with her father, or was this some possible future.and how did it fit into the story or move the tale along? Not since Kubrick's `The Shining', when I saw the person in the Bear costume, was I left as perplexed as to what the director was trying to say, but then it came to me later as I saw how Jackson was treating the lovely Miranda Otto's character Eowen's adoration of Aragorn. (An adoration which has little or no merit however due to the omission of several events from the book.)<br/><br/>As in watching a Puppet Show, Gollum slowly became more real to me because of my desire to believe he was a person and not merely a computer generated character. The interaction between he and the Hobbits is done quite well and is believable in the end, due in no small part to the talents of Elijah Wood and Sean Astin.<br/><br/>This lushly photographed epic is spectacular on the eyes, and many of the performances deserve a great deal of praise, but at three hours it gets tremendously bogged down in the great battle the film leads up to, it offering nothing unique from moment to moment outside of the occasional stunt or special effect. Lots of fighting, lots of things getting their heads, arms and other things cut off or impaled. In the end I give it, as a movie on its own merits, 3 out of 5 stars for being confusing in its dream sequences and long and boring in its battles. (Something I've been known to say about Kurasawa's `Ran' as well.)<br/><br/>Many of the fans of Tolkien's masterwork have decried the changes made in the story between the book and the film. They ask why these changes needed to be made and what possessed Peter Jackson to make them.<br/><br/>The question they all really need to ask is why things were left out like The Paths of the Dead, Gandalf and Co. going to Orthanc to confront Saruman and the ending with Shelob. The answer you will inevitably get is that there wasn't enough time in the three hour time slot, but then the follow up question is ""Then why did you add so much crap that had nothing to do with the story, like the cheesy dream sequences which were only there to encourage the audience to believe that there was a chance for a romance between Aragorn and Eowen, or Aragorn's near death experience...or Frodo revealing himself and the Ring to the Nazgul in Osgiliath, a place that Faramir would have as soon taken the Hobbits to as he would ""...take this thing, if it lay by the highway..."", something which the film infers quite the opposite sentiment of in the character's actions...<br/><br/>Truth to be told Mr. Jackson has, in his career, shown himself to be a master of action and gore. These are things which, in this film, were portrayed quite extensively at Helm's Deep...very extensively...in the extreme and to the detriment of the film, for the very length of the battle, the 4 months to film it and the incredible resources required to make what was shown could have been better spent actually telling the story instead of producing the only battle scene that I have personally ever struggled to stay awake through. I guess though that you cannot blame the man for sticking to that which he knows best...after all he DID win an award once for using the most fake blood in a movie scene in the film ""Brain Dead"". (A dubious award at best though for anyone who saw the theatrical rendition of Stephen King's ""The Shining""...but I digress...)<br/><br/>Thankfully they cut Arwen out of Helm's Deep, but where in the world did they come up with the ""Genesis Cave"" for the Women and Children to hide in instead of going to Harrowdale? Was it that much more important for the understanding by the audience of the story to show Osgiliath instead of the stately valley of Rohan in which the muster of Rohirrim kept safe?<br/><br/>And what of the curious decision to banish Eomer? They had to create an entire scene for this travesty for the sole purpose of the simpleminded conversation between Rohirrum and the three travelers so that they could heighten fears of Merry and Pippin's demise! Oh what tangled webs we weave, indeed!!<br/><br/>It seems that Mr. Jackson, et al, have such a low opinion of the viewing audience that he thinks it is necessary to beat them over the head with the most obvious of cheap story telling tricks in order to make them understand that which Tolkien had no problem conveying with no devaluation of the Characters or Story. While he altered events and dialog apparently to make the concepts more accessible to those who have not read the books, he presumes that the audience will accept the quite obscure concept of the Elves `.going over the sea.' at face value, making no attempt to explain what this means or indeed where they are going and why. This is confusing to me because of all the things he glazed over this is potentially the most confusing, yet it remained free of the `dumbing down' that so many other things suffered throughout the motion picture.<br/><br/>In fact if you look at the thing as a whole it becomes immediately apparent that one thing led to another in the writing of this screenplay. Every little change made, ostensibly for the sake of making the story understandable to the audience which hasn't read the books, led to one, two or more changes in the story having to be made to compensate for the lack of logic or continuity caused...<br/><br/>It seems that when Mr. Jackson states that he is making these films in ""the spirit"" of Tolkien he means that it has Elves, Dwarves and Hobbits and not much else in the way of the story, which leads me to wonder why he didn't just write his own fantasy story to film? Because he was nobody in the industry and needed the ""big name"" to push the deal. Nobody would buy an epic fantasy story by a man who's previous credits had been cheap but enjoyable horror movies and torrid black comedy, but with Tolkien's name on the project it would fly. Alas the Name is the most that has remained, and even IT was forced to be removed from the title by the estate...and here, in this film, we see more examples of how Peter Jackson is creating personal wealth on the skeletal remains of the most beloved story of the past millennium with little regard for the integrity, logic or continuity which made the original story feel more like a historical epic then a mythology for England, while all the while claiming that he wanted the movies to feel like Historical works rather then Fantasy.<br/><br/>New Zealand should produce a coin in honor of their Cinematic Son, Peter Jackson, and it should have a face on each side..."
"kevinm-4","Null","0","0","19 December 2002"," Wow!
","Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, ""THAT was three hours!""<br/><br/>I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made ""right."" After squirming through sludge that was the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" movie and ""Willow,"" or seeing a fantasy like ""Conan the Barbarian"" turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.<br/><br/>I hope ""Lord of the Rings"" opens up this new genre to other ""realistic"" attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is ""Willow"" or ""Dungeons and Dragons"" or ""Legend."" I hope to see the ""Dragonlance"" Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' ""Shanara"" series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.<br/><br/>At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on ""The Hobbit"" when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...<br/><br/>And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the ""Tolken geeks"" who are screaming at the ""diversions"" Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made ""authentically,"" hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of ""Two Towers"" instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)<br/><br/>Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many ""Tolkien geeks"" on this board and ask them how they would feel if ""normal"" Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, ""okey dokey!"" A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?<br/><br/>I recommend to every ""Tolkien geek"" who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.<br/><br/>This movie is a 10."

","Truly, it was one of the best movies in a long while.  I enjoyed it immensely.  The battle scenes were quite lengthy and full of many interesting stunts. But the movie was not faithful to the book.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything so I'll stick with little things:like the incident at Entmoot (gathering of Ents) where they decided *not* to go to war - and then did so only once Treebeard had seen the destruction of his people.  I don't mind inconsistencies but couldn't they be at least NECESSARY fabrications?<br/><br/>Anyway, in my mind the dialogue was a bit...melodramatic - for instance: Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn are running in pursuit of Merry and Pippin and then every so often they stop and blurt out a line (or Legolas eyes the horizon in his 'elfish' way) and then resume their breakneck pace.<br/><br/>So what I'm really saying is: See the movie! By itself I give it 9/10 or so but what you need to know is that when compared with the books it probably won't hold up (especially if you demand perfection)<br/><br/>Alone: 9/10 With Book:4/10"

If TTT was any good, I was going to naturally enjoy myself. But it remained to be seen- would I be blown away by this film as I was when I first saw FotR?<br/><br/>I most definitely was.<br/><br/>The opening scene was unbelievable. As my jaw hit the floor, I knew I was about to witness cinematic greatness. As the movie plunged ahead, I was enthralled but I mourned each passing moment that brought me that much closer to the end. There are so many wonderful moments in this film that are burned into my memory forever such as the excorcism of Theoden, Arwen at Aragorn's grave, the ride of the Rohirrim, the Black Gate and Frodo's elven cloak, the whole Battle of Helm's Deep and I could go on and on. This is more than a movie to me. It is already a dear friend.<br/><br/>You may be thinking I'm a total fan-boy and you are right. I am a fan. No apologies. I am biased. I have no idea how it comes of the screen for those who have not read the books as much as I have. All I know is that this movie was just nominated for a Golden Globe and rightfully so.

","Is ""The Two Towers"" better than ""The Fellowship Of The Ring""? That's rather an unfair question. I went to see the film hoping that it would be 'as excellent as' the first part of the trilogy and I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>After a fairly slow start (though with some awesome sweeps across New Zealand's unspoilt landscapes) we spend the next few hours switching between Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (as they race to rescue Pippin and Merry) and Frodo and Sam (as they race towards Mount Doom to dispose of the Ring). The culmination of the film is a breathtaking battle at Helm's Deep with Men and Elves pitted against the full might of Saruman.<br/><br/>The main characters are fleshed out in this film (Frodo and Sam in particular) and Gimli provides some welcome comic relief during the final battle sequence (which I think is rather too gruesome for the 12A rating the film's been given in the UK).<br/><br/>You could run out of superlatives simply describing the action sequences, the sets and the CGI work, before you even come to what I consider as the scene-stealer of the film which really puts the ""wow!"" into the ""the wow factor"". Much has been said of the character Gollum/Smeagol, but nothing prepares you for his first appearance - if this is what the next generation of CGI looks like, then actors beware! Andy Serkis (who voiced and provided the motion-capture for the character) and Wega Digital are to be congratulated for creating a character that can have you reduced to tears (as, I have to admit, it did me). If they don't win an Oscar for this, then there is no justice.<br/><br/>Much has also been said of the Ents. They're not as bad as I was expecting them to be and to be honest, you can't make walking, talking trees look anything other than rather stupid, no matter what budget you have at your disposal.<br/><br/>The only real fault with the film (and a similar fault with ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" before the extended version was released on DVD) is that it's rather scrappily edited. There are times when you question how something suddenly occured and the sudden jumps between scenes become rather headache-inducing. This film is crying out for a cohesive director's cut (and hopefully this will be with us within the year).<br/><br/>Overall a brilliant film. If you enjoyed the first part of ""The Lord Of The Rings"", you'll definitely enjoy the second. Roll on next year and ""The Return Of The King""!<br/><br/>Film - 9/10 Gollum/Smeagol - 10/10"

","It seems that although many viewers found faults in the movie (especially, viewers who read the book) nobody can seem to agree what was good and what was bad.<br/><br/>I guess that this should be expected from a book that tells three stories, The story of  Sam & Frodo, The story of Merry & Pippin, and the story of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli. Everybody has their favorite parts, and this is shown by what people love or hate about the movie.<br/><br/>While most people seemed to dislike the Ents (which has been a heated topic long before the movies were made )I liked them.

In the movie, Legolas is portrayed as an ultimate fighter and Gimli a bumbling buffoon.<br/><br/>Throughout the three books, the story of Gimli's and Legolas' relationship is one of growing respect and friendship between two races who despise what the other represents. Although their methods are drastically different they are both equally efficient fighters, which they grow to realize in the novels. This I feel has yet to happen in the movie.<br/><br/>This story was probably what stood out for me most in the novels, which is why I feel it missing more than most do. I guess this is the same with other parts in the movie for other viewers.<br/><br/>Throughout this movie, and the last, I found that my only serious complaint was that I felt that they could have given us more.

Though of course the setting, plot, and characters are the same, there is little similarity between the films.  There is no replication of the movements of the first film like most sequels because this is the same story..  We've had our (unrequested) one year intermission and now the first movie is finally continuing, placing us in the middle of freytag's (sp) pyramid.  The action is rising without any cause for such things as an introduction.. exactly as it should be.  Hardcore book fans (such as myself) will see many departures from the book, Jackson was not quite as good about following this one to the letter, but as a whole the movie was such a great work that those blasphemies can be forgiven: I've seen it twice and I'm going back tomorrow. They may have made changes but they didn't make any mistakes.  SEE THIS MOVIE AT ANY AND ALL COSTS!

In this second chapter, we follow three parallel stories: Frodo and Sam's attempts to enter Mordor, Pippin and Merry's capture by the Orcs and Aragorn's fight to save the Human Race. The pace is much faster than the first chapter with much more emphasis on action than on character development (as opposed to the first chapter). The special effects are stupendous although in certain segments, I found them to be a little too apparent -- not enough to be distracting however. I find Frodo and Sam to be a little one-dimensional as characters but the detail put into Gollum's character more than compensate for that. No other CGI creature comes close to what Jackson and his team has done in this movie. This movie rates a solid 9.5 for me... wait, I can't do that... Well, 10 it is!<br/><br/>L"
"stewate4","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," Excellent Film
","Generally an excellent film, which, taken as such provides an well paced continuation of the story, whilst at the same time sticking moderately closely to the original book.  Personally I can live with most of the changes that Peter Jackson has made, which given the limitations of time inevitable within a film are probably necessary.  However I'm not too keen on what he has done to Elrond.  In both films he comes across as almost contemptuous of the race of man, and in the new one seems to be emotionally bullying Arwen to give up Aragorn and join an escape of the elves to the far west, leaving middle earth to its fate.  As someone who has read the books this is rather jarring as there he is only half an elf himself (his full title is Elrond Halfelven), where his father was the man Earendil, whilst his mother was the elf Elwing, and Aragorn was himself a direct descendant of his brother Elros.  Also in the books the elves love middle earth and Elrond and Galadriel only leave it after the destruction of Saurons ring, and the power of their own rings in destroyed.  On the other hand as an adaptation where these back-story elements are not mentioned I suppose it could be justified, and maybe Peter Jackson's Elrond doesn't have this heritage.  Still, I think it's rather a pity.<br/><br/>Rather more serious IMHO is the changes to the story of Frodo and Faramir.<br/><br/>
Spoilers Ahead!!<br/><br/>
In the film they have been dragged off to the city of Osgiliath, which is under siege, and where, according to the words of one of the Gondorian soldiers, the east bank has fallen.  This implies that Frodo Sam, Gollum and Faramir are on the west bank. This alteration, as well as considerably diminishing Faramirs nobility, as other reviewers have noted, also raises the problem that, when he belatedly realises it would be a bad move to take the ring to his father in Minas Tirith and releases them, where does he release them to?  If he leaves them on west bank they will have to find their way back across the river, which is where Mordor is and they want to get to, and as they don't have a boat, and the only bridges are in Osgiliath where they are controlled by the enemy this may be difficult.  Also this last point makes releasing them on the east bank any more difficult as well. Tolkien did meticulous work on planning out where all his characters were at any one time in the book, and how they could get to where they were going to, and I think they should have kept with him a bit more here.  Perhaps any extended DVD may clear this up, but as it stands it is rather puzzling what Peter Jackson thought he was doing here, apart from showing some, admittedly very good, footage of the battle for the bridges at Osgiliath and attacks by Nazguls on their flying 'fell beasts', (very well done here).<br/><br/>Having said all this, this is still an excellent film, which I will almost certainly see again, as well as buying the subsequent DVD's when they come out.  The first film also had its inconsistencies as well, notably why Gimli wanted to go to Moria to see Balin, with his 'roaring fires' etc, whilst everyone else knew it wasn't going to be a very dangerous place indeed, and the timing of the Nazguls turning up in the Shire at the start of the film whilst Gandalf was in Minas Tirith searching through its library, and then Gandalf beating them to Bag End (how??). The battle at Helms Deep, as almost everyone else has said, is stupendously well done, and poor old Gollum is really brought to life here. Other high points are Theodens city of Meduseld, with a fully realised Golden Hall, beautifully done here, Gandalfs showdown with the Balrog right at the start of the film, and even if the fight with the Wargs wasn't in the book, I thought that was very well done as well.<br/><br/>Generally I'm not too bothered by the licences film directors take with their source material, as I still read the books and I can always run much better versions in my own imagination.  One of my favorite films is the 1950's version of 'Great Expectations', which takes much greater liberties with Dickens than Peter Jackson has done here, and as someone else in these reviews has pointed out, people don't take Prokofiev to task for the liberties he took with Romeo and Juliet for his Ballet.  Even with my quibbles above, it succeeds so well in other places I'll still give it a 10."

","The middle part of any trilogy is always difficult, as most of the narrative takes place, without the excitement and freshness of a new story, nor the thrill and anticipation of the climax. In light of this Peter Jackson does a magnificent job of managing to exceed the brilliance of Fellowship of the Ring. The story is told at a breathtaking pace, without straying to far from the tough guidelines that the books impose, while the visual splendour of some the scenes is something to behold.<br/><br/>I found it strange that (if you read the six volume set of LotR)the last two chapters of both The Treason of Isengard and The Ring Goes East, were left out. I imagine that it must have been for time constraints and that they'll be included in Return of the King. I was looking forward to the fight with Shelob, but now that's something I (hopefully) can anticipate for RotK."

"Shiva-11","Null","0","0","20 December 2002"," Jackson defeats the bane of the blockbuster
","Beware what you  wish for.  Words I'm sure Peter Jackson has reflected on many a time in the past two and a half years.  After finding a studio to back his dream to bring The Lord of The Rings to the screen, Jackson spent 18 months and a quarter billion dollars to create his vision. Lurking in the back of his mind must have been the realization that the failure of the first chapter would have meant the possible ruination of a studio and the knowledge that the remaining two chapters would sit in the can, never to see the light of day. Luckily for Jackson, The Fellowship of the Ring went on to earn over $800 million dollars and unanimous accolades from fans and critics alike.  Now all he has to do is repeat this success two more times.<br/><br/>With the fellowship dissolved, things are indeed looking grim.   Frodo and Sam have set out for Mount Doom, and must rely on Gollum, the devolved, delusional, former owner of the ring, to guide them. Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli, meet new allies to their cause and rediscover lost friends, but the joyful  reunion is short-lived when they learn that Saruman has dispatched his minions to destroy the stronghold at Helm's Deep, the first assault in the all out battle for Middle Earth.<br/><br/>Anyone expecting the contemplative, leisurely pacing of  `The Fellowship Of The Ring' with it's in-depth character development, and ethereal venues will be shocked -  action is the watchword for `The Two Towers'.  Jackson wastes no time with the obligatory drawn out flashbacks, opting to jump straight into the fray, and notches up the adrenaline quotient in the process.  The editing is quick, and deliberate, the settings dark and oppressive, and battles are many.<br/><br/>Once again the cast turn in solid performances.  Just as Viggo Mortenson imbues Aragorn with a regal charisma that shines through his bedraggled appearance, Ian McKellen's reinforces Gandalf's evolution, commanding your attention whenever he is onscreen. I especially enjoyed Gimli's role as comic foil -  quick with his axe or a zippy zinger - he adds the only real humor to the proceedings.  Elijah Wood is the standout once again, demonstrating an  even a wider range of emotions and ability.  I must admit that I feel sorry for him - he has managed to do such an outstanding job as Frodo that he is going to be typecast for eternity (not that there are many roles for hobbits in other films.)  I would be remiss if I failed to mention Brad Dourif who exudes putrescence as the diabolically reptilian Grima Wormtongue - I kept waiting for his forked tongue to peek out when he was speaking. There are two additional new characters of note.<br/><br/>I was unsure how Jackson et al. were going to flesh out Treebeard, the leader of the Ents -  I had no difficulty imagining how he should look while reading the book, but didn't know how they would bring him to the screen. I needn't have worried - the CGI work is smooth, natural and avoids being cartoonish (some of the other Ents do not fare as well). And then of course there is Gollum.<br/><br/>Arguably the most important character in the novel - nothing could have transpired without him - it was essential that he be properly rendered (with regards to appearance that is).  Rather than talk to a ball on a stick (a favorite prop when dealing with CGI characters), Jackson had Andy Serkis, the actor who delivers Gollum's lines, wear a motion capture suit while he acted his scenes with Wood.  The digital wizards at Weta works then turned to custom designed software to create the final screen character.  The results are exceptional - Gollum's expressions, movements, and speech are fluid and realistic.  On to the action.<br/><br/>While editing the initial footage that had been shot for the Helm's Deep sequence, Jackson decided that they did not impart the spectacle that he intended, so he gathered cast and crew together and went back to New Zealand to shoot additional footage.  His instincts proved right.  The final product - a combination of live footage and CGI (driven by MASSIVE, his special effects department's customized AI software, which allows the characters to `think' and `act' independently) blend seamlessly.  The entire sequence is superbly scored and further enhanced by the sound effects - a cacophony of thunderous chanting, metal on metal, and screams of agony and victory - plunging the audience into the midst of epic orgy of destruction. Phenomenal.<br/><br/>I do have a few caveats however.<br/><br/>I'll start with my pet peeve,  the 360 pan shot (where the camera spins around the characters).  Whether showcasing vistas or highlighting dramatic moments, this can be a highly effective technique - when used sparingly. But when it gets used at least a dozen times in the first twenty minutes of the film, I say enough already (I was starting to feel a tad queasy). `Two Towers' is definitely not a standalone film - those not familiar with the books (or even the first film), are bound to miss not so subtle references and risk being left out altogether in other scenes. This was evident from the several people, including the friend that I took to the screening, who kept turning to companions for explanations.  Also, the battles between Gollum's dual personalities (Slinker and Stinker as Sam Gamgee calls them) are too frequent - the intended dramatic moments become almost slapstick, diminishing their intended effect.  One of two `battles' would have sufficed. The Tolkien purists however are sure to cry the loudest.<br/><br/>Jackson takes more substantial liberties with the source material than he did in his first outing.  And we're not just talking about incorporating appendix material here (the Aragon/Arwen debate) -  there are several fundamental changes.  While these do not detract from the story - indeed some actually enhance the story (it is after all a screen adaptation), it took me awhile to get used to them.  Stay out of any LOTR chat rooms for the next few months.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Jackson has produced an apt `sequel' to the first film, which is engaging, enjoyable and exciting and he deserves to be lauded for his efforts.  But I'll bet even money that he gets stood up again come Oscar time."

"erikdeb","8","0","0","20 December 2002"," I would like to ask Peter Jackson... WHY????????? (Spoilers ahead!!)
","I have just seen ""THE TWO TOWERS"". A movie which I was expecting intensely all year. I was thrilled and excited whilst the movie began.<br/><br/>In this review I will not outline the story/plot which I think are present in most reviews. But I will show my expectations before the movie (probably the expectations of all those, who like me, read the book) and my reactions afterwards. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD so if you haven't read the book or seen the movie you should stop reading now.<br/><br/>Having read the book I had a list of things which I wanted to see.<br/><br/>Gollum, Treebeard and the Ents attacking Isengard, The Battle of Helm's Deep and SHELOB..<br/><br/>ALL of these lived up to my expectations. GOLLUM is the most impressive CGI character on movie history so far. He is so well integrated with the scenes and characters that you feel he is real. The part were he is in conflict with himself showing his evil and calm side is BRILLIANT and my favorite part of the movie. We can safely say that GOLLUM makes both DOBBY (Harry Potter) and YODA (Star Wars II) look like TOY STORY CHARACTERS!! The ENTS were also very good, even tough that some parts when Merry and Pippin were on Treebeard looked rather ackward. Their attack on Isengard was as I expected it showing the wrath and great strength of the ents against the tower of Orthanc. The Battle of Helm's Deep... well what can I say, it is quite incredible. Thousands of characters fighting each other in one of the most intense battle sequences I have ever seen.<br/><br/>THE TWO TOWERS is in scale probably even more grand than THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING. So why ruin it MR Jackson??? WHY???<br/><br/>During the last 30 minutes I was disappointed to the point of crying. Jackson took the two towers and ripped it apart like it was a cheap magazine! I can accept that he gives more importance to Arwen (Liv Tyler) as Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) love interest even tough she is barely mentioned in the lord of the rings books (i must remind you than an elf named GLORFINDEL took Frodo to Rivindell and not Arwen... but still.. whatever). I can accept that Eomer was not part of the battle of Helm's Deep but came afterwards with Gandalf. I can even accept that Gimli was turned into a clown to give us some comic relief during the intense battle sequences.<br/><br/>
And of course I can accept that that the ""SHELOB part"", ""the Saruman Vs Gandalf part"" and ""the PIPPIN let me take a look at the Palantir part"" were omitted from the movie since I expect them to be in ""THE RETURN OF THE KING""<br/><br/>But why were Frodo, Sam and Gollum taken to Gondor by Faramir and his men? Why Frodo had that encounter with the Nazgul? Why was he going to kill Samwise? None of these are present in the book, and to my eyes the whole part of Frodo and co taken to Gondor was useless to the movie since they were afterwards released. It only added a couple of minutes to an already long and tiring movie.  I tried to understand the point of it but couldn't find any reason. Maybe it's all planned. Maybe it will all be explained in ""The Return of the King"" next year and maybe it was just an hour of madness by Jackson.<br/><br/>I can say that the last part completely ruined all that was good from ""the fellowship"" and the first two hours and a half of the ""two towers"". Probably I am a too much a fan of the book to understand that this is still one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movie ever conceived both in scale and conception. And probably no movie will ever match the greatness of a book and the experience of reading it.<br/><br/>BUT STILL I WAS HURT AND DISAPPOINTED.. I wonder what Tolkien would say...<br/><br/>10 out of 10 during almost all the movie..<br/><br/>The last part takes down my rating to 7."

","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** The film is amazing. The special effects and action scenes are breathtaking. The computer generated Gollum steals the show - eligible for an oscar? This is certainly a cinematic triumph. But I was increasingly asking myself which book it was about. I confess to being an Lord Of the Rings fan and have read the books several times over the last 30 years. The storyline wasn't merely adapted for effect but completely re-written in places.<br/><br/>
In the book Treebeard is thoughtful and wise. The Ents are stirred into action against Saruman. Here he comes over comes as reluctant to fight and only goes to war when Pippin tricks him. Would the real Treebeard be tricked by anyone let alone a Hobbit.<br/><br/>The book contrasts Faramir with Boromir. He is not like his brother. He sees the danger of using the ring against the evil one. In the film he is just the same as Boromir and only agrees to help Frodo after Sam's speech. Since when did Frodo come face to face with a Nazgul within spitting distance of Mordor? (Isn't it supposed to be a secret? Wouldn't Sauron's faithful servant tell him?)Since when did an army of elves turn up at Helm's deep and all apparently die. Since when did Eomer come to the rescue. And so it goes on.<br/><br/>I agree that there has to be some adaptation of the book to translate it from page to screen. But Peter Jackson seems to have simply changed too much. Was Tolkein's version not good enough. Why film it then?"

","The massive scale and immense battles in the Two Towers eclipse anything else you will see in modern cinema.  Certain frames are truly overwhelming in scope, yet the ironic trend is that the battle scenes come across as slightly underwhelming and anti-climactic; due to some less than ideal editing and jumping between disparate plot-arcs.<br/><br/>Also, excluding the superb realisation of Gollum, characterisation does not match that achieved in Fellowship, which -- just as the novel does -- has a more cohesive narrative."

If you want to see a beautifully put-together fantasy film with kick-ass special efx, grand battle scenes, and cute elves then yes, DEFINITELY go see it. I admit I enjoyed this movie, I would even blow $7 to see it again. But as a Tolkien fan, I hatesssss it preciousss! Nasssty Jackssssonsss! Almost nothing happens as it is written in the book; and while I can forgive taking poetic license to create movie thrills, I think it could have been done without completely losing 90% of the original plot! The entmoot and the ents attack on Isengard could have been yet another sweeping battle scene, had they decided to spend more time on the ents and less on Arwen and Elrond. While I have no problem with the scenes involving the elves and Aragorn, they belonged in the next movie, not Two Towers. It would have been a better bet to include Shelob. I also hate the idea of the elves running like scared sheep to the grey havens which they do NOT do before the end of the war. Another peeve is the character of Faramir. A noble, complicated character in the book, he's portrayed as a bullying jerk in the movie. If Jackson was going for the frodo-centric approach why didn't he develop Faramir's admiration for the ring-bearer? I was disappointed with the treatment of Legolas and Gimli's friendship. Legolas delivers one-liners for Aragorn, and Gimli is the comic relief. (give the dwarf some respect!) And where is Eomer? Sure, they have him show up with Gandalf to save the day, but he should be there with Aragorn in the last ditch stand to save the Deep. And why are there Elves fighting at Helm's Deep? This battle is for the glory of Rohan. The pointy-ears don't belong there, stealing the show! Would it have been so hard to have Gandalf return with Erkenbrand as he should? The final bit of aggravating nonsense is Theoden being possessed by Saruman. What gives? I expected pea soup, and his head to start spinning at any moment. The redeeming factor in all this was Gollum. His schizophrenic ring-addiction is captured beautifully! You don't know whether to laugh or cry, rather like Gollum himself. He deserves an Oscar! The bottom line is that Jackson, like all filmmakers, made this movie to sell tickets to movie audiences. He didn't make it for Tolkien fans. That said, it's worth the time and popcorn, but don't hope for anything as faithfully done as Fellowship. This is a great fantasy movie that just happens to use Tolkien characters and is set in middle earth. Is it The Two Towers? No, alas, that it is not."

I swear the major battle at the conclusion of the movie takes up its final hour. Not that I'm complaining, but I missed the social interactions and sub-plots of ""Fellowship"". The highlight of ""The Two Towers"" is the arrival of Gollum, seen only for a brief second in ""Fellowship"".  This CGI guy steals the movie. And I have to feel some sympathy for the hapless Orcs, whose only purpose seems to be to die horrible deaths at the hands of anything that can fog a mirror.

","Absolutely outstanding!<br/><br/>When people ask me about this movie, one thing that crops up in 9 out of 10 conversations is the question `Is the movie true to the book?' <br/><br/>
To me this is an unfair question. <br/><br/>If you had asked Peter Jackson to make a movie that was beyond all doubt true' to the book, you would have a sequence of 9 hour movies instead of 3 hour movies. Also, the movies would be disjointed, dull and unwatchable. Why, you ask? Because movies require a unique combination of flow and pace that books are not constrained to, and transferring a story to film without adapting it for the job would be a big mistake. Book and film are not compatible media. What I often say is that the movie is true to the SPIRIT of the book. I get the same feeling watching the film that I got when I'd sit up late at night, reading under lamp-light because I could not tear myself away from the story. The characters on screen look to me as though secret agents from Weta Workshops mind reading department have tiptoed in to my bedroom at night and plucked the images from my mind  and I'm not the only person who says that  all the hardcore Tolkien fans I have shared this thought with have agreed with great enthusiasm. <br/><br/>After watching this film, I feel justified in my past comments that PJ is a genius. I have been a fan since he produced the cult classic BAD TASTE in 1987, an alien/zombie movie that relied on vision and talent as opposed to a big budget or any real kind of budget at all, to be honest. The movie was improvised from start to finish (that's right, made up as they went along), and only received any kind of funding (beyond that which came from PJ's own pocket) just before its completion.<br/><br/>Jackson is a creative genius, and deserves every word of praise he gets. No other person could translate the greatest fiction ever written in to the greatest film ever made the way he has.

Great action, great background (both computer generated and real life), great acting, and gullum was just unreal. Even the part with the live trees was OK, I never thought they would be able to pull that off. All in all it was just great fun. This is not a movie for real young children.

","All right, it deviates with the book, but it's not as bad as some people apparently think.  My only problem is that the people who made this film seem to want to emphasize that men are weak and stupid, and I think Faramir and Theoden suffer unfairly in their characterizations for it.  That aside, I found this adaptation just swell.  Really, that's all I have to say about the film itself.<br/><br/>I wasn't going to review this film, but I read something saying two things that show less knowledge of the book than the writer apparently believes to be in possession of.<br/><br/>1.  Return of the King is the longest book of the series. It has 544 pages if you count all of them.  The appendices and index at the back of that volume, though, amount to about 144 pages, and the story portion of The Return of the King comes in at more like 400 pages.  It's actually a lot shorter then The Fellowship of the Ring, which clocks in at 527 pages.  I also don't mind leaving the business of Shelob, and Gandalf's confrontation of Saruman at Orthanc to the beginning of the next film.  After thinking about it a little, perhaps keeping them in The Two Towers would have been somewhat anti-climactic.  Leaving those bits until the next film, however, will not expand its length over much.  It may even balance out the timing a little.  We'll see.<br/><br/>2.  The business about the love of Arwen and Aragorn is nowhere in the book. Check out appendix A from the abovementioned sections.  It's all there. It's just that Tolkien places it happening before all the business of this story gets started.  I suppose it could have been handled in flashback, but that might have been intrusive.  That's a judgment call, and Jackson's choice didn't bother me.<br/><br/>In fact, there are numerous references to the appendices, as well as occasional nods at The Silmarillion, throughout both films, and I expect the third will have many more.  Don't assume the filmmakers made them up unless you've read those sections.  There are deviations from the book, but they are no worse in this film than the first.  If they bothered you overmuch in the first film, then you probably want to avoid the second.

","Granted this movie strayed from the book, but Tolkien had some boring spots in all 3 books.  I could have done without the dogs of war, but, what a great play on words. This movie moved me and amused me and was the subject of discussion for 3 hours after.  It did what all great movies do, entertain.  You felt like you were there, in the great hall, in the fortress, great sets, writing and acting.  The stunts and extras did an amazing job of carrying on.  Some of the special effects were a little lame, but I can let that ride.  What would have been nice is a break in the middle.  I'm too old to go that long with out a trip to the bathroom.

","There were tremendous moments in this film.  There were scenes that made your hair stand on end and take your breath away.  But then there were sections where I started staring at the walls and ceiling.  It seemed to me that the areas where Jackson strayed the most from the book were the sections that were the least entertaining and the most jerky.  Also, some of Jackson's changes where very non-original going to over used ""hero over the cliff, thought lost, but wait.""   Of course things must be rearranged to fit a movie, but many were just done poorly giving a very jerky and inconsistent feel to the movie.<br/><br/>Despite all its flaws, this is still a better movie than most.  The highs still overcome its lows."
"HarryWarden","10","0","0","21 December 2002"," Even better than the book! Jackson triumphs!
","While I'm a huge fan of the novels (I won't dispute that it's among the best literary works), Tolken DOES possess flaws...flaws that I think Peter Jackson is correcting with the movie trilogy. ""The Two Towers"" was always my least favorite book, mainly because it all feels like setup to what happens in ""Return of the King"" and was a little too quiet after ""Fellowship."" However, Jackson's film not only tops last year's ""Fellowship"" movie, he also improves on the book!<br/><br/>People fail to realize that if you filmed the books page by page, the movies would be a total mess. The stories are divided up in a way that doesn't pay attention to structure...something three feature-length films hinge on. What if ""Fellowship"" had just ended when they got out of their boats? Not only do the new scenes add more meat to the characters and story, it also tops the scope of the first movie and gives each running storyline a fullfilling climax. <br/><br/>These films are the perfect adaptations of the novels. Jackson has taken the most difficult and complex translation in film history and made it into a masterpiece of story and beauty that we will probably never see the likes of again.   <br/><br/>Also, all the harsh criticisms I see here seem to be made by people who don't have the slightest clue about filmmaking. People like ""Grrr from England"" are just literary snobs who don't deserve to have an opinion, because their complaints are silly and ungrounded."

","This time, there's less J.R.R. Tolkien and more Peter Jackson--and that's a good thing. While still hewing close to the storyline in this second installment of the `Lord Of The Rings' trilogy, Jackson emphasizes character development over Tolkien's obsessions with myth and language and the results are far more evocative and immediate than the same events in the book. Jackson seems stubbornly determined to make a movie and not a mere representation of the novel, and as a result, there are liberties taken with the narrative (the book's fans will occasionally be disoriented but will adjust) that are used to open up not only the cinematic possibilities but to provide credible character motivations that Tolkien could not or would not provide. (Minor characters dismissed simplistically in the book such as Wormtongue, well-played by Brad Dourif, here help give emotion to the story and move the tale along in a convincing fashion.) The film, which follows three separate plot threads, is almost all cliffhangers and non-stop action (culminating in the enormous battle at Helm's Deep, which essentially comprises the final third of the film) and you're left with the delighted impression that Jackson's inspiration stems from serials and swashbucklers of the thirties as well as Cecil B. DeMille's `The Ten Commandments'. Overall, there's less balance than `The Fellowship Of The Ring'--this is out of Jackson's control as the ruggedness of the terrain dictates the plot--and it's relentlessly dark; but Andrew Lesnie's fluid camera once again captures the majesty of Jackson's larger-than-life vision and Grant Major's production design situates wooden-hut villages and stone fortresses in perfect harmony with the mountainsides that figure so prominently. Enormously satisfying, this is another superb complement--without being an imitation--to Tolkien's work and an outright cinematic triumph in its own right."

","It's inevitable that this trilogy will be compared to the Star Wars movies, particularly Ep 2, for both the grand scale of the movies, and that both directors are overweight guys with beards who like flannel.  First off, the visuals in Towers were absolutely incredible, much more believable than Clones.  Peter Jackson was much more willing to use the real world as a back drop, instead of doing every little detail digitally, the results of which are celluloid proof that the real world is still much better looking on screen than a completely digital world.  The Helms Deep battle is one of the greatest battle scenes ever to be put on screen, the scale of which can only be appreciated by watching the film, and is also miles ahead of the battle at the end of Clones (which, while very good, was the highpoint of an otherwise mediocre movie).  The final 45 min to an hour of Towers are just astonishing.  Gollum is the most realistic CG figure I've ever seen, far better looking than his twin brothers Dobby and Yoda.  I'm guessing the fact that the colors are drained from most of the scenes he's in makes the CGI blend better with the real world actors and scene.  The problem I found in Clones was that some of the scenes that were too bright, and saturated with color which made Yoda look fake.  The Gollum character is also much more fascinating and deeper than the midget Jedi.  The storyline, while not as clear as the first installment, was terrific.  Some of the details get lost on someone who's not familiar with the source material, whether it's true to it or not, and will require additional viewings to completely understand. I didn't particularly care for the Merry/Pippen story until the end, but I understand its importance.  The side love story between Aragorn and Arwen is much more moving than that load of garbage in Clones.  The acting in Towers is also far superior, (With all due respect to Natalie Portman, I cringe during points of her performance) which is the result of superior casting and a better script and storyline.  So far this trilogy has captured the magic of the original Star Wars films, and should be a reminder to everyone at Lucasfilm how movies of this magnitude should be made, and that attention to the detail of the visuals should never come at the expense of neglecting the storyline."

","Dear Gang,<br/><br/>Last night I was lucky enough to attend a preview screening of 'The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers' and I thought I would express my thoughts on the film.<br/><br/>The word phenomenal doesn't do it justice.<br/><br/>Without going into too much plot details I will discuss the visceral experience. From the instance the lights go down we are greeted with a gorgeous pan shot of the Middle Earth Highlands and from there we pick up where 'Fellowship' left off. This is an EPIC in every sense of the word. Every shot has been labouriously crafted to Ooze of another world, from the kinetic movements of the action sequences to the steady dolly shots of the grand landscapes of this Middle Earth, Jackson and his team have remained totally devoted to preserving the majesty and fantasy of their source.<br/><br/>It is an escapist's utopia, the seemlessness of merging digital effects with live action and mechanical effects has been mastered here in 'The Two Towers'. And this is where LOTR succeeds. Jackson has meticulously staged his battle sequences to blend the digital with the mechanical to such an effect that the true use of digital effects has finally been wholly realised - to support the story and not to support the film... And it is done to eyepopping synchronicity and impact. Nowhere is this more shown than in the character of Gollum. A completely CGI character in the film, performed by Andy Serkis, this is the first film that I have viewed, and my colleagues agree, that you feel connected to a completely digitally realised persona. Through the developments of this character we see how CGI can be used to enhance the cinema experience - not cheapen it (re: Star Wars Episode II, Spiderman). At no point does any effect in this film come across as cartoonish which shows another win for the creative team at Wingnut, by proving that the love of the characters is tantamount. And the love of the characters & detail to their environment is handled with such care for the original text that you feel the passion that the film makers have for it. LOTR is a story of characters and this is the ultimate engine of the films. 'The Two Towers' drives these characters forth, and, as with any great second act, momentum picks up & the characters bonds to one another are accentuated with subtle acknowledgements rather than overt blatancy (a common misgiving in American product). And with these subtleties come endearment to the audience. All of the principle performers are accomplished and do not serve as a distraction to the amazing backdrops that adorn the film. The end result is an Epic in every true sense of the word. You leave feeling full and dazzled, yearning to see it again and knowing that even though you've seen it once you haven't seen it all. This is a WINNER, don't walk to see it - RUN RUN RUN!!!!"

","I loved The Fellowship movie and was eagerly anticipating The Two Towers, I own the DVD Collector's Edition.  Differences between The Fellowship book and film I felt were minor and were understandable given time constraints, and allowing for creative expression of the director.  I would not have been bothered by even more deviation from the book in the second movie, but it was excessive in my opinion.  Some of the deviations were  so extensive that characters made fundamentally different decisions in the movie than were made in the book. (Brand new scenes that were not in the book did not enhance the movie, so why bother?  Some new scenes detracted heavily from the storyline because of the fundamental change required of the character(s).)  I don't know why Peter Jackson felt he needed to make these changes unless he felt his vision made a better movie than literally following the book.  However, I feel the changes he made detracted from rather than added to the movie.  My son, aged 18, leaned over at one point and said ""did they go there in the book?"", and my answer was ""no, and it is wrecking the movie!"".  After the movie the 5 of us discussed the movie and we all felt it was not nearly as good a movie as The Fellowship even though we all expected it to be even better given the major action sequences we expected.  I am pretty tolerant of a movie being different from a book, but this was the closest I ever came to walking out of a movie.  I have never been this disappointed in a movie, but that is probably partly due to my high level of anticipation.  I sincerely hope the 3rd film is either closer to the book, or at least remains true to the personalities of the characters.  (What a GREAT opening sequence ! )"

","Tonight I saw the Two Towers and was disappointed.  Although the movie was visually stunning including the special effects of both Gollum and the Ents I was very disappointed at the plot changes that were in place.  I can understand not putting something in because of its difficulty to film and other thing are needed to add to explain the film better completly changing the plot in points just to add action and cool special effects is unacceptable in my book.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson did not have to prove what he can do with special effects by adding a battle scene with orcs on wargs because he did an excelent job with Gollum and the Ents.  There were times when I could have sworn that Gollum was a live actor.  And he did not need to add more action scenes because the Battle of Helm Deep was more then most action movies have in the whole movie.<br/><br/>By adding these extra scenes he cut things from the book that I feel were very important in the story.  We see Gollum being hurt by the rope that Froddo and Sam tied him up with but we do not know why.  If you read the book you know that it is because the rope was made by elves and the purity of it burns the evil in Gollum.  This does not really matter but later when you see Gollum tied up again with regular rope he is not screaming and kicking about and peacefully going about his buisness.<br/><br/>I guess what upset me the most is that they moved this movie from being one about a story and moved it to being more of an action film and saying that the story does not really matter.  But then again what do I really know."
"Hanichi","9","0","0","19 December 2002"," Did he really change the story?
","Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.<br/><br/>First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life.  My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.<br/><br/>Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film.  It is not perfect, but it is really good.<br/><br/>Now to the meat of my comments.  Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film.  And there are a fair number of them.  The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be ""Did Peter Jackson change the story?""<br/><br/>Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different.  Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours).  Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene.  It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie.  Someone will be disappointed with something.  Therefore, alterations were inevitable.<br/><br/>So, did Jackson change the story?  In my opinion, he didn't.  He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.<br/><br/>
Some that work well:<br/><br/>* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book.  As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit.  I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.<br/><br/>Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep.  If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun.  The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits.  Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.<br/><br/>Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts?  How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.<br/><br/>However, I have to say that all of these items are details.  The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged.  I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc.  But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me.  He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:<br/><br/>* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)<br/><br/>As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well.  And thats really the crux of it all.  If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film.  However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.<br/><br/>One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies?  I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films.  Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex.  It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie.  I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship.  The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work.  A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.<br/><br/>Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought.  I wonder if anyone will actually read this."

Time after time after time, it had me gripping the arms of my chair. The weaving of the almost three separate adventures together was done very well. Really, there wasn't a dull moment. It went much faster than the first, which, while being mostly dedicated to informational, Two Towers was more, 'let's get right to the action.' One of the most amazing, eye-popping parts of the movie was the much awaited battle(at least for me). Done excellent to say the least! There is much more humor than in the first which helped greatly to lift the heavy fog of darkness and evil.

","This film is indeed a modern epic deserving of high praise, but I cannot understand how the good voters of this website have placed this film and its prequel amongst the top ten films of all time. Films worthy of this ranking must in some way change the art of cinema or, at bare minimum, they must be saturated with originality. ""The Two Towers"" is merely a brilliant collaboration of technology and writing; the art of film itself is almost unnecessary. Nothing artistically original has been presented in this film, and moreover, it is not even an original concept, the genre or the plot itself.  <br/><br/>   I'm sure that the ratings for this film are predicated on pure enjoyment and cinematic intensity, which this film does deliver in spades. I must say that the last hour of this film is one of the most invigorating hours of cinema I have ever experienced. I'm just not sure how, and I felt this after about an hour and a half, fans can watch with fresh eyes and vehement curiosity when the plotlines have become somewhat redundant. A battle occurs, a character we care for is wounded or killed or perhaps he fell and will inevitably return. I applaud Peter Jackson for making every battle as new to our eyes as possible, but after a while these beautifully constructed battle scenes play out as simple formalities.<br/><br/>    Overall, I would definately consider this film amongst the great action/adventure films of recent years, but surely not amongst the best of all time. It is a copy of a great piece of art, delivered with grace and beauty by technology. Once we begin to label films with such high praise because of technological feats, we are forgetting the true purpose of art, and for that, ""The Two Towers"" is simply not as good as its cracked up to be."

"McHuevo","9","0","0","21 December 2002"," As grand as the ""Fellowship""
","Just as its predecessor, ""The Two Towers"" is a major scale film, very well executed and performed. I don't think I can call it a sequel, since it was simultaneously filmed along with parts I and III of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Just under three hours long, the movie picks up right where we left in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Frodo and Sam are on their painstaking way to Mordor and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to catch up with the Uruk-Hai that took Pippin and Merry as prisoners. Enter Gollum, the Riders of Rohan and Treebeard, the new characters that play an essential part, each on their own, in the whole trilogy.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to see this movie ever since I was captivated by the first installment of the trilogy. I hadn't read any of the books by that time, but the story caught me so much, I just couldn't wait another year to know what happened to Frodo. I think that's the main difference between my perception of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Two Towers"". To be honest I felt that the first film was too long the first time I saw it, but when I finished the book and saw it again I felt it was too short.<br/><br/>Now, having read the book twice, I feel that ""The Two Towers"" is just a little bit too long, and I think I have a very good reason to do so: chapters 8-11 of book III and 7-10 of book IV were simply cut out and  and replaced with many other battle sequences, like the attack of the orcs on the people of Rohan on their way to Helm's Deep, many flashback and dream sequences, and others I won't tell to avoid spoiling it for you. This certainly will benefit the third film ""The Return of the King"" as it will contain many more action sequences than the book describes (and I agree it needs them instead of such a long epilogue), but ""Alas!"" it made me mad having to wait another year to see them. And since those chapters are left out, the whole movie concentrates on the grand finale of the Battle of Helm's Deep. Did you think the first battle sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" was long? Think again.<br/><br/>Leaving this aside, the movie is a very good adaptation from the book. I'm amazed by the way Peter Jackson's vision brought the story and its characters from the books to the film. All the places and landscapes are everything I had pictured in my mind. I was so anxious to see Gollum and Treebeard come to life, and I got more than I expected. In fact, despite the disadvantage of being a digital character, Gollum's performance is the one that makes the most lasting impression in this movie (and perhaps the three of them). Just like Frodo, you feel pity for the little guy. Awesome voice performing by Andy Serkis combined with flawless animation. Also, kudos to Frances Walsh for her screenplay adaptation. It's no easy task writing a linear story from a book that goes forward and backward in time so abruptly.<br/><br/>I have to see it again two or three more times to make an honest vote about it. I thought 9 at first, but that's just because I missed Shelba so much. I guess you guys that had read the books before felt the same way about Tom Bombadil (although she's not out at all, no my precious, just delayed...).<br/><br/>Now bring on the Extended Edition on DVD! I want to see Treebeard's home, the complete battle with the Balrog, more Merry and Pippin! One year is too long to wait for ""The Return of the King""!"

Even if the Arwen character is kind of weak, I don't care because the elves are friggin awesome!  And for those that can't seem to place Agent Smith as Elrond - please get over it.

","I did not do a review for The Fellowship of the Ring last year, because I wasn't sure how I really thought about the film.  I liked it, but to me, it wasn't the spectacle nor was it the film everyone else around me thought. Maybe it was how it ended, and maybe it's because I didn't feel there was a lot to the story itself.  Then again, I have had absolutely NO previous exposure to the Lord of the Rings stories.  Sure I knew they were around, but besides that, knew nothing of them.<br/><br/>That's not to say I didn't like the movie.  I just wasn't all that captivated with it like everyone else.  I do agree, that it was well done, well told, and offered a scope of cinema that is not common.  And when the extended version of The Fellowship of the Ring came out on DVD last month, I picked up a copy.  And I'm actually glad I did.  It gives a bit more background to the story, and offered me a refresher before seeing The Two Towers.<br/><br/>And now, I am more able to give The Fellowship of the Ring its fair score. It does an excellent job to set up the characters, the relationships, and the mission.  This becomes more apparent from watching The Two Towers. Since I now know about the origins of the characters and what their objectives are, I can pay more attention to how they strive to meet their goals.  <br/><br/>The Two Towers has a lot more substance to the plot and to the activity than its predecessor.  There are also different locales to focus on and simultaneous story lines.  Instead of just focusing on the fellowship as a group, we have their separate quests and adventures.  We have Frodo and Samwise who are trying to reach Mordor (as well as their new tag-along friend) we have Aragorn, Gimli, and Greenleaf on their quest, and we also see where Pippin and Merry have been led. (You may recall these groups were all separated at the end of The Fellowship of the Ring.)<br/><br/>What's also nice is that there is a self-contained story here.  With the first story the quest began and they ran into some road-bumps, but the story didn't really end (of course not, we had 2 more chapters to go).  The story of this journey continues with The Two Towers yet there is also a self-contained, yet connected, story at work here.  As well, there is a new story of Gollum.  We learn a bit more about this odd creature -- a decent blend of good, bad, and his own personal struggles.<br/><br/>The battle sequences in The Two Towers were more powerful and had more impact than previous, but justifiably so.  The tension in Middle Earth is rising, and both sides are nearing a peak and rising to achieve their goals at whatever cost.<br/><br/>However, I had a bit of a complaint.  I would have liked a better explanation of these `Two Towers'.  What are they exactly, and why are they so significant?  They are apparently significant enough to deserve the title.  If their role was explained, then I apparently missed it. <br/><br/>
The Two Towers does well to complement The Lord of the Rings series.  And as such, I can now hold The Fellowship of the Ring in a better light, since now I have the benefit of its tale to be the setup for The Towers.  I can very much appreciate how this epic trilogy is going to continue when The Return of the King comes to theatres this time next year."

"Doddi","10","0","0","21 December 2002"," A fantastic, flawless second act. And maybe slightly better...
","It isn't easy spending 5+ years of your life making a film version of the most beloved books of the 20th century. Peter Jackson and his team knew this and have shown such a wonderful respect for the material, and turned it into the film events of the century which has just started. Fellowship was an amazing feat, flawless and it warped us into Middle Earth. It was hard waiting for the next part, but it's here and it is amazing as well. I truly admire Peter Jackson for the decision on not connecting the first two films with ""rolling text"" or what has previously happened. You just continue the story and it is so powerful. It feels like you're home, like you never left. You have Frodo and Sam in one quest, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in another and then a bit of Merry and Pippin. Plus new characters and creatures and the film flows flawlessly. It's a flawless second act, where the only fault is that we have to wait another year for the conclusion. Yes, The Two Towers parts the most from the novels (PJ has himself stated) but it isn't that much. Films will never be as great or the same as the books, it is simply not possible, yet the impossible task is near perfection in PJ's version of the trilogy.<br/><br/>There is a lot more action in The Two Towers, understandably, yet it finds time to develop the depth behind the new characters, enhance the olders ones and make us feel for them all. I felt the ring's influence on Frodo so much, I felt Sam's pain as his best and trusted friend, I felt the change in Merry and Pippin, I felt the transition from the Grey to the White, Aragorn's fighting skills were superb, as were emotional difficulties with his troubled love to Arwen, Gimli as the comic sidekick works perfectly and Legolas is great as always. There are many scenes I could point out, but me and three friends went together and after the film we all sat in awe and questioned each other afterwards: How is this possible??? The battle at Helm's Deep must be and will be considered one of the greatest moments in film history. The tension built up until the moment the first arrow is shot... wow - an amazingly big WOW!! Howard Shore has developed his amazing score further and Emiliana's ""Gollum song"" is hauntingly good, Lesnie's cinematography is perfect, costumes, make-up and visual effects ... never better! And if you are in doubt, ask Gollum!! A powerful performance by a cgi-character!! (Andy Serkis was magnificent)...<br/><br/>I could count more persons (actors, crew-people) but I'm trying to finish without bursting to tears... yes, I almost cried because I was so heavily influenced. I was in awe! And I still am. This is what cinema is about, pure escapism and more than that... fulfilling it with such a fantastic, flawless second act. PJ: thank you for your brilliant piece. It may be slightly better than the Fellowship, which I didn't think was possible. It only makes me more anxious in seeing Return of the King. This trilogy will go down in history as the greatest trilogy of all time. From the bottom of my heart, I thank everyone involved and responsible for the film, especially the true visionary and greatest director: Peter Jackson."

","I've seen a lot of movies, action and other genres. I have never seen a film so rich, nor have I enjoyed watching one that much. The scenery and sets had me wishing for a LOTR theme-park in New Zealand. The actors' performances were definetly more impressive in TTT. The action scenes were the best I've ever seen. And the effects were the icing on the cake. I would ask any critics to compare TTT to two similar films that have won Best Picture (Braveheart and Gladiator). The TTT is a better story. While Viggio Mortensen generally may not be on par with Russell Crowe or Mel Gibson, he is better in this role than they were in their movies. It shouldn't matter, because Elijah Wood gives a better performance than any of them. I would say that TTT is better than either of those movies, and should get strong consideration in an otherwise weak year. It's a better film than FOTR. I went in fully expecting to be disappointed because TTT could not possibly live up to FOTR. I was really wrong. Now, I don't want to see ROTK, because 1) I don't think it can live up to the TTT and 2) it will be the end of the story."

","****<br/><br/>Starring: Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortenson, Ian McKellan, and Sean Astin.<br/><br/>This film takes off where 'Felloewship' left off.  This time, they aren't a fellowship.  It seems that the fellowship broke off into little groups. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), the holder of the ring, and Sam (Sean Astin) set off to Mordor to destroy the ring.  On their way, they find an unlikely guide, Gollum.  Gollum suffers from a split-personality way, having one side a vicous beast and the other a nicer beast. Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) set out to find Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd).  When we last saw Gandalf (Ian McKellan), we had thought that he fell to a death.  But he ends up being alive afterall.  Saruman (Christopher Lee) makes an army of orcs to kill everyone and retrieve the ring.<br/><br/>The film is excellent on many ways, filling every question with an answer, every battle with a great end, and every character has its goods.  I will also note that the final battle is brilliant."

","As I hoped, since all three movies were shot at the same time, the quality of ""The Two Towers"" is right up there with last year's ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  At first, I was a little apprehensive with the artistic license Peter Jackson was taking in this movie.  But, after thinking about it awhile, the changes made do make sense for the movie version, anyway. <br/><br/>
In the book, it is the Huorns (the nasty trees that the Ents keep under control) that actually take out a lot of Saruman's Orcs at Helm's Deep as well as Saruman's forces at Orthanc (Isengard).  And of course, introducing yet another character that also gets almost no book exposure - Erkenbrand of Rohan - who comes in with the cavalry, would have been very confusing.  So, having Haldir lead a troup of Elves from Lorien to help at Helm's Deep, and having Gandalf bring in the cavalry, does help to lessen confusion.  I was dismayed at Haldir's death, but upon reflection, it would have been totally unbelievable if EVERY character survived such a savage and genocidal onslaught.  <br/><br/>Regarding Faramir taking Frodo to Osgiliath before letting him go.  This is just an expansion of the theme in Faramir's hidden fortress.  In the book, Faramir was tempted to take the ring, although he did let Frodo go with full knowledge of what he carried.  In the movie, Faramir also does this, albeit only after a change of mind and a little convincing (the winged Nazgul). The dangerous part of movie's change - having Frodo the Ringbearer ID'd by the Nazgul in Osgiliath - is that Sauron would now suspect that maybe his foes WEREN'T taking the ring to Gondor and Minas Tirith after all.  He might now suspect there was a plan afoot to have the ring stealthily destroyed in Mt. Doom.  That might cause him to focus less attention on Gondor, and more on his own realm's borders, to catch any attempt to get in.  That would have resulted in the failure of Frodo's mission.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie delivers convincingly.  Aragorn is coming into his own.  Gollum is pitiable and sympathetic, as well as menacing.  He steals the movie.  Bernard Hill does an excellent job as Theoden, as does Miranda Otto as Eowyn.  Uniquely beautiful, she is.  Frodo and Sam are perfect, and Sam is really becoming a favorite (as he does in the book).  Legolas and Gimli were good, too.  Gimli was particularly funny in this one, and let's face it, the movie needed some relief of tension.  I was very impressed with Treebeard and the Ents.  I was hoping they wouldn't come across as silly, and for me, they didn't.  Almost sad, they were.  <br/><br/>I give it a 9/10.  A subsequent viewing might make me change that to a 10/10.  Don't miss this movie!  But see ""Fellowship"" first!"
"blteigen","Null","0","0","20 December 2002"," Awesome in its own right, but not as great as Fellowship
","WARNING: SPOILERS<br/><br/>I really liked this film.  It had everything.  It made me laugh, it made me scream and it almost made me cry.  But for just some reason, it did not seem as beautiful and as dark as 'Fellowship'.  One thing that probably contributed to this was the choppy editing and jerky camera work.  It was also not as faithful to its book as 'Fellowship'.  I understand that the director could not possibly put it everything into a movie that was in the book but more could have been added if, for one thing, they left out the corny love triangle whatnot between Aragorn, Arwen and Eowyn.  Miranda Otto was okay as Eowyn (she did not appear that important in the film) but Liv Tyler should banish herself in shame for leaping into that cesspit of love and hurt feelings and prophecy, and for dragging Hugo Weaving with her.  If Viggo was so into the character of Aragorn, wouldn't he have anything to say about this?<br/><br/>There were also minor things in the movie that just bothered me because there was no point in them.  Like how about those Wraiths riding on the dragons when they're supposed to be riding on winged horses?  How about all the lines getting screwed up and said by the wrong people (when Theoden says that ever famous line 'Alas the old wither and linger while the young perish' or something like it, he was talking about Boromir, not Theodred). Why does Theoden look like the Pope from South Park?  I'm don't even want to talk about Faramir.  And I bet surfing on the shield was Orlando Bloom's idiotic idea.<br/><br/>But now on with the good stuff.  A couple actors really really shone in this film.  Screw Legolas, GO Gimli, Son of Gloin.  Gollum rocks!  Andy Serkis did the best job out of all them, including Elijah and Viggo.  I want the words to the song he sang about the fish.  I liked it how he always referred to Sam as the 'fat hobbit.'  That cracked me up.  Grima Wormtounge also ruled.  He gave a pretty humane performance.  Dude, is Eowyn crazy?  I bet anything Aragorn or Faramir can't wax poetic like he did.  Another cool person was Haldir, the ONLY cool elf, but unfortunately, like in the Fellowship when Boromir was offed, and Haldir got the ax as well (literally).  That was when I almost cried.  Three cheers for the Orcs! Grishnakh and Ugluk and Lugdush and Snaga, hooray, can't wait to meet Shagrat and Gorbag in the next film.  At Helm's Deep, though, that one Uruk-Hai with the sparkler torch greatly resembled an Olympic marathon runner.  The Haradrim also ruled.<br/><br/>All in all, excellent, but Peter Jackson, please, please, please reduce Arwen to the protected, wizened, unseen elven princess that she really is. Please do not make Shelob look corny and please do not (by my friends' popular demand as well as my own) skip the scene where Grima throws the Palantir out the window and when Sam runs into the wall of Barad-dur.  I give it three stars out of four."
"movieguy1021","5","0","0","20 December 2002"," The Two Towers: 5/10
","Ho hum. In Peter Jackson's second movie of the three books, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is trying to deliever the ring of power to the fire in middle earth, since that is where it was created, that is where it can be destroyed. Along with him is his friend Samwise (Sean Astin), who refers to his friend as ""Mr. Frodo"". Something about that strikes me as just weird. The other members of the broken fellowship (how did they break up? I don't remember, I saw the first one a year ago and I'm not an avid fan) seem to be trying to tag along. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), a human, Legolas (Orlando Bloom), an elf, and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), a dwarf, try to trace the trail of Frodo and Sam. Two more hobbits, Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan) get lost and are aided by talking and walking trees (!). Confused yet?<br/><br/>The one-minute-shy-of-three-hours runtime seems somewhat padded, maybe so it can keep up its reputation. Jackson tried to stay faithful to the book, but kept too close. For the record, I have not read any of the books. If everything about Pippin and Merry had been taken out, it would have been easier to tolerate.<br/><br/>To improve, they needed a more over-the-top climactic fight scene. In the first one it was the mines of Morea (sp?). This time it's Helm's Deep. With thousands of fighters, it's pure fun right? Wrong. It goes on for way too long, and after a while, it becomes, dare I say, boring? The first hour or so was fine, fun, and enjoyable. In the second hour, when characters came in and out and Jackson expected us to know everyone from the book, it drags a little. The third hour is just pure chaos, with not real rhyme to the reason.<br/><br/>It also seemed like everyone who died came back to life. I know this is a magical world, but come on! After falling off a cliff? Gimme a break. All of the acting was fine (Astin's may have been best), but I still don't know who a lot of the characters were.<br/><br/>Added to the mix is a computer animated character named Gollum, who sounds (and looks) a lot like Dobby from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. He was once a hobbit, but came under the spell of the ring, and he's dying to get his hands on it. So he helps out Frodo and Sam to get to where they need to go. Oh yeah, he also has split personality for a bit of comic relief.<br/><br/>The cinematography seemed to either be long, wide, sweeping and beautiful shots or grotesque close-ups of Gollum or rotted faces of Orcs. Not exactly a pretty picture. The Two Towers doesn't have anything to do with the title (unless, of course, it was mentioned when I was in the bathroom). It's mainly a continuation of the first film, a transition between numbers one and three. And what was with Aragorn's dream type things? Maybe I should read the books.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is entertaining but deeply flawed by its meaningless plot and boring fights. Its visuals are stunning, but little else in the movie is.<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for epic battle sequences and scary images."

And the actors did a excellent job working with this. Seriously, if you don't know he's a CGI ahead of time, then you won't know it when you see him. And Treebeard and the Ents are exsquisite as well. I must say, I found the Ents very quite and amusing.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson and his crew could not have picked a better cast! Elijah Wood, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Cate Blanchett, Sean Astin, Viggo Morensen, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, Miranda Otto, Brad Dourif, Bernard Hill and everyone else are PERFECT at their respected parts.<br/><br/>Frodo has the most amazing eyes, Sam is so warm, Legolas has some seriously cool kick-ass moves, Gimli is hilarious, Arwen is perfect, Aragorn is terrific, Theoden is exactly as I pictured him in the book, and so is Wormtongue, Saruman has the perfect voice, Eowyn is quite charming, and I just love Pippin and Merry.<br/><br/>This is by far the best movie since The Fellowship of the Ring (I'm not sure which is better), and I encourage everyone, especially Lord of the Rings fans, to go see it.

","A cinematic landmark that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the full-length feature. The Two Towers roars through the cinemas with a simple conclusion that can be determined as soon as the lights go up and people start getting up from there seats to leave. This is without doubt `The greatest film of 2002' and following The Fellowship of The Ring with only one eagerly awaited film left to go, this soon to be trilogy has massive potential to be the greatest trilogy in cinematic history. Taking its place alongside the Godfather trilogy and the Starwars saga these films are razor sharp with a mind blowing plot and dazzling performances. The Two Towers pretty much leaves where there Fellowship left off, expanding the horizons of the middle earth setting with more jaw dropping scenery, greater character development, fierce tense action scenes and plenty of mouth watering computer effects. J.R.R Tolkien had a great vision and an amazing story to tell and with the help of master director Peter Jackson, `The Two Towers' succeeds in every aspect a film should do. It'll be almost impossible to track down any faults that could have been erased to better this movie. This is pure magic, brilliant stuff!!!"

But why ADD detail- and detail that distracts considerably from the integrity of the story?<br/><br/>Let's see: the Ents have to be duped into joining the fight; Faramir does not show his essential difference from his brother Boromir, and captures Frodo and Sam, only releasing them later; Wossisname- the king of Rohan- is physically enchanted by Saruman.  (I also don't recall him- or his people- being the way they were portrayed.  Thought I'd stepped into a showing of Schindler's List for a while there)  Maybe that was why they had to have a wholly unnecessary battalion of elves show up, doubtlessly transported there by Deus ex Machina Airlines?<br/><br/>Tolkien eschewed any use of allegory- spoke outright against it, in fact. Quite a contrast to the several Shakesperian orations (Forests good! Technology bad!!!) in which we discover unsuspected depths in our hobbit friends.  Clowns and buffoons in the first, Machiavelis in the second: what will they do in the third?<br/><br/>-And speaking of clowns, am I the only one who objects to Gimli being the comic relief?<br/><br/>Boy, that Tolkien... great story line... if only he'd known how to write..."

","I felt compelled to write when I read some of the responses that people had to the movie. Folks, let's get something out of the way first and foremost: the book is unfilmable in it's original layout. I'm sick of hearing all this complaining about how Peter Jackson and company changed this and changed that. I guess you would all like to see a hack like Michael Bay take a crack at it? Or maybe someone who didn't even read the book but was considered a perfect choice for his ""stylish"" visuals? People, understand something. The movies are being made by someone who has an obvious affection for the books, possibly more so than any other film director working today. The guy is doing everything he can to give the books the treatment they deserve! Of course stuff is gonna get left out! Anybody who thinks he is making this movie solely to get it out there and get some money out of it, without any regard for a respectable adaptation is sorely mistaken. Come on, how much is he straying from the source material that you have to whine like kids? I personally think this movie was excellent on all counts. The only complaint I have is that it was a little slow at times and some of the ending dialogue was a little hokey but there's so much here that leaves you in awe that it'd make for a review well over the thousand word limit, so I'm gonna keep my praise restrained. Gandalf's battle with the Balrog was something that I've never seen anything like in a film before and that's saying something. Frodo falling into the Dead Marshes was one of the creepiest scenes I have ever seen in a movie, period. I don't think the Academy would have the balls to nominate Andy Serkis for best supporting actor but some kind of honorable mention is due. This is digital character done right, no mentioning the other digital atrocity bestowed upon us back in '99. I don't have to mention the name, do I? The battle of Helm's Deep was a technical accomplishment that, sad to say it, makes similar large scale effects works like Attack of the Clones look like grade school stuff. The movie was close enough to the books that I could honestly overlook any omissions or additions made. Everything that was added was true to Tolkien's work. Anything that was omitted was done for the best reasons, I'm sure. I'm dying to see how Jackson executes the scene left out of the Two Towers book at the very end, the one scene anyone who has read the book remembers. The acting was great on all sides and the music was almost as good as Fellowship of the Ring was. This movie was something else. Peter Jackson, I stand and I salute you and I applaud your effort, as well as the rest of the people who helped you to bring this to the screen in such magnificence. Count me among the first to buy this DVD and the extended cut on their respective release dates. And count me among the first in line for Return of the King. Rating: ***** out of *****."
"horosha","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," The only bad thing is having to wait a year for ROTK
","I am not sure how to compare this to Fellowship. Both films are very different. This one is much more action packed and has what in my mind is the best CG character ever on film (Gollum). The image quality on Gollum was great. Very realistic, or at least as real as I imagined Gollum when reading the books. But besides the image the movement was what really stands out. Not just body movement but small movements in the eyes and facial expressions. The effects were great in every scene and, as in Fellowship, they were done in such a way that they told the story rather than overshadowing it. For those who have read the book you should be prepared that in the film version of TTT the ending is about a chapter early which in the long run will turn out better to have it in the beginning of ROTK. Everything about this film was great except that it made me want to watch ROTK right afterwards. Well I guess 1 year to wait is better than 3 (like certain other directors do with their trilogies). Although I wanted ROTK right after this one I still found it to be a good stand alone movie. IMDB 10/10. Also check out Peter Jackson's other work such as The Frighteners and Heavenly Creatures especially. If you want to see something totally opposite of LOTR though check out Bad Taste, Dead Alive (AKA Brain Dead), or Meet the Feebles as well."
"awjonesjr","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," BETTER THAN FELLOWSHIP
","The Fellowship of the Ring was a sermon preached to the converted; The Two Towers directs its evangel at the undecided, and will no doubt win more to the flock of the faithful.  Although the second act of a trilogy (it will make more sense to those who have seen part one, and it begs to be concluded with the finale next year)it stands on its own with great action set-piece. Peter Jackson seems to do better when he has more balls up in the air, staging eye-popping battles, reaching deep into the emotional lives of his characters, and telling a rousing tale with the best visual effects you'bve ever seen, especially the wholly digitized Gollum, whose internal struggle against corruption is captured as believably as his body movement.  Two Towers extends its franchise, and the meaning of epic, in a way that few movies have since Star Wars.  The bar has been raised."
"K_Cole01","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," Excellent Film
","Peter Jackson did a wonderful job translating the book into the movie. Every part was close to how I imagined it when I read the book. The movie does not have much character development, but as the middle of 3 books and predominately action oriented, this is too be expected. The battle of Helm's Deep was incredible, and the albeit skewed timing of events was spot on and correct for the adaptation. (Ents destroying Isengard after Helm's Deep instead of before)<br/><br/>Overall excellent movie  10 stars"

","This movie was great. It was not better than the first film, but I loved it just as much. The battle sequences were astonishing, Gollum was as scary as Gollum can get, and the plot was kept together (although, not as well as in the first movie).<br/><br/>The only things I didn't like were the constant jokes with Gimli. He is never allowed to be serious! Several of his jokes were funny (especially ones with Legolas), but I wished that he could have a more serious side, like he does in the books.<br/><br/>But just that can't take too much away from this movie.

"joeblimp2","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," As close as you can get to being in the movie
","WOW, the two towers was an exhilarating ride. There was so much more to the movie than I had imagined from reading the books. I am not talking about the shape or sizes of characters or the picturesque scenery. The extent that Jackson pushes the story is astonishing. It is so well crafted and thought out, characters are given depth. For example, you are not told that Theoden is King of Rohan with a crown plopped on his head you are shown in the mini-stories of the tribulation of his people. Gollum is a CGI coup, the first believable CGI character, so complex, what a great job!<br/><br/> The Ents come off well too, this is where things also could have gone very wrong but Jackson and WETA have done a good job with this tricky part of Tolkien's story.<br/><br/> I cannot stress enough that the two towers goes beyond a fantasy movie, it is a war movie at its heart. Again Jackson goes beyond to show us what death means, to a dying elf-lord no less, or the psychological terror of war. There is so much to the film, it is so rich in detail, of action, of art work in the form of the material artifacts constructed for the picture, and of cinematography. Oh and it is funny too. The last movie of the Ring cycle, Return of the King, is a year away. So long to wait for the end. Thanks to Peter Jackson and co. we have two movies to watch as we anticipate the payoff of this EPIC trilogy."

","Starting with the opening scenes of Gandolf and the Balrog right through to the ending that leaves you wanting more, this movie is a masterpiece. Gollum is totally believable and is most definitely the best CGI character of all time. (with Spiderman being the WORST!)<br/><br/>New Zealand is also a star again with some scenes making you cry out WOW! I wanted to scan every corner of the screen so I would not miss a thing. I wish I didn't have to wait almost a year for the extended DVD!<br/><br/>Certainly it was much darker than FOTR but it was paced just perfectly. Three hours went by way too fast.

","I've just returned from an advance screening of The Two Towers here in Brazil and I'm very fulfilled. Everything went fine in the second adaptation of Tolkien's book.The story is fantastic as always ,the characters show anger and want to fight for freedom of the Middle Earth.<br/><br/>The best in this picture are the battles that were extremely well realised , the Ents fighting were great and the scenes with Gollum are at the same time funny and scary.The story follows where The Fellowship of the Ring stopped, you see the parallel stories of Frodo and Sam going to destroy the ring and the story of Legolas,Aragorn and Gimli(the most funny in the entire picture) trying to rescue Merry and Pippin.<br/><br/>More characters were added to the story.First Eowyn(Miranda Otto) a woman with presence and that has  very good facial expressions,she doesn't act too much. She's there just to cause jealousy in Arwen with a bigger cameo in this picture.ThÃ©oden is just excellent and Grima is just fantastic.<br/><br/> It is not better than the first but is very good too.It has more effects and more freedom to tell the story cos' now Peter Jackson doesn't have to explain the story of the book,who wants to really understand Tolkien's world must read his books.The 3 hours pass quickly as a thunder(if you enjoy the story!).It can't be analized alone because the movie doesn't have a conclusion so it's a great second part,with a lot of jokes, battles, adventure, beautiful places and a story of hope , fight for a good cause and of course the ring."

"asticht","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," Academy take heed and recognize!
","I was absolutely enthralled with the Two Towers, I don't think there are enough superlatives in the English language to express the pleasure and all out thrill I received from watching this movie unfold on the screen.  Peter Jackson is absolutely brilliant with his making this movie a separate film with a completely different style of editing from the first installment of the series.  I do however wish to make an editorial comment here regarding the Academy of Motion Picture sciences nominating the first film for practically every category imaginable and the film only coming away with a couple of statues.  Listen up Oscar, this film is BY FAR the best Picture of the year, and Peter Jackson is a penultimate director and deserves credit for the incredible work that he has done making a movie that is not only pleasing to the fans of the work on which it is based, but also is very well crafted as a GOOD motion picture should be in this day and age.<br/><br/>I read last year that there were some people commenting about the film not being that good because it is basically a chase movie.  REALLY?  I mean get real people, of course it is, and anyone with half a brain who has actually READ the original masterpieces on which the films are based would have KNOWN that!  This isn't Rocket science people!  Tolkien I think is smiling down on Peter Jackson right now as he has done well for making a visually and artistically stunning movie.<br/><br/>For those who have Rank & Bass's interpretation of Hobbits and Dwarves and Gollum, throw everything out from your mind.  Gollum most specifically is the most accurate and true form to Tolkiens description of not only his appearance but as to his genetic origins being closely related to Hobbits. It is his characterization by Andy Serkis along with the mystical Ent Treebeard played by John Rhys Davies which in my opinion makes this film as good as one who is a LOTR fan would hope for.  Not only that, but the CG technology used to create these two characters is by far some of the best computer animation I have ever seen, and the realism that these characters posses is definitely the best live action characters since Jurassic Park. Brad Dourif's portrayal of Grima Wormtongue was also worthy of note as he is as snaky and evil in the book as he was in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a wonderful fast paced film.  The editing was much more snappy than in the Fellowship of the ring. There are many more separate stories going on at the same time due to the Fellowship having parted at the end of the film and there are three separate tracks taking place simultaneously.  <br/><br/>The only thing I felt was distracting was where I ended up sitting during the film, I was near the front of the theater and during some of the action scenes, due to how close I was to the screen, it was blurry at times and there was more activity going on than I could follow.  This was not the filmmakers fault however, I was just too close to the screen to see everything happening at once.<br/><br/>I would caution those who would like to bring younger children to this movie as it is definitely more violent and scary than the first film and some parents may find themselves calming nightmares for several days after a younger child sees this movie.<br/><br/>Bravo Peter Jackson!"
"chets808","10","0","0","20 December 2002"," Majestic film.
","Simply put: the best fantasy movie ever made. <br/><br/>The complete Lord of the Rings trilogy will be this generations Star Wars. We will be looking back upon Peter Jackson's triumph with the same awe and inspiration used to look at G. Lucas' accomplishments 20 years prior.<br/><br/>Once again Jackson and company find the right tone at every turn. It never becomes too hokey, too geeked out, too cloying, too anything. Scene after scene he manages to avoid the pitfalls plaguing so many other simliar movies.<br/><br/>Last thought: G. Lucas could have only dreamed of realizing a full CGI character as well as Gollum when first he attempted it with Episode 1.<br/><br/>For the first time, I believe we have seen just how incredibly far a filmmaker can go in inventing a character out of ones and zeros; quite scary indeed. Voice acting will definitely see a spike."
"robinanng","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," The Film/The book/U can love both
","I have read the LOTR books 4 times, with a few glances back over the years. I daresay I'll read them a few more times before I pass from this earth. I need not say to those who have read and loved those books, how I treasured those novels. They are more than just books. They are stories I have held in my heart long after I put them down.<br/><br/>Being a film buff as well, I have waited many years,with great longing and anticipation, for a film to bring the magical words of the trilogy to the screen. In my heart I knew it would be an imposing task, maybe an impossible one.<br/><br/>In the past year I have seen what Peter Jackson has made from these books. I believe:<br/><br/>1). Mr. Jackson labored mightily, and it was his heartfelt wish that these films be as close to the original idea that the books perfected, that his films grasp the feeling and mood and meaning of the words Tolkien put down. To this desire I believe him to  be true. One can feel and see the labor of love he put into these movies.<br/><br/>2. I also believe that these books are so intense and personal to each loyal reader, and no visual art can truly fulfill every person's individual imagining of the magical places, actions and people of Middle Earth. While one person might accept the image of Jackson's Shire to be right on target, another might have thought it less than right. There are bound to be some parts of these movies that disappoint individuals, as each person holds a different picture in their own mind than did Jackson,or Tolkien did or anyone else. This is the unique and best part of these books, the idea that each of us can fill our own minds eye with whatever we envision as magical.<br/><br/>Those things being said, I liked both of the movies. Did I think them absolutely perfect to my imaginary idea of MiddleEarth? No. Did I find them close? Yes. Can I respect the effort of the writers, directors and the actors who worked hard to bring these ideas to life? Yes.<br/><br/>The Fellowship seemed to follow the book more closely than did the Two Towers. But the first book is an easier mark to hit, as the story is just unfolding. The second book was incredibly detailed with new characters, plots and separate adventures of the main characters. I think to bring the Two Towers book to complete justice, one would have to have 2 movies just to cover it all.<br/><br/>Was I a bit disappointed in some of the liberties Jackson took with the story, that Eowyn did not take up the sword and Faramir was an incomplete character, as I had loved him so in the book? Yes, a bit. But the ancient Ents were there on the screen and Viggo M. brought fabulous life to Aragorn. Gollum was an incredible character both visually as well as poignantly humanized and Helm's Deep was dank and dark, the Enemy overwhelmingly many.The dead mrshes were truly frightening and I loved all breathtaking scenery, the mountains and the valleys, the imposing gates of Mordor.<br/><br/>There were some disappointments, but overall the effort and the final product far outweigh the negatives. Both movies are cinematically brilliant. To judge them harshly by comparing them to the written word is unfair, as one cannot compare one to the other.<br/><br/>The bottom line for me in rating a movie is by the overall effect it has on me, after I leave my seat and get in the truck to go home. I was truly moved by the Two Towers and the Fellowship movies. They are not mere popcorn chomping movies you watch and leave behind in the theatre. They are movies that stayed with me long after I walked away from the screen, impressing me with their strong, umwavering idealization of good and evil, dark and light. The same ideals found in the original written works by Tolkien.<br/><br/>I'll go see it again and look to next year for the Finale."

I am here to ask one single, solitary question:<br/><br/>Where was Gwaihir? How could this movie leave him out like that? (Ok, maybe two questions *smile*). It seems to me that, unlike Bombadil in Fellowship, you have to stick the Eagles in there somewhere, even if it is just for the benefit of the die-hard fans like myself.<br/><br/>The film was terrific, but there were some points that needed omission, or addition:<br/><br/>Aragorn falling over the cliff - take that junk out.<br/><br/>The Ents not -wanting- to attack Saruman until the Hobbits tricked them? That was just silly.<br/><br/>Too much Arwen. Period. How in the world did PJ manage to stick Galadriel in there, even for a brief moment?<br/><br/>Come on, PJ, the die harders wanted to see Shelob. Let the movie end on a suspensful note like the book, not on a  vague threat by Gollum.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and put Gwaihir in there! He needs a little more introduction if he is going to fly Gandalf into Mordor in the  next film to save Frodo and Sam.

","I guess i walked in expecting an exact duplicate or incredibly close to the book and that my boyhood dreams would be perfectly placed on screen. Well from a strictly movie critic point of view it was absolutely amazing, and i didn't stray from my seating position once (which is not an easy task considering 3 hours went by).  I thought that the visuals were to the next level. Smeagol was so realistic in the close ups that it freaked me out a little bit because it looked TOO real! An amazing piece of work, and Mr. Jackson deserves a slap on the back and a pint bought for him. BUT being the nitpicky ""obsessed with the books since i was 10"" kind of person, i was shocked at some of the scenes. The biggest of course being that Frodo and Sam never go to Osgilarth(i cant spell sorry) with Faramir. This really bugged me because the winged Nazgul are left a mystery really in the books, and never ever is Frodo staring one down. To tell you the truth as i write this i begin to realize that i'm sounding like a complete twat, and to those who haven't read the books i apoligize. I could get really detailed and complain, but at the end of the day YOU try to take a book written by a genius, put it on the big screen and please hollywood and a few billion people. Not an easy task. So Mr. Jackson I congratulate on a brilliant piece of cinema which brought a twenty+ man back 14 years to a time where Lord of the rings was the most amazing adventure he had ever been on."

","This movie is even better than the first. With more spectacular adventure lines and a perfect chance for Elijah Wood to show that he IS a good actor. He now is faced before the treacherous might of the ring. He shows jealousy, anger and obsession in a way he never been able to show before. The special effects are made so that the story wont be based on them. The fight at Helms deep is amazing and will be written into history as the most extended and the most realistic (so realistic it can be when 10 000 Orcs invades an immense keep against 500 men). None of the effects look especially computer made. The funniest character of them all is Gimli (the dwarf) that always have problems due to his length. See it, but don't expect that every line will be based on the book. The story is suited for a movie, not a book. But it feels very Tolkien, thats for sure."

The character development in Saruman, Faramir, Aragorn and especially Gimli are missing and then just seem..well...we don't feel that it matters much whether they live or die.<br/><br/>Besides some of the scenes are really corny: Gandalf exorcising Theoden, Aragorn telepatizing with Arwen, Sam's monologue about the character of good, evil and adventures etc.<br/><br/>This good have been one of my favorite movies of all time, but it really is a miss. If you haven't read the books, the movie probably will appeal more to you, but if you have read the books, you will leave the cinema with the felling, that this COULD have been a great movie, but now it's just mediocre.

","The Two Towers is a stunning follow-up to last year's blockbuster The Fellowship of the Ring. While its pacing is a little strange (it's got no exposition or closure), director Jackson's genius style seamlessly weaves the three stories of Frodo and Sam; Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn; and Pippin and Merry. The special effects are jaw-dropping; the Battle of Helm's Deep is biblical in its proportions. Heavy on action and light on character development, I think Fellowship was better; however, Two Towers does not fall too far behind."

"farlane6","Null","0","0","19 December 2002"," Not exactly like the books, but still great
","OK, I've read quite a few reviews now and felt I had to add my comments after watching this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, there is no way that every detail in the books can be put in these movies.  The film was very expensive to make at three hours, can you imagine how long this film would be if Jackson had included every single thing in the book?  These films are an adaptation of Tolkein's work, not a verbatim translation.  Simply put, the limits placed by budget and time forbid almost any book, let alone something this massive, to be put into film scene by scene.<br/><br/>Now I did have some problems with the film, most of which were satisfied by understanding the premise of the project.  The fact that the three stories jumped around a lot was a bit distracting, but probably better than having the three told one at a time.<br/><br/>Faramir being tempted by the ring; so what?  I was a bit ticked when they passed on the entire scholar/underappreciated son routine, but in the end he did release Frodo to accomplish his mission.  Again, it would have been great to spend more time with him, but you can't put everything in and still make the movie.<br/><br/>The jokes between Legolas and Gimli were a bit out of character perhaps, but then again if everyone was grim and serious all the time, there would be no emotional swing to the scenes.  Besides, the ""kill-count"" in the book was kind of a joking dialogue; why not emphasize that aspect of their friendship?<br/><br/>Gollum, one word: WOW!<br/><br/>I've read some complaints about the lack of a beginning and end to this movie.  Considering that the books were not even supposed to be separate, I think this adds to the uniqueness of the project as a whole.<br/><br/>I didn't really care for the Arwen scenes or Aragorn being rescued by his horse, or of the obligatory surfing scene (although his mounting of the horse was very cool), and I would have liked to see more of the dialogue between Pippin & Merry and more of Gandalf in general, I can wait with the feeling that anything pivotal to the telling of the story will be included in the final chapter, and if I want every nook and cranny of what Tolkein envisioned...I can pick up the books.<br/><br/>Until then, I'll just appreciate what Jackson and the entire troupe accomplished, not gripe about what they did not.  Bravo!"

","'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' continues exactly where the first left off.  The majestic panoramic shots introduce the viewer to the frenzy that is 'The Lord of The Rings' and the epic saga continues as the audience quickly becomes reacquainted with the cast of characters that first appeared last Christmas. Director Peter Jackson closely adheres to his general strategy that was introduced in the first film. Seeing as the three films were filmed consecutively, his strategy seems to be efficient. This strategy includes picturesque cinematography, stunning visual effects and his trademark and climactic theatrical action sequences are all included in this arcane three-hour opus that is not applicable to all tastes. Those fans that have religiously followed the filming and releases will be quite pleased with the end result. Fans such as myself who first tasted the LOTR aura will also enjoy the film, and more so, might enjoy it even more than the first film. It is a much more thought provoking film as the unexplained is explored and the entire film serves as a nice supplement to the origin piece. It should be mentioned that Jackson is not trying to win over any new LOTR fans, he starts his picture quickly and galvanizes the viewer with a myriad of subplots the viewer must swiftly adapt to as they all have one link - the ring. Upon the first film's release last Christmas, I was very skeptic about the quality of the film residing in the hands of Director Peter Jackson. His previous efforts included the small film 'Heavenly Creatures' and the Michael J. Fox Horror/Comedy 'The Frighteners'. Yet upon the original LOTR film completion, I respected and admired the filmmaker for his ambitious undertaking, but could not find myself frenzied with the film. This was in part to my stubborn view that Jackson had more focus on style than substance. In my eyes, the original wanted to impress more than tell a story. As such, while the first film was grand in its' own way, the second reigns superior due to its juxtaposition of subplots, main plot and gothic approach in story telling. The second film neglects the aspect of brotherhood and good reason, themes the first film heavily explored. This film also releases focus on the power of the ring, this piece looks at the journey of one's inner strength, as all our characters must succumb to the realization that their mission to destroy the ring might destroy themselves. This realization arises due to the separation of our 7 characters that appeared in the original film. In this session, they are one less and the six characters embark on a journey separate from one another all in the hopes of one mission - destroying the ring. Fans will remember Jackson made it a point to demonstrate the power of the ring, yet in this film, the power is emoted in a subtle manner. Its' carrier, Frodo (played once again with childish angst by Elijah Wood) is held hostage by the mystical power of this ring and instead of displaying its utter destruction upon others, Jackson shows the inner battle of Frodo between himself and the ring. As the carrier of the ring, many inner battles arise as he must guard himself and others from the malevolence of the ring. Far superior than the first, this film captures all the mythology, the mystery and the metamorphosis between all the characters and their descent into a fierce battle with the villains of Middle-earth. This film is a bleak, morbid, dark three hour epic that moves much more quickly than the first in terms of plot development. As always, the action sequences are spectacular and serve not as eye candy, but as a device of story telling. Jackson fills his frames and paints his pictures with uber-detail as each frame of this film carries his imprint. It would be unfair of me to fully review this film, as I aforementioned; this is not a film I would regularly look forward to. Mythology and folklore are not cinematic themes that appease me, yet the quality of this film is above standard and its style are to be envied.  As such, I know many critics have also hailed this film a masterpiece and one of the year's best films. Let me repeat, this is not the type of film that excites me terribly. Yet, it still is a good film, with phenomenal production values and a score by Howard Shore that will leave you breathless during the epic sequences. That said, come Oscar time, it will not obtain as much attention as the first did.  The film holds nothing revolutionary except for a CGI Composition that actually becomes a key figure within the film.<br/><br/>The stunning complexity behind the character 'Smeagol', a devilish looking creature stalking Frodo and Sam (the Hobbits guarding the ring) is astonishing. The New Zealand Company Weta Digital has pushed the limits of technology with a psychotic and at times quite amicable creature that plays with the feelings of the audience as he battles his inner psychosis. The craft and artisanship behind this character allowed it to be a truly believable and viable character able to emote feeling, anger and inner hatred. As the movie progresses, we discover this creature - Smeagol was not always a hideously disfigured creature, but he contains a past directly linked with the ring. And as the film ends, he plays a pivotal role in setting up the final and grandest of the three pictures. It is difficult to review a film of this caliber. It can be summarized clearly this film; in my opinion it is one notch above the original. It focuses less on the Orcs and all the other evil-doers and spotlights the ring and the  journey behind it, and what lies ahead. This is truly another ambitious undertaking and a testament to Jackson's passion for the film. Jackson has tremendous actors in front of the camera allowing to capture some wonderfully framed sequences and the irreverent Sir Ian McKellan returns once again as Gandolf. The cast is just a small element of a film that marries myth and method in quite a sublime way. It encompasses adventure, myth, inner hatred, greed and most of all temptation. While it surely will not be on my Top 5 List of 2002, it still is recommended if the material attracts you.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: **1/2"

","This movie, like all others based upon epic books, will always leave some confused, frustrated, dissappointed, and down right pissed off. No movie can ever bring a book to life no matter how true they stay to the original novel. So Jackson, in his attempt to not only bring the books to life but to also make a movie, has tinkered with the story. He has cut here, expanded there, and just used his own imagination to develop parts in the movie Tolkien never imagined in the book. When all is said and done a person who loved the books does a great disservice to him/herself if they don't just watch instead of study. The beauty of Tolkiens story was that it entertained us. It brought us into a world called Middle-Earth and it never let us go, even when the final chapter of the book had been read. Jackson is doing the same thing, only in a different way.<br/><br/> **********SPOILERS*********************<br/><br/> Lets get to the changes. First, and possibly most serious, is the fact that Faramir is far different in the movie then the book. His basic character is changed. I for one was never a fan of Faramir or Boromir, never really cared for either, but Jackson takes far too many liberties with him then need be. Instead of passing the test of the ring in the lands outside of Mordor and sending Frodo on his way with Sam and Gollum, Faramir drags the threesome to Gondor, where he is ready, able and willing ti hand the little hobbitt with the little ring over to his father and thus destroy all hope that remains. I think Jackson did it to lengthen the journey through/to Morod part of the movie but it was not needed. Faramir also warned Frodo of Gollum and the path he proposed to take them on in the book, but not in the movie.<br/><br/> Second, the whole romance between Arwen and Aragorn, and the displeasure Elrond exhibits towards it, is overplayed here. No one cares if Arwen leaves the shores of Middle Earth. She wasn;t a large character in the books and she is not that interesting in the movies. And Galadriel showing up out of no where, just to get some screen time, makes no sense either.<br/><br/> Third, the elves never do show up at Helms Deep to help out the men of Rohan. This, in my opinion, is the worst decsion Jackson has made. To underscore the Rohirrim in favor of a brigade of Elves coming to help out in Helms Deep was a wrong decision in my opinion. I would have rather seen the fight of Helms Deep the book portrayed rather then the one Jackson dreamed up.<br/><br/> But what did work?<br/><br/> Gollum!!! I can't explain to you the startling reality of this character. I always found Gollum to be one of the most complex, interesting, disgusting yet pitiable characters anyone has ever created. This character is EVERYTHING he was in the books. He is perfect, as if Jackson simply opened his copy of LOTR and Gollum jumped out asking to see his precious. You fear him yet you pity him yet you like him yet you distrust him. He IS the character of Gollum. And the precision of the CGI on this character is amazing. He has feeling, emotions, and actions that are displayed through his eyes and his face. You don't think of him as a CGI character when you see him, you think of him as a pitiful creature, but one that is real. OUTSTANDING!!!<br/><br/> The Ents!!!!! The book basically tells you, in much more eloquent terms then I use now, "" These guys are kinda crappy until they get p****d, then watch your a**."" And boy do they get going. The attack of Isengard by the Ents is incredible. It is brief but the power of the Ents, and the anger of Treebeard come to life in those moments.<br/><br/> Helms Deep!!!!! Sure it is a little far fetched to have Gimli and Aragorn fighting 100 Orcs on a bridge all by themselves and not being touched, but who cares. They are heroes, right? They are the modern day Beowulfs, right? And didn't Tolkien write a story where a little hobbit killed a Nazgul? So that isn't a big deal. And the action, the action is incredible. The fight is overwhelming. The Orcs are never ending, the bravery is unquenchable, and intensity is palpable. One of the best battle scenes movies have produced.<br/><br/> Finally, the characters!!! The love of Tolkiens stories, in my opinion, rest first on the amazing world the man created, then second on the amazing characters the man created to inhabit that world. In and out of the novels moved characters, some important to the story, such as Treebeard and Elrond, and others not so important but yet enchanting, such as Tom Bombadill. But the main characters are the ones most of us fell in love with. They were our eyes and ears. They carried our swords, killed the orcs we would have killed, and braved the hopelessness of the dark places the way we would have liked to. We loved them. And in this movie these characters come to life. Aragorn is strong and kingly, yet humble and unwilling to force his heritage on anyone. Gimli is strong, funny, awkward, and head strong, yet loveable. Legolas is exotic, fearless, and full of joy in times that seem to be devoid of such emotion. Frodo is weak, tired, stressed, fearful, yet loving even to the creature Gollum. Sam is simple yet strong and fearless and while Frodo is the bearer of the ring, for all intensive purposes Sam is the keeper of that ring and its mission. And Gollum is astounding.<br/><br/> The characters are what drives this movie, our love, our hate, and our fear of all of them, but mostly by our deepest desire to see all of the main characters reach their goals.<br/><br/> Go see this movie. Go see it tonight so that you can go see it tommorow. Go see it after Christmas and then read the books over again so you can be ready for the next one. But while you are watching the film, put the books down and enjoy the show. Enjoy middle earth."

","Excellent, considering how hard reading the book is and the special effects of Gollum make harry potter's Dobby look like something out of pinky and perky. Only one misfire of the effects caught my eye, when Legolas charges the wargs, watch out for it. The acting is still top notch.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have with LOTR:TTT is that it is another  year until Return of the King.<br/><br/>To sum up, this is a highly recommended film that will blow you away with battle scenes that go above and beyond Braveheart and co. Go see, a must."

","The Two Towers presents a worthy successor to last years The Fellowship of the Ring. I eschew the word sequel as it is not truly a sequel but a second installment in a continuous story that has been divided into three parts. I am hesitant to pass complete judgment until all three films have been released as it will only be then that we will be able to see the story totally unfolded and then that we will be able to see exactly how Peter Jackson has constructed the story as a whole. After the first two parts, however, it seems as though the story is in good hands.<br/><br/>
This film presents a sound plot driven action epic. It is shorter on the character development than the first installment and throws a couple new characters at us with little time to get to know them, however, considering the circumstances in which the characters find themselves it does not feel like a disservice. The actors all do an admirable job inhabiting larger than life figures. Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, and Ian McKellan especially invest their characters, the three who stand above all others with a sense of the grandeur of the goodness that drives these men. Special mention must also go to Andy Serkis for breathing remarkable life into the animated creation of Gollum, perhaps the most interesting character in the entire film.<br/><br/>The true star, however, is Peter Jackson who brings together a gigantic epic with a touch that is pitch perfect. He has done an impressive job of bringing to life a fantasy world and making it not only look beautiful and marvelous but feel real and inhabited. The massive battle at Helm's Deep is a remarkable feat of movie making and is without a doubt the greatest battle scene of its kind ever committed to film. What is perhaps most impressive about Jackson's achievement, however, is the manner in which he moves effortlessly between the epic scope of the battle sequences and the more intimate journeys followed by the pairs of hobbits.<br/><br/>Jackson weaves together three story lines and brings us three hours closer to the conclusion and does it all in epic fashion."

","Coming into the theater, I was concerned that the awe and wonder that accompanied the initial viewing of ""Fellowship"" would leave me a bit disappointed in ""Towers"" - delightfully, I was wrong!  Though now accustomed to the perfect depiction of the Tolkien characters, and the beauty of the scenery and filming of ""Middle Earth"", I was thoroughly impressed by the new visual effects and gripping portrayals of characters such as ""Gollum,"" ""Wormtongue,"" and the Ents.  Peter Jackson has done it again - folks. This is definitely a movie you don't want to see on video.  The action is gripping, the characters riveting, and the storylines perfectly interwoven. As I left the theater I heard one young woman say, ""I don't even like ""The Lord of the Rings"" but I loved this movie!!""  You won't be disappointed - but you will laugh, gasp, worry, empathize, and wonder during this movie. Don't miss it!"
"tee_owe","9","0","0","19 December 2002"," Great, but not quite as good as the first movie
","There are two ways, really, to look at a movie: you can deconstruct it and look at the component pieces, or you can look at it whole and just see how it feels.<br/><br/>Let's start by looking at The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers the first way.  The action is beautifully filmed, with the vistas creating the proper sense of vastness or intimacy.  The acting performance are again all better than mediocre; I mean they were all wonderful and credible, even if there were no (live action) standout performances such Sir Ian McKellan's in The Fellowship of the Ring.  The musical score once again lent its epic sensibility; pounding intensely during the battle scenes and smoothly easing the audience in interludes to the action, but never getting in the way. Howard Shore rules our earways.<br/><br/>The screenplay had some minor issues, and there were a few significant deviations from the book, but the dialogue never seemed awkward.  Gimli provides some comic relief.  Faramir, for example, comes off as a much less level-headed guy than he was in the source material.  The Ent scenes left out a lot of Tolkein's art. And Shelob is onhold til the third installment...<br/><br/>The direction impacts the prespective of the shooting, the characterizations and the overall pace.  Once again Peter Jackson nearly aces this stuff. The battle scenes are especially memorable and terribly realistic.  As reader of the novels, the pacing seemed awkward at times to me, but this is likely a function of the movie being in the middle.  There are three plot strands with the same origin, and the same ending point, which are both out of scope for this film.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the plot.  The classic good versus evil struggle is maintained with pleasingly clear boundaries, at least at the higher level. The film never gets boring, and is never really trite.<br/><br/>But the real star of this movie is the special effects. And the headliner here is Gollum.  One review I read said Gollum still looked computer generated at first, but then we forgot all about that.  I agree.  Gollum is simply captivating  He alternately creepy and pitiful, homely and at times so ugly he's almost cute.  The actor, Andy Serkis, who wore a motion capture suit during filming, voiced the character beautifully.  As one of my friends who saw the movie with me said, ""This is better than anything the Star Wars ever put out.""<br/><br/>The fury of the Ents is something to behold. although the Ents themselves are not quite as spectacular.  A scene like that might have been corny in a lesser-crafted film, but here it was just awesome.<br/><br/>My thoughts when looking at the film as whole?  Not quite as nice as Fellowship, but still nice.  My main and only complaint is that I never got invested into Aragorn and the others enough to really deeply care about their adventures. I cared but not just as much as I thought I should. This was likely because there was so much plot in the film.<br/><br/>So technically, TTT was a slighty better film. But I thought FOTR was a marginally better movie, made even more complete in the extended version. I look forward to TTT's extended version, where I expect the minor flaws will be addressed.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mccabe_mike","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," An amazing achievement
","The Two Towers is an excellent movie.  The special effects, in particular, are extremely well done.  You really get a great sense of the massive amounts of people/orcs involved in the battles.  That sense of a huge crowd/army is something that The Two Towers achieves, that no other film has ever come close to matching.<br/><br/>Gollum/Smeagol is such an amazing character in the book and I was very happy to see him become what is destined to be, a classic movie character.  At times, he seemed a little bit too bright, which gave him away as a CG character.  But, there were also times where he looked so incredibly real, that you cannot help but view him and watch him as you would a regular, ""human"", character.  Andy Serkis deserves a nomination for the character he helped create, and The Two Towers should win the Academy Award for Best Special Effects because of what has been achieved with Gollum/Smeagol alone.<br/><br/>Seeing the continued battle between Gandalf and the Balrog was so good, it had me wishing that I had my DVD remote with me so I could watch it again and again.  It opens the movie with a bang and it resonates so strongly, it's kind of difficult for the other things in the beginning of the movie to feel as important.<br/><br/>That feeling of ""importance"" is not as apparent in The Two Towers as it was in The Fellowship of the Ring.  Of course, it IS a ""middle"" movie, and that important feeling is going to be somewhat missing, regardless of what happens.  But I think it's more the pacing and flow of The Fellowship that makes it seem like a more ""important"" movie.<br/><br/>Scripting and filming HUGE battle scenes is extremely difficult.  But Peter Jackson set the bar so high with Fellowship, I was expecting even more this time.  Unfortunately, we don't get as many ""bad-ass"" moments in Two Towers, as we did in Fellowship.  As I already stated, being able to witness a battle that has so many characters fighting against each other is absolutely incredible.  But, I was hoping to see more examples of how Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas are superior warriors to the rest of the masses.  In the first movie, I was blow away by how calm Legolas was while he stabbed an orc in the eye with an arrow, then shot the same arrow at another Orc.  I wanted to see more of that sort of thing.  I wanted to see more of Gimli as a fearless and accomplished warrior, and less of him being the comic relief.  But, perhaps those are just things that I selfishly wanted to see on the screen. As things are, I really can't complain.  It's incredible and it needs to be seen.<br/><br/>The two worst parts (and these are VERY minor) of the movie are: 1)The Aragorn/Arwen love story 2)Legolas on a skateboard<br/><br/>I understand the use of Aragorn/Arwen love story, but I feel that it interrupts the natural flow of the movie.  Basically, it doesn't fit and takes WAY too long.<br/><br/>During the battle of Helm's Deep, Legolas slides down a stone staircase on an arm shield.  This feels totally contrived and remember thinking, ""What movie is this? Is this Two Towers (xXx Remix)?""  It was just weird and out of place.<br/><br/>But whatever.  I'm being over critical.<br/><br/>The movie is very, very good.  It's not quite as good as the first one, but it's still very good.  If you liked the book, you will love this movie. If like huge battle scenes, you will love this movie.  If you loved the first movie, you HAVE to see this movie."

","I took my 3 teenage boys to see the Two Towers last night and loved every minute of it.  Peter Jackson has done a quite different movie than The Fellowship of the Ring.  This movie is literally 'darker'.  Heavy Heavy fighting scenes, lots of action, which I had heard some people complain about the lack of 'big'scenes (other than the prologue) in FOTR. I thought the acting, again, was superb.  I have to remind myself that this is a fantasy so true are the actors to their characters.  Viggo Mortenson again stands out but David Wenham as Faramir was also superb.  None of the cast was anything but outstanding.  Peter Jackson tackled a difficult storyline and did it so well that even after 3 hours of sitting in the theater, I wanted more.  I would have liked more about the Ents attaching Isenguard as I think it was rushed, but likely the entended DVD will have more on this.<br/><br/>I also think the costuming was wonderful.  Weta again produces great visual design for this movie.  Overall, I would give it the highest points possible.  I plan to see it again tonight."

It may a have suffered initially with no recapitulation from the first film, but after that it just keeps getting better and better until it reaches its climax in the battle of Helm's Deep. Gollum is excellent (who is Dobby?) as is Treebeard. If Ian McKellen excelled in the first film, here we see Viggo Mortensen reaching out for greatness. Still the real star of the film is Gollum.

","This movie is beefy. I loved it but I will have to see it again before I can provide an accurate rating. I can say this though: Gollum was amazing! I had some reservations about him due to my dislike for all digital actors (first and foremost being Jar Jar Binks) but the second he showed up on screen I was won over. But even though Gollum was seamless I was less impressed by the effects in general. The blue screening Of Merry and Pippin in the Fangorn Forest was very shoddy, as was the Nazgul over the Dead Marshes. Effects wise, it was more ambitious than The Fellowship of the Ring, so it was inevitable that the cracks were going to show through.  There has been a lot of talk about Peter Jackson taking liberties with the story, and as far as I am concerned,  it makes for a better film going experience. Where he has given the hobbits short shrift, and emphasized the darker aspects of the story, he has made several improvements over Tolkein, including: A) The corruptive power of the Ring; B) The duality of Gollum; and C) the character of Aragorn. In the books, Aragorn is initially one of the more appealing characters but as the story progresses he becomes increasingly long winded and regal to a fault. In the films, he is infinitely more interesting as he makes the transition from rogue to king. I am intrigued by him every step of the way.  It is a thing of beauty that one of my favorite books is becoming the greatest pop fantasy to ever hit the screen."
"Thieron","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," It'll make you drool for the next one
","First of, it is not as good as Fellowship.  It is however, almost as good. There were few elements I didn't like about the movie and many, many I did.<br/><br/>Most people are talking about the CG.  And most people are focused on Gollum.  I want to give a mention to the Ents.  We all knew about what Gollum should look like, but how do you animate a tree.  Now we know.  The Ents were perfect.  There is no other way to decribe it.  Their distinct appearance, their voices, their mannerisms are all just brilliant.  Gollum is almost perfect.  He still has that slight unreal look that all CG has that tells you he isn't really there, but from the way the actors and Gollum himself behave, it doesn't cause a problem.  He is animated, alive, and acts on the environment around him better than any CG character to date.  There is a scene where Gollum and Smeagol complete for dominance that will blow you away.<br/><br/>While everyone was anticiapting the Battle of Helms Deep, few people were ready for the battle at Isenguard.  I think this stole the movie.  The Ents rampage was just amazing and there wasn't a second in the battle you though they were fake.  It just felt like the keep was being torn apart.  Helms Deep was one of the best action sequences ever.  It is fast paced, intense, and features large and small scale fights all around to keep the variety going.  The battle builds and builds until its wonderful climax that will have you cheering in your seat.<br/><br/>Now, I would give Fellowship a 10.  It is the perfect movie for that story. I give Two Towers, really, a 9.5.  The problem in it are not enough to drop it more than that however.  My problem, you ask?  Is the pace of the movie. Unlike Fellowship, which really, has two parts, Two Towers builds and builds for 2 hours until the Battle of Helms Deep.  After the first 1.5 hours I was just eager to see the Battle and urging the movie to get on to it.  There were a few small bits of action during the first 2 hours, but mostly it was story.  Mind you good story, but 2 hours is a long, long time to build up to something.  Especially when it seemed that it took forever just to watch the warriors of Rohan preparing for the Battle of Helms Deep.  Also, to create some tension, they make it seem like a key character might be dead, but it is a character you know will live, even if they don't stick to the books, this character is too important to die now.<br/><br/> Then, once the Battle of Helms Deep start, there are breaks to the rest of the story, which is still slowly developing.  It isn't until there are battles in all parts of the story that the pace really moves and you can't even sit back for a good 30 minutes.  I wish they had started all the battles at the same time, so that while you would break from story to story, there would be action in all of them, so the last hour would be nothing more than a nonstop fight.  The intensity of Helms Deep is just too great to switch to the Ents talking and Frodo walking.  It is too much a shock in pace to feel confortable.<br/><br/>That is why I'd say Two Towers is a 9.5.  However, once the ending is in full gear, it makes up for just about any problems with the movie.  The Battle of Helms Deep is amazing and filled with bits that will leave you in glee and the Ents rampage at Isenguard will just leave you with chills."
"david-draper-name","Null","0","0","19 December 2002"," Bitterly disappointed
","After a year of intense anticipation after the first, excellent installment of LOTR, I was bitterly disappointed.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>The film deviated drastically from the story line of the book, and although I fully understand that it can't (and probably shouldn't) stick right to the book, the way they deviated violated the spirit of the story in a big way. The changes made in ""Fellowship"", although substantial, were by comparison quite natural ones that did not at all violate the intent of the tale. Here, whole sections are inserted that did not appear in the story at all,and the motivations and actions of crucial, central characters are fundamentally altered.  I spent at least a third of the movie just shaking my head in disbelief. Time was wasted on inserted material to the extent that the third film will have no chance of covering all the crucial events it should contain, especially the Scouring of the Shire-- there is no way there will be time to include that, and I predict that the last film will end simply with the destruction of the Ring.<br/><br/>The biggest problems for me with Two Towers were as follows.<br/><br/>1) Faramir not showing the nobility he did in the book.  Instead, he lusts for the ring as did Boromir, and TAKES FRODO TO OSGILIATH for pete's sake. This entirely made-up section wasted time they should have spent showing Frodo, Sam, and Gollum heading up Morgul Vale and into the Cleft of Cirith Ungol for the showdown with Shelob and Frodo's eventual capture by the orcs of Mordor.  The cliffhanger ending should have been when Sam collapses against the door to the orc-tunnel (CLANG!), or at the very least with Frodo appearing to be dead, wrapped in the shrouds of Shelob.  With respect to Faramir, a major theme of LOTR was the ability of Men like Faramir to do the right thing simply because it was the right thing to do (i.e. aid Frodo and let him continue his journey), and that a warrior can be accomplished in arms while still being thoughtful, kind, and well-read.<br/><br/>2) The Ents' deciding at first to take no action against Saruman until Merry and Pippin trick Treebeard into walking into a section of destroyed forest. The real story was that the news the two hobbits brought to Fangorn roused the Ents to cold-eyed fury and set them into motion as an implacable foe. For Treebeard to suddenly change his mind upon seeing the burned out forest flies in the face of the most important facet of what makes Ents who they are: Not being hasty.<br/><br/>3) The long, misty-eyed flashbacks with Arwen.  I realize this material is more or less contained in the Appendices to LOTR, but to include those sequences in Two Towers wasted screen time that should have been spent advancing the story.  These sequences seem to have no purpose other than to put female faces on the screen. Yes, Tolkien's work was male-dominated-- get over it.  I would cheerfully spend hours watching Liv Tyler emote onscreen, but this was not the place for it.<br/><br/>4) Miscellaneous: Aragorn falls over a cliff and floats down a river for a couple days while everyone thinks he's dead.  The Ents do not send the Huorns to Helm's Deep.  Gandalf returns with Eomer's company instead of leading Erkenbrand's people, eliminating the friendship between Aragorn and Eomer; and wasn't Gandalf *inside* the Keep during that battle?<br/><br/>Bottom line is that all this time spent on the inserted material and on the faulty depictions of crucial characters ensured they could not reach the point in the story at which Two Towers actually ends, despite having had a head start by including The Passing of Boromir at the end of Fellowship. No Cirith Ungol, no entry into Mordor, no expulsion of Saruman from the Order by Gandalf breaking his staff.  This guarantees that there is no way they'll have time to present the Scouring of the Shire in Return of the King, which is in my view *the* central tenet of the story: The hobbits returning home to set their own community to rights after having matured and grown via their experiences in the War of the Ring.  I do not see how the series can recover from the terrible choices made in this film.<br/><br/>Now for the positive.  What *was* there was spectacularly well done.  The acting is just as good as the first film, and the execution of the sweep of the events was outstanding.  Those elements that did stay close to the real story were very nearly flawless, which makes the deviations summarized above particularly anguishing.  The real story would have been no more challenging cinematically than what was in the film (Helm's Deep alone was a monumental filmic undertaking), and there is absolutely no doubt that Jackson and Co. would have made it every bit as stunning as they did the 2/3 of the film that stayed on-topic.<br/><br/>For those who are not devoted fans like myself, it stands as a fine film. If they had just not gone so far from the story line it would have been a masterpiece.  As it is, these wholesale changes are so egregious that I don't even think I want to see it again, unlike Fellowship which I have viewed half a dozen times now."

","Personally, I loved this movie.  It's better than 'Fellowship', in my opinion.  Also, note that I say ""movie"", not ""book.""  There's no way that any movie based on a book can be an exact facsimile of said book.  It just doesn't happen.  Book and film are two entirely different mediums; they can't be done in the same way.  I personally welcome the changes; I'm always intrigued by new perspectives.  And this is Peter Jackson's take on the tale, not Tolkien's.  He knew this was not going to be an easy task to take on, and I think he's doing an amazing job.<br/><br/>There were many things I loved about this movie.  First, the landscapes are incredible, they are more vivid in this film than they ever were in my mind. I probably missed a few things in the film because I was too busy being in awe of the scenery.  It simply enhances the film.<br/><br/>But more than anything, I enjoyed the characters.  Gollum is a great character, he is torn between his lust for the ring and a desire to do good. Who cares how realistic the CGI looks?  I sure as hell don't.  I don't understand why this is such a big deal.  It's the characters that are what's important, not the graphics.  Two of my favorite characters have always been Sam and Aragorn.  Sam is ever loyal to Frodo, keeping the faith even when Frodo falters.  I loved seeing more of him in this movie.  And Aragorn, well, he is the epitome if heroism.  There were points in the film were I physically applauded his ability to will others on when they had run out of hope.  All of the other characters are fantastic as well.  Yes, I thought sometimes Gimli functioned solely for comic relief, but the audience laughed, as if thankful for a moment of levity in such a dark movie.  And, of course, Legolas is such a complete badass that he steals nearly every fighting sequence he's in.<br/><br/>Finally, the battle of Helm's Deep was incredible.  The whole movie seemed to function as a setup for the battle, and I was not disappointed.  I won't say anything more, it has to be seen to be appreciated, but a movie has never before made me feel the way I did in those tense moments before all hell broke loose.  It's as if I was unable to catch my breath, which I was not able to do until the battle was over.  This movie was phenomenal, an absolutely engaging tale of hope, sacrifice, and trust in those closest to you; three things there simply aren't enough of these days.  All this movie has done is drive me to read the book once more.  10/10."

","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is, as expected, an amazing movie. Although, it lacks the pure brilliance of The Fellowship of the Ring, it is no disappointment.  Tolkien fans have criticized Two Towers as being untrue to the book, but I believe it comes as close as is absolutely possible to achieve an enjoyable movie.  Everything about this movie is superb.  The acting was incredible, especially the role of Gollum (played by Andy Serkis), the special effects were magnificent, and the cinematography was stunning. The only complaint that I have is the lack of screen time for some of the main players like Gandalf (Ian McKellan), and Eowyn (Miranda Otto). Otherwise, TTT was a perfect example of a movie masterpiece. This movie is worth seeing for any Tolkien fan, ringnut, or otherwise, and all those who just enjoy watching a good movie."

Its a somewhat different movie than the first half of LOTR 1, but picks up nicely where that feature left off (pace wise).<br/><br/> There are some minor changes from the book, but those changes don't negatively affect the movie in any serious way.

","This is an awesome movie.  I've seen it twice now, and I'll probably see it twice more before it leaves the theatres.<br/><br/>Part two continues the outstanding work done on Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.  There is a bit more liberty taken with the plot in this one, but with good pacing and balance.   The book tends to drag quite a bit in the second volume, as very long plot lines are developed, and the movie does a very good job of keeping things moving with both action and plot development.<br/><br/>The special effects are state of the art, and very creative.  The Ents were particularly well done.  Wargs, which look more like the hyenas in ""The Lion King"" than anything else, were quite good as well.  The flying Nazgul didn't quite fly right, but was otherwise very realistic. Gollum is heart-wrenchingly pathetic, and utterly believable.<br/><br/>The cinematography is actually better in this movie than the first, if you can believe it, and the acting shows at least as much depth.  Go see it in the theatre!<br/><br/>Don't sit in the front rows for this one, unless you are not prone to motion sickness.  There are *many* full-speed, full-screen action shots that are breathtaking, but could be rough on your inner ear if you are up front.<br/><br/>There are some surprises in here for Tolkien fans.  The writers worked some new things in for Aragorn, presumably to make the relationships with Eowyn and Arwen develop well on-screen.  The new twists work, and are like the substitution of Arwen for Glorfindel in the first book: they actually strengthen the plot rather than weaken it.<br/><br/>There is one major departure from Tolkien which bothers me about this movie, however, and it is the same thing that bothered me about Fellowship of the Ring.  Tolkien was painting a very believable fantasy world in which there was nevertheless true nobility in the midst of easily swayed and tempted creatures.  Aragorn represents a return to a more noble state of humanity -- Elrond even calls him the image of the earliest kings in glory undiminished from the beginning.   Yet Aragorn in the Fellowship movie comes across as a lost soul who has turned away from his destiny, rather than the true king awaiting his time.  He does seem to be developing his character in the Two Towers, however, and is beginning to show something of a kingly nature.<br/><br/>In the same fashion, Faramir supposedly hearkens back to the earlier days of Gondor, in which there was true greatness among the people of Gondor.  Yet in the movie, Faramir is just as weak, just as fallen, as Boromir.  His actions towards Frodo, Sam, and the Ring are even more debased than Boromir's, and more alarming.  He does realize his error, but it seems unnecessary.<br/><br/>Boromir's and Faramir's father Denethor (not in this movie, but in the next) we can expect to be like this, so Faramir represents the counterpoint. Denethor and Faramir are good and great men, father and son.  One chooses pride as a way of life, and lords it over a kingdom as Steward in a losing war.  The other chooses humility as a way of life, and finds in service a greatness beyond that of his father.<br/><br/>Part of what makes LOTR one of the greater literary works of the past century is its ability to communicate that we all do face choices between Valinor and Mordor (essentially heaven and hell), we do not have to be born the heir of kings to live nobly, and real examples do exist, for we all have the seeds of greatness within ourselves.  Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are all very ordinary characters, but they all achieve a kind of greatness through their struggles.   I think Tolkien would say, ""So may we all."""

Of course they are some truly amazing stuff in that sequel, ""Gollum/Smeagol"" for instance is nearly perfect, and the 45 minutes action scenes with thousands of CGI figures are impressive even though I think the few seconds of the war against Sauron's army they showed in the opening of the first movie were more inspired. But frankly the overall result didn't convince me. The movie is definitively less cohesive and the way they shrink Tolkien's narrative is abusive: L.O.T.R. has been ""blockbusterized"" at the level of a cheap action film.<br/><br/>Following is a few examples:<br/><br/> - Opening: the first 10 mns are important in any typical Hollywood movies to hook up the viewer but now its getting ridiculous.<br/><br/> - Humor: nothing wrong with it! BUT kill-bad-guy, make-a-joke, kill-bad-guy is a pattern I've seen in too many bad movies.<br/><br/> - Aragorn is getting prepared for war !

"rockford_hinten","9","0","0","19 December 2002"," More impressive than the first
","I was very impressed with this movie.  It was even better than _Fellowship_. Fellowship was a bit slow sometimes because they had to introduce characters and start building the story.  This one took right off from there in full-tilt action and plot progression.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with their portrayal of Smeagol/Gollum and Frodo's relationship with him.  They did a nice job emphasizing it as multiple personality disorder, like Green Goblin in Spiderman.  I found it very meaningful that Frodo realizes first-hand what a torture the ring is, and what it has done to Smeagol.  His pity manifests itself in attempting to help him and save him by reminding him of who he once was. (""It is the name of your true self--you've only forgotten.""-ROTJ ;) )  That attempted redemption in Return of the Jedi is strikingly similar to this one, except that this meets with less success.<br/><br/>I only have a small problem with this movie, and that was some of its deviations from the story in the original book it is based on.  No spoilers here, but it threw in several things that just weren't in the book.  I won't fault that in the movie rating, though, because this is a movie producer's portrayal of it, and the things they changed actually made for a better movie than the book plot would have done.<br/><br/>For those who have read the books, I was surprised to see where this movie ended in the progression of plot, compared to the books.  This movie stops well short of where _The Two Towers_ book gets to.  It makes me wonder if we are in for a running time pushing 4 hrs. for Return of the King, or if they are just going to cut a lot of stuff out to fit in the end of Two Towers' plot and then all of Return of the King's plot."

","If you are a fan of the first movie, don't bother reading any reviews, just get down to the theatre.<br/><br/>PJ takes more liberties with the second installment of LOTR but you'll get over it.<br/><br/>My point of view is that of someone who has practically memorized the books, and who liked the first movie, especially the extended version. My comments will be most useful to those who have already seen the second film and also know LOTR well. SPOILERS!<br/><br/>One thing I've learned: it's important to see the movie twice, because the first time around I'm distracted by the changes to the dialogue and story.<br/><br/>The film opens with a fantastic vision of Gandalf's battle with the balrog, and it never lets up except for some slow flashback scenes attempting to pad out the Aragorn/Arwen romance.<br/><br/>I never rooted for Eowyn's chances more.<br/><br/>A big change from the book is we see Arwen apparently head off to the Grey Havens. In the books, plenty of pressure has been put on Aragorn already by Elrond, who tells Aragorn his daughter won't be marrying Aragorn unless he can make her queen of Gondor. Ain't that enough? All the scenes of Elrond and Arwen seem to take place in some type of Elvish livingroom, making them feel static.<br/><br/>The battle of Helm's Deep makes you forget all about these problems. Not only is the story closely followed, it is simply the best battle scene ever in any movie.<br/><br/>The Ents are delightful, but they get short shrift. This section feels disjointed and undoubtedly some scenes were cut. The same disjointed feeling happens with Faramir. I expect the extended version will be far better in these areas.<br/><br/>Gollum is so good he is just as painful as he is in the book. He speaks a great deal of unaltered dialogue to great effect.<br/><br/>Frodo is getting on my nerves. Nothing wrong with Elijah's performance, I'm just tired of his eyes glazing over and almost blowing the quest by handing off the ring to a passing Nazgul.<br/><br/>The movie ends before the book does. No Shelob, alas! But I'm okay with it because a great deal of book III can and should be trimmed for the movie [the very long journey of the Riders of Rohan, the trip back to the Shire, etc. I'm guessing PJ is going to have Frodo hop straight on a boat after a much abbreviated version of the scouring of the Shire.<br/><br/>I am wondering how Arwen is going to get back on track.

","`The Two Towers' is by far my favorite of the Tolkien books. Perhaps that's why I left the theater disappointed that Peter Jackson felt it necessary to remove so much of what made the book special, and replace those things with his own unnecessary scenes. I've read a few comments that defend Jackson by saying there just wasn't enough time to represent the book accurately. Well, perhaps he could have found more space if he hadn't spent half the movie showing characters on horseback riding around in long panoramic shots that slowed the pace of the movie. They rode in, and they rode out. They rode in, and they rode out. They rode in, and they rode out. They rode in, and they rode out. See, isn't that annoying?  I mean, I started checking my watch after about a half dozen of these. What on earth happened? Where's the storyof the Ents? Where's the confrontation of Gandolf and Saruman?  Where's the spider? Where's the sense of evil that was present in the book? Why did those hobbits spend most of their time on top of Treebeard composited with a really bad chromakey? Why did he have to show women and children in the caves repeatedly?<br/><br/> About the only thing in this movie that to me had of the depth of Tolkien's work was the character of Gollum. He was brilliantly depicted, and a marvel of 3D animation, but he doesn't save the movie for me.<br/><br/> I saw `The Fellowship' twice in theaters, and bought both the regular and extended versions of the DVD, but I'd be surprised if I'll see this movie again!<br/><br/> >"

Arwen going to the Grey Havens?  Not even mentioned in the literature.  Elves at Helm's Deep?  I don't think so. Frodo and Sam taken to Osgiliath?  Never happened.  What was with keeping Merry and Pippin with the Ents the entire time?  They do so much more in the actual story.  Eomer was never banished by Grima in the novel. Okay, enough nit-picking.  Overall, the film was spectacular.  The pacing was a bit off, though.  As I said, it felt like Merry and Pippin didn't do anything, and the end was not appropriate at all.  There's a lot of plot to be accounted for in the third film.  I suppose, though, that the feeling of detatchment is because this film really is a continuation of the first.  The opening sequence detailing Gandalf's fate was amazing.  There was a lot of clapping in the theater.  The film is not a ""10,"" but deserves no less than an ""8."""

","i just saw the film today and thought i would add my two cents.<br/><br/> no doubt it is a great movie and i give it 9/10. as from the first movie, it has tremendous scenery, action and suspense, and the movie never seems over-long. in fact i wish it kept going!<br/><br/>only negatives i found were that the new characters in this film weren't as interesting or ""fleshed out"" like in the first film. the pace is so hurried there's hardly time for further character development as FOTR. very dark atmosphere permeates the movie, to be expected under the circumstances. characters such as gandalf ""the white"" are more warrior-leader like compared to his previous incarnation. the movie keeps shifting amongst the three seperate fellowship groups now split, and a couple of dream sequences/flashbacks. this makes for a messier flow to the movie than FOTR. also, there's no beginning or end really. even the first movie had an appropriate ""ending"" that set up the sequel, this one is more like sudden stop shortly after the already famous final battle scene. but these issues aren't a major knock as far as i'm concerned, though i can understand how others may find them to be. its obviously a continuation from the first book and should be looked at as such, not simply on its own merits. no one should see this movie without seeing the FOTR first or it won't make sense.<br/><br/>also, if you can't get into fantasy and let your mind go, then you won't be into this either, save for the cinematography which everyone in the world simply must to commend, regardless of taste. Gollum was also terrific! quite a character and so well done.<br/><br/>i did not read the books, and any of the criticism i did see was largely from comparing the books to the movies and some differences that existed. i think that may interfere a bit when one has other ideas what should be shown here or left out there. a guy like me comes in with an open mind to what comes and gets blown away by the incredible events on screen. i can hardly wait til the extended DVD version comes out like it did for FOTR, i believe that forum can provide more scenes to add extra substance and character to a largely action-packed movie.<br/><br/>no doubt this trilogy should be rated as one of THE cinematic achievements, and i can hardly wait til the final one comes next year, and then complete my DVD collection of the series!"

","Well, I loved the books when I read them almost 20 years ago (and I read them 3 times), and I loved the movie adaptation of ""Fellowship.""  I can understand that some things had to be changed for pacing reasons, and commercial reasons, not to mention political correctness (for example, the Wargs look more like boars than wolves, because we couldn't have our heroes killing wolves, could we?).  Frankly, the new stuff thrown in didn't really bother me.  I felt a little disappointed that we don't have as much humorous interaction Merry and Pippin and Treebeard, but I can see how Ent-lore might have bored audiences.  Also, I thought Treebeard's nose looked silly.<br/><br/>The parts that I really had problems with were the Gollum/Smeagol argument (""I'm not hearing this!""--way corny), and the ""Exorcist"" bit they did with Theoden (I almost expected him to say ""Your mother s---- c--- in Hell!!), not to mention his amazingly quick recovery.  Also, they could have made the end of the battle of Helm's Deep more definitive.  We see the tide turned, but no real conclusion after all the fighting.  Maybe Jackson could have included scenes of fleeing Uruk Hai to better illustrate the victory. And the over-use of Gimli as comic relief, not to mention revisiting the dwarf-tossing gag was somewhat annoying, I thought.<br/><br/>I agree with other posters and reviewers who have said that this feels more like a bridge, or the middle of a great film, than a great movie in its own right.  I disagree with reviewers who have said that the huge battle scenes are not true to the spirit of Tolkein.  The massive battles, blood, and gore were always part of the original books.  Even ""The Hobbit,"" a children's book, has its share of gore and lopped-off goblin heads.  Still, I think this movie somewhat lacked the human element of ""Fellowship,"" and the original books."

","I have only seen the movie once so far and it definitely needs/deserves to be seen one more time before I can totally judge it. But otherwise, TTT was everything that I expected it to be - which is that it's no better or worse than FOTR...It's just different. It definitely has a more epic feel to it, which is it's both strenght and a weakness - Peter Jackson just had to do so much that he sometimes forgot to perfection little things. I'm not going to dig myself into detail just yet (I need another viewing, other people will do that better anyway and my English stinks), but before I go I just wanted to point out one little thing:<br/><br/>For every breathtaking pixel near-perfection that is Gollum ,there's outrageously horrible blue-screen work involving Merry/Pippin on top of Treebeard. I don't know what went wrong, but, WETA Digital, I know that you can do a lot better than that. It really put me off and all of a sudden I realized that I was sitting in the theater next to all these weird people.<br/><br/>
Otherwise, thank you again, Peter Jackson and co. for reminding me once again why I love cinema so much. And I meant it in a good way :)"
"mark_reichert","7","0","0","19 December 2002"," Looks fantastic, storyline disappointing
","I thought the movie looked fantastic, just like Fellowship of the Ring, but once again Jackson made COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY changes to the storyline. None of the changes where necessary to condense the story.  In fact, many increased screen time.  I'm not a purist.  I believed the decision to interweave the story of Frodo and Sam and the story of the rest was a correct one since modern audiences expect that sort of thing  like say in the Empire Strikes Back.  The story changes that actually replace parts of the story in the book were not at all necessary.<br/><br/>I would say more but I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the movie.  I'm just warning them that they better not expect the story in the Two Towers volume."

","Understand that Jackson is making a movie, not a cartoon that just reads the script of the book. You can't include anything and everything you want from the book. In fact, you even need to change somethings to keep it interesting.<br/><br/>Faramir being tempted by the ring makes the story more cohesive and emphasizes Aragon's character more. If you don't remember, the ring tempts all living things. Every single man who has seen the ring thus far in the movies has been tempted and tried to get it, with the exception of Aragon. Unfortunately, audiences do not eat up sappy stuff like men are divided into sweet and sour. People want a dues ex machina to come out of the sky at the very end and smite all the problems away. If Faramir's temptation is shown then it serves only to add glory to Aragon.<br/><br/>The elves at Helms-Deep link the story back to the elves. Jackson is making sure the characters are not forgotten and that their nobleness is well known. It ties up loose ends with some major characters by compressing them into a single scene. Remember at the end of Fellowship, there wasn't just a single battle at the end, there were many. But it sums it up in a single more dramatic encounter which adds to the flavor of cinema.<br/><br/>Some stuff was moved to The Return of the King, and understandably so. Anyone complaining that Shelob wasn't in the movie are simply acknowledging Jackson's magnificent use of a cliff hanger.<br/><br/>Stop judging the movie as a book because it isn't. Take a step back and realize just how close it is to the books instead of scrounging for the small breaks of plot. Use your trivia for impressing your friends, not trying to tame a movie of this caliber. Putting a book to script is like translating a Greek passage to French when you're native language is English. You have to understand that both people who have read the book and those who haven't will be seeing the movie and it has to appeal to them both. It's not like Jackson changed all the names to Scott, Bob and Joe, even though it would have been much easier to follow for someone who was unfamiliar with the books.<br/><br/>Plus, I'm sure the extended edition will be more geared for you just as it was this year with many more details and insights."

","warning: spoilers possible<br/><br/>Last night's premiere of the Two Towers was an excellent movie experience, with a few minor quibbles. First, as has been mentioned in some other comments, there are a few scenes where they portray Legolas as a Super Hero, and his antics are so over the top as to illicit more than a few snickers or groans from the audience. Second, some of the battle scenes, though very impressive in their grand scale, have the feel of the Clone War in Attack of the Clones, where you felt like the computer animators just couldn't restrain themselves. Lastly, for a three hour movie, there were times when the pace of the movie was off. Some matters were rushed, and you felt like they needed more explanation, and others dragged on or were repeated seemingly too many times.<br/><br/>On the flip side, the movie has some very fine points. When Gollum first appeared, I was very disappointed at the CGI rendering, and his dialog seemed poorly synced with his mouth. But after that initial sequence, almost everything he did, his movements, the emotions his face conveys, the very depth of his character . . . . it was astounding. It still doesn't replace an actor, but it comes damn close, closer than anything ever presented on film. And the battle scenes are top notch, especially Helms Deep, though the Ent assault on Isengard is very impressive. I personally thought their rendering of the Ents was very well done.<br/><br/>I've read the book, and the book purists will have much to complain about, but I understand the choices Peter Jackson made about deferring much of the story to Return of the King, and making Helms Deep the climax of the film (it's in the middle of the book). And there is a ""Hollywood"" slant to some of the dialog and action sequences that Jackson has taken some liberties with, but the essence and soul of the book come across. I would regard the movie as well worth your money for a big screen ticket and 3.5 hours in a crowded theater. I anxiously await the final picture. 9/10"

","While not entirely true to the book, this movie was incredible. I resented that Jackson added stuff to the movie that was not in the book while leaving out things that happened in the book, and the portrayal of Faramir could have been better. Gollum was exceptionally well done, as were the Ents. Overall, this was an amazing movie. I saw it twice on the first day it opened, so I had plenty of time to examine it. Aside from the aforementioned glitches and a few others, The Two Towers is commendable work. I cannot wait to see what Jackson does with the third, and am anxiously awaiting the extended version on DVD."

","I watched the first screening of TTT in Basel yesterday - and wow, was I impressed!<br/><br/>True, there are things to be criticized and things I personally would have loved to see - but that doesn't change the fact that to me, TTT is an incredibly intense movie! I was captivated right from the start and forgot all about sitting in second row, craning my neck... I loved how each character has at least one moment to shine and that there were a lot of touching and true interactions between them.<br/><br/>If there's one thing to criticize it's that the movie wasn't long enough - I'd have loved to see more of Merry, Pippin and the Ents as well as of Frodo and Sam (there specially more about Faramir). I'm hoping the Extended DVD will remedy some of that... But although I'm really not a fan of big action sequences and therefore didn't expect to enjoy the long long battle scenes, I found myself loving every minute of them, also thanks to Gimli acting as comic relief (admittedly somewhat overdone at times, but that doesn't change the fact that I for one needed those breathers).<br/><br/>Oh, and one more negative thing - how the hell am I supposed to wait another year for ROTK? :)"
"theojhyman","9","0","0","20 December 2002"," WOW!...Need to see it again now!
","Hardly a moment's rest in this film!...very little space to sit back and breathe. It goes straight back into the story and the action, introducing the character, Gollum, almost immediately and putting him at the heart of this middle part of the trilogy. So many great points to commend, especially the battle sequences and even more breathtaking I think - the Ents. Aragorn is the great hero of the movie and Frodo, this time, becomes the sad soul or the victim of the film, because of the pain and burden of bearing the ring. The 2nd book was the best of the trilogy, but I'm expecting the third film to be the best of the movies. This lived up to all expectations and was far from disappointing. However, it seemed to be just a little dumbed down for today's audience for two reasons - the complexity of the 2nd book was extremely difficult to put onto film and that the story was so dark, cold, violent and horrific that Peter Jackson felt he had to lighten it up a little with Gimli's frequent comic lines and Gollum's overplayed cute, childlike innocence, which, while ever apparent in the book, wasn't as oveerplayed as in the film. Sad to see that Merry and Pippin have very little screen time in this film. I'm sure the audience would love to have seen more of them, after having become so attached in the first film. Good to see an emotional depth to the character, Eowyn - excellent, although it did overshadow the love story between Aragorn and Arwen. I'd agree with most other reviewers that this film is not as emotionally involving as the first, as it does concentrate more on the action and story development, compared to the first whose main focus was on characterisation and served to make the first film the more moving and compelling of the two. BUT I don't consider any of these criticisms to be faults of the moviemakers. I think they have tackled the most challenging of stories with a standard that is as close to perfection as you can get in cinema. Out of the 2 films, this is the more watchable - I think people will keep going back to the cinema over the next few months to watch this one again and again. Its pacing is much faster and tighter and I suppose it was quite a clever move to end this film much sooner than the incredible cliffhanger ending in the book. Can't wait to see the next one in a year, and I'll add that all other films over the next 12 months will seem disappointing compared to what we are expecting next December! This movie will soon be in the IMDB Top 10, and perhaps Top 5 ?"
"suro","9","0","0","20 December 2002"," Middle child rocks
","As the second part of the trilogy, The Two Towers is like the middle child. The first movie had been greatly anticipated, and the last movie would be the mother-of-all cataclysmic battles (and of course the grand finale). The middle movie serves to bridge the introductions to the finale. A bridge indeed; it's the Khazad-dum of bridges, and it will make 3 hours seem like 3 minutes.<br/><br/>Faithfulists beware, however, as there are much more 'artistic freedom' present in this installment, although all serve Tolkien's major theme: Pluralism. The defeat of Saruman is not, and cannot be attributed to a singular being or group, and the movie is faithful to that point. However, I did take an exception, despite Frodo's encounter with the Nazgul (never happened), despite Faramir's apparent desire for the Ring (book serves as a contrast to the personalities of the brothers), at the Lorien elves' joining of the battle of Helm's Deep. While their involvement definitely adds to the movie, the book is very clear that the time of Elves had passed, and the book is really a historical perspective of the passing of the elves and the rise of men. For that, I had to take a point off--but my recommendation to see the movie does not change one bit.<br/><br/>The movie must have been incredibly difficult to adapt, as the members of the fellowship have separated and independently pursue their goals. Peter Jackson does a great job keeping the audience involved by interweaving the different plots which all happen pretty much at the same time. Had he followed the book, Frodo and Sam would have made their appearance in the second half, after the breathtaking battle of Helm's Deep. The interweaving is similar to The Return of the King, and with further separation of the Fellowship, the movie due next year should follow the same format.<br/><br/>If there is one thing that stood out, it's the creature Gollum. The sympathy Jackson creates for the creature is almost enough to forgive his major theme deviation (see above), and I think personally he did better than Tolkien did. His inner monologue--with his 'evil' Gollum side vs. his 'nice' Smeagol side--while the Hobbits sleep is indeed memorable and frightening (can you say bipolar?). If there can be an award for a digital character, then Gollum has my vote for best actor.<br/><br/>Those unfamiliar with the novel may find some parts confusing and perhaps unnecessary, as there are still many characters introduced. Do yourselves a favor and read the book; even at over 1,000 pages (including the appendices), time will fly. And most important, you'll appreciate the movies even more."
"Adriane","Null","0","0","19 December 2002"," Even more superior to Fellowship
","First of all, I would like to say that Peter Jackson is the only director who could have done these films. It is overly apparent that he knows the books. He has portrayed Tolkien's vision in a way that Tolkien himself could never have imagined. When I saw Fellowship last year, I knew nothing about the stories, and after viewing it, I immediately bought all the books and was instantly hooked. I thought ""It can only get better from here"", and I was right. The Two Towers never falters, and its action sequences are unlike anything you have ever seen. Unlike Fellowship, this is Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli's film. Frodo and Sam provide the journey to the story, of trying to get rid of the now-heavy and prominent force over Frodo's life. The effects are what made the movie fantastic, they look so real! Although the film is 3 hours, it felt like 20 minutes. I felt as though Jackson had provided seats right there in New Zealand for us, and we watched from the sides like spectators at a football game. Now the hardest part: waiting one more year for the final film. The best movie of the year. *****/5 stars"
"tgeddes","8","0","0","19 December 2002"," Fantastic adaptation... but beware!
","The Two Towers is a wonderful movie, one that stands as a great work on its own. As an adaptation, it also excels, but you have to be willing to forgive the filmmakers for the amount of material they changed. At first, I left the theater a bit unhappy and ticked off. Some things really didn't need to be changed, I thought. They went too far. However, after thinking about it more, there were a lot of things in the books that wouldn't translate well, not to mention the fact that introducing more people, towers, etc. would only serve to confuse the casual movie goer. Also, some characters weren't complex or realistic enough in the books (Faramir), and needed more depth and conflict. Arwen, who is barely mentioned in the books, with exception to her tale in the Appendixes, also needed to have her story, and her love story with Aragorn, expanded, for the sake of realism and believablity. That is the key. There are things in the book that we can accept as readers that casual watcher wouldn't believe. Were the movie geared only toward fans of the books, they could have mentioned all the names they wanted, and given us everything from the books they could have fit in 3 hours. But for the sake of making the trilogy make sense for new viewers, things had to change. I think that even the most jaded fan will appreciate this movie once they understand that. And, most importantly, Peter Jackson kept the mood and attitude right. Details may have changed, but the heart-and-soul of the book remains. That is commendable."
"shakavo-2","8","0","0","19 December 2002"," Two Towers would be better if coupled with Fellowship.
","The Two Towers follows in the footsteps of its predecessor in terms of its incredible sets, exceptional costume design, and top-notch CGI.  It is certainly one of the best looking epics ever shot, and the battle scenes rival (but do not surpass) the intensity of Braveheart's. I cannot say enough about Gollum.  I will say that a best supporting actor nomination is a slim chance for Andy Serkis although the honor would be well deserved.  Gollum's CGI origins are not easily detected as I was expecting, and WETA's ability to create a photo realistic computer generated character should be celebrated for years to come.  Serkis' performance rounds out what may be one of film's greatest achievements. In the same light, the Ents were amazingly designed and compelling.  They did not raise my 'this is CGI' flag.  Great job.<br/><br/>These elements help keep the movie from tanking.  Jackson and company have undertaken a project of magnificent scope in The Two Towers; so magnificent that it barely fits into three hours.  There is no doubt in my mind that the cutting room floor is home to the extra characterization and emotion that this film has forsaken to pave the way for all of the action needed to tell the vast story.  Fellowship brought tears to my eyes on a couple of occasions.  Towers almost did once. As someone else put it, (The Two Towers feels like a whole lot of middle). I agree, and look forward to the extended edition.<br/><br/>It may help to think of The Two Towers as just part of a movie.  It is almost unfair to judge only part of a movie.  The first and third part may stand alone better than the middle part, but I believe that a full realization of the films will come when we are able to sit down and watch all three in a row - possibly the extended editions.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the money making machine known as the box office sways studios from risky decisions such as releasing a 3 1/2 hr. movie, but it is business - and nobody wants to lose money.<br/><br/>Score - 8 out of 10 for great visuals, action, and performances."
"IcemanCometh","9","0","0","18 December 2002"," Jackson continues to channell Tolkien
","The Two Towers: It's official, Lucas is the padawan of film makers, Peter Jackson is the master.<br/><br/>New Line Cinema will go down in the annals as having made a brilliant decision at a time in it's history where a gaffe could have sunken them, and we as filmgoers should be amply grateful that things fell into place the way that they have(these people that gave Jackson LotR also gave Raimi Spiderman - I think I see a trend). Now, granted, Jackson was handed one of the greatest stories ever told to bring to cinematic life, which Lucas was not, but Lucas could certainly follow some leads here on returning some humanity, lightness, and real dimensions into his upcoming swan song; after all, turnabout is fair play - Lucasfilm gave WETA their first leg up on a lot of the CGI technology prior to the Fellowship. But full marks to New Line for making some uncharacteristically shrewd moves at the studio level which are going to continue to pay large dividends over the remainder of the decade. THus far, Lord of the Rings has been all that Episodes I and II have promised to be without any of the sloppy shortcuts.<br/><br/>A steady barrage of well plotted action, more polished performances by a cast little in need of polish in the first film, fanatic dedication to the material by all involved, and the discerning hand of Peter Jackson and his staff bringing it all together adds up to one of those rare sequels that at least matches the original, but in some ways surpasses it.<br/><br/>
Some have been mistakenly critical, but count me amongst those in the majority that found the way this movies hit the ground running to be a major positive. The backstory well established for all but the foolish holdouts, Jackson sees no need to build his story up, and launches right into chapter 2 of the saga with vigor. Opening with a teaser of the unseen footage of the Balrog battle from Fellowship, eyes are popped early on and make their way back into the sockets only during brief respites where the story is glued together. Really refreshing to see an epic like this done so painstakingly and with such dedication to craftsmanship without sacrificing an iota of story advancement.<br/><br/>My biggest fear before his first scene(wasn't kept waiting long) was that Gollum wouldn't work - CGI simply hasn't been 100% successful imo with central characters to date, but you can chalk up another breakthrough for Jackson. His wise decision in hiring Andy Serkis to not only voice the character and map out his motions, but to also perform his scenes live during filming payed off handsomely. Nothing short of groundbreaking the way Gollum fits into the movie so seamlessly.<br/><br/>And WETA did not lose a step either going into this second movie. The many otherworldly denizens of middle earth are brought convincingly to life on grand scales(of number and size), the locales of Barad Dur, Helmsdeep, Rohan, and Isengard are completely mesmerizing, and the battle choreographies and sequences of mass destruction are again new standard bearers for the industry.<br/><br/>In short, a great movie on all fronts - if you don't like this movie, I hereby request you put me on ignore; we have nothing more to discuss, though I'd be interested to hear any cowardly swedes' opinions on the film before doing so.<br/><br/>4/4 stars"

","I saw this on OPENING NIGHT and it was WORTH IT.  Thank goodness nobody dressed up as a hobbit for the premier.  Anyway, this movie was incredible. The THREE HOURS went by so fast.  I was not surprised though being that I loved the first one.  This movie was more action driven (amazing battle scenes that make Braveheart's battle scenes look like a playground fight) and the special effects were even more amazing.   This movie has some great highlights.  One of them is Gollum.  He was a cross between Yoda and a heroin junkie.   He was a big part of the movie and definitely `acted' well. I know it was computer generated but that doesn't matter, he LOOKED SO REAL.   Then of course there is FRODO, the role Elijah Wood was BORN FOR. He was good in this as well.  In this movie, we start to see the darker side of our HERO HOBBIT.  The ring's dark power begins to take hold of FRODO. Frodo is not in this movie nearly as much as the first.   Then there is ARAGON (brilliantly played by VIGGO MORTENSEN).  He continues to show bravery and heroism while every now and then, showing his personal side. He kills about a thousand orcs in this movie.  I saw in an interview with Viggo, that he was so immersed in the movie making, that he actually felt as though he was a real character in middle earth.   The new characters introduced in this movie are all very good.  The acting is superb.   Even then ENTS delivered the goods.  Yes, the ENTS.  The ENTS are these HUGE TREES that are alive.

","I did not anticipate that TTT could equal FOTR, a movie I have now seen 16 times.  But in some ways, this one was actually better!  More action, faster pace, positively Apocalyptic battle scenes.  As for the poor reviews of some, if I knew as little about my job as some of these people do about this movie, I'd get fired!  I guess I'm just too easily entertained.<br/><br/>
Gollum is wonderful, almost ""real"", easily the best CGI character to date. Jackson does take several ""liberties"" with the plot, but unlike other fans of the book, I realize that Jackson has made an ADAPTATION of the books, not a literal translation!  The book spans some 20-25 YEARS of time, come on folks!  The movies are already 3 hours!  But even though it is long, I never looked at my watch!  The action is compelling throughout.<br/><br/>I have only two criticisms, which prevented me from rating the movie a 10 (which only FOTR has received so far): 1. the storyline with Merry & Pippin is almost distracting.  In the midst of intense battle, we are abruptly transported to the forest, and the pace SLOOOOOWWWWSSS way down. 2. Gollum's schizophrenic war within himself reaches, well, comic proportions.  The cuts from ""bad Gollum"" to ""good Smeagol"" I found funny in spite of myself.  I'm sure this was not what Jackson had in mind.<br/><br/>On a positive comical note, the banter between Legolas and Gimli is great. Their friendship was one of my favorite themes in the book, I hope it is expanded in The Return of the King.<br/><br/>A must see, even if you only mildly liked the first one.  This one is much more for the ""twenty-first century moviegoer.""  More action, faster pace, and although darker and bloodier than FOTR, it is not overdone.  But then again, it SHOULD be darker, the middle of the story is a darker and more desperate time than the early chapters.  Go see it, give it a chance, and cut Jackson some slack on the plot!"
"mglenn-2","9","0","0","19 December 2002"," Good but Lacking
","The Two Towers has many elements I think are superbly done, but fails in many places.  SPOILERS BELOW.<br/><br/>First the good... The movie starts off fantastic.  The balrog scene was exciting to watch.  Gollum is amazingly realistic and very well played. The ents are wonderful.  PJ continues to make use of the dwarf for comic relief to good effect, which I'm ok with.  Many variations from the book fit nicely.<br/><br/>The second movie cannot compare in grandeur to the first... The first movie included many fabulous and amazing sets... The shire, rivendel, moria, lothlorien... The second focuses mainly on Rohan (barren grasslands), Fangorn (just a forest, though done to nice effect), and the badlands around Morder.  You do get to see a bit more of Barad-Dur which was nice.<br/><br/>After half the movie however, things started to go astray. Many additional scenes are added that do not appear in the book, and in my opinion, do not progress the story either.  The most notable of which is the warg attack on the kings company and the loss of Aragorn over the cliff.  So much time was taken for these scenes and it does nothing whatsoever for the plot... We had to see everyones reaction to the news of Aragorns loss, and then had to see everyones reaction to the news of his return!  The Arwen scenes were way overdone, and could be (and should be) ommited entirely!  Taking the hobbits to Osgiliath was silly as well.<br/><br/>Rather than this additional hour of content that was not in the book and does not progress the story, I would rather see an hour of content that was in the book and that was ommited from the movie!  How about treebeards home and the hobbits drinking the entdraught from the huge bowls?  Where were the Huorns?  The whole key to Sarumans loss at helms deep was the attack of the ents, and this isn't portrayed at all.<br/><br/>On this note, the movie ends way too early!  Too much has been left for the final movie.  The encounter with Shelob and Sams realization that Frodo is still alive!  What better cliffhanger?  Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman after the battle. A very key scene, and a fine way to end a battle... Now we have to wait for the next movie for that?<br/><br/>Plot changes bothered me a lot... Especially around Theoden and Faramir. After releasing Theoden from Sarumans bind, he remains nearly as craven as he was under Sarumans control!  He is portrayed as being cowardly by ""retreating"" to helms deep.  That isn't at all what Tolkien had in mind! And the elves sending additional troops!  What a waste of elves, and a waste of our time.  Faramir completely lost his nobility...  The ents result at entmoot too... Why shouldn't the ents decide to attack Saruman?  I was so looking forward to the ents starting their march.  At one point I felt PJ was so far off the mark with this movie, as the battle at helms deep appeared to be a masacre, the ents refused to attack Saruman, and Faramir ordered Frodo taken to Minas Tirith.  I almost felt sick.<br/><br/>In summary, too much additional content, too many plot changes, ending the movie way too early, significantly less grandeur than the first... All contributed to my dissapointment in this film.  I am sure to buy the extended edition dvd anyway, but I don't think I'll yearn to watch this one nearly as much as the way I yearn for FOTR."

But the same applies for the book of cause. The novel ""Two towers"" is much more action packed than it's prequel, and this gives Jackson a very good excuse to make 3 hours of action... wich he does! And he does it extremly well! The final battle is one of the best action sequences in a long long time! But this is of cause also the problem, 'cause between ents rampaging Isengard, 10000 orcs attacking Helm's deep and nazgul chasing Frodo there just isn't enough time to go into details with the more quiet subplots from the book! Especially Marry and Pippin's story is almost non-excisting. This is a shame, but I'm sure that it will be corrected in the expanded DVD-set... (Who cares if a movie is 5 hours long, anyway?) But the bottom line is: I really liked the film. It entertainted me and that is what it was suppose to do! (9/10)"

","The Two Towers picked up where Fellowship left off, which is great.  i hate a sequel that wastes time reminding us what happened already.  This one plunges right in..........literally!  Gollum and the Battle at Helms Deep were the highlights.  ALthough, i loved TreeBeard and the Ents as well. The movie was fast paced, and only slowed down a bit here and there.  Peter Jackson didn't repeat Tolkiens words line for line......and took a few liberties, but i think he did an excellant job of bringing his work to the screen.

"zbrak","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," Plot changes -- books are still sublime, movie is still epic
","A lot of teeth are gnashing about the changes Jackson has made to the plot in Two Towers. I feel bad for people who are upset and can understand their frustration. I myself went out of my way to find reviews with spoilers so that, instead of spending my time in the theatre obsessing about plot deviations, I could just sit back and enjoy the movie (which I truly did). I think many of these plot changes were necessary, although I might have done them some other way if I was calling the shots. So let's launch in to a few of them . . .<br/><br/>**SPOILER WARNING** Faramir: He's one of the more fascinating characters in the book, and he's simply given a broad stroke in the film, and not a particularly attractive one. But looking back at the book, Faramir's character occupies 50 pages, much of which is dialogue between Faramir and Frodo. No wonder he's a complex character in the book! He does lots of soul-baring. Given all that, it's understandable that some change had to be made in the film, otherwise we'd have ""My Dinner With Faramir"".<br/><br/>In the book, Faramir's plan originally was to take Frodo and Sam back to Gondor (not because of the ring, however). After all the dialogue (and after Faramir finds out about the ring), he changes his mind. There are also mentions of the book about the battles at Osgiliath. So lots of the elements that are 'changed' in the movie have foundation in the books, and Jackson (who feels his job is to make an exciting movie) did what he felt he had to do. I would've done it differently, but that's me. But there's obviously no room in the movie for the exposition that the books have.<br/><br/>
The Nazgul confronting Frodo as Osgiliath bothered me as much as anything - part of the strategy of Gandalf for the war is to sneak the ring in to Mordor to destroy it, figuring Sauron will believe that Gondor is going to try to use the ring to challenge him. No need to announce to Sauron that the ring is somehow at mordor's doorstep.<br/><br/>I think the rousing of the ents (Pippin's `trick') also could've been handled better. In the books, Tolken makes it clear that the Ents are slow to anger and reluctant to get involved, but they knew what Saruman was up to and said `enough is enough.' Not sure why Jackson did it the way he did - didn't really add anything that needed to be added.<br/><br/>The warg battle -  This is in the book, sort of. As the contingent from Rohan is riding to Helm's Deep, they skirmish with orcs on Wargs and drive them off. This is probably a couple of sentences in the book and is expanded in the movie (a la the cave troll in the first movie). No harm done here, IMHO. Aragorn's plunge off the cliff, however, could've been left out. It didn't add anything to the film, except another excuse to dip into the Arwen subplot.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, much of the tension between Arwen, Aragorn and Elrond is spelled out in one of the appendices in the book. Jackson took some liberties there as well, but the idea pretty much holds true. (You could've left the whole Arwen thing out of all the movies completely and it wouldn't have bothered me, but I understand how androcentric the film would've looked then.) The imagery of Arwen grieving over  King Ellasar's body was nicely done, showing her dilemma. So again, Jackson is taking the story and shaping it to the film - he is not creating this stuff out of whole cloth.<br/><br/>After looking back through the book, I was actually pretty impressed about how much the battle of Helm's Deep matched Tolkein's descriptions of it. And the landscapes --- I cannot believe how much the scenery matched my mind's eye from reading the books (like the scrub trees in the final scene in Ithilien - a tiny detail, but absolutely perfect as it was captured on film.) Astounding. And enough has already been said about Gollum, who is a revelation. As I said before, I sought out spoiler reviews so I wouldn't be distracted from plot deviations. If I want to read the books, I'll read them. But I certainly enjoyed the film for what it was - a majestic and exciting adventure flick, well worth seeing again."
"fjordboy","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," Like the Movie, Liked the Book
","This movie was very different from FoTR, in many ways.  First of all, the movie and book is mostly battle.  The battle of Helm's deep is probably the focal point of the entire movie, so the movie is significantly more violent than the first.  If you're faint at heart, and don't like seeing orcs die, then you might want to consider watching ""Bambi"" or something else instead.<br/><br/>
The cinematography in the movie was...once again, astounding.  One particular shot that runs in my mind is when Aragorn retraces the steps of Merry and Pippin...the flashbacks between Aragorn (present) and Pippin and Merry (past) are excellent.  A few other notable shots include when Aragorn picks up the Lorien Leaf that the hobbits leave behind; when Aragorn walks through the double doors, and (this one is incredible) when Frodo attacks Samwise (watch his blade..this shot is incredible). Of course the landscapes and the battle scenes are great too, those are just a few particular shots that I remember.<br/><br/>There are several things that I really loved and enjoyed about the movie. I'll make a brief list of them here: The introduction starting outside the mountain hearing what is going on inside and then Gandalf falling/fighting the Balrog; Grima Wormtongue.  Perfect casting..you couldn't get any slimier than that! ; The Wargs (though they sort of looked too cute... ; The ents...oh my..the Ents were spectacular. ; The destruction of Isengard!  I just wish they would have shown more of it.  ; The battle of Helm's deep.  I know this is like half the movie...but it was great!<br/><br/>There were a few changes from the book, but I won't mention them (I don't want to spoil the movie too much), but if you want to mention them, go ahead and post comments.  I'll back up every (almost) change that Jackson made...even what Jackson did to Faramir.<br/><br/>
There weren't too many things I didn't like..but the first and foremost is probably the Entmoot...that is the one change that I think Jackson shouldn't have made. Also...we didn't get to see Treebeard's ""house.""  That was a shame.  I really wanted to see the table and the Ent draught.  I also didn't like the dwarf tossing joke (yes..*another* dwarf tossing joke...sheesh!) and I didn't like what Frodo saw in the Dead Marshes.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson (even he admits this), took more creative liberties with this movie than any of the Lord of the Rings films (released and unreleased).  Knowing this before I went into the movie, I was a little worried.  I figured he had cut something big out...or added something stupid in.  But, in the end, I can appreciate almost all the changes he made (with the possible exception of the entmoot), and I think this movie was once again a winner!  Thanks to everyone who made it!  It was great!"

","I saw this film a day ago, and I am still sorting out my feelings for it. Whew!  With a year to build up anticipation and expectation, it had a lot to live up to. Exactly like my reaction to The Fellowship of the Rings when I first saw it, I left the theater with my expectations both rewarded and dashed.  I have read the novel several times, and again the the week before The Two Towers opened nationwide.  I kept thinking, ""wow! that's incredible!"" followed by ""wait a minute--- that's not right!"" due to my own vision of what should have been left alone and what should have been changed for the theatrical version. Any 1000+ page epic like the Lord of the Rings novel leaves each person with their own interpretation, focus, and feel for what they read.  Peter Jackson took on the un-envious task of creating a CINEMATIC vision that would appeal to hard core and casual readers of the novel as well as those who have never picked it up.  I'm sure some hard core fans that can't let go of their own vision will be disappointed or even angry, while some non-readers will be befuddled or uninterested.  So be it. I myself left the theater dazed and amazed, and with a positive yet somewhat jumbled opinion due to the changes made. Now that I've had some time to adjust to the changes and contemplate the film, however, Jackson's vision is growing on me.  I was vaguely disappointed with ""Fellowship"" at first, also, but that initial  disappointment has given way to great admiration for Fellowship. I now love the first film for it's own sake, separate from the novel.  I think the same is going to apply for me with The Two Towers, especially if the altered story arc comes to a unified and satisfying end in the next part.<br/><br/>The visuals, sets, musical score, and costuming are beyond reproach.  The pacing is perfect in my opinion.  The acting is superb once again.  The dialog itself is a mixed bag, but serves its purpose, and is spoken with authority.  You can nitpick a few things, such as blue screen lines being visible in some scenes, but for me they never distracted from the overall look of and feel of the film at all. Overall, it is an incredibly crafted film, and superior to most of the so called ""blockbuster"" films of late.  It is full of action, drama, humor,love, hate, beauty, ugliness, hope, and despair. It's all wrapped up in a visual treat that is compressed into 3 hours of movie magic that if anything feels too short. Unless they have no interest whatsoever in the action/fantasy genre or are Tolkien purists, I can't see anyone outright disliking what the Two Towers gives.<br/><br/>I, for one, am really looking forward to how Jackson is going to wrap up his vision in the third installment.  Bring on The Return of the King!  Now another year of anticipation and expectation....."
"Captain Ed","10","0","0","19 December 2002"," The saga continues ... (some spoilers)
","So I got a co-worker to go with me on Opening Day (I had to take a half-day vacation) and we watched this amazing achievement in moviemaking.  I thought that this part of the Tolkien saga would be the most difficult to realize; there is an enormous amount of action and story to get through, and I was very afraid that the Ents would get too much of the ""warm and fuzzy' treatment, a la Ewoks.  I shouldn't have worried -- Jackson has outdone his first installment by a fair piece.<br/><br/>The Fellowship has broken, and now the main characters have split up, leading to multiple story threads. Unlike the book, Jackson has chosen to portray this in 'real time', switching back and forth, but without making it seem choppy at all.  Truly, there are too many wonderful things about this movie to prattle on about; my favorite was the battle at Helm's Deep, one of the most powerful portrayals of war on screen in recent memory.  Watching the Ents go to war would be a close second.  Gollum/Smeagol is brilliant, a CGI creation voiced by Andy Serkis who may be the most heartbreaking character of all.<br/><br/>Go see it.  Shame on those who gave this movie a 1 -- even if fantasy isn't your cup of tea, a true film enthusiast would still appreciate the craft and talent that this film displays."

Last year Jakson cut a lot of scene, but I understand this. This year the director follow only the basical structure of the storyline and he adds, because he has the power, new scenes, sometimes insignifiants:<br/><br/>Why Aragorn fall in the battle of the wargs? This scene doesn't exist in the book. Why elves join the humans in Helms deep? Why Haldir die? Why Frodo meet the Witch-King?

"Cthulhu42","9","0","0","19 December 2002"," A great continuation of FOTR
","This movie is another amazing movie from Peter Jackson that is almost as good as the original. It has great acting, amazing special effects, sweeping landscapes, a huge action sequence, and on top of all that it's also pretty funny.<br/><br/>All of the remaining fellowship are just as good as the first, and most of the new characters are just as well cast and well acted as the original group. Miranda Otto is great as Eowyn, Theoden is excellent, the Ents are about as good as the Ents could possibly be, seeing as I never really liked them from the book to begin with, and Gollum is frankly the best character in the movie hands down. Also, Gimly is given a lot more character and shows off dwarven pride in many hilarious ways.<br/><br/>The opening is so cool, my only problem with it was that it was too short. I know a lot of people had issues with the pacing and the editing, but personally I didn't have a problem following things. I have read the book, but that was years ago, so I wasn't completely up on the story going in. It seemed to be very well cut together considering that there are three story lines. The movie deviates a lot from the book, but I'm not so much of a purist that I have a real problem with that. It stays true to the characters and plot, with the exception of Faramir, and it certainly ended up working well as a movie. I think over all it was a very faithful adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>But, I did have a few problems with it. First, the action in the movie was too clumpy. I know this is more a problem with the story itself, but it was still annoying that all the action came at the very end, instead of being spread throughout like the first one.<br/><br/>Also, I know I'm alone on this, but Helm's Deep wasn't as good as I was expecting. I blame that a bit on the fact that it was overhyped, as it was pretty cool, but I still think that the battles in the first movie were better. I think one reason for this is the fact that in the first movie there were individual enemies, like the Balrog, the cave troll, the Nazgul, or the Uruk-Hai chieftan, that stood out and made the fights more dynamic, scary, and interesting. In this movie all the enemies look the same, and it lacks a sense of real power on the side of evil. If they had just left Shelob in I think I would have felt better about this aspect of the film. Still, all in all it worked better as an action movie than most others in the genre, and in my mind was an even better drama than action movie, so it's hard to complain.<br/><br/>The other problem was the ending. At the end of the first movie I really wanted to just keep sitting there and watch more. At the end of this movie I was ready to go home. It wasn't that it was bad, but unlike the first movie the ending seemed rushed, and put a damper on the overall drama that had been running through the last hour of the movie. If the movie had been just a minute longer, and they had wrapped things up a bit more, it would have been as good as the first one.<br/><br/>If I could, I would give FOTR a 9.7, FOTR extendend 9.8, and this movie a 9.5, just for comparisons sake. Given that I can't, I'll just go with 10/10, as I will probably like it even more with a second viewing."

","The tidal wave of reviews has begun for Two Towers. I won't add much to the fray except to say that TT is to the 21st century (so far) what Star Wars was to the late 70s.<br/><br/>George Lucas must cry and tear his napkin while watching Peter Jackson's trilogy of Tolkien's work. Where the original Star Wars really was able to take us to an entirely new place in time and space and imagination, his current projects are flimsy stories used as support structures for visual effects that can't get out of the way and commercials for an unending stream of ""collectibles.""<br/><br/>TT, on the other hand, recaptures the magic of the Star Wars era. As with Episode 4, the stunning visuals *complement* the story, they don't overpower it. There is a humanity to the characters (particularly Gollum/Smeagol) that Phantom Menace and AOTC sorely lacked. And with the LOTR series, people are eager to see the next installment, even though many of them know the story already. With the current crap...uh, I mean ""crop"" of Lucas films, the story is unknown, but who cares? The story is barely there, anyway. Fans are obligated to rush out to see the next SW movie, and they are obligated to rave about whatever garbage Lucas throws up onscreen, even though they are keenly aware of the gnawing sensation that they are being cheated.<br/><br/>LOTR doesn't cheat the viewer. Three hours is not enough time to tell even half of what is in each volume in the series, but there is a complete absence of filler, and the three hours breeze by without sacrificing the crucial elements.<br/><br/>To borrow a line from a previous success, the LOTR saga truly IS ""a new hope."""

","I saw this movie yesterday, and already I've overheard one comment from the theater I was at, as well as a comment from a workmate, who said that they were disappointed with something(s) about this movie. Whether it'd be that it didn't follow the book EXACTLY, or it just wasn't as good as the first. I understand that it doesn't follow the book exactly, but I beg to differ as far as it not being as good as the first movie.<br/><br/>Sure, it doesn't follow the book exactly. Neither did the last one. In fact, as far as I know, there were probably just as many differences from the book in this movie as there were in the last. For example, in the book of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" Gandalf takes many years to get back to the Shire(wasn't it like 50 years?) before he tells Frodo to set off on his quest to destroy the One Ring. Also, the ENTIRE Tom Bombadil scene was cut from the movie - including the scene where they obtain the swords to kill the Nazgul where they meet the Barrow-wights (I assume that perhaps the swords that Aragorn gave the hobbits at Weathertop are the swords that kill the Nazgul, but I can't be certain). Also, dialogue was switched around from what it was in the book, like someone in the movie saying a line that was originally someone else's line in the book. Or the same person who said a line in the book says it in the movie but at a different point in the story(a.k.a. Gandalf's ""all we need to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us"" speech and his story of Gollum; in the book it was at Bag End, but in the movie it was in Moria.) Also, we never see Gandalf talk to Radagast the Brown (another wizard). And, Boromir dies at the end of the movie, whereas he died at the beginning of the second book. Lastly, they never expanded on the fact that Merry and Pippin knew about the One Ring before they found out that Frodo had it, and also they never went to Farmer Maggot's house. And I know there were more changes.<br/><br/>And what changes were made to ""The Two Towers' story in the movie? Faramir was meaner, they didn't go to Gondor, we don't see Saruman wandering the woods, Elves were at Helm's Deep, Wormtongue makes it to Isengard before the Ents flooded it, Arwen was in it, Eowen went with them, and certain things were pushed back until the third movie. There were a few more, but there were not many more changes than what was done in the first film. And that's not what gets me. What gets me is that people complain about these changes, and NONE of them were bad! The movie still worked very well!  It still stayed 90-95% true to the book(if you got that percentage on a term paper - that's an A grade my friends!). The only reason anyone would see these changes as bad is because <snobby, whiny & complaining voice>""It wasn't in the books!""</snobby, whiny & complaining voice><br/><br/>
Come on! This movie was fantastic! It's still very true to the book, Gollum was cool and funny, Gimli was hilarious, and the battles were so epic in scale it's not even funny. The Ents were just as I had pictured them - both character and visual-wise. The conflict with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum was perfect. Helm's Deep was terrific and very epic in scope. And the destruction of Isengard was just amazing. We really got a great picture.<br/><br/>I think ultimately when one goes to a movie and comes out loving it, they will build up the sequels to such high expectations that they end up disappointed. Why not just expect the sequels to NOT be as good, since it's impossible to capture lightning in a bottle - and then come out not so disappointed?<br/><br/>This movie was awesome. Just as great as the first one.<br/><br/>

","Surprising absolutely nobody on this planet, this film is in fact very similar to the Fellowship film. On the plus side, it's got all it's strengths (CGI, New Zealand, mostly wonderful acting, New Zealand, length, costumes, music, etc. etc.) On the minus side, it's got most of its weaknesses (mainly the kinda hokey medievalese dialogue, the weird pronunciation of the r's and Elijah Wood). So assuming you've seen the first one (and if you haven't, and haven't read it, you'll have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on) here are the major points of difference:<br/><br/>-The Sir Ians don't appear much in this one. Also Boromir doesn't, for obvious reasons. So, the three best actors are barely in the movie. Thankfully, Bernard Hill, who does Theoden, makes up for it with a great performance. And the drawing of poison scene with Theoden is one of the most imaginative in the film, which is saying a lot<br/><br/>-Gimli and Legolas aren't so gratingly annoying. Well, at least Legolas isn't. Gimli is comic-relief for some reason (although some of it is funny, like when he tells Aragorn ""toss me!"")<br/><br/>-Smeagol-Gollum. Oh, man, how wonderful is this? The Gollum is so fantastic, it kicks the proverbial ass of all previously created CGI characters (even the ones in the Final Fantasy movie). I don't know if Andy Serkis (who is billed in the role of Gollum) had a lot to do with his 'acting' but if he did, congratulations to him on a great performance, and if he didn't, well, it's kinda creepy that CG can make better actors than most people actors now.<br/><br/>-Rohan. Might as well be called 'The-Land-Where-All-Men-Look-Like-Chad-Kroeger-From-Nickelback.' Otherwise, however, it is superbly done in a true to Norse mythology style. The gloominess of the place is at times palpable.<br/><br/>-Meriadoc, Peregrin, Samwise actually get to do something in this movie. Which is great, 'cause it was a little bit annoying to me to see those three as bumbling idiots over and over again.<br/><br/>-Faramir. He's not a syrupy-sweet good guy in this one, unlike the book. Which I think is an excellent change, even though some say this is some sort of Tolkien blasphemy. Other changes from the book are also good (well, when they're changes. Straight omissions are a little harder to swallow, simply because one is interested 'how would they have done that?' even if it really wouldn't have mattered)<br/><br/>-Battle of Helm's deep. Overlong. Kinda boring for me. Yet no one can say this isn't a movie-making feat worth celebrating.<br/><br/>-Disjointedness. Good on one hand, as Elijah Wood isn't there so much. Bad on the other hands, since it can be confusing as to what is going on where<br/><br/>-Ents. There is a school of thought that says you can't help but screw up visualising ents.  Although I disagree, this movie seems to give credence to that notion. How could people that did so well in other ways mess up so embarrassingly here? These ents are comic to me, when they're supposed to be majestic. I don't remember how it was described in the book, and maybe they stayed true to that description, but it just doesn't make sense to me for ents to be smaller than trees, two-footed and quick runners. I was disappointed that the Buckland and Old Forest scenes were omitted in the first one, but now I see why - they just don't do forests that well. It's kind of a shame, really.<br/><br/>
Well, there you have it. I can't give it a ten, cause of the general hokeyness, and cause of the ents. A nine it is, then."
"dgeer80","9","0","0","19 December 2002"," Just as great as the first one
","I saw this movie yesterday, and already I've overheard one comment from the theater I was at, as well as a comment from a workmate, who said that they were disappointed with something(s) about this movie. Whether it'd be that it didn't follow the book EXACTLY, or it just wasn't as good as the first. I understand that it doesn't follow the book exactly, but I beg to differ as far as it not being as good as the first movie.<br/><br/>Sure, it doesn't follow the book exactly. Neither did the last one. In fact, as far as I know, there were probably just as many differences from the book in this movie as there were in the last. For example, in the book of ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" Gandalf takes many years to get back to the Shire(wasn't it like 50 years?) before he tells Frodo to set off on his quest to destroy the One Ring. Also, the ENTIRE Tom Bombadil scene was cut from the movie - including the scene where they obtain the swords to kill the Nazgul where they meet the Barrow-wights (I assume that perhaps the swords that Aragorn gave the hobbits at Weathertop are the swords that kill the Nazgul, but I can't be certain). Also, dialogue was switched around from what it was in the book, like someone in the movie saying a line that was originally someone else's line in the book. Or the same person who said a line in the book says it in the movie but at a different point in the story(a.k.a. Gandalf's ""all we need to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us"" speech and his story of Gollum; in the book it was at Bag End, but in the movie it was in Moria.) Also, we never see Gandalf talk to Radagast the Brown (another wizard). And, Boromir dies at the end of the movie, whereas he died at the beginning of the second book. Lastly, they never expanded on the fact that Merry and Pippin knew about the One Ring before they found out that Frodo had it, and also they never went to Farmer Maggot's house. And I know there were more changes.<br/><br/>And what changes were made to ""The Two Towers' story in the movie? Faramir was meaner, they didn't go to Gondor, we don't see Saruman wandering the woods, Elves were at Helm's Deep, Wormtongue doesn't make it to Isengard until after the Ents flooded it, Arwen was in it, Eowen went with them, and certain things were pushed back until the third movie. There were a few more, but there were not many more changes than what was in the first book. And that's not what gets me. What gets me is that people complain about these changes, and NONE of them were bad! The movie still worked very well! It still stayed 90-95% true to the book(if you got that percentage on a term paper - that's an A grade my friends!). The only reason anyone would see these changes as bad is because <snobby, whiny & complaining voice>""It wasn't in the books!""</snobby, whiny & complaining voice><br/><br/>
Come on! This movie was fantastic! It's still very true to the book, Gollum was cool and funny, Gimli was hilarious, and the battles were so epic in scale it's not even funny. The Ents were just as I had pictured them - both character and visual-wise. The conflict with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum was perfect. Helm's Deep was terrific and very epic in scope. And the destruction of Isengard was just amazing. We really got a great picture.<br/><br/>I think ultimately when one goes to a movie and comes out loving it, they will build up the sequels to such high expectations that they end up becoming disappointing to the individuals that make such idiotic accusations. Why not just expect the sequels to NOT be as good, since it's impossible to capture lightning in a bottle - and then come out not so disappointed?"

","It's not often a movie strikes a chord with me as The Two Towers has. In my opinion this film is now the benchmark that all other movies should be judged. Unlike other special effect loaded movies such as The Mummy returns. Lord of the Rings doesn't leave you feeling that you just watched a two hour or more video game unfold. I was in total amazment with the effects in this movie. Furthermore I am not sure if they give an acadamy award for casting but this has to be the most brilliant job I have ever seen. Every actor in this movie seemed to be born for the part he or she played in it. I cannot thank Mr Jackson enough for the job he is done on this series. The only things that bug me about the trilogy now is 1. I have to wait a whole year for the next one. 2. I have serious doubt that the third one could live up to Two Towers.

","The beauty of the risk taken by the producers of these three movies is how seemlessly they mess together.  All the characters are in place, look the right way and so it goes.  This is, perhaps, a signal of a paradigm shift in the making of multi-installment movies.  Just think of the problem facing the Harry Potter people with the death of Richard Harris.<br/><br/>It also takes the risk out of coming to episode 2 and 3.  We know what to expect.  There will be no disturbing surprises due to deaths, contract disputes, etc.  You also can know the cinematography style, music and such not bounce off into left field.<br/><br/>To me, the most stunning part of this movie was Gollum.  The state of computer animation art is growing at an incredible pace.  Gollum was so lifelike that it was eerie.  I understand that much of the polishing of his character was done between movies, but it was worth it."

","***Warning contains minor spoilers.*** I never thought of myself as a Tolkien purist, but what d'you know, after watching this movie, I am.  I really feel that TT ought to have a rider ""Very Loosely Based on Some Characters from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy: Any similarities to the story are purely coincidental"".  Peter Jackson/Fran Walsh what were you thinking???<br/><br/>Partly my Disappointment stems from the fact that there is too much hype, so I only have myself to blame for listening to it.  TT was like a Christmas present, so full of potential when it's all wrapped up, but when you open it, you realise it's not what you wanted at all.<br/><br/>I realise that PJ had to diverge from the book to keep the pace up and to link the films together, but were all the divergences necessary?  In some cases, it added to the story like Gandalf's fight with the Balgrog (***Amazing!!!***) and the love affair between Arwen and Aragorn (Awww!)- because it adds to character development, and explains Elrond's dislike of Aragorn.  However, why did Walsh/Jackson feel it was necessary to totally alter the character of Faramir.  In the book Faramir is truly noble, his only failing is that he is forever living in his brother's shadow, particularly in the eyes of his father.  He learns of his brother's weakness and determines not to walk that same path.  So why did they feel it would add to the story, by corrupting one of the greatest character's in the TT and RoTK?  I am telling you now - it doesn't.  Gollum was good. I know people have complained, but how else do you portray a mad creature that is hundreds of years old whose body and soul has been twisted by evil? Finally, Gimli.  Okay, the first couple of jokes were funny, but by the 10th ""short"" joke - it's just not funny any more.  And the ""Dwarf Tossing"" joke just WAS NOT funny. (I'm 5'8"" in case you're wondering).<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie.  It doesn't feel like three hours. It has action, humour, a love story, an unrequited love story, more action and a great ending.  The plot races along nicely.  BUT, IT IS NOT Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Big Kudos to the unmentioned character - the New Zealand scenery was beautiful, but then I would say that, wouldn't I?  And to Kiwis: Try spotting who hasn't been on Shortland Street!<br/><br/>Watch it you'll probably enjoy, but don't expect Tolkien."

","What do I need to say? Director Peter Jackson has done a brilliant work with this one. I was totally surprised and didn't realize how time passed. It was simply captivating. Once again the actors do a fine job, although I did get a bit of the feeling that too many important dialogues were skipped/cut for the sake of more action-based sequences. Which, of course didn't make the movie bad as a whole, but I've read the books time and again, and I've missed many nice parts that simply didn't make it into the film. Character Highlights? Gollum: Amazing acting. Eomer: Small role but very expressive. Eowyn: She came alive straight from the book's pages. Aragorn: Excellent! He takes a leading role in this one does lots of good acting. Gimli was very humorous, but he kinda starts looking as a comic-relief character, and although that probably makes him popular, it's quite inaccurate as to his part in the deeds of the Fellowship, and I wouldn't find myself laughing in the third film if he keeps tripping, falling, and doing all those funny acrobatics, or dimwitted quotes. (That is: very nice so far, but I've had enough of this ""laugh-at-the-dwarf"" thing) Legolas is portrayed a bit differently as what in the books. But does all those cool acrobatics, that really add a bit into the excitement. Theoden I found perfect (he's one of my favorite characters in the book) (although I expected a more white-haired, long-bearded version in appearance). Grima was also very well acted-for. And of course Treebeard is just perfect. Unfortunately Gandalf, seems to be a bit decorative, and the film loses perspective IMO as to his role in this part of the trilogy, which one could have said is actually central. Saruman has only a few lines, and we don't get to see much of him. And finally, My big disappointment: Faramir. That's just not the Faramir from the book. Reminds of him sometimes, but some key things (that actually help the film greatly) weighed heavily IMO on his role in the story. Still, the film (apart from the book) is excellent, brilliant and the work done is very rewarding to the audience. An excellent film! Just (all you LoTR fans out there) don't get too stuck in the ""it's in the book/ it's not in the book"" thing."

The article was right.  Though I don't consider myself a fanatical fan I was hoping Mr. Jackson wouldn't toy with the characters to much.  I was wrong, in some places he had the characters acting so unlike themselves in the book it was disappointing.  I guess he had his reasons for doing so but in the beginning he stated he would be true to the book and well he let this fan down.  I also didn't like scenes that he made which didn't even happen in the book.  Oh well I guess that is show biz.  I hope the next one doesn't deviate like this one did.

What's happening to the story has become ridiculous.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way Peter Jackson decided he was going to rewrite Tolkien's story, regardless of how the original would have translated to a movie.

"gdrg2","Null","0","0","19 December 2002"," Disappointed
","Having thought Fellowship to be spot on, and supportive of any changes made to the book to make a film, I was disappointed by the Two Towers.<br/><br/>My problem comes of course from having read the books, a lot.  While the standard of the production remained superb and Jackson did so many things very well (Gollum especially of note), I was surprised and rather dismayed that he made fundamental changes to some of the story, that I really didnt see improved the film at all.  Where in FOTR the changes made I thought improved it as a film, some of the changes in TT werent necessary and simply changed from the book and didnt make it any better a film.<br/><br/>Of note (*** SPOILERS... well sort of***):<br/><br/>Faramir is the exact opposite in the film to the book.  In the book he passes the test of the ring, because quite frankly he was THE BOY.  In the film he captures Frodo, not because of greed of his own but for the kingdom. But still it is a fundamental change in his character.  So there was no need to go to Osgiliath, maybe because Hollywood wanted to see shit getting destroyed.  And the bit with the Nazgul was a bit silly, because it would have alerted Sauron to the fact the ring was closer to his borders than he thought... something he overlooks in the book, which allows Frodo to slip by.<br/><br/>The elves appearing in Helms Deep.  This was ridiculous and really p****d me off.  This never happens.  One of the fundamental things of LOTR and the War of the Ring was that it was a war of men because the age of the elves was passing.  The only reason Jackson seems to have done it was to get the cool design work on the elves into the battle.  But I felt the Roharrim were more than a little neglected and turned from a proud race into something a little more village and simple and gruby.<br/><br/>Elrond never interfered with the love between Aragorn and Arwen, although he was upset.  The condition of the guy getting the girl was that he be King, so he was going to battle for good, Kingdom and love.  Now he is love-lost, and would be closer to a deathwish than hope.  Although I did see Jackson doing this to bring a love subplot into it for the film... so OK (but he could have just played on the pain of mortal and immortal love and the anxiety of having to become King rather than making Elrond a selfish and cruel father)<br/><br/>Oh, and the Ents were rather underdone.  They didnt break Sarumans damn, but diverted and entire river themselves, because they are the BOYS.  Jackson rushed that, but could have had more time if he hadnt been packing crap into other parts.<br/><br/>Another annoying thing was the reference to 'industry'.  Many people have thought Tolkien used LOTR as a commentary on industrialisation, although I dont believe he ever admitted it.  In the film they SHOVE this idea down your THROAT.  Going so far as to use the i word itself and seeing Saruman preparing gunpowder (I thought was very crap).<br/><br/>Well, sounds like I was pretty harsh.  Still it was a great film, just not nearly as satisfying as the first.  I would give the first 9, and this 7.5. Still even if youre a die hard book guy or gal, go and watch it and enjoy what they did well (Gandalf fighting the Balrog, Gollum, Wormtongue and more) and just try not to think too much about the bad bits.<br/><br/>(Oh and lets remember that while Jackson has been doing this for a few years, and for the most part doing a damn fine job at it, Tolkien did spend his entire life daydreaming and developing Middle Earth from its creation)<br/><br/>Sorry to sound like such a Tolkien GEEK... just got a little carried away"

I don't know if it's just because I followed the story easier or wheather it was more action than FOTR but those three hours just flew.<br/><br/>I dreaded rumours of a 45 minute battle scene but that was quite unfair as it was actually about three interwoven battles at the same time.  It was so cleverly done that I didn't notice it was so long.<br/><br/>Criticisms:  Merry and Pippin spent most of the film literally up a tree so added very little to the story line.  Some of the filming was a little dizzying.  Beautiful scenery but too much panning and zooming for my liking. Too many key scenes ended with not showing us the actual outcome of a certain event.  It was OK the first couple of times but got a bit stupid after five or so times.  Some of the graphics sequences actually looked like graphics.  Gollum was very well done though.  I swear it was a guy in prosthetics.<br/><br/>I found some unseen parts of FOTR were very cleverly interwoven Two Towers, particularly certain love scenes, which many people criticised FOTR for leaving out.  It is hard to tell wheather PJ intended it to be this was or added it as an afterthought.  Either way, it worked really well.<br/><br/>On the whole, another marvellous addition to the trilogy.

While Smeagol was incredible, there are so many parts of this movie that were perfectly done I hesitate to focus on just one.  One aspect that I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, however, are the rohirrim, the Riders of Rohan.  I thought their depiction as sort of Vikings on horseback was perfect!  They were perhaps my most favorite characters in the books, and Peter Jackson really made them come to life for me.  I only wish there had been time to see more of them.

","Right after watching LOTR, the group I was with - all of whom having read the trilogy several times - started debating whether this one was truer or less true to the original than Fellowship was. Even moreso than with FOTR, we concluded quite quickly that we didn't *care* about these deviations.<br/><br/>The score was much more balanced than FOTR. I have read many times that Howard Shore has composed the score for the entire trilogy as one piece of music, however the Wagnerian usage of themes was a lot less obvious in this installment than it was in Fellowship.<br/><br/>Furthermore, where in FOTR Gimli was a little too recognizable as a standard John Rhys-Davies character, in TTT he appears more ""natural"" in his fumbling, quirky behavior, probably because he knows when to keep his mouth shut. In short, I found his character to be a nuisance in FOTR, and a great source of comic relief in TTT.<br/><br/>As for the Elves, their stance towards humans seemed to have grown more distant and in the case of ""Agent Smith"" Elrond (I can't help it) sometimes almost seems hostile. Which of course breeds tension for the love triangle that develops between Arwen, Eowyn and Aragorn - something I anticipate will deepen in part three even though Tolkien's original barely scratches the surface.<br/><br/>Smeagol, in his computer generated glory, is a visual delight if one can call a wretch like him that. His creepy, crawly hideousness goes beyond the human form, so Jackson made an excellent choice in putting the latest and the greatest of rendering systems to work, and the end result is simply baffling. Especially since the immense pity Frodo feels for the creature takes hold of the viewer as well. Not bad for a bunch of pixels.<br/><br/>Also wonderfully done are the Ents, whose way of disposing with Orcs I couldn't help but find terribly amusing. Here you see the splatter artist Jackson briefly appear, though the film keeps neatly within its PG-13 borders.<br/><br/>There are some weaknesses in the editing storyline, and I am left wondering why this had to be done. Probably the alterations made for the Battle of Helm's Deep allow for a grander army to come from Isengard without the story losing too much of its credibility, but one wonders whether this could not also have been accomplished by simply doubling the garrison.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, special praise has to be given for the way vast armies are created with the help of computers, ironically the very machines Tolkien was anxious about. I will not go into much detail, but you can very well expect to be swept off your feet by the intensity, the grimness and the sheer magnitude of it all. There has never been a battle on a movie screen with such ferocity and enormity, and one can only speculate what will happen once New Line unleashes the third installment of this already epic trilogy.<br/><br/>We will see, my Precious, we will see...<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","I was extremely impressed with this the latest in the trilogy. The great artwork, the camera shots/angles, effects, music, acting, humor, action - I can't fully express how great this movie was with words. I didn't know if I'd be able to sit through the 3 hours, but I left the theatre wishing that it could go another 3. My compliments to all who had a part in this work; it definitely raises the bar for all moviemakers, no matter what the genre."

","wow! this movie is great!<br/><br/>many hard core book fans are disappointed. and many don't like how the three stories flip back and forth. but i think it was the best style to take.<br/><br/>at first i didn't like the opening with Gandalf fighting the balrog. i thought jumping into immediate action wasn't a good idea, but since the Two Towers is the middle story it makes sense. I LOVED GOLLUM! i saw the animated version of the Hobbit when i was a kid and made my parents buy a copy because he was my favorite character. around middle school i read the Lord of the Rings and loved him even more. so i went to see this film anticipating the growth of his character. when this film was being previewed in the big cities i heard critics bare their fangs into Gollums digital make up, but i thought he looked good. and i had high expectations. i really enjoyed his self vs. self scenes. the battle of Helm's Deep was spectacular. i was afraid that it would look incredibly fake, but thankfully it was wonderful. as were all of the fight scenes. and all the CG characters were amazing.<br/><br/>my only real complaint is the new character Eowyn. her part is incredibly small(as it should be like the book), but is hyped up as Aragorn possible new love. they didn't explain her position in the story at all. she's just walking around the screen glancing at Aragorn each time. she has zero personality. if i hadn't read the book i would wonder why her character even exists.<br/><br/>of course these movies will never be as good as the books. any Tolkien fan will never be completely pleased no matter what appears one the screen. that's fine, i love the books too, but that doesn't mean movie versions aren't good at all. everyone has to remember that these people dedicated 2 and a half years of their life to this film. this is the best that can be done folks. this is what they have to offer. Peter Jackson deserves more credit then he already has. he himself is a HUGE Tolkien fan and he wanted this story brought to the screen. it's not some Hollywood studio who went looking for a director and handed Jackson the script. in fact most of Hollywood said no to Jackson. so for those of you want to hate this film take these facts into consideration. this film is good for what it's suppose to be good for.<br/><br/>i give it a perfect 10"

","The word I've been using is HUGE... and often. This movie is filled with so much... when it came to an end, I was only upset to not have at least another 30 minutes to an hour for more.<br/><br/>You've likely all heard it already, but Gollum is incredible and enjoys LOTS of screen time... even ""solo"", if you'd even call it that. <wink><br/><br/>Treebeard was taken directly from MY mind.<br/><br/>The fact that Viggo Mortensen didn't get a nomination for Best Actor: drama in the Golden Globes is proof that there is little justice in the entertainment biz. His Aragorn is so utterly more convincing than many of the other nominees...<br/><br/>Anyway. And to the folks who are voting a 1 for this movie (or even a 5 or less)... your baseless pettiness is so obvious, it's actually pretty sick.<br/><br/>Was everything book perfect? Heck no. Are you a fool for expecting everything to have been done book perfect? Heck yes! Most people I know who have read the whole story always felt that Two Towers was the most boring of the books. Battles are fine and all, but don't make for great story writing. This movie made it more exciting.<br/><br/>So, a couple characters were again embellished or altered to fit a slight change in plot, but they worked out, and certainly could only possibly bother someone who expected every little detail to remain true to the books... which has been said from day one to be less than completely possible in a movie setting.<br/><br/>Yes, I give a 10/10. Perhaps I'm too easy to please.  Since I can't step outside myself and see it as a Tolkien novice and refuse to see it as a Strict Purist... it was as perfect as a movie can be made now. Perhaps some nasty critics should be stuffed in caves for a couple hundred years until they become their own gollums and then no CG will be needed?"

","Yesterday I have seen TTT. And I must say that I'm quite disappointed. When I first saw FOTR I was a little bit sad that there was no Tom Bombadil and no Barrow-wights and it took me half a year to accept this fact, but I think now, it is true that the film would have been too long nevertheless it is one of my absolute favourite movies! It is absolutely well done, a real masterpiece.  But now it seems to me that peter Jackson has invented his own story in TTT. In the first half I asked myself many many  times if the changes were really necessary and I got more and more nervous and anxious. In the second half I begun to ask myself if I was in the right film. For example there were no Huorns. Perhaps it was too difficult to realise this scene but I don't think so, it was just more dramatic for the popcorn audience when Eomer came back at the edge of time with thousands of riders of rohan (where the hell did he gather them). Also the Ents seem kinda stupid folk. In the book they are described as the eldest people in Middle-earth and full of wisdom but in the film they seem thin as paper and rather dull ( I was astonished that Ents have such long legs, do they really???). Faramir is strong wise and just, the better part of Denethor's sons but not so in the film. There he first appears as a greedy rough man. Rough was also the real Faramir but not in this bad way. Then they go to Osgiliath! WHY, PETER JACKSON WHY??? There Frodo encounters e nazgul. WHY? That is also just e cheap little bit of `tension' catching. There Faramir decides to let Frodo go. That seems to me not as an intelligent turn. Peter Jackson just had to go back to the book for a while otherwise the film would have gone in a totally different direction than the book. Maybe the worst part of the film was when the people of Edoras was attacked by the Wargs. I have seldom seen such  bad CGI's. In EVERY second of this scene you could see that they were CGI's! Puuh. it reminded me in a way of the BBC's documentation with that prehistoric beasts, maybe someone knows them. This is a unbelievable discrepancy to Gollum/Sméagol. Yes, in this film were also good characters and scenes and Gollum/Sméagol was my favourite. He is absolutely lovely and authentic! I have never seen such a realistic CGI. I thank to Andy Serkins because he partly saved the film and I hope he gets the Academy award for that . The schizophrenia of Gollum/Sméagol was, after me, even better presented in the film than in the book. There were also lots of nice landscapes which we know already from the first part. The riders of Rohan in the plains in front of the tall, white mountains is an epic picture and it opens the heart of every Tolkien fan. Also the black gate, Fangorn and the Oliphaunts were very beautiful scenes and they compensate a little bit for the rest. All in all it is a very colossal and entertaining movie for those who have not read the book. But the real Tolkien experts who have read the book many times will be a bit disappointed. I rated it 7/10!<br/><br/>One year ago I longed every day for the continuation of FOTR. And often I asked myself in what fantastic ways Peter Jackson would convert Tolkien's epic story into his movie. But now I think that I have do be afraid every day thinking how far the Return of the King will stray from the real storyline! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Peter Jackson STICK TO THE BOOK!!!"

","I love movies - these days there seems to be such a general high standard of film making that was missing from, say, 10 years ago. I let myself get taken along with most film-makers who show even the slightest bit of emotional tact. Peter Jackson has whole landscapes of the stuff. This time it's very dark stuff yes, but anyone who knows Jackson's earlier films will not be surprised to find that even the nasty orcs and uruk-hai have a tendency to raise a smile with their 'cockerney barra-boy' chit-chat. There's little time for breath - there's just so much story to pack in (and even at three hours it's a struggle) - so when Aragorn does begin to dream of elves and romance 2 hours in, it's almost a relief. There are problems - the time constraints have, at times, embarressed the editing and the dialogue will certainly annoy those people who believe real English is what is done when texting your mates on your mobile. It doesn't matter though because anyone who watches this film with even the smallest bit of objectivity will come away after 3 hours stunned by Gollum and Helm's Deep. Pushing boundarys and breaking new ground for the sake of the storyline is taken for granted by Peter Jackson, or so it seems - but if we stop for a moment and imagine the amount of work that must have been done to achieve this we only then begin to realise that these sort of films don't come round that often. If The Return Of The King keeps up the consistancy next year, there can be no doubt that we have been blessed to be around as these films were released - just to tell our grandkids....I remember when those films first came out...I was there on opening night!"

","Spectacular filmmaking! Peter Jackson has taken his work to another level. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was a more deliberate and subtle film. ""The Two Towers"" hammers you over the head with a visceral ""Welcome to Middle Earth"" like a war hammer to the temple! With battle scenes (the intensity of which can only be compared to Braveheart and Saving Private Ryan) and more and scarier creatures, this film isn't for little ones so do them, yourself and everyone else in the theater a favor and find a sitter.<br/><br/> Don't expect a typical action film. Don't expect a prologue to get you up to speed. If you haven't seen the first go and rent it immediately (preferably the extended special edition) This film is epic in every sense of the word. Superb. Some major plot changes from the book provide surprises and suspense for even the most well-read Tolkienite. (If you have a brain and a heart) you will love this movie!  As Winston Churchill said, ""This isn't the end, or even the beginning of the end, but perhaps it's the end of the beginning"""

","There is no doubt that TTT is amazing. It's epic. It does everything to flesh out its characters. It continues the story with a faithfulness to the spirit if not the storyline of Tolkien.<br/><br/>But is it better than FotR? I think not.<br/><br/>TTT does an amazing job with fleshing out Gollum, for example. He is an accomplishment, but hardly perfect. His subtle facial changes and manic schizoid monologues are worth watching a second time. Serkis voices him with a creepiness that I could only hope for. But he's still CGI, and it's too apparent at times.<br/><br/>Where Gollum is close to perfect, Faramir is a step in the opposite direction. For those who recall, Boromir was a complex character in the movie FotR. Faramir had even more opportunity to be fleshed out, in acts of pity or a look in the face. Instead, Faramir is a bully, little better than his brother. I never got the impression that he was a good guy. And that is not true to the character as Tolkien wrote him.<br/><br/>Aragorn's story is ... eh. A SF Guardian review said that the film is wonderful when it's faithful to the written word of Tolkien. The subplot of Aragorn and Arwen was not in the original story for a good reason, and it shows in this film. Even though it is well acted, it is such a showstopper. Its only moment of excellence is when Elrond really hammers home to Arwen what choosing Aragorn would mean for her. For that reason, I do not trash this part of the film mercilessly. But it could have been handled SO much better.<br/><br/>TTT does NOT have enough Legolas. Period. He is easily one of the most amazing characters to come out of fantasy movies, and he is underutilized. Gimli is wonderful, but little more than comic relief. It's criminal that he has pathos and drama in the extended version of FotR but is really two dimensional in TTT. Ah, but for just one hour more.<br/><br/>Overall, TTT will be remembered many years from now. But better than its preceding film? Not really. It's about the same, which is not faint praise either."

","One cant enter the theatre, without enormous expectations of what is to come, what is to be seen and lived through in The Two Towers by Peter Jackson. The fear of failure vanished 15 minutes into Fellowship of the Ring, so it was with good reason, that those unjust expectations flourished or for some still flourishes, in our minds.<br/><br/>But, oh my god, the river that is The Two Towers, lets us once again, deeply into the very heartbeats and cries of middleearth. Where I see Fellowship of the Ring, more as an introduction to the marvel of Tolkiens thinking, than anything else, Two Towers is indeed the unleashed epic of the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Not since reading the books, have I felt such vigor, vastness and beauty in a story, that portrays in essense the so very important values of our existance. <br/><br/>The Two Towers is a masterpiece, not surpassed by anything I have ever seen. The story by Tolkien are one of the greatest fantasy-reality escapism/realism stories of the world today. Its silverscreen adaption is worthy of our gods of old, whose segas is our legacy to inherit.<br/><br/>

","It isn't often that I spend the day at work distracted by the fact that I have a movie ticket in my pocket.  Today, I could barely contain myself until I sat down into the theater seat with my Junior Mints to watch Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers.  Yes, I love movies, like many who lurk here at imdb.  But the effect the Lord of the Rings trilogy has on me is something new. For some reason, my imagination, my heart, my head, and even what I think of as my soul have been taken by the work of Peter Jackson and his companions.<br/><br/>I have books by Brian Sibley (you've seen them in the bookstore, I'm sure) detailing how P.J. made the films, and the 4-disk Fellowship of the Ring DVD set is well worn in.  I've listened to all four DVD commentaries as well as watched all of the supplemental material on the last two disks.<br/><br/>When I research how these films were made, I think I am searching for the key Mr. Jackson found to break into my psyche.  By manipulating pixels, lighting, models, costumes, actors, extras, and props, I have been newly spellbound by a fantasy story I read as a kid in 6th grade. I have the CD version of the BBC broadcast produced by Brian Sibley (excellent, by the way!) which I've listened through three times in two years.  I've never been a fan of anything to this extent. I am amazed by the storytelling in these movies and I am anxiously awaiting The Return of the King. Also, I can't wait to get the Extended DVD version of Two Towers in November 2003. Jeffrey"

","'The Two Towers' is amazing. Not only does it have extremely intense war scenes, but it also develops the characters much further. The definate high point to the film is 'Gollum'. We only got to see glimpses of him in the fellowship, but the wait is well worth it. He is so well created u can almost not tell he is cgi. And in creating his split personalities Jackson displays a funny and moving battle between the good and evil inside of gollum. If you are not a fan of action films(like myself), the film will still keep you captivated. And its worth seeing even if only because of Gollum."

","The sense I got from watching this film was that I was seeing the middle part of a movie.  The action speeds up with a minimum of exposition, and I think in the end we will have to see all three pictures in order to understand Peter Jackson's vision.<br/><br/>The most satisfying aspects of this film are the performances of the newer cast members.  Miranda Otto as Eowyn is a very human, down to earth rival to the ethereal elven maid Arwen (Liv Tyler).  Bernard Hill is near-perfect as Theoden, the aged king of a threatened realm.  Karl Urban is surprisingly good as Eomer, the valiant nephew of the King.  But the most startling performance comes from Andy Serkis, the human 'template' for the character of Smeagol/Gollum.  Playing his role in a motion-capture suit, Serkis brings a human aspect that has been lacking in CGI characters since their inception.  Mr. Lucas should take notes: you need a *human* to make a character human.<br/><br/>By far the best moment comes from cast veteran Sean Astin as Samwise.  Hi s speech at the climax of the movie may come across as cornball to some, but it is the best expression of what is worth fighting and dying for. Taken into the context of current world events, the speech becomes a timely message, reminding us that there are reasons to fight the good fight that have nothing to do with religion, revenge or even patriotism.  It's an interesting point that Sam's speech inspires someone to commit an act of treason in support of Frodo's cause.<br/><br/>This is the second part of a three-part masterpiece.  Peter Jackson should get a special achievement Oscar for all three films.  I never thought that I'd see a performance worthy of Best Supporting Actor from a CGI character. Gollum definitely deserves it.  Yoda should still get the MTV award for best fight scene, though."

","And it does, no intro or anything, it picks up exactly where ""The Fellowship"" leaves off. The battle scene in the begining with Gandlolf was wicked, even though it was a dream.  Yes this part of the trilogy was much darker than the first one, but that's ok cause that's the way it should be. The special effects were amazing as always, the work on Gollumn was just superb, they made him a character that almost moved human like and had personality.  The battle of Helms Deep looked like tons of work was put in on that, and I got to appriciate that. <br/><br/>The movie was basically divided into 3 stories within one and that was basically this movie. Aragorn looked more like a solid leader in this one, the dream sequences were enchanting between him and Arwen. The most inspiring part of the movie was at the end when Sam was telling Frodo a story inside a story about how generations from now will remember this as a tale to tell one another. Any scenes with Sam and Frodo were great. There is so much to say here that I won't cover it all, but well worth waiting a year for, and now we conclude the journey next year where the battle for middle earth really begins...on December 17th 2003."

","Much like Gollum in the film, I am off two minds about Two Towers.  Oh it still gets a 10 and is an absolutely astonishing work of art and entertainment.  The battle scenes alone are the greatest ever put to film.<br/><br/>My sole complaint comes only in comparison to the first film, Fellowship of the Ring.  In FotR we get one story - Frodo's story - told over 3 hours. There is a singular drive and focus.  Two Towers however, actually being made up of two 'books' (Lord of the Rings was written as six books that the publisher combined into 3) has a split focus.  'The Battle of Isengard"" sections focusing on Merry & Peppin with the Ents, and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli and the events leading up to the Battle of Helm's Deep; and 'The Ring Goes West' section featuring Frodo and Sam's dealings with Gollum and Faromir.<br/><br/>The movie rapidly moves between the two parts of the novel and as such, the is a lack of cohesion to the story.  It doesn't movie forward in the way Fellowship did.  Oh, it's still better than nearly any other movie out there, but whereas FotR is in my top 10 all time, Two Towers will have to be content with being in my top 20.<br/><br/>As for changes from the book, Who Cares????  It's a movie, not the novel on screen.  If the author had wanted a movie, he would have written a movie. The job of a film is to tell the essence of the story.  Getting every detail from the book exact is what makes the Harry Potter films so lacking in spark and magic.  Peter Jackson's ability to deviate from the novel when it serves the needs of the movie is amazing and commendable.  Anyone demanding slavish devotion to the text should be rightfully ignored.<br/><br/>And yes, that means Shelob and the tunnel have been moved to the beginning of the 3rd film.  Yes that means the elves, and Arwen in particular, have a larger role here than in the novel.  But it all works and works brilliantly. This is a film not to be missed on the big screen."

","This movie was absolutely amazing to watch, truly amazing.<br/><br/>I've read where some people are utterly disgusted with the direction this movie is taking, that makes me upset.  This movie was so much better than the first. Granted that some parts which were included never happened in the book, while some of the semi important parts weren't included at all. But come on it's a movie after all. It's made for as much entertainment one could cram within a certain amount of time.  If the makers of this movie were to do every single thing in the book it would be a 10 hour movie.  I think what they did with this movie worked very well. People should go to see a movie for the fun of it, not to be so petty as to criticize every little detail of the movie.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was top notch, from the actors to the cgi animation.

I don't care whether your a big time fan of the books or not, there is something in this movie which will please everyone.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9, only because the beginning of the movie was a tad slow, but they had to do that to help develop the story plot."
"jermdown","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," Absoulutly Amazing!
","Absolutely Astounding!<br/><br/>First of all, I would like to point out that I have read and own the books. I also own the FOTR DVD and the FOTR extended DVD (which is superb compared to the original theatre release of the film), so I do have a lot of prior knowledge. Being a New Zealander its great to see your home country portrayed in such a beautiful way on the screen, and relate to it personally. But now to the film itself. After reading many online reviews, I have gained the knowledge that about a fifth of the people who saw the film were disappointed because it `left out to much stuff and changed it around to much!'. GET OVER IT! Do they want the film to be a week long, its a film, you just cant make a film in the same way you make a book! Also, an extended film will be coming out next year which will have extra footage, and from experience from the last film, the extended version will be even better. I strongly agree that the changes were for the best and heightened the film's drama and etc. As you probably already know, Gollum, is CGI and you also may have read that he he is excellent. To be really honest... he is. Nothing compares to he, he is brilliantly performed by the talented Andy Serkis and incredibly designed by the Weta Digital team. The wise and elegant Ents are more than what I hoped for, and even though at times you can identify that they are not entirely real, but this is compensated by the performance's of Merry, Pippin and Treebeard. The incredible Helms Deep battle scene looks flawlessly real, and has all of the jokes from the book between Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn intertwined (plus more) I wouldn't be so bold to say that this film is `better' than FOTR, because each of them is unique and excellent in their own ways! This again (as FOTR) has proven to be a spectacular achievement, congrats to Peter Jackson and his team (P.S. PJ has another cameo), for successfully bringing to life this masterpiece. A definite 10 out of 10. I loved it."

"pl004j@mail.rochester.edu","8","0","0","18 December 2002"," Good, but for fans of the books, leaves you with a sour taste
","-------------------SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN THIS REVIEW!!!!------------<br/><br/>Ok, let me preface my review by saying I overall enjoyed the movie.  If I hadn't read the books (many times) I probably would have REALLY enjoyed the movie, but I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as the first. That sentence is misleading, however.  I DID in fact, enjoy The Two Towers, it just left me with a sour taste in my mouth (read below for details)<br/><br/>The Fellowship of the Ring was, in my opinion, one of the best movies I'd ever seen.  It didn't remain entirely true to the books, but there were few additions, and a few ommisions that didn't have an overall effect on important characters in the story to come.  The biggest problem with The Two Towers, is that, as has been said before, some of the added material is unnecessary, some not necessary but interesting things were left out, and a few important plot changes were made.<br/><br/>To me, there were four big changes that are worth noting, and I'll in the increasing order in which they bothered me.<br/><br/>First, the battle with the wargs (giant hyenas?) was an addition, and a reasonably significant one.  For the most part, I would say this was a welcome addition.  More than anything else, it was simply exciting, however it could have done without Aragorn going over the cliff.<br/><br/>Second, the elves being included in the battle of helm's deep was neither here nor there for me.  It really added nothing to the story, but it didn't take much away from it either.<br/><br/>Third, was King Theoden being possessed by Saruman.  This is where the changes start hurting Tolkein's character development, and will ultimately put a damper on the character development for the next installment.  As mentioned in an earlier review, Theoden breaks free from Wormtongue on his own, which shows his will.  He is also a much stronger king in the books.<br/><br/>Lastly and to its largest detriment is the change in the way Faramir handles the situation with the ring.  As we learn later on, Faramir is the highly unfavored son of the leader of Gondor, because he was ""weaker"" than Boromir. I understand Jackson's justification of making Faramir want to please his father, but that is simply not how Faramir's character is drawn up.  He is noble and wise.  He intuitively knows what happened to Boromir, and knows he can't make the same mistake.  Unfortunately, this happens and moves on until the movie is nearly over, and it left me with a sour taste in my mouth. It just wasn't necessary and will hurt the character development across the films.<br/><br/>For people familiar with the books, there are a lot of other obvious changes from the book, but these are overall less significant.  The development of the Ents is obviously lacking in the film, but the overall effect isn't much different.  The reason the changes in Fellowship of the Ring were so tolerable was because the end result was still the same as the book. Ultimately, the same thing happens with The Two Towers.  It leaves us about 30-50 pages before the end of the novel, but the path we take to get there changes things that will have an impact past the scope of this film on its own.<br/><br/>Now that I've gotten that gripe out of the way, I'll discuss some other things!  Gollum (Smeagol) was produced exquisitely.  His interaction with Frodo and Sam is very believable, and his facial expressions and humanity (hobbity?) are both impecable.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in general are impressive to say the least, but you won't find anything like the fight sequence in Moria with the cave troll, or the duel between Aragorn and the Uruk-Hai fighter like you did in Fellowship. The battles in The Two Towers are bigger, but somehow less exciting.  It's comparaing Apples to Oranges though.  What the Two Towers does in its battle sequences it does very, very well.  As far as large scale battles go, there isn't much that can rival the execution of the battle at helm's deep.<br/><br/>
The opening scene with Gandalf, is a good way to get the audiences pulse going, and the scene showing his return to Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas and the fight on top of the mountain was amazing.<br/><br/>My conclusion is simply that I must see the movie again, knowing what to expect.  This way, the changes won't distract me, and I'll be able to concentrate on exactly what's happening in front of me."

I have never seen a more intense scene in my life!!! If you liked the first one (even if you hated it) go see this for at least the actions scenes!!!<br/><br/>
()()Fast Fact()() Most people dont know this little fact but the Helms Deep fight scene took longer to make then any movie production of a film! ()()<br/><br/>This movie is packed with some major action. And it does have some scenec that seem to go on forever but the rest of it makes up for it!! In soweys this is even better then the last!!! I am a diehard LOTR fan and i cannot get enough of this movie!. This movie was defintely more dark and therfor some youger kids might find some of the creatures to be rather frightining.<br/><br/>Just like the first one when it ended i went nuts because i couldnt wait to see the second part!! Now i want to see the third Part!!!!! 12 more months!!! AHHHH!!!!<br/><br/>
(*)(*)(*)(*)SIDE NOTE concerning accuracy to story(*)(*)(*)(*) I would like to point out that people might say its not like the book because they either missed stuff or didnt even add certain things but he told us from the beggining it was going to be diffrent!<br/><br/>
Theres no way you can fit just one book into a movie. The movie would be hours and hours and hours long! The movie add the main points. Anyways i dont see anyone else spending millions to make a movie!"

","In a paragraph I'll describe it as a fun movie to watch at any time of the year. It dominates visual design and roars to the oscars (hopefully). Its Intro was a bit tasteless due to the fact that people who have not read or seen part 1 will go through great difficulty to understand part 2 without having seen part 1. But, nevertheless entertaining. I also think that the acting was superb. BRAVO!!!"

","Having read the books at least 10 times I came prepared to find fault, and came away in awe.  Yes, not every scene made it to film, nor every line of dialog.  However, they captured the feel and scope and grandure of a true epic.  What makes a great film?  You start with an large and important story and then tell it well.  I came away drained and counting the days until The Return of the King!"

","There is no doubt in my mind that The Two Towers will pick up at least 7 awards this year. The whole film is just so engulfing, it takes you right from the beginning. The Two Towers continues the story of Frodo and Sam as they make their way to Mordor, as well as the journey of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, who are in pursuit of the Uruk - Hai that captured Merry and Pippin. The script tries to follow the book as close as possible, but there are some digressions, like the Elves at the battle of Helms Deep, but it doesn't matter because it was one of the best scenes in the whole film. Fans of Legolas will be pleased, he does more high flying, arrow shooting action in this one than in FOTR. By far, Gollum is the most impressive character in the film. Before the film I didn't have high expectations, we all saw Jar Jar Binks, and even though Episode I may have not been the best film, Jar Jar was still impressive, but Gollum totally boggles the mind. It actually looks like Gollum exists, there are no flaws whatsoever, you begin to believe, and that is the magic of Peter Jackson. Serkis deserves the best supporting actor Oscar, he IS Gollum. I thought that The Fellowship of the Ring was God's gift to movies, now I have seen The Two Towers, which is by far superior to FOTR. I can't wait until next year for The Return of the King. Many critics have given this film 5 out of 5 stars, and rightfully so, they don't just go throwing stars away you know."

","I see a lot of people lambasting Peter Jackson for ""making up"" the scenes with Arwen and Aragorn, claiming that this is not true to the books.<br/><br/>To you I say ""please read Appenix A, part v of The Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>In a book, an appendix is some information material to the story that couldn't be told as part of the story, for reasons of continuity or brevity or clarity.  In a film, an appendix is easily grafted into the story as a dream sequence, memory, etc.  THIS IS WHAT PETER JACKSON HAS DONE IN TTT.<br/><br/>He's added an appendix to the story as part of TTT to enhance the film, to make things clearer to the uninitiated and to generally make the movie better.

"jaesboxer","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," Peter Jackson has created another masterpiece that surpasses the awe-inspiring Fellowship
","I have just returned from seeing ""The Lord Of The Rings:  The Two Towers"", and I am still breathless.  Now, first off let me state that I loved FotR. I saw it five times in the theatre, and believe it to be one of the greatest movies of all times.  For 364 days I have been anxiously awaiting the release of ""The Two Towers"", with mixed excitement and apprehension.  I asked myself How could Peter Jackson ever surpass FotR.  Well, Two Towers does just that.  It is, without a doubt, the single most spectacular film I've ever seen.  The battle of Helm's Deep is the most detailed, astounding, and exhilarating fight ever put on film.  Braveheart, Gladiator, Star Wars, Ben-Hur, even The Mines of Moria in Fellowship, can't hold a candle to this. The story is spectacular (I myself chose not to read the first book until i'd seen the movie, and ditto with this one) and from the opening frames, I sat in awe.  I know most of the reviews say so, but I'll just reiterate: The CGI Gollum is one of the best visual effects i've ever seen.  Some of the scenes where we see Smeagol held captive by the dark, manipulative Gollum practically brought tears to my eyes.  I felt so much pity and mixed adoration/fear over this creature.  The criss-crossing storylines were well handled, with not to much time spent in one place, at any one time, and having seen the exhibit here in Toronto, I was thrilled to see the sets of Edoras, Helm's Deep and Isengard on the screen. I have money set aside to see this at least four more times.  One viewing, or two for that matter cannot do this triumph justice.  Peter Jackson is a genius, truly.  Every award this film wins, it deserves.  I was bitterly dissapointed when Fellowship lost to the well-acted, moving, yet highly flawed A Beautiful MInd, but this year I'm prepared for such a shun.  If you haven't seen this movie, get off the computer right now and buy your tickets.  If you liked Fellowship, this film will blow you away.  Fair warning though, if you haven't seen the first chapter, go out and rent it before seeing this movie, you'll be lost without it.  One of the greatest films ever made, and I can't wait another year to see The Return Of The KIng.  When the triloyg is finished, I'm sure it will be the greatest cinematic achievement of all time."

","This movie is great. It followed the book a lot closer than did Fellowship of the Ring. But, that is not saying this is a better film. They are equal, as, I am sure, the third will be. There did not seem to be a lot from the book left out of the movie. But, from the book standpoint, the movie did jump around a bit, but just to keep the pace. All in all, if you liked the book(s), or even just the first movie, by all means check this one out."

The 3 hours passed in no time and if given the choice I would've quite happily sat there for another 3 to watch the next installment or even the next showing. There are quite a few changes from the book but these seemed almost insignificant during the film and that hasn't really changed in the few hours since while discussing them with my friends. Go forth and watch this movie with the upmost possible haste!"
"firealarmbill","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," A Majestic Movie
","It is rare that a sequel outdoes the orignial (The Bride of Frankenstein and The Godfather Part II are the exceptions).  While The Two Towers really is not a sequel in the true sense of the word, it is a movie that overtakes ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and is deserving of Best Picture consideration when Oscar time comes around next March.<br/><br/>What makes the picture is the last hour, as Good and Evil fight their first big battle.  The combination of real and computer graphics were astounding, showing the true promise of the mariage of digital images and film can offer.  In addition, unlike the first two chapters of the Star Wars series, this movie does not sacrifice the humanity of Tolkien's story in favor of the special effects, a fine line that most moviemakers (like James Cameron) have crossed.  Even if you have read the book dozens of times, you still have emotional interest in these characters.<br/><br/>This movie alone justifies New Line's gamble of filming the trilogy in at one time.  Jackson and his crew are on the way of creating one of the great achievements in cinema history, and I for one can't wait to see how Return of the King will play out.  The movie gets ****."

"xwingalta","Null","0","0","18 December 2002"," Disappointing to a Devoted Fan
","Warning: May contain what some consider to be mild spoilers<br/><br/>I consider myself to be a die-hard Ringhead. I've read the books, ALL the books, I've seen Fellowship hundreds of times, and my room is full of the geeky paraphrenalia that the studios love for me to buy. I went into Two Towers expecting to be just blown away like I was with the first movie. The previews looked great, all the reviewers loved it, all my friends who saw it said it was fabulous.<br/><br/>I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The first movie was an intense, sweeping epic that spanned time, space, and the human emotions of love, hate, greed, fear, loyalty and courage. Two Towers had more in common with an action-comedy. They ought to have replaced Gimli with Chris Rock for all the seriousness he carried through the movie. He was the butt of so many jokes and sight gags that I wanted to fluff out his wig and name him Curly. It was simply impossible to respect him the way he was portrayed, a sad fate for a treasured member of the Fellowship.<br/><br/>In place of plot and deep character development, there was a massive battle spanning 2/3 of the movie, interspersed occasionally with shots of angst-ridden hobbits and Christopher Lee being toady. Arwen disappeared almost entirely, despite playing a large part in the previews. Most of the elves did. Okay, I know they were almost completely absent from the book, but I was still hoping for more since Jackson twisted and warped the plot so badly anyway. Another thing that left me reeling was the death of a character who I'd grown to love. Before I could recover from that, the movie was miraculously and suddenly over, leaving me sitting and staring at the screen open-mouthed. The first words out of my mouth upon the credits rolling were ""That's it?"" Granted, it was a 3 hour movie, and by the end I felt like it was, but there was so much exposition that never happened, so many scenes that flashed past in seconds which should have taken minutes, and not NEARLY enough of Ngila Dickson's magnificent Elven costume designs.<br/><br/>Maybe they'll be in the Extended Ultra Extended Special Edition DVD.<br/><br/>Summary: A superficially wonderful fantasy action flick with characters you feel like you've grown to know from the first movie already laid out for you and breathtaking epic visuals. Unlike Fellowship, the changes to the plot and ""flow"" of Two Towers have made movie and book two entirely separate entities, each deserving of some merit on their own. However, if you go in expecting to be floored, you WILL be disappointed. It's decent, but nowhere near as intense or gripping as the first movie, and if you get easily attached to certain minor characters, brace yourself. It hurts. My rating: 3.8 out of 5."
"Bond-33","8","0","0","18 December 2002"," It tears me in two...
","Having just returned from seeing The Two Towers, i find my self torn in two between my love for Tolkiens original work, and wanting to love this interpretation of it.<br/><br/>Because that's what this film is, an interpretation of the book.  It made a number of changes which I absolutely hate, but can't help to love visually.<br/><br/>
First off, Mr. Jackson, get your priorities in order.  YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BEND TO THE HOLLYWOOD FORMULA!  You don't need to create all these new love stories and stupid cliche triangles between Aragorn, Arwen and Eowyn. These scenes were never in the book, they were only subtexts.  Leave them alone.<br/><br/>
THE ENTS ARE AN INCREDIBLE CREATION!  SHOW THEM OFF!!! The Ents needed much more screen time.  When we're first introduced to Treebeard, Merry and Pippin talk to him for about 30 seconds before we're off someplace else.  He's a new incredibly unique character!  Can we develop his history and culture a little more? PLEASE??  After his introduction, we only cut back to him for periods of a minute or less!  How long have Merry and Pippin been on his shoulders?  Then suddenly it's the march to war, and we don't even get to see their first charge!  Suddenly we cut back from Helms Deep and they're already inside the walls, breaking everything down! No dialogue with Saruman. He should be saying things like,  ""Saruman!  THe Forests are descending on the walls!""  ""What?  Impossible."" Etc.<br/><br/>On the battle of Helms Deep.  This was i'll have to admit, incredible. However you should have played down Gimli's comic relief just a little bit. We should have seen him with a blood lust in his eyes, hacking away at the armies of the orcs, not being too short, tossed by Aragorn and poking people with the end of his Axe.  However the rest of the battle was incredible. Well Done.<br/><br/>On Gollum.  Very nice indeed.  I was worried about his portrayal, and though a tad bit over the top, his dialogue with himself and the aside to the audience was great.  And there were just a couple of shots during the movie where I almost believed he was real.  Impressive.<br/><br/>On Sam and Frodo.  KISS ALREADY!  If you're gonna have them get that close to each other and put all that mushy dialogue in, take it all the way. Frodo, stop overacting.  Sam, stop overacting.  Your monologues are rediculous.  It sounds like you're reciting poetry.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a wonderful, incredible film.  The visuals are very much amazing, however there were almost too many grand sweeping shots, to the point where rather than thinking ""Oh my god, what incredible mountains!"" It was ""Oh look, another sweeping shot of more mountains.""<br/><br/>However, stick with Tolkien, he knew what he was doing.  It's all there in front of you.  If you complain that you had to cut stuff from the book for time, don't go adding stuff back in that wasn't in the book."

","Apart from the world premiere, where the industry insiders and movie critics from the press got to see it first before everyone else, I got to see one of the earliest screenings of the ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" in the<br/><br/>world! And being in Singapore, and as you know, the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, which means Singapore, being somewhere near the Easternmost part of the World (apart from ""Middle-Earth"" New Zealand), I get to see it before anybody else!<br/><br/>It was 5pm on December the 18th, 2002, Singapore time. As the New Line logo comes on screen, I start hearing the familiar music from the soundtrack (""Foundations of Stone"") which I had bought a week earlier. Then I see the snow-peaked mountains of Caradhras. And from then on, it starts with a bang.<br/><br/>And what a bang it was. Right from the beginning to the end, I was restraining myself from answering nature's call (except for the Passage of the Marshes, which I missed, but heck, it's relatively boring, and I might see it again for another 3.. no 5.. no 9 times later). I literally don't want to miss one single frame (except from the occasional subliminal eye blinks)! Oh if only I have photographic memory...<br/><br/>Alright, let me just highlight some parts of the movie which I think is worth mentioning (not necessarily in chronological film order).<br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf's return. When he starts to recount his transcendence into Gandalf the White, there is this brief sequence of abstract stars, lights, rays, as if we're seeing a documentary on cosmology (think Black Holes, Big Bang, Supernovae)... It was almost sci-fi-ish.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gimli's hysterics. His falling off the horse a few times is unnecessary. But hahah... the ""Toss Me"" part is great.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Aragorn. We really get to see the future King of Men revealing his character here, not just as a noble leader, but a fearless warrior. There was once after Haldir died, he fought off a few Uruks and got on one of those ladders and it went swinging down... to a sea of more Uruk-Hai, disregarding all the spikes and other sharp thingies jutting out ready to pike him if he miscalculates his land... That is true valour.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Theoden King. ""Where is the horse and the rider""... this part was from the book, albeit a little altered. The poem is much longer and it was Aragorn who quoted it. It was truly dramatic, almost Shakespearen, except for the redundant blinding white light behind him coming from the door. Where did that come from?</li></ul><br/><br/>And of course, how can any review of TTT fail to mention abt Helm's Deep or the Flooding of Isengard. Simply put, Helm's Deep is the most spectacular sequence since Ben Hur's Chariot Race. And the Flooding, the most awesome since The Ten Commandments' splitting of the Red Sea. Hey, both films have Charlton Heston in them. Heheh..<br/><br/>Hmm.. I'm actually in the middle of writing a novel here. I'd gladly let Peter Jackson adapt it to a movie, anytime, no questions asked."
"duff_99","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," Good, but Jackson changed too much
","I was a huge fan of the FOTR movie adaption, and gave it 10/10. Don't get me wrong: TTT is an amazing movie! But, there is a LOT they could have done to make it better by NOT straying so far from the books. Here's my list, which some other TTT book fans have already noted (warning, spoilers)<br/><br/>King Theoden: In the books, he was a headstrong king, strong within, and was able to make his own choices. In the movie, he's a little whiner who needs nudging from Aragorn every 5 seconds to go to war.<br/><br/>Faramir: This was unacceptable. He's not the same character anymore. In the books, he was a great warrior, wise, and had a strong will. In the movie, he's more rash, impatient and weak willed  then Boromir was. What the hell happened?<br/><br/>Gandalf: Well, not much to say, seeing as how one of the most imposrtant characters of the book is maybe in the movie for 15 minutes. We don't see at all how he's changed from Grey to White.<br/><br/>The whole love thing with Aragorn and Arwen: Ok, we get the friggin point. They love each other, but she has to make a sacrificie. Elrond doesn't want her to go with him. After a whole 30 minutes of watching that, I was nearly asleep.<br/><br/>And what about the 6 chapters that they kind of skipped? Don't I remember something about a spider named Shelob in this book? And about my favourite chapter in the book, where Gandalf and Theoden exchange words with Saruman? I mean, they really could have taken out the unnecessary scenes (Osgilath, Arwen) and made room for these important ones. How do they expect to fit all in Return of the King? And since when does Saruman work for Sauron? Isn't he supposed to be a double traitor? It gives him more depth. He was one of my favourite characters in the book, because of his thirst for power, but now he's just a servant to another power.<br/><br/>And now for the good. Gollum was great! Andy Serkis pulled off an amazing job. Exactly how I imagined him. It gives you the right affect, as you end up pitying him. The Ents were great. My favourite scene in the movie would have to be them attacking Isengard. I just hated how Pippin had to trick Treebeard into going to war. How the hell would one of the oldest beings of the land get tricked by a teenage hobbit? The battle of Helm's Deep was well done, with all the details I remember from the book being there, and the few that were added were good. Excellent job and excitement. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin both did amazing jobs as Frodo and Sam. Frodo was great at showing how the ring was taking over him, and Sam is showing how he's maturing.<br/><br/>In total, a very good movie (hell, I'm sseeing it again in 2 days) but there was much they could work on and add and delete.<br/><br/>8/10"
"eyalsun","Null","0","0","18 December 2002"," Seminal Film, but Does Not Surpass FoTR : Fans of the Legendarium should expect A Few Dissapointments
","There is no doubt TTT is a seminal film, but few fans of the legendarium will appreciate this sequell to the extent that they did FoTR. I'll provide a brief pro vs. con, beginning with con. I am a fan of the LoTR books and the entire legendarium, so this review certainly is not intended for all (especially those who did not read RotK), and I strongly discourage anyone who have yet to see TTT to read it as well.<br/><br/>***** Heavy Spoilers Therein *****<br/><br/>=======> Cons   : =======> - The Elves fighting in Helmes Deep - WHY? I admit I did not expect this. Interposing individual charcters in respect to actions/passages is fine, but a whole peoples? This simply wasn't necessary. The Huorns, which the Ents shepard were not involved, but the Elves. That didn't sit well with me because it dosen't conform to the behaviour of armies amongst the Elves. No Elves army in the entire LoTR book engage in enemies outside their borders. Where are the northern Dunedin, the remnants of Arnor, Aragorn folks who join (albeit after the battle of Helms Deep) with Elrond's sons. I sincerly hope that we will see them in RotK, but I mention them because I initially thought that the unexpected (& from my standpoint unwarrented) Elves army was them.<br/><br/><ul><li>Edoras/Meduseld(sp.) looked like a fort. It should have been castle-ed. It should have been larger, not Minas Tirith grandness but some grandness nonetheless. The gate certainly should have been bigger. Likewise at the battle of Helms Deep the scales were again significantly shrunk, 300 vs. 10,000, where in fact it was 1000+ .</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Music was not as monumental as FoTR. It was good but not great, certainly not as epic as in FoTR. A completely different ethos here in that respect, and that's too bad.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Faramir Kidnapps Frodo to Osgiliath. I'm fine with Farmair fighting at Osgliliath before he returns to Minas Tirith to tell his father/Gandalf that he encountered Forodo. But for Faramir to fall for the ring to that extent is really a bastardization of his character in the book all under the guise of making us understand that the ring is evil. We get it! Galadriel said her ""I will diminish and remain Galadriel"" speech; Gandalf had his ""don't tempt me, Fordo"" one; Aragorn had his ""I would have walked with you to the very fires of Mordor"" one. Faramir should be similarly redeemed. That is, the speech/state whereby he lusts for the ring is the 'exception' to his personality (unlike Boromir's), he dosen't need to physically kidnap Frodo and -then- have an epipheny. A subtle difference I'm sure not too many people would even notice. Oh well. Onwards.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gimly is comic relief in the book to an extent but I think this was a bit overdone here. Nonetheless sometimes this worked really well, not always though.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lagolas has this weird panic attack during the Battle of Helms Deep. Very out-of-character from the book. Very out-of-charachter for FoTR the movie, in fact.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Eomer and Gimly's antagonism-to-friendship relationship was'nt developed. Perhaps the extended version will. Hopefully.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Theoden is too young-looking. I fon't mind that overdramatic bit of exorcism Gandalf pulls on Saruman to remove him from controlling Theoden's mind (even though that didn't happen in the book). Theoden should have gotten younger-looking after that ordeal, but he should have had white hair and beard &amp; quite a bit older.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf should have been doing more talking/ be less uninvolved. Enough Forodo already, give us some more Gandalf! And maybe some more Saruman as well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>M&amp;P interaction with Treebeard + other Ents could have been handled better. And there should have been more Ent-types (especially spruce-like). The Ents seemed a tad homogenious in their basic architecture. I didn't mind that a dam replaced the channeling of the river Isen's current, but perhaps we could have seen there was a dam ten seconds before we see it being torn down. And the Ent that supposebly burns, should have perhaps burned. Some tragedy especially authentic to the book is good. Did we really need a deus ex machina to rescue him? But maybe I'm off on this one, because it was pretty cool, almost cartoonish.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Where is Eowyn's malaise. This is pretty pivotal stuff here. She should have been a conflicted, suffering, in-love, heroic, and an in-depth complex character. Only some of these traits from the book were integrated in her character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gandalf final battle with the Balrog should have had more lighnings involved! I hope the extended version will offer more of that. As the book described, it should have been as if there was a storm up there. But a truly an excelent scene(s) here, so this battle will also be a plus.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Maybe it was the cinema's low framerate, but some battle scenes seemed a bit too jumbled and didn't translate well on-screen. Mybe these will look better on the higher fps DvD.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li> Some of the scene(s) between Arwen and Aragorn were really good, but some were just plain redundent. A movie of this scope, of this kind, cannot afford any redundance whatsoever though!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Elrond is ready to run away!? Elrond objects to Arwen &amp; Aragorn's union, that's fine I can swallow that change easily. But him ready to sail away and have the Valar protect him far in the West seems awfully wimpy. Elrond has not been one of the foremost leaders of all that is good and wise and true in Middle Earth for a thousand years to simply run-away. Sauron, the last 'large-scale' supernatural evil of the angelic order is largely the reason Elrond remained in Middle Earth for that long. Very out of charachter. What was albeit inadvertant nonetheless translated into a somewhat profound lack of bravery. In the book, Elrond will not leave until all his said and done, and he will send his sons to battle Sauron as well.</li></ul><br/><br/>=======> Pros : =======> + Gandalf fight/falling scene with the Balrog, his meeting with Aragorn, Gimly & Lagolas, and the Battle of Helms Deep (albeit a bit too cartoonish at times) are spectacular scenes. On the merits of these epic scenes alone, this movie could be considered very worthwhile. Quite a few other really good scenes as well that truly shine.<br/><br/>+ Many passages/attributes from the book were retained (thankfully!). While often interposed in various ways, for a Tolkien fan this is what original Shakespere passages evoke in a shaksperean scholar. It is precious to me.<br/><br/>
+ Technical cinematographic qualities of this movie are, once again virtually beyond reproach. The Golum character was sufficient, I thought, I didn't find it as lacking as some other critics here have in it being too trasperently computer-animated-y. Formal beauty of the topography of Middle Earth and of artificial constrcuts is once again absolutely breathtaking. This movie also becomes worthwhile to pay to see at the ciename (not to mention buying/renting the DvD) on these merits alone.<br/><br/>+ Extended version may still make more sense out of the theatrical release. Definitely something to look forward to. Hopefully there is more than half an hour that had been cut-out. Now that everything is said and done, the more stuff that has in fact been cut-out the happier I will be.<br/><br/>===========> Conclusions: ===========> As detailed and undoutedly tedious my 'cons' list has been (especially vis.a.vis the pros), this is still an amazing movie qualifying as a near-masterpiece. I highly doubt I will see a movie I like as much until RotK. The same impetus exists in terms of my love for this movie and my reservations, and this has to do with my affinity to Talkien's LoTR & the rest of his body of work - the most impressive work of fiction (& I'm including scriptures/mythologies in this) ever created. From that standpoint a comparison with the monumental movie, FoTR - who I found revised the book in an acceptable, sensible, & far less significant (not to mention pivotal even) manner - is unavoidable.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, this isn't close to being as bad as Attack of the Clowns/Phantom Menace is when compared to The Empire Strikes Back, let say, but I suspect fans of Tolkien will be slightly (or depending on how pragmatic they are in this sense, more so) dissapointed with the sheer extent of the revisionism vis.a.vis FoTR.<br/><br/>Nonetheless this is clearly a Must-See several-times-over kind of film. Easily earning 9 out of 10 and even higher, but not the 10++ /10 FoTR earned in my view.<br/><br/>The best movie this year, most likely yes. Best movie in decades (as was the case with FoTR, I thought), from how it struck me, unfortunately it did not reach such a high level, not to mention surpassing FoTR. In short, not a cinematic feat as FoTR was, but we can hope that RotK will be! Even surpassing both FoTR & TTT!<br/><br/>To sum up, notwithstanding all these long-whinded qualifications, drawbacks and criticisms (and note that this is merely a seen-it-once from midnight-to-3am impression), I still highly, highly recommended to pay to see this at the cinema. It is, ultimately, very worthwhile. I may not go see it four times as I did FoTR, but I will pay to see it in the theatre again."

","Warning ! Warning ! This contains movie material, please do not read if you have yet to see the movie.<br/><br/>At last and least the sequel to the Lord of the Rings : The Fellowship of the Ring falls into blasphemy. Jackson as a director did a great job , but who may I ask on the screen writers , the five of them haven't read the second book . They did a major FUBAR. And unfortunately as the movie is out , it is too late to stop that FUBAR from spreading any further. First of all they have butchered the second Book. If they had filmed the movie as the book was written, the rest of the Fellowship ,meaning Aragorn and the rest in the first half and frodo in the second it would have been a much better movie. Secondly if they had Followed what FARAMIR DID DO in the books it would have been a better movie. He never took them into a Human Controlled CITY . What happened people ,did adding Stephen Sinclair to the screenwriters list mess everyone Up? The battlescenes were okay , but My problems in this movie go onwards. 1) Eomer was never banished. 2) Frodo never went to a human city 3.) Famamir was not tempted to take the ring 4.) Frodo never threatened Sam with Sting. 5.) At the battle of Helm's Deep there were Humans, 1 ,count them 1 Dwarf ,and One; ONE ELF. Legolas. 6.) The Trees were bigger and the Ents decided to march off to war after Treebeard saw the damage to the trees by Isengard , and then the gathering was called. I am depressed by this blasphemy that something of such great writing has now been let loose in this world as a Nickle and Dime, play to the masses and the politically correct populace, and play to the children.<br/><br/>The actors were wonderfully played and done, don't get me wrong the animation, the characters ,most of them were great but well read my last thoughts. The actors can not be blamed for other people's mistakes. Lastly , maybe if they had made it a R rated film and did it right the first time, it would have been a good movie . Unfortunately for the Director and the Screen Writes ,and let us hope they learn from it before releasing the third movie. For if this is how the trilogy will end up then I think even Tolkien would roll over in his grave and what started off as a good piece of work; the first movie; now with the second fall into a bottomless pit. May the third installment make up for this sequel."

","We showed up at 5:00 for the 5:30 showing and the rest of the shows were already sold out for the night. Fortunately, I had purchased our tickets online last week (at the matinÃ©e prices, no less). After sitting in the third row, center, we were shown ads for drivel such as Legally Blonde 2 and Dumb & Dumber 2 (titled Dumb & Dumberer). This is their target audience? Shrugging off the insult to my intelligence, I was treated to the visual and intellectual ride of my theater-going life. The first few minutes are simply INTENSE, and will make you want more, which the final hour of the 3-hour tour provides. I will try not to reveal or spoil too much for those not finished with the books yet.<br/><br/>Let me first say that Peter Jackson has skillfully remained faithful to the books, but yet still created his own version of the story by taking creative license when he deemed necessary. Some events are invented, rearranged, or removed, but it is easily apparent when taking into consideration the task at hand. My overall impression is that what may have gone overlooked in the books is highlighted enough to show emphasis, yet not overemphasized as to feel insulted.<br/><br/>The movie handles most of the second book, ending way before the ""other side of the mountain"" is even reached. It made sense to be a good place to pause the story, since the main climaxes had just happened (Helm's Deep, and Isengard). Gollum is featured prominently (and almost repulsively), and Faramir's roll is enhanced a little. There is also more emphasis on Arwen & Aragorn's relationship, too, but that's for the chicks, I think. Aragorn has a large roll throughout.<br/><br/>The special effects are, again, intense. The 10,000 computer-generated orcs are quite convincing. My trained and critical eye had a hard time finding any flaws, and I think I only found one (I could be wrong). If anything, the battle scenes seemed a bit too flashy, and by that I mean the action zipped by the screen so fast that I could hardly tell what was happening. Truly a candidate for next-gen video game youngsters on speed with slo-mo remotes. (Or am I just getting old?) Otherwise, superb. And the cinematography is, well, how can anyone take a bad picture of New Zealand? Spectacular. Even the musical score seemed improved (and note that Enya does not contribute to the soundtrack this time).<br/><br/>Everyone's acting is nothing less than excellent. Gimli the Dwarf plays a large part in providing comic relief, almost unexpectedly sometimes, which truthfully I thought the books lacked. Again, here is but one of the many examples where the film provides what seems like added ""bonus"" material to the books, without leaving you feeling disappointed about what they left out or changed.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this film a carefully weighed 10, which is a grade not readily handed out in my book."

"edward-cahill","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," This One Goes to 11!
","Since The Fellowship of the Ring was clearly a ""10"" in it's scope, acting, effects and story, calling Two Towers a ""10"" does it a great injustice. The acting in this installment is again top notch, especially the performance by Bernard Hill as Theoden, which should secure him a Best Supporting Actor nod from the Academy. New love interest Eowyn (Miranda Otto) is also deserving of great praise. I longingly await the release of the extended version of Towers in the hope that it contains more of her character. Despite these exceptional performances, plus the emergence of considerably more content on Aragorn (heart-throb), Gimli (comic relief) and Samwise (true hero), the film is completely and entirely stolen by Gollum/Smeagol. Not only is the CG character the most believable ever put up on the big-screen, but his schizophrenic debates are nothing short of pure cinematic gold. Can a CG character be nominated for an Oscar???<br/><br/>The grand finally with its interlaced battle scenes between Helm's Deep, Osgiliath (Gondor) and Isengard is among the best I've ever seen on film, particularly the epic battle at Helm's Deep. The detailed battle scenes, a very realistic view of siege warfare and medieval combat, are better than those in Braveheart (A Best Picture award winner). Of course, giving that TTT is a Fantasy, as opposed to a completely fictionalized historical drama (alla Braveheart), I fully expect it will be ignored, again, for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars. It shouldn't however, for it deserves both of these awards.<br/><br/>Only two very small complaints: I would have enjoyed seeing more of Christopher Lee's fantastic performance as Saruman. I would also have preferred an altogether new voice actor for the voice-over on Treebeard, who clearly sounded too much like Gimli (John Rhys-Davies). Neither point adversely affects the film.<br/><br/>A well acted and filmed, timeless epic with meaning and applicability for all the Ages, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers soars well beyond a `10' rating. This film goes to `11'."
"Altima","7","0","0","18 December 2002"," Is this the same director??
","Note, there may be spoilers in these comments.<br/><br/>I just returned from Ireland's first showing of the film. I was at the first showing on The Fellowship of the Ring last year and was blown away, and I still hold that it was more deserving than ""A Beautiful Mind"" for last year's ""Best Picture"" Oscar. It got many things right, the characterizations were perfect, the locals were amazing, set design was top notch, special effects, cinematography, landscapes and script were superb. They couldn't have improved it.<br/><br/>unfortunately it seems that this film was tainted by Hollywood execs who wanted more bucks from this film and padded it full of stuff to bring in a more varied audience. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film does not have the same focus as the last. The characters are separated, doing different things. In the book, it mostly deals with each group's quest one at a time according to the timeline. in this film, it switches between them constantly, trying to squash all of these events that happened over a certain timeline into a much smaller timeframe. It seems disjointed.<br/><br/>Secondly, there are major story rewrites. This was forgivable in the first film (Face it, Tom Bombadil deserved to be cut, and the sweet scene between Aragorn and Arwen was nice) but in The Two Towers, a full 45 minutes of the film is just invented, padding out the time that should have been spent on the relevant story. Most of these scenes are painfully clichéd and remind one of Fabio romance novels, especially the cover illustrations. Also, Frodo heads to a particular place far too early, a book too early in fact. I'm not looking forward to the rewrites they'll do for Return of the King.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and mood of the film is surprisingly different from the Fellowship. Last year's film was dark, brooding and full of impending doom. Well, if the doom has come in The Two Towers, it wasn't much to worry about. It's full of one-liners. The comedic angle is exploited far too much, at the expense of Gimli's character especially. The first film did an excellent job of portraying the relatively minor characters of Gimli and Legolas. They hate each other at first because of racial differences, but soon grow fond of each other. Gimli's range of emotion is surprisingly versatile, especially seen in the Mines of Moria. Despite the large focus on Gimli's and Legolas's relationship with each other in the book, none of it is present in the film. None.<br/><br/>Set design was another disappointment. Yes, Rohan was a feat that none of it was CGI, but it still looked awful and downright small. The scale in this film, with the notable exception of the Battle at Helm's Deep was far too small. Entire cities we are supposed to care about are not much bigger than the little towns that get ravaged early on.<br/><br/>
In the oft-discussed Battle of Helm's Deep, there's a lot to like. Unfortunately, there are at least a dozen times when the focus cuts from the action to a Titanic-esque look at the women and children cowering in the caves. Just one shot of that would be forgivable, but it shows them so much it just becomes annoying.<br/><br/>Also, The film ends before the book does! It handles the three major quests at dif ferent paces; so Frodo's quest takes him into Return of the King territory while the rest of the story leaves off only halfway through!<br/><br/>But there are plenty of good things about the film. The highlight is Gollum. This CGI ch a racter gives the best performance out of anyone in the film! (Even the likes of Gandalf are sub-par in this film, when he returns he is so unlike the character we knew before that one almost wishes the Balrog ate him) Gollum is a triumph of computer animation and his voiceover is excellent as well. There were also a couple moments of visual brilliance, like at Barad-Dûr.<br/><br/>But over all I give this film a 6/10, whereas Fellowship earned a 9/10. It is not a worthy sequel to Fellowship and considering it was all filmed at the same time I am at a loss as to how it could have turned out like this."
"mt7176","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," The Two Towers is Three Hours of FUN!
","Let me just say this movie was good.  How good?  Well it made three hours seem to go by as if they were only 2 hours.  The only time I was dissapointed was when it was over.  I was like, ""No, it can't be over. Please, I want some more!""  It ends much in the same fashion as the first film ended and if you are just a poor slob like me it will have you wanting more.  I wouldn't say it was any better than the Fellowship movie but it is definately as good.<br/><br/>As well the first film actually I think is a little darker in tone and this new film is more action oriented and has less to do with a foreboding mood. In this film the characters are just thrusted into the events that are happening and in the midst of it there are pockets of humor which lightens the film up a bit.<br/><br/>Things to look forward to is the battle of Helm's Deep.  It was just as I imagined while I was reading the books for the first time last year and so was the case with the Ents storming Sarauman's tower.  Absolutely breathtaking.  I know there were some changes such as the elves showing up to fight along with men but these sorts of changes were to serve the film. Lets face it the books are wonderfully written but in order to make them work on film you have to do a bit of adapting and summarizing.  All and all the film is faithful to Tolkiens world and the ideals behind it.<br/><br/>
The new characters were good additions to the film and were played with talented actors.  Especially the man who played the king of Rohan.  They along with the bantering between Legolas and Gimli and Aaragon and the struggles of Frodo and Sam keep you interested for the first two hours before you get to the epic battle scenes.  The more fantastical creatures like the ents and Gollum are enjoyable to watch but I really don't think they take center stage nor should they.<br/><br/>In the end I walk away with the same feeling as I did with the Fellowship film.  Peter Jackson has done one of the most brilliant jobs in film making and LORD OF THE RINGS IS GREAT."
"IcemanCometh","9","0","0","18 December 2002"," Jackson continues to channell Tolkien
","The Two Towers: It's official, Lucas is the padawan of film makers, Peter Jackson is the master.<br/><br/>New Line Cinema will go down in the annals as having made a brilliant decision at a time in it's history where a gaffe could have sunken them, and we as filmgoers should be amply grateful that things fell into place the way that they have(these people that gave Jackson LotR also gave Raimi Spiderman - I think I see a trend). Now, granted, Jackson was handed one of the greatest stories ever told to bring to cinematic life, which Lucas was not, but Lucas could certainly follow some leads here on returning some humanity, lightness, and real dimensions into his upcoming swan song; after all, turnabout is fair play - Lucasfilm gave WETA their first leg up on a lot of the CGI technology prior to the Fellowship. But full marks to New Line for making some uncharacteristically shrewd moves at the studio level which are going to continue to pay large dividends over the remainder of the decade. THus far, Lord of the Rings has been all that Episodes I and II have promised to be without any of the sloppy shortcuts.<br/><br/>A steady barrage of well plotted action, more polished performances by a cast little in need of polish in the first film, fanatic dedication to the material by all involved, and the discerning hand of Peter Jackson and his staff bringing it all together adds up to one of those rare sequels that at least matches the original, but in some ways surpasses it.<br/><br/>
Some have been mistakenly critical, but count me amongst those in the majority that found the way this movies hit the ground running to be a major positive. The backstory well established for all but the foolish holdouts, Jackson sees no need to build his story up, and launches right into chapter 2 of the saga with vigor. Opening with a teaser of the unseen footage of the Balrog battle from Fellowship, eyes are popped early on and make their way back into the sockets only during brief respites where the story is glued together. Really refreshing to see an epic like this done so painstakingly and with such dedication to craftsmanship without sacrificing an iota of story advancement.<br/><br/>My biggest fear before his first scene(wasn't kept waiting long) was that Gollum wouldn't work - CGI simply hasn't been 100% successful imo with central characters to date, but you can chalk up another breakthrough for Jackson. His wise decision in hiring Andy Serkis to not only voice the character and map out his motions, but to also perform his scenes live during filming payed off handsomely. Nothing short of groundbreaking the way Gollum fits into the movie so seamlessly.<br/><br/>And WETA did not lose a step either going into this second movie. The many otherworldly denizens of middle earth are brought convincingly to life on grand scales(of number and size), the locales of Barad Dur, Helmsdeep, Rohan, and Isengard are completely mesmerizing, and the battle choreographies and sequences of mass destruction are again new standard bearers for the industry.<br/><br/>In short, a great movie on all fronts.<br/><br/>4/4 stars"

","1. Fight scenes were certainly fighty, but not a lot else. The last hour of the film was, in essence, a treat for video game audiences, but probably not for anyone who likes acting, dialogue, or round characters.<br/><br/>2. Gollum, the new Jar-Jar. I thought someone had pumped nitrous oxide into the theater during his little schizophrenic bouts. The crowd was cracking up. I thought filmmakers had figured out circa 1923 or thereabouts that, being a visual medium, film lacks the ability to show inward conflict well. Peter Jackson apparently hails from the overwritten monologue school of screenwriting.<br/><br/>3. They messed with the book yo.<br/><br/>4. The homosexual subtext between Sam and Frodo was so thick it was more like text. Either tone it down a bit or just have them forsake their quest, move to Vermont, and get married. :)<br/><br/>5. Howard Shore's ultra-melodramatic score makes Oliver and Company look like an Edgard Varese piece.<br/><br/>6. The opening scene. Way to be subtle, Mr. Jackson. Start with a fireball. I'll bet you learned that little high concept trick at film school, eh?<br/><br/>7. Legolas sliding down the stairs on a small sheet of metal. Why do I think this will reappear in the video game?<br/><br/>8. The comic relief had me in stitches. No, literally. I needed stitches after clawing at my face in embarrassment for three hours."

The wrong things: -Eomer's speech to Wormtongue about lusting after his sister (which should have occurred after Gandalf confronts him and Theoden) -Eomer being banished by Wormtongue for said speech.( He gets banished for taking forces out on patrol without Theoden's leave). -Aragorn falling off the cliff in that fight and being presumed dead,and getting returned to life by some form of long distance healing by Arwen. -Elrond becoming a huge anti-human bigot and trying to break-up Arwen and Aragorn.(He did try and dissuade those two,but it happened well before the current storyline(pre-LOTR),and during the LOTR saga he was well reconciled to their love.) -All the elves leaving and then deciding to go and fight at the battle of Helm's Deep.(Never happened,only elf there was Legolas.Other elves,namely Elrond's sons,showed up after with all the Rangers). -Faramir lusting after the ring,and taking Frodo and Sam to Osgillath.(He never wanted the Ring,and while he does go to Osgillath,it's after he and Frodo et.al part ways.He never takes them there with him.) -No ""glittering caves of aglarond"" in the battle for Helm's Deep. -The Entmoot ending with the Ents deciding not to fight,and Fangorn being browbeaten/tricked into fighting by Merry and Pippin.(Dead wrong,the Entmoot ends after several days with the Ents deciding to fight.) -Orcs with crossbows. (no way,just no way) -The ""olympic torch runner orc"" that sets off the explosive at Helm's Deep.( I don't know what to say here,except for just no.Did not happen.) -The Frodo confronting the Nazgul at Osgillath scene. ( I can't even begin to describe how wrong that is.Since he was never at Osgillath,and after he leaves the Shire,I can't see how he could have confronted a Nazgul there.) -The wargs. ( I dunno what those things were,but they were not wolves and that's what the wargs are supposed to be.)<br/><br/>Ok,now for what was done well. -The Balrog/Gandalf fight scene. -Smeagol/Gollum conversation scene. -The Entfight at Isengard. -The confrontation/discussion between Aragorn,Gimli,and Legolas and the Riders with Eomer.<br/><br/>Sadly,that's about it.Now,I know some will disagree,but please keep in mind that this is just my opinion and nothing more.I've tried to include,where I knew it offhand,what should've happened or why I feel the way I do about each issue to try to give some justification.I may even be in error about some of the above,and if I am,then I do apologize to all involved.<br/><br/>Just my 2 cents worth."

","Right, first off - this film is awesome - the wide sweeping pan shots are used to the full extent against breathtaking scenery; the special effects blend beautifully with the live action and the battle scenes are simply amazing.<br/><br/>Now I've read a lot of gripes about how the director strayed from the book, but to these people I say this - you are watching a film, not reading the book. The medium is different and a massive story has to be condensed to 3 hours. Also there are large sections of the book that work well as prose but if filmed would be deadly dull so a certain amount of artistic license has to creep in. Also if the story was told exactly how the book ran, what sort of surprises and twists would there be for those people that know the books well?<br/><br/>As someone who is familiar with the books but not read them for about 20 years, the story did NOT jar at any point, it flowed nicely from point to point and also the director cut between the three threads (Sam & Frodo, Pippin and whatsisface and finally the battle for Rohan) very nicely.<br/><br/>There are going to be a lot of mixed feelings about this film considering it is of one of the most famous and well known stories on the planet. My suggestion is that you should just watch it and enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>There was humour and I think (although some will disagree) it defused the situation just the right amount.<br/><br/>No spoilers but things to watch out for and enjoy: The Battle of the Keep, The Attack of the Ents, The Battle of Gandalf and the Balrog, Dragons, Gollum.<br/><br/>This film is better than the 1st - I hate to think how good the third would be.<br/><br/>The only negative thing I can think of is that as the film ends you realise you now have to wait a year for the final chapter!!<br/><br/>This scores 9.9 out of 10"

","FINALLY!!!  Peter Jackson has proven that it is indeed possible to CGI a character and it look 100% realistic.

I say YES!<br/><br/>I saw The Two Towers last night full of the same kind of anticipation that I had for Star Wars Episode One.  I walked away from this movie feeling breathless.<br/><br/>The story starts right where Fellowship ended and splices the stories of the members of the Fellowship flawlessly.  Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor when they meet Gollum.  Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas tracking the kidnapped Merry and Pippin where they meet and ""old friend"".  They end up with the Rohan.  From this point on it is non stop action.  The battle of Helm Deep is breathtaking.  CGI where needed, everything else, good old fashioned battle scenes.  Merry and Pippin have their own story with the Ents that is humouring and moving.<br/><br/>Everything climaxes to a point that leaves you screaming at the credits. Three hours?  Pah, I could have sat there for another three hours.  December 2003 cannot happen soon enough.<br/><br/>Lucas take note before directing Episode 3.  Sit down with Peter Jackson.

","First off - to the purists who will bemoan the fact that he made more substantial changes from the book - get over it. Film and novels are two different media and he has been honest all along is saying that the films are HIS vision of Tolkien's work. To those out there who just don't get fantasy and never will - stay home, you won't like this one either. To the other 98 percent of the world - go and enjoy an experience that you will never forget. When Return of the King is released, Peter Jackson will have given the world an unprecedented gift of 3 movies that are truly one and tell the greatest epic adventure we will ever see. This one was going to be difficult to do as the middle part of the Trilogy was always the least satisfying. Jackson managed to keep the story threads moving without confusing them, gave the plot more heart and soul than came through reading the books and gave us the single most incredible battle ever put on film. But he also gave us the little details and emotions that explain why Samwise said what he did. Any why Gollum/Smeagol is so truly pathetic and Frodo feels tied to him. I came out of the theater stunned, as if I had just walked through a hurricane. It was the most incredible movie experience I have ever had. Howard Shore has outdone himself with the soundtrack and the actors and crew have again demonstrated their complete commitment to excellence. George Lucas should be forced to sit and watch this movie over and over until he understands how he betrayed himself and his fans. It will be shear torture waiting another year, but I have total confidence in the hobbit from New Zealand."

","Spoiler Alert grrrr97, you've got to relax and take a step back.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some chapters missing from the end of TTT.  If you paid attention during the film, you'll remember Gollum deciding to let ""her"" kill the Hobbits.  ""Her"" is obviously Shelob, so it becomes apparent that PJ is merely finishing off here, for now... and we'll see the rest in the next film.<br/><br/>Remember that The Return of the King is much, much shorter than the first two parts of LOTR.  So, in the interests of turning a profit, New Line and PJ are making three, 3-hour films... instead of a 3-hour film, a 4-hour film and a 90 minute film.  Most of Return of the King is battles.  This way, we'll have a great setup, then great battles.<br/><br/>As for the Arwen-Aragorn storyline.  These are excerpts from the appendix that Tolkien himself wrote detailing their long courtship.  It serves three purposes here:  1) to give us an idea of what the issues are vis-a-vis elves and men; 2) to give the less-than-pedantic-Tolkien-fan public something akin to a love story (I don't know if you've noticed, but there is a lot of epic-fighting and very little else going on) and 3) graft in a beautiful story that many people aren't even aware of because they got to the end of ROTK and saw a couple hundred pages of what they assumed to be family trees and glossaries.<br/><br/>Reading LOTR again has given me an appreciation for how much narration Tolkien did.  For all the story and pagecount, there isn't that much dialog between characters.  In a visual medium like film, you can't relate the fact that beyond Middle Earth elves and men are doomed to be apart till the end of time unless somebody speaks it.  You need to fill people in if they haven't read the books.<br/><br/>You or I can cry bloody murder all we want, but at the end of the day, PJ has done an outstanding job of staying true to the original story while making a film that EVERYONE (not just the Tolkien geeks) can enjoy.<br/><br/>There's a lot more in adapting a masterpiece to film than just reading the original manuscript."

","Just seen it w/ 2 friends, and... well the three of us weren't overly impressed.<br/><br/>1. Storyline. Omissions and some changes are always in order. Most of Jackson's changes in Pt. 1 follow the BBC radio version. Fine. Tolkien's pt.2 is fairly choking to me at times - he wanted chivalry, so there's a lot of kneeling and being knighted to serve The King etc. *yuck* to me - but lotsa people like it. Jackson skips much of that, and replaces it with a little bit of ""die for the nation"". yuck.<br/><br/>2. Characters. The novel has at least some complexity in several characters. They botch up things and pay for it. Good & educational. Jackson skips much of that, replacing some of it with his own invented father-daughter ""follow your destiny"" - ""no I'll follow my heart"" conflict. Not good enough.<br/><br/>Some characters are one-dimensional much of the time, but then they just flip to another pose without any apparent reason. Others are just sliced into rather thin cardboard. Gollum is an exception, being explicitly and over-explicitly schizo. Tolkien's creation was racialist (meaning: race determines character). Jackson ""fixes"" this by making everybody white except the rest, which are monsters. okaaayy... Now in Tolkien the elf-dwarf-man relation would perhaps show that race can be transcended with an effort (at least among good races). Here it's simply inexplicable why they're such good friends. Gollum is perhaps the saver characterwise, but then we move to...<br/><br/>3. Visuals Is this the greatest CGI of all time? Well, it's really good, but last I checked the clock it hadn't stopped ticking yet. The landscapes looked good - though  the snow-clad mountain ranges got fairly repetitive. The massed creatures looked good and moved good. The single creature at close range (Gollum/Sméagol) looked like some latex CGI concoction. Not quite there yet, but perhaps in a few year's time. (oh, the trees just looked whacky, but what the heck, the idea is freaked-out anyway)<br/><br/>Then there's the nagging question, it's the most expensive, overwhelming, fantastic project, created by hundreds of talented people working for months... and we get *this*??? Watchable but immensely forgettable."

","After having read some comments on IMDb and reviews in newspapers I finally got to see the movie myself and I don't actually know what people are complaining about. Entertaiment doesn't get better than this. I think I can safely promise to anyone who goes to see this movie that he/she won't be bored at all.<br/><br/>This is not one of these stupid CGI and action-filled Movies without heart and essence. I guess you knew this already because FOTR wasn't either. The story - and what Jackson made of it - is so epic and gripping that i was more than once shivering and shaking in my seat. I don't want to go into detail because i think most people know the story and for those who don't it may spoil the fun.<br/><br/>But what I really have to say to people who dislike the movie because they say it doesn't stick close to the book or because something isn't quite looking like they wanted to or blah blah blah...<br/><br/>How can you be this annoying? I mean, there are people who know everyone from these three books. They can tell the slightest difference between book and movie and dislike most of them. Well, sure, this is your opinion. I don't want to hurt anybodys feelings, but there are more books out there - even, although it may sound unbelievable - better ones. Normally i really understand peoples feelings towards books very much. I myself read a lot and i am mostly disappointed with book adaptions (didn't like the HP Movies very much) but with this one, i really can't follow these arguments. This movie is so brilliant and epic especially the way it gets you emotionally involved that i dare to say: it is better than the book. This is the tale of a handful of heroes who try to save their world and it pretty much feels like this. What do you want more? Are these changes really spoiling the quality of this movie?<br/><br/>No, they aren't. The movie works pretty well for itself and it takes the essence of Tolkiens story - if there is any. Tolkien himself said - if i remember this right - that the books do not have a deeper meaning, that they should stand as what they are: an epic fantasy tale.<br/><br/>*****mild spoiler*******<br/><br/>
So, why is it bad then to change Faramirs character to focus on the essence of Frodos journey - the rising danger of the ring?<br/><br/>
****end of mild spoiler******<br/><br/>
It isn't. This movie has to simplify the book and it does this pretty well. Look at what they've done to the Harry Potter books: they even forgot to give Harry a character! I cannot understand what people love so much about the books that they do not find in the movie. Yes, I know, the books full of details about the history of middle-earth. And I know, they take a lot of time for everything. E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. Many times they are plain boring and not at all brilliantly written. This is my opinion. You may dislike me for it, but i did not feel anything while reading them. To me the characters and landscapes remained blurry and dull. I still liked the story and think that what Tolkien thought up is a brilliant piece of work, but his books didn't get me involved.<br/><br/>The movie did. It got me very involved. And to get this to an end:<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie gives Tolkiens story the epic scale and especially the feelings that should have been in the book. And it is a brilliant movie in itself. It is so good that i think complaining about it is a complete waste of time, because as i said in the beginning: Entertainment doesn't get better than this. And after all movies and books of this kind mostly are about entertainment, aren't they?"

","""The Two Towers"" is every bit as good as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Why? Because it is pretty much the same movie. Stylistically, the movie hasn't changed from last year, and that's a good thing. It is just a continuation of the classic story, now with more characters and action, but the heart and purpose the same. People who didn't see last year's film are going to be hopelessly confused. Go rent it! The new characters in the film are truly great. Bernard Hill was wonderful as Theoden. Brad Dourif was simply a marvel to watch, and Miranda Otto was great too. Gollum is going down in cinema history as being the most realistic computer creation ever. The filmmakers could not have done a better job. I was stunned and shocked at how glorious he was. Andy Serkis is a genius. The Ents are also smashing. In the beginning they are the definition of cool, in the end they are the definition of killing machines. Quite something to behold, indeed! Like last year, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Ian McKellan, and Viggo Mortensen are terrific, as well as the rest of the cast. Shore has a sure score again in this one. There are also many simple and beautiful visual touches that add a lot of cinematographic artistic dimension to the piece. Of course the movie does have flaws. Much is lost from the book, the result being that the movie feels extremely unresolved. There just seems to be too much Peter Jackson is going to have to squeeze in for ""The Return of the King"" next year. Also, there are many things that happen in the film that don't happen in the book at all. Some are really cool, and some are completely unnecessary. But still, overall, these are shaping up to be the movies of the century. These films are so good, they are positively going to stand the test of time. Keep up the good work, Peter! I'm breathless. 10/10"
"QuintessentialQuipper","Null","0","0","19 December 2002"," An epic film
","Please beware of minor spoilers in this review!<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed this film, and on numerous levels: Does it have Humor? Yes.  Romance?  Yes.  Action?  Oh, yes.  Deep truths to ponder?  Yes, if you're willing to do so.  I am a college professor, so perhaps that is why the last way in which I enjoyed the film means the most to me.<br/><br/>Two themes that struck home to me were: 1) the concept of death's very clear reality (e.g., how THE love affair might end in death someday: pictured by the movie so well in the scene where we see a body slowly ""morph"" into a sarcophagus), and 2) the counter play regarding what is worth living for (e.g., the shire?  What if it's not there anymore? Then--the cause of good?).  Powerful themes.  The movie is made, I presume, primarily for entertainment; still, such concepts as the very nature of life and death permeate the movie and add a deeper layer, and a deeper value.<br/><br/>The environmental theme was probably more important to write about half-a-century ago, I think.  It has now become clear to most people that we must balance technological advances with our duty to preserve the resources God has given to us.  Still, I like trees:  I feel sad when they are chopped down, even with good reason--but the idea of doing so doesn't freeze me with fear.  Everything in balance: People can actually be -too- environmentalist!<br/><br/>Even though I'm a thinker, however, the movie's action really grabbed me--WOW is it good.  The word epic means, ""Surpassing the usual or ordinary, particularly in scope or size"", and thus it aptly describes this amazing movie.  My rating for this film is 10/10.  I'm very picky about movies, but this film easily takes a place as one of my favorite movies ever.  I highly recommend it."

","As a fan of the trilogy and the movies to date, I find myself in a juxtaposition as I bet many reviewers are.<br/><br/>While I doubt I could have ever hoped or received a better cinematic adaptation of the tales with the same quality as Peter Jackson has delivered, I find myself asking numerous questions as I praise a stellar job.<br/><br/>Having read the books multiple times both prior and since the release of Peter Jacksons' masterpieces. I have always had what I believe the same queries as he as I read the books.. How can this be done??<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, aside from the fact that he does scale down the vast text, remains true as possible to it during the 3+ hour offering. Capturing the vital elements to each part of the whole story and displaying them to us as grandly as possible is in essence what he does so well.<br/><br/>And therein lies the magic! The things I found lacking were few, but in my opinion for the viewer and the continuity of the story they were critical.<br/><br/>First was the forced pilgrimage of Frodo and Samwise to Gondor at the hand of Faramir which never took place in the books.<br/><br/>Authenticity states that they traveled together in curiosity of each other but in companionship for some time conversing. I assume the course of events taken in the movie were for the purpose of including the fall of Osgiliath and the incorporation of Gondor into the Two Towers in the allotted time.<br/><br/>Second to my distaste was the time Merry and Pippen Spent with the Ent where it is critical to the conclusion that they grow several feet in size.<br/><br/>Perhaps it may be revealed in the final part of the series of movies that in fact they have done so but as the literary time line goes that is not the chain of events as one reads them.<br/><br/> Those are the major points of inaccuracy as I found them.<br/><br/>Now for the crowning achievements. The CG rendered Ent were masterfully represented in likeness and behavior and are second only to Gollum/Smeagol who was briefly introduced in the first movie.. steals the spotlight from the human actors in this film through is realistic behavior, speech and movement.<br/><br/>The battle at Helm's Deep was exceptionally offered both for the imagination and the eye alike and surely stands out as one of the best if not the best mass combat sequences ever offered on film.<br/><br/> If it were not for the limited seating time available and the short attention span of the present day movie patron, each movie could easily alone be 6 hours in length.<br/><br/>What we receive is condensed acceptably with out much lapse in authenticity to the literary masterpiece, offered visually without parallel, and leaves us wanting more all within the span of roughly 3+ hours.<br/><br/>Can we ask for more? Yes! Should we? No! We get more than what we need and certianly more than the admission price, the lively hood of our own imagination should be the basis of your entertainment.<br/><br/>If for whatever reason you fail to be drawn into the world of Middle Earth, be it as a newcomer to Tolkien and his genius, or as a veteran, it is your imagination that fails you not the movie or the director."

","The second installment of LOR is much more disappointing than the first respectably stellar edition.  The additions, deletions and widebreadth poetic license taken with the screenplay for the Two Towers is nothing short of astounding -- and to the film's detriment. The actual book was much more compelling, its prequel FOTR being the more informative.  The slow stop and pan cinematography in this feature detracted from what should have been building moments in the story.  The new characters are barely likable as scripted, save one fair shield maiden, and after the inappropriately (and newly) created scenes with our 2nd Ambassador from Gondor, I cannot imagine anyone having a desire to visit that fair city.  The scenery was still breathtaking, the animatronic spectacular (especially the trees) and the storyline began and ended intact.

"rookie-8","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," Where to start........How about AWESOME
","I love the books. Call me a geek, a loser, a freak, its been done before.(mostly by my mother) I love the world Tolkien created, that wonderous place called Middle Earth, and I love the characters that he sprung from its soil. I love everything about it. So when Jackson was making and then releasing FOTR I was excited, nervous, and a little apprehensive. How could anyone, even with Lucas graphics behind him every step of the way, how could anyone capture that magic the books cast upon most of us who read them? How could anyone do them justice? Well, Jackson did, and Two Towers comes close to eclipsing FOTR as a whole. First, it is darker, as the book is. There is more action, more fighting, more tense pressure put on by impending doom. Second, there is more comedy. These characters that seemed so distincted are now alive, real, human in this movie, where their love and their fears and their hates all come out in full view. Finally, there is Gollum. I have never seen such a character. You have to remind yourself that he is computer animated for one thing, but then the depth of the character, the depth of the emotions shown in its face, the eyes, the forhead, the body language, it is all just astounding. I could have watched Gollum all day and night. The charcater is so very interesting you do not mind being taken away from the action to seem him as he guides Frodo and Sam closer and closer to Mordor. Jackson does, as in the first one, take some liberties with the novels, not living up to every chapter in them, but the detail is so precise, the important moments so well done, the intensity raised to such a high level, that even the most ardent LOTR fans will not scowl at such changes.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. Go see it once, twice, three times if necessary. It is great cinema, it is great escapism, but most of all it is a great story that finally comes to life. And now, we wait for the Return of the King. Is anyone else excited?"
"cgfry","1","0","0","18 December 2002"," Hugely disappointing!!
","I had some real concerns during the last half of The Fellowship of the Rings about how unrelentingly gruesome, dark, and finally tortuous the movie was. Jackson never gave us a break. Think about it: we go through Moria with Gandalf's apparent death; there's no joy in Lothlorien; and then the agonizing-to-watch death of Boromir. In the book, Tolkien had us (and the characters) relax and wonder in Lothlorien.  Then following the breakup of the fellowship, he gave us this funny scene with Sam swimming after Frodo, who'd just taken off in the canoe, even though they both knew he couldn't swim. It was a place to laugh with them at the great friendship they had. Did Jackson give Tolkien his due, as one of the greatest storywriters of all time? Would he simply use common sense, and know that the audience needed something cheerful to leave the movie with. No!! He gives us a slow-motion near-death experience with Samwise. Yuck!! So my worries kept coming back at me all year.<br/><br/>Even so, with spectacular special effects in Moria, and some great story adjustments (with Aragorn, in particular), I was very happy overall with The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/> Unfortunately, The Two Towers shows Jackson at his worst. Not only is this movie unrelenting in being dark in appearance and in tone (Gimli provides a few--far too few--upbeat moments), but now the story ""adjustments"" are way out in left field, and terribly done. As a huge Tolkien fan, I won't be able to forgive Jackson with this movie. I give the movie only 5/10; as a Tolkien fan, I can say that it is only just bearable to watch.<br/><br/> Gollum was truly terrible. Comparisons to the BBC radio production-- Gollum is incredibly well done--leave us wondering how Andy Serkis could have landed the role in this movie.  There is very little range in his voice. The animation, perhaps predictably (can anyone say Jar Jar Binks?), does not help at all. The primary problem, as with the movie overall, is the nearly complete lack of humor in Gollum's characterization; he comes off as completely unlikable-I find it hard to believe that anyone could even feel pity for him.  Jackson seems intent on making everything as gloomy and downcast as possible.  Very slow pacing doesn't help.<br/><br/> SPOILERS<br/><br/> In the first movie, Ian McKellen was incredibly strong in his performance as Gandalf. Here he gets very little to work with, and Bernard Hill as Theoden is a miserable substitute. Hill's completely unnoteworthy performance was given no help with the screenplay. Theoden is written in as a very weak character, hardly a King to admire or care for.  For some reason, Jackson decided all the other main characters should show weakness as well.  Aragorn is weak, not as a warrior, but in his relationship with Arwen. In the first movie, this was somewhat acceptable as an excuse Jackson invented to explain why Aragorn had not assumed his heritage as the true king.  Aragorn's weakness there also helped in contrasting the strength of Arwen, a very nice update from Tolkien.  But in the Two Tower's, Jackson destroys all with Arwen losing faith in her own decisions and love.  So much that was positive in the first movie was destroyed here. Dada says go to the Grey Havens, being mortal will be too tough for you, and off she goes! > Faramir?!?! What the heck did Jackson think he was doing here. This whole part of the movie takes a complete departure from Tolkien. One of the main points of Tolkien's Faramir was to show that the wizard in Gandalf and the Numenor in Aragorn still existed in the men of Gondor. Faramir was a promise that although many good things might fade away, perhaps even better things can come through to the future. The depiction of Faramir in the Two Towers was a final nail in the coffin for me. If my family had not been with me, I might have gotten up and left the theater at that point.<br/><br/> These fatal flaws in the screenplay were only compounded by some true silliness in the action.  The powerful Nazgul has a mighty flying stead (dragon-thing?) that is cowed by a single arrow, and apparently just flies away!  Please!!!  Mr. Jackson, I've read Tolkien, I _know_ Tolkien, and trust me, you are NO Tolkien!!!!  Cut the super-crappy story changes!!!!!!!<br/><br/> Jez, I really gotta calm down...<br/><br/> The only part of the movie that I thought was reasonably well done was Treebeard. His voice and animation were very good.<br/><br/> But did Jackson slow down and give us a moment with Treebeard in his cave serving the Ent water to Merry and Pippin? No. That might have broken the dark, somber, unrelenting tone of the movie. And was Jackson satisfied with how Tolkein did the Entmoot and the finale at Helm's Deep? No. For no reason at all, he changed both, to the very huge detriment of his movie (it sure as heck is no longer Tolkien's in any way, shape or form!). The point of the Ents and Helm's Deep was to show us that men were not strong enough to defeat Saruman, much less Sauron.  After Helm's Deep, we _knew_ that Gondor would have no chance against Sauron; only Frodo could save the day. Instead, Jackson wants us to believe that if Gandalf can ride out and gather up a few hundred men, anything can happen (what the hey, Aragorn, Theoden, and a couple other riders can simply ride out through the gates and brush thousands of Orcs right off the battlements like a knife through butter!).<br/><br/> Oh well. This particular fan will stay faithful to Tolkien. Jackson is no longer in that realm, and should not be forgiven. How depressing..."

Sam and Frodo are not even supposed to consider trying to enter the Black Gate. As soon as they see it, they are supposed to know they can not even try.  Faramir is not supposed to succumb to the same temptation that Boromir did.  And when do the elves go to Helm's Deep? And what about the forest springing up out of nowhere, surrounding Saruman's troops and helping to scare them off.<br/><br/>I can justify the bits left off at the end (Shelob's Lair and Cirith Ungol, plus the journey back to Isengard) simply out of hope that they will be tacked on to the beginning of The Return of the King.  If not, I will be seriously p***ed."

","It's hard to be objective when you've been waiting for a film for a year. Now I've seen it, I am not disappointed.<br/><br/>(Watch out - SPOILERS coming up...)<br/><br/>Firstly, Gollum is *excellent*. The star of the show, IMHO. He's so far from being the cartoon character that was Jar Jar Binks, and just the wrong side of human. His schizophrenic battle with himself on whether or not he should help Frodo was riveting.<br/><br/>With three storylines, the editing was always going to be tricky, but it just about works - just. A bit more of a gentle lead-in as each ""strand"" changed would have been a little less confusing. But this is nit-picking.<br/><br/>A couple of new scenes have been added that are not in the book, presumably to allow the characters in the scene more screen-space. Given that one of those characters is Arwen (Liv Tyler), you won't get any complaints from me!<br/><br/>Gimli certainly got all the laughs this time. I've read someone else describe this humour as ""much needed"" in the film, but I'm not so sure - it seems to jar slightly with what's going on in the rest of the scene.<br/><br/>This film really is on a biblical scale - think Ben Hur and The Ten Commandments. I can only hope Mr Jackson and his crew get their just rewards come Oscar time. Perhaps this year, we might have a Best Film worthy of the award...?"

","while the fellowship of the ring paints a fair picture of the spirit of tolkien's work, the two towers might as well have car chases and buildings exploding...and in every scene.  and unlike the first part of the trilogy, the departures from the book GREATLY detracted from rather than enhanced the story.  why did faramir come off looking like an evil boromir?  not his role....and why do ents have knees and never go to rohan?  such departures seemed pointless -- and i found myself wishing about halfway through the movie that the struggles in life to determine the right vs. the wrong course could be as easy as jackson depicts them in this movie.  if only evil looked like an orc, we'd all know to flee or fight it!  but only the really shallow or uninformed -- or inexperienced -- ever think any of the struggles between forces in this world are as clear-cut as this movie makes them seem. quite a disappointment -- especially considering my love of the first part.  i can only hope the editing of the 3rd part focuses more on the dynamics of the story than the dynamics of the special effects."

","After a year of anticipation Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is finally in theatres, and it is everything one would hope it would be and more.<br/><br/> The acting and effects were far superior to anything ever scene.  Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) was hilarious, with some of the best one-liners I have ever heard.  Gandalf (Ian McKellen) was awe inspiring, leaving you completely dumbstruck by how all consuming his performance was.  Viggo Mortensen was a perfect Aragorn, a man trying to hide from and embrace his destiny.  The scenes with Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) were very slow going, but were necessary for the next installment.  The sluggish pace was made up for by the performance of Andy Sekis who played Gollum.  The way Gollum/SmÃ©agol was portrayed was perfect.  At times he was humorous, then scary, but mostly sad.  I really took pity on this creature; there were times I almost cried because I felt so much pity for him.  The Ents (tree-like giants) were exactly what I had pictured when I read the books.<br/><br/>Then there was the epic battle of Helm's Deep.  Nothing felt softened, or played down, it seemed so real that even though I have read the books I was still in suspense for how it ended.<br/><br/>The movie was so incredible that when it ended you felt like you had this secret that only people who have shared this experience would know."

","Warning Readers:  Major Spoilers Ahead!  Go back now if you don't want plot spoilage!<br/><br/> I didn't mind Frodo going to Osgiliath with Faramir, and I actually loved the Lothlorien Elves at Helms Deep.  These diversions from the book were expected.  What I couldn't stand was the break-neck speed of which the story was told.  It's like Peter Jackson panicked.  Granted you've got three different plots going on, but the transitions from one storyline to another was choppy and rushed.<br/><br/> For example:  We start off with Gandalf falling and fighting with the Balrog. Cool! Love it already!  Then we start off with Frodo and Sam capturing Gollum; then Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli running after the uruk-hai who have Merry and Pippin. Then we get diverted to Edoras and Wormtongue ousting Eomer from the kingdom; then to Merry and Pippin almost getting killed by the orcs; then Eomer running into Aragorn & Co. and tells them the orcs are dead. Then we're in the Dead Marshes with Frodo, Sam and Gollum; then back to Fangorn where Merry and Pippin run into a ""very hasty"" Treebeard who has them meet the ""white wizard."" Then Aragorn & Co. find the ""white wizard"" to actually be Gandalf.<br/><br/> See what I mean?  And the movie goes on at this nauseating pace.  I knew that Helm's Deep was going to be 45 minutes long, but it was like Peter Jackson was trying to hurry up and get to Helm's Deep to show off his new ""massive"" special effects.  Don't get me wrong!  The battle was great! But near the end, it was like, ""Let's hurry up and get this over with!""<br/><br/> I thought Arwen's part put in a good romantic feel in the movie, but what was up with Galadriel telepathically conversing with Elrond?  I found that to be the most awkward part of the movie, and I think that could have been done different.  Granted Arwen may have had a mental connection to Aragorn, so I guess that's what P.J. was trying to do with Galadriel and Elrond. Tolkein Elves do exist on two planes of existence.  But P.J. does a terrible job of explaining the Galadriel/Elrond connection.  Like I said: awkward.<br/><br/> I was hoping to have the same feel that I had after I saw ""The Empire Strikes Back.""  Dark Transition with a lot of Emotion.  Now I realize I expected too much.  I came out of the movie with the same yucky sensation that I had when I first saw ""The Fifth Element"" or ""Starship Troopers"" or should I dare say it: ""Mission to Mars"" (ugh! yuck! Gross!).  Hopefully I will come to love this movie fondly as ""5th Element"" and ""SS Troopers"", and not turn it off every time it comes on like ""Missed2Mars"".<br/><br/> I'm going to see it again to see if I can get a better feel for the movie. But now I can't wait to see the extended edition of ""The Two Towers"" to see what Peter Jackson unnecessarily cut out of the movie.  All around, I do give it a 9 out of 10, just because it's a continuation of a movie that was a 12 out of 10 for me and had characters that I really care about.  It is good and I hope ""RotK"" to be better than ""Fellowship"" and much better than this slight disappointment.<br/><br/> Peter, if you're reading this, please take a deep breath and calm down! Don't rush this story.  You've got the fans. Now give them a story they will cherish for the rest of their lives!"
"jer2","Null","0","0","18 December 2002"," Great Film...but dissappointed with changes (spoilers)
","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>I just saw the film and I have to say that it is as good as the first film in action, acting, direction, pacing, special effects, and the world of MiddleEarth is still a wonderful sight to behold. This film gets a lot right, but I have a few frustrations to vent about the picture as well. First is the ending. It ends completely different than the book does. Frodo goes to Gondor with Faramir b/c Faramir is obsessed with the promise that the ring might save Gondor??? Definitely a misrepresentation of his character. Frodo and Sam end up in Mordor, and Faramir does right himself, but gone are Shelob and the capture after the tunnel. Second, is some minor frustrations with Helm's Deep. Jackson has the Elves (Haldir from Fellowhip) reinforce the fortress before the Uruk Hai attack. Small complaint, but I'm not sure why Jackson messed with this portion of the book b/c it seems to be one of the most directly translatable parts of the story. Thirdly, Arwen is again misplaced in the story and overdone. So is Eowyn's relationship with Aragorn. Again, I guess it makes for more plot, but I see no need to change these aspects of the books. The Ents are awesome, but Jackson doesn't give enough time to the destruction of Isengard. It collects perhaps 5 minutes of screen time...I really was looking forward to seeing that part of the action in detail on the silver screen. Jackson also includes a weird sequence with Aragorn falling off a cliff and being seperated from the Fellowship right before Helms Deep.<br/><br/>Jackson gets a LOT right. The fellowhip characters are all excellently portrayed and their relationships with each other just feel right. Gollum is excellent, as are all the CGI characters. The battle sequences are astonishing and epic. He stays true to the most important arcs in the story and the film is paced very well. Overall, do not miss this film. My complaints are small but I think that other fans of the novels will probably share some similar sentiments. Rating : 8.5/10"

","I decided to slack off today and went to see TTT and I'm in agreement with the vast majority of people here. This is the best movie I have seen this year. It's dark but funny and zips along at a tremendous speed (the parts without Liv Tyler at least. Her character served its purpose in the first film as a way of fleshing out Aragorns' motivation but I feel Arwen is a distraction now).<br/><br/>I, like everyone else, was worried when I heard about the digital Gollum and the rumours that Jackson plays fast and loose with Tolkien in this one but I needn't have bothered. The CGI is superb (JarJar Binks eat your heart out) and the changes don't hamper the story. I think a lot of people have trouble detaching themselves from the text which is something I had trouble with on FOTR. This time I enjoyed the film on its own merits. Anyway, the biggest change took place on the Frodo/Sam/Gollum thread which, in my mind, improved on the book as it was quite a dull episode in comparison with the high drama of Helms Deep.<br/><br/>Like anything in life though, its not perfect. As it is the meat in the sandwich there's no real beginning and end to this installment. The 'Three Hunters' story thread is by far the most engaging and the other threads do detract from the tension somewhat towards the end. I get the feeling that the director felt this too as he spends so much time building up to Helms Deep that he begins to labour the point to cover over the problems with the other threads.<br/><br/>However, I'm probably being overly critical here and all I can say is that, for a 3 hour movie the time flew by and I didn't have to go to the toilet once (unlike half the audience)."

","*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>Well, after seeing the midnight showing last night I am still amazed at the progress of computer graphics. George Lucas is always talking about how close we are to having CG characters interacting seemlessly with the flesh-and-blood actors. Well, Peter Jackson and crew have accomplished more with Gollum than anything to date.<br/><br/>From the first sequences including Gollum to the very last, he is alive and part of the cast. The interactions between Gollum and the hobbits, Frodo and Sam, are perfect. Cloth movement, shadows, substance - it has it all. The more he fights with the hobbits the more real he becomes. I couldn't help but watch him in every scene he appeared. ""The rope burnss usss!"", ok, Frodo takes it off of him, perfect interaction.<br/><br/>The Battle of Helm's Deep is another sequence that is just breathtaking. You want 10,000+ orcs fighting a few thousand men, elves and of course a certain dwarf? No Problem. You want an army of Ents destroying Isengard? No Problem.

"Moricious","Null","0","0","18 December 2002"," A very involving continuation of LOTR (slight spoilers)
","I enjoyed this film about the same amount as the first, maybe just a little less. I really liked the leisurely introduction to the characters that FOTR allowed. This time around the sweep of events overtakes the character development somewhat, but not to the extent that this is secondary to the plot. Perhaps I didn't view the film in the best frame of mind, as I was slightly distracted by the swooning gasps of the Aragorn/Legolas estrogen brigade seated in the row behind me, these films really do appeal to folk for all sorts of reasons...<br/><br/>Jackson does a superb job of weaving the three story strands together. Tolkein was adamant in his objection that those retelling the tale shouldn't intercut between the separate storylines in the book.  Though for this film it really was the most appropriate choice. My one slight reservation was that Merry & Pippin's story seemed to stall a little in the middle, but it has a great, and visually spectacular, pay-off with the Ent's attack on Saruman's forces.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are given a good amount of screen time. Frodo's struggle against the ring's power begins to threaten his relationship with Sam, which adds a lot of pathos to thier story, fine and nuanced acting from Wood and Austin here. Aragorn's personal struggles become increasingly prominent, expanding on what we know about him from the book.  Legolas and Gimli have more of a presence as well.  Some might object to Gimli serving as the comic relief, but John Rhys Davies, who perfected the quietly amusing supporting role in the Indiana Jones movies, plays it just right. He's funny without being bufoonish, and brings a good deal of humanity to the film. There's much less of Gandalf this time round, and when he's on screen he seems more subdued than his old cantankerous self from FOTR. Readers of the books will know that there is a reason for this, but I do miss Gandalf the Grey. I was also sorry not to see Ian Holm's Bilbo this time round, but again that's down to Tolkein.<br/><br/>The new additions all make a strong impression Brad Dourif's haunted and reptilian Wormtounge and Bernard Hill's conflicted Theoden are standout. Miranda Otto's Eowen is also impressive, it would have been good to see more of her during the Helms Deep battle. Golum is, as many have said, one of the most thoughtfully created and technically accomplished CGI creations yet brought to the screen. Eomer and Faramir are well realized and give strong support as well.<br/><br/>This is a fine continuation of FOTR, and well worth seeing in the theater (particularly for the Helms Deep sequence). Yet again the major digressions from the novel are well thought out, and serve to make the cinematic story telling more involving. Here's to Return of the King."

","Two Towers did not let me down in one tiny way.  It was everything I have hoped for since I was in elementary school and first read the genius books by JRR Tolkien.  Everything was amazing.  The scenery was amazing.  Peter JAckson did a wonderful thing in searching for as many real locations to shoot as possible rather than using digital images.  The locations were beautiful, some were depressing, some were just as I pictured them.  The acting was definitely appropriate and the score was awesome.  Aragon's romantic story, which is created by Hollywood, does not overwhelm and ruin the story, but actually adds a little appeal to another side of the story. I loved Two Towers and I'm glad I got to the midnight showing to be one of the first to see it."

","As a movie this was, of course, amazing - Helm's Deep was better than I ever imagined.  But if you have read the books and are a ""Tolkien geek"" like me, you might be a little disappointed.  I don't want to give anything away, but they have changed a lot more from the book for this movie than they did for Fellowship.  And sometimes what they changed just doesn't make any sense. It all starts to noticeably change when they leave for Helm's Deep; also, Frodo and Sam's encounter with Faramir is drastically different.  It still works for the movie, I suppose, and people who haven't read the books wouldn't have a problem.<br/><br/>Aside from those differences, it is still amazing.

"dbriers","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," What all film makers should strive for!
","Well, after months of waiting, I finally got to see the sneak preview of Lord Of The Rings : The Two Towers last night.<br/><br/>Despite a fairly unpleasant cold, and being pretty tired (the show only started at 12:15 am), I was still blown away by this second installment of the trilogy.<br/><br/>I am both a long-time Peter Jackson fan (and highly recommend that all fans of the LOTR movies try and locate some of his early movies to see from whence he came - certainly a vast change in style, but nevertheless, distinctive), and a relative fan of the Tolkien novels (I have read LOTR and The Hobbit on more than one occasion, but have not bothered to delve deeper).<br/><br/>A warning first - had you not seen ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"", you will get really lost, really quickly, so it is highly recommended that you see the first movie before this one.  Mr Jackson thankfully does not make the age-old mistake of having a brief montage of events in the previous movie - you are thrust straight into the middle of events, and everything starts moving quite quickly.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go on and on about every single event, but there are certain things which do deserve special mention.  Firstly, Wormtongue is marvellously cast. Portrayed with just the correct mixture of cowardice, malice, and toadiness (for lack of a better word), the character was just as I had always imagined.<br/><br/>Secondly, Gollum was magnificent - personally, I don't think that the CGI was what won me over about the creature (although relatively flawless in it's execution). What won me over was the way that Gollum was portrayed as a laughable creature, pathetic, snivelling, and almost thoroughly evil, yet with the distinct yet remote hope of redemption. I also was absolutely besotted with the voice of the creature, as well as the distinctive movements, grimaces and expressions of the two different personalities (Gollum and Smeagol). I sincerely believe that the performance of the creature is oscar-worthy - after all, Serkis is indeed present in the creation, and makes it his own - the spirit is there, even if the flesh is not..<br/><br/>Finally, the battle of the Ents in Isengard was to me a highlight. Many have gushed about the battle at Helmsdeep, which was indeed spectacular, but few have commented much on the Ents, especially the battle in Isengard, and I have no idea why, as this was to me one of the real highlights of the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is every bit as powerful as ""The Fellowship Of The Rings"", but is slightly darker - basically, if you were a fan of the first movie, you will no doubt see this, and find it to be as compelling and awe-inspiring as the first installment.  If on the other hand, you were not a fan, then you will probably not enjoy this either - after all, Jacksons filming the trilogy all at once really has given the film a great amount of continuity, and the same sense of mystery and wonder throughout.  I highly recommend it, and have no hesitation in giving it a perfect 10."

","If you are a die hard fan of The Lord of The Rings novel, then most likely you will not be pleased with the adaption of The Two Towers into film. The movie story line left the novel story line for about half of the film. While this greatly displeased me that Peter Jackson would so obviously leave Tolkien's story line, I understand that the constraints of making such a massive epic story into a movie are quite hard to overcome.  I mean come on, who of you out there would sit through a 4 or possibly 5 hour movie?  This is how long each of the movies would have to of been if Peter Jackson had stayed with Tolkien's story line.  As a movie, The Two Towers is awesome. There was only one scene in which I thought was truly unnecessary and that was the ""dream"" that Aragorn had with Arwen.  Any other faults with the adaptation can be forgiven if you take in the fact that the movie is only 3 hours long and in the end Peter Jackson gives you ""the big picture"" version of The Two Towers."

","What people who come to this film need to realize is that what Peter Jackson has done (and honestly, what any director could have done) is create an interpretation of the written works.  Arguing points like lack of songs, the fact that elves joined the men in battle, the exaggeration of scenes and characters says absolutely nothing about the film as a piece of art.  All it does is say that aspects that you liked about the books weren't present. When something is adapted to film, be it book, play, or a previous movie you have to expect things to be different...time must be accounted for, flow of narrative, and above all the difference in how a film entertains versus how a novel of hundreds of pages entertains.  When a stage director goes to show a Shakespearean play on stage, lines are cut, scenes are changed, and nuances are done according to the director.  This is how it is, and how it has to be... What Peter Jackson has done is adapt a remarkable written work, into a remarkable filmed work.  Yes, the two are different, but they are completely different media.What matters is that the essence of the story remains...what makes the film so wonderful is that the world of Middle Earth, the characters in it, and the basic story has been brought to the screen.  Enjoy the film as a separate piece of art that stands on its own, and enjoy the novel the same way."

Yes, it IS that good. No movie is perfect, but this one comes pretty darned close.  For a movie that really exists as a plot device in many respects, we could not ask for more from Peter Jackson, WETA, and all the wonderful actors.  Gollum, voiced by Andy Serkis, stole the show.  Never before has inner turmoil been so wrenchingly realized.  If only Serkis would get the credit he deserves for creating such a character.  This has indeed been a long year; though this coming year seems like it will take even longer.  Jackson's LOTR trilogy seems well on its way to becoming the most entertaining and emotionally stirring trilogy of our time."
"mteverest2005","Null","0","0","18 December 2002"," An Epic, and Unlike FOTR, Many Changes to Tolkien
","""The Two Towers"" is an imaginative adaptation of Tolkien's second book of the trilogy, filled with epic battles in the continued fight between good and evil.  It is a strong sequel to ""Fellowship Of The Rings,"" and to those who have never read the books or those who have not read them in many years, flows smoothly.  Unlike FOTR, TTT did not follow the Tolkien books as closely. I was not disappointed with the movie... even though attending the midnight show I had no trouble staying awake or interested.  To someone unfamiliar with the Tolkien works, I'm sure the film lacked nothing.  I realize that print and movies are different media, and sometimes time doesn't allow a similar adaptation. But as a longtime fan of the writings of Tolkien, some of the changes seemed unnecessary and completely unrelated to keeping the film's time to a watchable minimum.  To me, the worst change came in the character of Faramir.  In Tolkien's work, he was a juxtaposition of his brother, Boromir.  Faramir knew his brother so well, that though he loved him immensely he guessed that Boromir must have tried to take the ring from Frodo, due to his impossible aspirations to be king.  In the movie, Faramir kidnaps Frodo and takes him to Gondor, to gift his own father with the great ring.  He comes to his senses, but shows a weakness of spirit never shown by Tolkien.  With time constraints acknowledged, I also was disappointed the Ents were not allowed to come to the conclusion of going to war with Saruman before prodding by the hobbits or witnessing a burned forest on the outskirts of Isengard. Makeup, costume design and computer enhanced technology have certainly added to the movie's believability, as Ents, the creature Gollum and the agility of elves are all credibly done.  The Battle of Helm's Deep, with an army of elves added in the movie version, is spectacular.  Just to show I am not a Tolkien purist who would argue with any change, I thought that was a well-thought out twist to re-unite a pact of old, and cut out the neutrals in a good vs. evil war.  I also understand the increased screen time of Arwen, as signing Liv Tyler to the role of Arwen in only ""Return Of The King,"" would have been improbable at best. Peter Jackson has done another fine job with TTT.  As a fan, my recommendation would be that if time is a concern, subtract scenes that can either be summarized or deleted, but don't add.  Tolkien's imagination has added enough for all of us.  From the standpoint of a movie critic, he is certainly on track to another huge success."

","In the humorous spirit of the notorious two word review of Spinal Tap's album entitled ""Shark Sandwich"", I would also have to classify The Two Towers as a ""Sh#%t Sandwich"".<br/><br/>While the 1st installment had a magical chemistry of good vs. evil, the Two Towers is stale and uninspired in comparison. A majority of the characters that were once so interesting, are now flat and boring. Left standing are Gollum and Gríma - two characters who made a very memorable impression on me.<br/><br/>Technically, the effects were not executed as well either - I saw plenty of bad blue screen shots, and the miniatures lacked scale and presence. Gollum on the other hand was amazing!! They really spent some quality time making this character come to life, interact, and blend in with the environments.<br/><br/>To summarize my experience with The Two Towers - a good opening, boring middle and by the end I just didn't care."

","After seeing the Fellowship of the Ring at the end of last year and feeling quite content to rank it as one of the best films I have ever seen, I was most intrigued to see what Peter Jackson and his ensemble would serve up this year.  Although the Kiwi has taken on a pure labor of love, it is clear to see from the films and the supplementary material on the special edition Fellowship DVD that his enthusiasm and love for such a great story flowed into his cast and crew and have allowed them so far, to produce what I personally believe are two pieces of cinematic history.<br/><br/>The Two Towers picks up where Fellowship left off and does not dissappoint, in fact it only adds to the magic contained in the first film.  Although there is a slightly darker air than the first (and rightly so, as the shadow further advances from the East), there is still humour, and plentiful emotion as the main protagonists of the splintered fellowship continue on their respective quests, with the addition of further memorable characters. The one incredible example being that of Gollum.  Note - if any Star Wars fans (I was one of them prior to Episode I and II) wish to see a believable CGI character, please go along to see this performance!<br/><br/>Coupled with this, we are also treated to much more wonderfully choreographed and action on an epic scale.  No more needs to be said than that, except I refuse to believe that anyone could see the Helm's Deep sequence (the word epic just about covers this!) and not be impressed!<br/><br/>All performances are once again heartfelt and impressive, Howard Shore's score is once again a wonderful key into unlocking the most emotional and inspirational parts of the film, and lest we forget, the star of the first film, the New Zealand landscape, is once again present in even greater splendour this time around!<br/><br/>I can't think of a bad thing to say except this...I have to wait a whole year now before I see Return of the King!"

","Wow. As one who has never read the books, I initially had a little bit of hard time digesting the new characters in TTT. But, just like in the ""first"" installment, Fellowship of the Ring, the movie's story grows on you... even after leaving the theatre. Questions begin to arise about this character's motivation, or what are ""they"" going to do next.<br/><br/>I think it's attributable to depth. Depth of story, depth of character... your mind stays working, trying to figure it all out. I love it!<br/><br/>
The battle scenes -- particularly Helms Deep -- is just Epic, with a capital E.  At the next viewing I believe I'll pick a seat further from the screen just to try and take it all in. (If that's possible). <br/><br/>The complexity, the scale, the cinematography... what a movie! Easily the best 10 score this year."

","The second part of the epic The Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is simply the most spectacular film I have EVER seen. This movie overpasses its previous part The Fellowship of the Ring and delivers the most brilliant piece of cinema to ever hit the big screen. From the landscape to the characters, this movie is simply stunning in its own time.<br/><br/>The characters fit right into the story through their emotional and physical features. Frodo and Sam are joined by Gollum, the most amazing CGI creation to be put on screen. He is so real and blends into the environment so seamlessly that after a while the audience forgets that he is animation and accept him as a real, physical character that shows no signs of falsity. The audience feels a real fear of the Uruk-Hai that have captured Merry and Pippin. The Ents are also quite impressive. These beings are believable and very true to what I visualized in Tolkien?s words. The Wargs, the winged Nazgûl, the oliphaunts and the Balrog, now viewed more in detail, are extremely breathtaking. The new characters add to the story and progress it faster than before.<br/><br/>The music of the film is also perfect. From the opening of the Misty Mountains to the Battle of Helm?s Deep and the storming of Isengard, Howard Shore unquestionably deserves another Oscar for his spectacular work. The music of any film is vital to its feel and images portrayed in screen. It simply blew me away. The tone was just right and the volume as well. I couldn?t find any faults in the score, which has never happened to me except when I watched the Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>The storming of Isengard and the Battle of Helm's Deep is what really took my breath away. These had got to be the biggest and best executed battles I have EVER seen! I would rather go see the movie again for this!<br/><br/>To sum it all up, don't miss this movie at any cost! Except, maybe if you haven't seen the first one, then see it NOW and then see TTT. Otherwise the plot and/or characters might be a bit confusing for you. Other than that, it's perfect cinema work.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this movie more than 10 stars, but that's as high as it goes! Well done Peter Jackson!

One thing that really pulled me out of the movie was the odd herky-jerky camera work in the big battle scenes. The fight scenes were an incredible part of the first movie but this one replaces grace with cinematic subterfuge - what happened? I don't know, but Legolas won! Not cool. I got the sense that they were running overbudget by the time they filmed the fight scenes.<br/><br/>To be fair, if FOTR had never been made, I'd have been awestruck by TTT but, FOTR WAS made and TTT should have been better than it was."

Too many to mention, but to highlight: Faramir kidnapping Frodo to Osgiliath? Aragorn falling off a cliff and falling in a river? Making a big deal about some imaginary exodus of the Rohirrim??? Elves from Lothlorien, and no ents/huorns to save Helm's Deep?<br/><br/>
The long, drawn out changes to the story totally ruined the movie.  I agree with some of the other postings that I have seen, that say it was these changes that made the movie overlength.

","I loved this movie... I loved Fellowship too, but this one... it's so funny...! The tone in FOTR is very very serious between the fellowship, compared to the tone between my three main men after seeing this movie: Legolas ( I love that guy! ), Gimli, And Aragorn...!<br/><br/>The development in relationship between these three is awesome... we already know that Aragorn and Legolas go way back, and that Gimli can be a thorn in the eye on both of them from time to time... But the way these three act together, it's unbelievably cool! The love-hate relationship between these three, it is so brilliant, I was in awe...! Especially between Gimli and Legolas, the frustrating outbursts of Legolas towards Aragorn at Helm's Deep and the sneaky attack at the bridge of Helm's Deep when we get to learn a little more about ""nobody tosses a dwarf!"" I liked this trio, but I loved the relationship between the dwarf and the elf...<br/><br/>I also liked Elijah Wood more in this movie than in FOTR, he's very dark and brooding and it shows the burden of the ring very clearly... I feel so sorry for poor Frodo, but I loved his development in character anyway!<br/><br/>But the TRUE star of the show... Left me in awe ... again... Poor, POOR Smeágol! This poor creature is so miserable you can only feel sorry for him... he's so cute at sometimes and so disgustingly evil at other times... The way his split personalities work was a bit confusing at first, but it makes sense when you think about it a time or two...<br/><br/>Go see this movie... don't argue, DO IT... It's incredible... I think the reason why it 100% lives up to the first one is due to the fact that they shot all the films at one time...! They didn't have to do better than the first one, and that is great...<br/><br/>So go see this movie, and enjoy the scenery, the wonderful acting, the feel of the whole thing...

","Everyone is going to say that the director (Peter Jackson) is a genius and so was the author of the books (J.R.R. Tolkien), so I'll just agree and spare anyone who reads this comment.<br/><br/>The epic battle at Helm's Deep was fantastic. The effects were excellent, especially Gollum, though Treebeard wasn't too shabby. Edoras, the golden hall in Rohan, was beautiful. This film looked just as good as the first one.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, especially Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom). King Theoden (Bernard Hill) was also wonderful.<br/><br/>My only two tiny problems were these. The fact that Faramir, the supposedly wise and pure-hearted brother of Boromir, was not actually that much of a better man. That kind of sucked. And what the devil was Haldir doing at Helm's Deep (and why the #^%$ did he die there?). I loved the books (too much perhaps), and that was a bit of a departure. I seem to recall Rangers (and the apparently missing sons of Elrond) joining Aragorn later, but why elves at Helm's Deep? I know the film can't be entirely true to the book, but eh ...<br/><br/>Everything else, including the huge part Arwen had and the fact they they didn't finish the book within the film, was just fine, and the film as a whole was thoroughly enjoyable. I will probably go and see it again ... and again."

","Right off the bat, let me say I enjoyed the movie immensely. Visually stunning, the right mix of comedic moments in tense situations, great cinematography, acting, and direction. It will leave you breathless and with an (enjoyable) case of sensory overload.<br/><br/>Here's the ""but...""<br/><br/>While I accept, and in most cases agree with the cuts from the first installment, I think Peter Jackson went way too overboard, with omissions and changes. I list some of these below. (Note: Some of you might consider these spoilers, so...)<br/><br/>************************SPOILER ALERT!************************<br/><br/>Why was Theoden such a pansy? After released from Wormtongue's spell, he SHOULD have become the leader as he was depicted in the book.<br/><br/>What was all that Arwen/Elrond/Galadriel, and Arwen/Aragorn crap? There was so much more from the book that could have been added, and it seemed like this was padding. I could have accepted it, were it exposition, but it wasn't even that...<br/><br/>Elves in Helm's Deep? Puh-LEESE!<br/><br/>The Ents initially refusing to fight? Come on! They have a hatred for the Orcs because of the Orc's destruction of the forest.<br/><br/>AND WHERE THE HELL WERE THE HUORNS AT THE BATTLE OF HELM'S DEEP? Having just read that section in the book, I was really looking forward to the suspense and mystery they would have added. How strange it would have been to see the retreating Orcs running through the new and mysteriously appeared ""forest,"" only never to re-appear out the other side, and no trace of them ever to be found.<br/><br/>This isn't just a wish list. This stuff could have all been in the movie had they dropped the non-existent Elf stuff, and done away with the wolf battle, neither of which were in the book. I think it would have been a more exciting story, had they not strayed so far.<br/><br/>**********************END SPOILER ALERT!**********************<br/><br/>Now that that's out of the way...<br/><br/>The film is magnificent. Jackson has a talent for capturing all the peoples of Middle Earth, and to the exact idea of everyone's mind's eye. The Ents are perfection, (BTW: Does anyone else think that John Rhys-Davies did the voice of Treebeard?) Smeagol breaks new ground in CGI, and the battle scenes are (in the true sense of the word) awesome.<br/><br/>If you saw the first, you won't be disappointed with the second, but I do hope that all the extra scenes that Jackson called his actors back for weren't all those glaring mistakes...<br/><br/>9 out of 10 (I just can't give it a 10 because of all the changes.)"

","The Lord Of The Rings Two Towers: This is a review based on the merging of my love for the books and the movies. The fellowship, held tightly to the story (Except Bombadill which we will forgive) It was epic in every sence of the word. Captivating everyone who gazed at it for even a minute. The Two Towers redefined EPIC even further then that of Fellowship. The Two Towers cinematicly was the greatest movie in my opinion every made!<br/><br/>Although: There was a catch to this move, and that catch is in the statement that the lord of the rings can not be done live action. The fellowship could, it was linear, and was not overly gigantic in size. While the two towers, was unquestionably one of the hardest feets ever taken. To bring a story where there is no true ending or begining (Although i am not saying the story was bad, it was my favorite) is almost impossible. To conquer that Jackson, recrafted the tale to fit into the guidlines that made it work, and made New Line invest in it. I personaly do not like some of the changes (even though some were better then the book itself). Two Towers would have definatly in my opinion won over Fellowship as best of all time had it not been for the abscence of Shilab.......365 days 7 hours and 45 minutes until Return Of The King!"

","It is, perhaps, possible to imagine a place in which dreams and stories lie hidden beyond the boundaries of silence, beyond distance and pain; a place in which they lie waiting to be discovered with trepidation and warmth.<br/><br/>Maybe it is easy to believe that, no matter how tired and defeated these stories may feel, the essence of that which once made them complete still remains inside, untouched, clean, virgin. Waiting in silence to be discovered, to be understood, to be brought to light.<br/><br/>It is clear by now that J. R. R. Tolkien's epic saga 'The Lord of the Rings' is perhaps one of the most accomplished works of literature. The scope and reach of his tale has been discussed in countless essays and articles, with millions of fans throughout the world. But to translate his work to screen seemed like an impossible task to undertake by anyone. There is no doubt in my mind that Peter Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS has accomplished this, and more, by bringing the story to life with such passion that words fail me at this moment.<br/><br/>I think, and I say this with a small hint of suspicion in my tone, that I am still under some kind of spell. The seconds go by incredibly slow as I watch in delight every single movement that the tree outside my window is making. Right now it appears to be covered in mist, almost as if a small fluffy cloud decided to come down and rest outside my window. The tree is shaking its branches vigorously, trying, to no avail, to shake off the impalpable intruder.<br/><br/>Transfixed as I may be, I feel the necessity to put into words what this movie has left in me. This is not an ordinary review I must warn you. In it you will find no plot summary, there will be no word about the specific turns and twists; that task I leave to you. No, this is an intimate look at Peter Jackson's THE TWO TOWERS.<br/><br/>A persistent feeling of urgency and oncoming darkness creeping into Middle Earth is ever present during the story. The scope is grand but at the same time it feels more intimate and personal. The stakes are high but the characters have grown so much since we were first introduced to them that you feel every word and every wince of pain coming out of their faces. I could try to sum it all with a collection of simple, unobtrusive sentences. Stuff like, Andy Serkis' Gollum is by far the best character work in the movie. Or maybe, the direction and work from the production team is flawless and inspired. This would be too easy, too simplistic.<br/><br/>I don't want to do that.<br/><br/>I find that right now my thoughts wander off into directions and places unfamiliar to me, unfamiliar not because I am not aware of their existence, but simply because only hints and images existed of them inside my own drifting heart. It took THE TWO TOWERS to awaken them. This collection of almost-familiar thoughts lie at the center of my desires and hopes, breathing life unto them with their mystery and beauty.<br/><br/>
They move through time and space, going back and forth between those images from the movie that I now hold dear in my heart, and that remarkable unspoken word which controls my nightmares and my dreams, all too often resting in the memory of someone else's puzzling reality. THE TWO TOWERS reminds me just how fragile and precious our own existence really is; these things, hidden as though they may be to unscrupulous eyes, will still be with me until the end of my days. Such flurry of thoughts awake a sense of sheer blissfulness when I think of what lies ahead, when I dare to dream the dream when I'm awake.<br/><br/>The length of my words can barely capture the state in which my mind is right now.<br/><br/>Thank you to all involved in the making of this movie."

","Watched the second installment of the LoTR trilogy last nite. Having read the tome about 5 times over the past 5 years, I had come out of the first movie with mixed sentiments. I thought the movie was visually exquisite but had I not been such a big fan of the book, I'd have prolly found the movie confusing in parts and slightly boring in others.<br/><br/>The second movie however is a truly magnificent cinematic experience imo and not just for fans of tolkein. The movie had me (and almost everyone else in the movie hall) on the edge of their seats thro'out the 3 hours.. I did check my watch once or twice but only because I was so afraid that the movie might end I'd have to go back to the real world once again! In this episode, the director seems to have focussed (and rightly so) on the storytelling and this does not mean that anything has been taken away from the technical brilliance of the first film.<br/><br/>This time around the story cuts between the 3 stories of the separated groups. I wont say much more for fear of spoiling the movie for those who havent watched it yet but the climax of the movie which is the battle at helms deep had me holding my breath for a whole 20 minutes! I am mostly unmoved by cgi sequences in movies (am one of those who cribs about how stories have been replaced by fx in movies) but in this case the fx seamlessly blended into the film, to the extent that one of the central characters in the film, gollum, is a complete cgi character whom i almost felt like giving an acting award to :O.<br/><br/>Unlike jar jar binks, gollum is not merely meantr to add visual appeal or comic relief to the film but is a full character in his own right and has been treated as such by the moviemaker.<br/><br/>Is the movie completely true to the book? Indeed, no. And yet, the director seems to have taken all the right liberties. Any distortions only seem to have added to the dramatic content of the story thereby making it a more interesting movie to watch! The basic conflict that the book deals with is clarified in the two towers and this has made the third part a lot more tantalising to the ppl who havent read the books. All the new characters are brilliantly executed (including the new, more scary ringwraiths) as are the ents!!<br/><br/>Phew, Never have I gushed about a movie this much!!

","The same kind of juvenile childishness that makes people watch Star Wars will make people watch yet another episode of Lord of the Rings.  This film is nothing more than a vehicle for flashy special effects.  To some people this is enough to consider Peter Jackson a genius.  To me, it is a waste of an adult's time.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings is a fine book for children.  It really is.  But adults are supposedly capable of distinguishing more sophisticated plotlines than all this hogwash about good versus evil, aren't they?<br/><br/>The dialogue in this film, as in the last, is atrocious.  There is a self-importance about the film that is equally annoying.  Remember, this is fantasy-entertainment, nothing more.  People who treat this with Biblical importance are missing something in life.<br/><br/>People who dismiss this movie will themselves be dismissed as killjoys with no sense of fun -- and the box office will make fools of us all.  That's OK. I've seen real speculative fiction turned into a true work of genius -- the American ""Solaris"" and witnessed people walking out bored, so I know that most audiences obviously only want to be spoon-fed predictable gruel. Film-goers want a battle every 30 minutes otherwise they will fall asleep. Well, for some us, it sends us to sleep to watch a battle every 30 minutes when you know that the goodies will ultimately prevail.  There is not a single surpising or unique aspect to this film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I see this film not as a work of art but rather as a shrewd economic investment.  McDonalds has thrived for years by selling people exactly the sort of bland food that they expect.  The Lord of the Rings achieves the same.  The only thing more predictable than this film is that this is an investment that will definitely pay off."

","So, after a full year, and countless viewings of the first movie, The Two Towers finally have premiered. During the year I have been building up expectations, despite knowing that this behavior is foolish. By, alas, I´m only human and Certified Tolkien Fanatic at that.<br/><br/>It pains me but.... I am not satisfied after my first viewing. Coming out from the cinema, I could not decide if I had seen a good film or not, and with me, that is a very bad sign.<br/><br/>During the movie there were actually scenes when I deliberately looked away since what I saw was completely...embarrassing..?<br/><br/>For a diehard Tolkien:ist the rewritings have truly a great impact. Of course, I understand that some of them had to be done to make an actual movie, but there are some that I do not at all get.<br/><br/>Here are some of the things I´m no friend of:<br/><br/>*WARNING SPOILERS*<br/><br/>That whole thing with Galadriel and Elrond just so that Haldir could show up at Helms Deep is just plain wrong. Aragorn and Arwen, not just the fact that their scenes together this time did not add to the plot or flow of the story, but also for the fact that; It Does Not Work between them. It´s stone cold dead. Timelines (of wich I´m a big fan) does not work anymore in this movie than they did in the previous one. Too many to recount here. The Ents got far too small a role to play. Did someone miss their impact on Helms Deep? How about the Huorns? Also, I have never seen the dwarves of Middle Earth as inferior beings, and Gimli not only lagged during the hunt for the Hobbits, but his height also came into focus at the Deep.<br/><br/>I felt that all those storylines should work better given a little extra time before cutting to the next scene.<br/><br/>But there were magnificent scenes also! As soon as I got used to Gollums appearance, and could ignore the fact that he was a bunch of pixels, he shone very brightly in every scene. Osgiliath were masterful. Gandalf and the Balrog would be a real stunner if it were not cut as short as it were. There are alot of scenes in that cathegory, and it will be a long wait for the extended dvd in 10 months time.<br/><br/>As far as the actors go, many new ones got to show themselves off. Everyone did their job fine, but the ones at the top were Brad Dourif as Grima, Andy Serkis as Gollum and of course Theoden Son of Thengel. Aragorn were great as usual.<br/><br/>This movie will undoubtedly be alot better on the second viewing. And by my third, I will probably think it´s as good, if not better than, as the first installment. This is, however, not the luxury reviewers have usually, so I fear that some reviews will not be 100% truthful.<br/><br/>I have decided now, after having written this, and against better judgement that... I'ts actually a quite brilliant film, and I can´t wait for the concluding Return of the King. I'll give it around 8 and I gave the first film a 9,5 (extended)."

","....and our story continues. Part two of Jackson's incredible 9 hour epic gives us more of the genius he displayed in part one. <br/><br/>
The most compelling member of the cast is certainly Gollum, as played by Andy Serkis and rendered into reality using amazing computer graphics. Gollum's mutiple personality disorder makes him a much more pitiful creature than he ever seemed in Tolkien's books. This is an incredible achievement on the part of both Jackson and Serkis.  I never felt sorry for the creature in the book, but everyone I talked to who saw the movie felt sorry for him. You can see how devastated he is by his evil side, but his addiction to the Ring is so difficult to fight.<br/><br/>The terrific battle scene at Helm's Deep and the sacking of Isengard by the Ents left me in awe.  Great eye candy.  However, there was an emotional tinge to the entire ordeal, as portrayed by the women and small children huddling in fear in the Keep at Helm's Deep as the orcs battle their way into the stronghold.<br/><br/>Overall, both thrilling and emotionally involving from beginning to end. Highly recommended."

Do we really need a 5 hour movie?<br/><br/>I haven't read the books, though I've had them since before FotR came out. So why haven't I read them? Am I a horrible LotR fan? I don't think so. I am a huge proponent of film as a form of art, and I didn't want to taint my cinema experience with griping about how the book was better. Film is a different media, and this is an adaptation, not a carbon copy.<br/><br/>
Props to Peter Jackson and crew for creating yet another great film."

","When I first saw the first lord of the rings film in the cinema at Easter I loved it and said I have to go and see the second one. Before seeing the second one I had my doubts, thinking it might be dull (it could be that I was used to the first one)<br/><br/>Ive seen THE TWO TOWERS and I just have to say WOW!!! This is 10 times better than the fellowship of the ring. The first one was all talk and little action. This one is all action and little talk.<br/><br/>The fellowship is broke- Sam and Frodo on their way to Mondor, meeting Gollum on the way who is fighting his poisoned mind (Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde thing going on with him.) Aragorn, Legolas, Gandalf and Gimli meet up with a kingdom of men who are about to be attacked by Saruman. Merry and Pippin have been captured and spend their time im a forest full of moving trees. Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. <br/><br/>This film is far more mature than the first film. You learn more about the creature Gollum and you get to like him and feel sorry for him. The ring is consuming Frodo by the second and god knows where he would be without Sam. (Andy Serkins should get an Oscar for his role!!) Merry and Pippin are more mature and Pippin shows a bit of intelligence. <br/><br/>Oh and Arwen and Aragorn's love is put on hold with Arwen being put to the test by her ftaher to show her loyalty to the elves. Aragorn fears he may not come back to his beloved and you see him having glances at the King's niece. <br/><br/>Although the film is dark, there is some light humor, particularly from Gollum and Gimli. You'll be stitches over what Gollum says and does and what Gimli has to put up with- a dwarf in the company of tall men.<br/><br/>
Overall this deserves far more Oscar recognition that the first one (even though the first one was badly underrated in the Oscars). Prepare for a lot of gore and one cool stunt from Legolas on a shield.<br/><br/>10/10!!!!"

","I saw the film together with a packed house at the first showing in Leicester Square.<br/><br/>This lived up to my pretty high expectations after the first one, right from the fantastic opening scene with the Gandalf and the Balrog to the climatic battle.<br/><br/>Gollum was an outstanding character and should get some recognition (either the voice actor or the CGI programmer). Aside from a bit of off time inter-cutting at the battle of Helms Deep, which lessened the impact of he battle at bit, this was great filmmaking for start to finish. It had humour, spectacle, a bit of romance and great action, with characters you actually liked and cared about.<br/><br/>Having said that it would be great to see the bits they had to cut out to make it even better, but for £6 you can't get much better entertainment for 3 hours.<br/><br/>Only 365 days till the Return of the King...Are they taking bookings yet?"

Me myself, I never expected all that mouch, true I enjoyed the first film, enjoyed it to the grade that I would rate it a 7 out of 10. Tough after the first hour I began to feel that this film could turn out better, the more action based sequel gave a better impression on the big silverscreen, epic battles in beautiful terrain with stunning cgi. The costumedesign, makeup, original score, cgi where all top notch, but, these things does not necesairly make a good feature. In this case the overuse of cgi disturbed me alot, todays technology does not allow cgi we can truly see as realistic. The industry has to wait a few more years before successfully pulling of a film with this amount of cgi. I'll rate the two towers with a 8 out of 10 for its story and beautifull design, what drags it down is the overuse of cgi and that I find the story to be a little unbalanced."

","Oh, if only Peter Jackson had not done such a good job with The fellowship of the ring, I could almost forgive the way he has mangled the Two Towers. I drove arround town to three different movie theatres to find tickets to the Two Towers, and now I wish I had never seen it.  My first problem is that he has added two battles in this movie that are not contained in the book, and ended the movie without even showing the two climatic scenes from the book.  The Wargs were not in the book and should have been left out of the movie, because the Special Effects looked crappy.  The battle at Osgilath may have seemed like a good way to end the movie, except for my second problem with the movie.  Peter Jackson has totally ripped the heart out of two of the main characters.  Fairimir has lost all his nobility, and Theoden has become craven.  Fairimir would never have taken Frodo to Osgilath.  The scene where Gandalf wrestles with the mind of Theoden is brilliant, but Theoden does somehow does not find his courage afterwards in the movie. As for leaving out the second confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, that is the single greatest moment in the entire series.  Too bad it didn't make the film.  I felt ill by the end of the movie."

","First of all, i will just point out that YES i have read the book, and yes the book is GREAT !<br/><br/>Me and some friends started out at 8'oclock with Lord Of The Rings: The Felleowship Of The Ring just to be prepared, Fellowship is getting better and better each time...just fantastic... Well now for my opinion on Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers.<br/><br/>After the commercials ended a silence broke out in the theater that i would never had imagined. When the text ""New Line Cinema"" appeared on the screen in the pale blue as we know it. I had goosebumbs all over and when ""Lord Of The Rings"" faded on to the screen a rush of cheering went through the theatre. Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers had begun, what a release that was.<br/><br/>We start out with a speed and have no resumé of what happened in FoTR. I like that. We are dealing with a 9 hour long movie here and not three movies as someone maybe thinking and now we have 2/3 of the story. There is no beginning and no end to this movie, though in the end Peter Jackson tries to make one. With mixed success i would say. The last 30 min. of the movie deviates a lot from the books, thats a shame, but in my opinion it doesn't make it a less enjoyeable movie.<br/><br/>Now for Gollum or his other self, rightfully, called Sméagol. I think the way Peter Jackson tells Gollums story is fantastic and i get the same feeling as when i read the book. The struggle Gollum is undergoing in his mind is so dark and we see immediately the same problem groing i Frodo who is drifting further and further away from being the hobbit we first met in the shire.<br/><br/>Well i have to end sometime, but i can't point out enough how important it is to see Fellowship before The Two Towers, if you don't have the opportunity to see it on the big screen, the rent the Extended Edition on DVD or VHS, or buy it for pitty sake it's great !<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a great and much more dark movie the Fellowship, we are no longer in the shire....

","There I was sitting on third row, 0:30 in the morning (or night) ready for the second installment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy (that can hardly be considered a trilogy), 'The Two Towers'. Like last year's premiere this was one that made excitement and amazement win from exhaustion. This one is even one minute longer than 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and for you people out there who wonder if it leaves you waiting in anticipation for part three, 'The Return of the King' like last year's movie did: yes.. even more. Now I want to see how it ends.<br/><br/>One difference for me personally was the fact I started reading the novel in the meantime. And that made me realize there were quite some differences, both improvements as well as some quite disappoinments. Maybe the word 'disappointment' is not chosen properly since this is and always will be an adaptation for the big screen and a movie requires other things than a book does... Problem with having read 'The Two Towers' just before the movie is released is that you start to recognize things immediately. People who have read it several times will probably go through the same thing. But this wasn't of a disturbing kind.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson did not follow Tolkien blindly. He took some artistic freedoms, including a bunch of extra scenes, and he twisted around the chapters quite a bit. And that automatically provides the best improvement on the novel. My problems while reading 'The Two Towers' is that its first half (the 3rd book of the series) completely focuses on Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas and Gimli and the second half (the 4th book) only on Sam, Frodo and Gollum. While reading the one half you wonder how the other characters are doing. Jackson suitably switches between these 3 seperate storylines which makes the movie much more enjoyable. Some scenechanges were a bit too swift but Jackon does a good job trying to keep the viewer's interest. Added to this are several other character/scene-changes, like the ones showing Saruman, King Théoden and his daughter Eowyn and the Elves Elrond and Arwen.<br/><br/>Now there's an example of elements Jackson added to the story that aren't in the original: the Elves. To my opinion it was a bit unnescessary but not bugging. And the proclaimed lovestory was there but not dominating, just like it wasn't in 'The Fellowship'.<br/><br/>Gollum is amazing, exceeding the CGI-characters you've seen in other movies (like Yoda in 'Attack of the Clones' and Dobby in 'The Chamber of Secrets') in personality and looks. Sometimes his movements are a bit harsh and too much PC, but this actually is a character with personality where a lot of his CGI-counterparts completely lack such a thing. His internal battle is very well being presented, showing he actually has two sides, Gollum and Sméagol, something Tolkien very well depicted already. This shows Peter Jackson actually admires the author and wants to keep his intentions stored.<br/><br/>Treebeard is a bit disappointing in a way that he's less interesting compared to Gollum. and you very well see the fact Jackson used both CGI animation as well as lifesize dummies. Maybe the Ents are the reason why a lot of people proclaimed 'The Lord of the Rings' was unfilmable. Maybe their concept doesn't allow any cinematographical treatment. Still the scene in which they literally wash Saruman's ears is still rather amazing.<br/><br/>And Helm's Deep isn't? Yes, Helm's Deep certainly is. If you keep in mind that most sets were real-life and it took 3 months of nightly filming in the rain this definately is one of the most smashing scenes in movie-history. The giant armies of Saruman's Uruk-Hai's almost faint you. A few minutes before that you see them leave Isengard and I couldn't help making comparison with Hitler's stadium army gatherings in the late 1930's. Helm's Deep marks the fact that most action is put in the last quarter of the movie. The only complaint about the Helm's Deep sequences is the fact it sometimes is abruptly disturbed by the other storylines. Maybe I was expecting half an hour of pure fighting and battling but Jackson switches to other character's and their battles in the meantime (like the Ents attack on Isengard and Frodo and Sam's capture and battle in Osgiliath (also not a novel element with an amazing 'new' scene with the flying Nazgûl).<br/><br/>All in all: even better than 'The Fellowship', very well character development, a lot of action but exchanged with a lot of story and... why do years take 365 days?"
"Tinuvielas","Null","0","0","18 December 2002"," Great foreplay, but sadly unsatisfactory act (minor Spoilers)
","In Germany, there is a saying that sort of fits this film: Operation successfully completed; patient dead. Which means that in spite of the technical perfection, the obvious dedication of cast and crew and the overall grandiosity of the whole enterprise, somewhere along in the movie, a strange feeling of shallowness and lack of emotional involvement creeps up. Lest fans now abandon this article, let it be said that ""Two Towers"" is nonetheless a hugely enjoyable viewing experience. The first part left me saying ""wow"" to myself several times and thinking that this might turn out the perfect adaption which ""Fellowship"" wasn't. The introduction with  Gandalf and the Balrog falling down into the abyss is breathtaking, and Grimas performance (strangeley enough, my favourite in this film) has a shakespearian intensity. The ""let's hunt orcs"" sequence of Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli is all you could ever dream of while reading the book, and seeing the hosts of Rohan storm over the plains is alone worth the ticket. Also the filmmakers again managed to fit quite a number of little details from the book into the film, which will draw gratified smiles from the readers and probably go unnoticed by those who don't know the books. But even so, after two hours or so, somewhere between the fifth grunting uruk hai and the third cute Rohan refugee child hiding at its mothers breast, I found myself wondering why I was lacking the emotional involvement with the characters that is so strong in the book. Looking at my watch half an hour later, I found myself thinking: ""o no, it's almost over - and where's the climax?"" A sort of interruptus: Great foreplay, but sadly unsatisfactory act. Actually, this is quite a fitting metaphor, not least because this movie obviously is only part two of a three-act-play. And while the beginning in medias res works beautifully, the ending provided by the script only enhances the lack of a proper end of the story. But it also fits because all the orc-chopping going on towards the end of the film, all the surplus action invented by the filmmakers (as if there wasn't enough in the story anyway!) is probably going  to appeal mainly to young masculine fans. Ok, we do have a rather kitsch horse-sequence and the flashback and -forward romance of Aragorn and Arwen for the ladies; but while scenes of fights and battles crowd the screen, the other elements of the story (like humour, legend or poetry) get rather trampled. More unfortunately for the film though, its concessions to popcorn-culture (and probably Jacksons own taste) are also often taking precious screen time away from the characters, who are again played beautifully by the great cast. This dominance of action over character is  the more grievous as the film has to follow three story lines instead of one, the fellowship being split up and each party pursuing their own way against Sauron or Saruman. In the book, this works well enough because the first part of ""The Two Towers"" is dedicated to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, who in the end rejoin Merry and Pippin, while the second part follows Frodo and Sam, so that each part leaves off with a cliffhanger ending of its own. Obviously, this structural solution could not work in the film, but Jacksons frequent intercutting between the three story lines does make for some confusion - especially since all three subplots in the film end up in simultaneous action. And here one may at least ask why the heck Jackson didn't rather adapt Tolkiens original cat-and-mouse-play between Faramir and Frodo and Sam, thus contrasting a quieter, more suspense-filled storyline to the impressive CG-battle at Helm's Deep and the destruction of Isengard by the ents. But no, again he opts for action and has the hobbits carried off into the midst of Osgiliath under attack by the Nazgul. Frankly, who will follow? Those who know the book will grieve for the character of Faramir being corrupted (though played well enough by David Wenham otherwise!); those who don't will probably lose track of who's fighting who. All told, the film works well as long as the script follows the novel; it grows superficial when unnecessary action-sequences are added. Do we really need to see Legolas go surfing down a staircase while shooting at orcs? Do we need to see Gimli thrown (again?)  Or have Aragorn, attached to a Warg, fall down a cliff to (apparent) doom and witness the grief of his friends, just as when Gandalf fell in the ""Fellowship?"" I suspect that here the unholy land of sequels popped up its head, which will have a successful device in the original movie repeated and exaggerated in the sequel. So, too, in the repetition of the ""temptation scene"": In ""Fellowship"" it's the powerlusty Boromir who tries to take the ring from Frodo; in ""Towers"" Faramir steps in his shoes, which is not at all true to the book and yields a rather weak sort of suspense as well as a very unlikely, abrupt and incredible change of mind in Faramir when he  decides to let Frodo go in the end. Would Faramir otherwise really have been too statical a character, as the filmmakers will have it?  The answer, of course, to all the above rhetorical questions is (in this critics opinion) no."
"Dethedrus","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," A grandeur of scope that is seldom seen!
","As a quick aside, I find myself amazed at many of the negative reviews which come off as angry/spiteful that a movie could generate the kind of buzz and near slavish fandom that the LoTR trilogy has to date. Feh.<br/><br/>While The Two Towers doesn't quite have the visceral impact of Fellowship, if for no other reason than the newness that FoTR brought (not quite the drought of high fantasy that existed when FoTR hit the scene), the depth of story and the strong emotional energy truly push the limits of the genre. How to classify a fantasy film, that has strong action elements, an engaging romance, and all other sorts of fun turmoil?  This is one film that's hard to pigeonhole, unless perhaps you simply want to title it an epic, ala the classics like Spartacus, Ben Hur, Braveheart, et al.<br/><br/>From the wrench internal struggles of Gollum/Smeagol, to the near hopeless love of Aragorn and Arwen (and don't forget Éowyn), to Théoden seeing his world crumble before his eyes while he tries to save what he can of his people...  it's almost as if the action is simply a beautiful backdrop to a deep and engaging drama.  Not something you see too often in a standard sword and sorcery flick.<br/><br/>Add the masterful performances of Viggo Mortenson, Sir Ian McKellan and John Rhys Davies (""Nobody tosses a dwarf!""), I can find very little fault with this second installment.  The only complaints I can muster are a little *VERY* obvious CG work (some of the Ent scenes are a bit iffy), and the fact that the music score seemed very derivative of the first movie without having nearly the same impact.<br/><br/>Sure I'll be tired at work today (12:01am showing), but well worth the effort :)<br/><br/>9.7 / 10"
"brad_stephenssmith","3","0","0","18 December 2002"," I don't know what book Peter Jackson was reading, but it wasn't Tolkiens 'The Two Towers'!
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** A few disclaimers:<br/><br/>First, I have enormous respect for the effect of Tolkien's work despite the fact that, to be honest, his writing style doesn't do much for me.<br/><br/>Second, I loved the first movie. It really brought the book to life for me. The changes PJ made were forgivable because, like having Arwen save Frodo in order to get Liv Tyler more screentime, they didn't particularly alter the plot or the nature of the characters.<br/><br/>Third, I was annoyed with people who slammed the first movie for whatever little quibble they could come up with. I wanted these movies to be great and get no satisfaction out of reporting otherwise.<br/><br/>No, with this second installment it seems that Jackson and co have decided to throw Tolkien's book out the window in favor of their own screenwriters in far more meaningful ways. In interviews, Peter Jackson has even acknowledged that he thought the books were too ""dense"" and that they needed to be ""simplified"" for the average person who was unfamiliar with the books. The best part is that in the same interview, his justification for all this is that ""there is a lot of money at stake here"".<br/><br/>Well, the really sad part is that it didn't even work. During the beginning of the movie, I was trying to watch it as someone who had never read the book (which was not so difficult as it had been some time since I had) and was already disappointed. Characters are introduced too quickly, plotlines are rushed... and the changes this time around are far from trivial.<br/><br/>
-- SPOILERS BELOW --<br/><br/>Of my wife and I's three favorite characters, only Eowyn, who is actually played quite well, is spared. Poor Gimli has been reduced to comic relief and does little more than fall off horses, be the subject of height jokes and axe people in the groin (yes, the film actually sinks this low). But Faramir fares worst. Apparently the average, non-tolkien-reading person off the street can't grapple with a concept as complex as a man who shows the wisdom to, unlike his brother, see the ring for what it is and not try to take it. No, in this version we are given the 'simplified' Faramir, who does try to take the ring and deliver it to his father as a gift. It takes a close call with a Nazgul (which also never appears in the book) and Samwise spelling it out to him for the 'simplified' Faramir to actually let the ringbearer go. Simplified, or just plain simpleton? The worst part is that this change does absolutely NOTHING for the plot! Sam and Frodo still end up parting ways with Faramir and his men and Faramir is still on his way to defend Gondor. The only difference is that anyone who has read the book and loved the character of Faramir is now disgusted with what we've been given instead.<br/><br/>I said that was the worst part. Actually, I lied. The worst part is that there are numerous scenes like this. A completely new, ill-contrived subplot involving Aragorn and Arwen wastes time by doing nothing but giving still more screentime (now in a story that the character isn't even meant to appear in) to a Mabeline-laden Liv Tyler and then taking us back to exactly where we started (unless PJ ends up messing with the characters in even more tasteless ways in the next film). The 'simplified' ents, rather than noticing that a huge chunk of their forrest has been hewn down, initially refuse to take part and have to be manipulated by Pippin into going to Isengard before doing anything. All of these changes seem inferior to the book version and yet they all deposit their characters in roughly the same position as their counterparts in the book. It makes one wonder what PJ was thinking in making the changes at all.<br/><br/>I feel betrayed and alienated by this movie. It would have been much better if the first film had been lousy. I wasn't expecting much at the time. But having longed to see Helm's Deep on the big screen for so long, when I saw Jackson's ""Fellowship.."" I developed a faith that it could actually happen. Never in my wildest imaginings would I have expected to be contemplating leaving in the middle of it. The thought actually crossed my mind that 'maybe the whole thing is really just a bad dream and then I'll wake up and we'll go see the real movie'. My wife, who is the real Tolkien fan of the family, was left literally in tears.<br/><br/>For those who are interested, here's the most complete list of major (ie not just nitpicking about lines added or sideways glances omitted) changes that we could put together<br/><br/>Gandalf literally excorcises Saruman from posession of Theoden The character of Faramir is radically different Gimli is mostly comic relief<br/><br/>New subplot with dog riders attacking the people of Rohan en route to Helm's deep, aragorn's ""death"" and Arwen's (apparent) descision not to stay with him.<br/><br/>Theoden is much less heroic at Helm's Deep and has to be coaxed into doing anything.<br/><br/>Elves show up to announce their alliance with the humans and save the day at Helm's Deep (????)<br/><br/>The women and children of Rohan are kept in Helm's deep instead of another keep in the mountains apparently for no other reason than to give us lots and lots (and lots) of shots of women and children crying during the fight. Eowyn is therefore there at the battle, but neither fighting nor having been given stewardship over her people.<br/><br/>Ents have to be tricked by pippin to decide to to do anything about Saruman<br/><br/>No shelob *<br/><br/>Gandalf does not confront Saruman (he's never even at Isengard) *<br/><br/>Gandalf and co never receive the plantir (black, spherical seer stone thing) *<br/><br/>

Being such a fan of the book as I am I have to complain about the things I didn't like/found strange; Worst of all is that they left out about one third of the book(climbing into Mordor etc), I can understand that if this should have been in the movie, it would have been 5 hrs long or something. Still I found it weird that such a big part of the book was missing. Hopefully we will see it next year though. Another thing I didnt like was the massive rewriting,as I am sure anyone who has read the book will agree with me. Also MUCH of the film could have been removed,the whole Arwen/Aragorn-thingy IS NOT IMPORTANT!! There. Also,some of the animation were far from perfect. Watch Merrin and Pippin riding on top of Treebeard,you can see how awful it looks. I also found the music during the Helmsdeep-battle to be totally wrong. These scenes should have some mighty war-music or smt, not that cheesy,soft crytillyoureyesbleed music. When I have said so much, I can go on and on about how good the movie actually was.

The violence is raw, the evil is dark and the Uruk-Hai army is mighty. This is also the point where the trilogy really becomes an epic story of the classic themes; love and friendship, hatred and war. The characters all become more complex. Elijah Wood portrays the increasing darkness in Frodo brilliantly - his frightening eyes telling a whole story of their own, Legolas is the ultimate medieval action hero and King Théodan is also given a worthy performance by Bernard Hill. The most successful character, however, is the one of Gollum/Sméagol. He is geniously portrayed by the actor and mountain climber Andy Serkis, who both does his voice and his movements. Gollum is definitely the most complex CGI character up to date, and his appearance is also very realistic.<br/><br/>
The footage is amazing. Peter Jackson has simply done an even more splendid job behind the camera this time than with Fellowship. The beautiful nature of New Zealand is a pleasure for the eye, with its majestic mountains and adventurous plains. Fangorn forest is fantastic. The extra lightening effects, as are widely used with Gandalf, adds to the experience.<br/><br/>The Battle of Helm's Deep. It is huge, overwhelming and epic in all its form, as is the movie. It is hard to believe that the film really manages to portray the battle as great on screen as it was meant to be, but Peter Jackson has accomplished the task. That is really the core of my opinion on The Two Towers (as on The Fellowship of the Ring): Tolkien's story of Middle-earth was a perfected masterpiece, hailed by many as the greatest of all stories. In these years we are witnessing it come to life on the cinema screen in a way no one could have imagined. We are privileged. The professor would have been proud."

","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This was a great movie. The battle at helms deep was really brought into veiw. Great armies of men and elves fought through MASSive software. I was a little disappointed in Faramir. In the books he does not take the ring to Gondor. To me, the change is  to drastic. Faramir is a Noble man who lets the ring go, not gives it to his Father. On the other hand, they did Gullom very well. He is by far the best computer generated image I have seen. Don't watch this movie if you haven't seen the first (like you haven't!).

","who have read the book and those who are going to.<br/><br/>The first part of this comment is if you mainly base your experience of the film, by the first film: ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" (FOTR). Now if you also have read the book, you might also want to read the second part.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!!<br/><br/>Now if you haven't got a vision of the book in clear memory, i.e. never read it or long ago, and you wants to see next chapter which began with FOTR, this is some epic story. The location for the film is breathtaking, the number of real people and real props is massive. The tension in the film starts with the battle between Gandalf and the Balrog ending with a fantastic battle at Helm's Deep. Combined with excellent special effect-making it gives the film a trustworthy touch, and during all 3 hours you are never bored or feeling that you wasted your time. As an epic adventure I would give 10/10.<br/><br/>If you have read the book: I've recently read the books 3+4 of LOTR, which is the background for the movie ""The Two Towers"", and wanted to see how well adopted it is.<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam's story works fine, we can feel their hopeless quest, and we get a brilliant picture of Gollum. But when they come to Ithilien a question arises, why changing the plot: Why are they going to Osgiliath? Why couldn't the problem be solved at Henneth Annûn? That the film ends before Shelob is okay, otherwise their part in ""The Return Of The King"" probably would have been very short.<br/><br/>For Merry and Pippin again it works: That they're chased by Grishnákh, the meeting with Treebeard, and finally the breaking of Isengard.<br/><br/>Lastly there's the tracking trio, where especially Gimli is altered: Why is he goofing around all the time - lacking behind, being tossed of a horse, being thrown into battle and so on (a dwarf is stout and proud, not a clown). To mend this you could have the result of Gimli and Legolas's competition, but maybe Gimli's victory is saved for the extended DVD version? Then there's Legolas' stunts just a little too much - the leap from ground to horse and the skateboard-trick, it's unneeded and ""modern"". There's too many of these silly bits. Then there's the squadron of elves, commanded by Haldir, that arrive: Where did they come from? Apparently they come to aid instead of Huorns and Ents. In spite of this is the whole battle at Helm's Deep is stunning, so many Uruk-hai and so few men.<br/><br/>I find that the changes mentioned above seems peculiar and unnecessary. And I find that it reduces the quality of the film. On the other hand you have some changes work, for example the larger role Arwen plays or the chase by Grishnákh. Mainly because I've read the book, and based on the above I can ""only"" give it 9/10."

","Warning - Spoilers<br/><br/>How can a book so well known as this need a spoiler warning in its film review?  Partly because Peter Jackson has (necessarily) changed the story in order to give the viewer some of the background story that Tolkien put in the appendices, and partly to make it more cinematic.  I can put up with the need to include Liv Tyler, despite the fact that Arwen does not appear in the book at all, and I can just about put up with the film finishing a couple of chapters early - but why completely change a character?  Faramir is made out to be some kind of monster, carrying on where his brother left off.  To me the whole character in the book was the antithesis of Boromir, well cultured and studious, a character which will be required in the third film, but here this has been hindered by the handling of the minor part he played in this film.<br/><br/>The effects in the film are generally good and I can't complain that they don't fit with my minds picture of them from the book.  The Nazgul's flying beasts are superbly done, but the Gollum is unbelievably seemless. It is the best piece of CGI I have ever seen, and deserves an Oscar for that alone.  A bit too cute for my liking (the Ralph Bakshi Gollum fit the character better for me) but Andy Serkis deserves the Oscar for supporting actor for the voice acting alone.<br/><br/>Some of the other acting was a bit wooden in places (and I don't mean the Ents), Faramir for example, and Grima was just not acted at all, just the lines read out.  Sam and Frodo didn't shine here either.  Finally too much was made of the comedy of Gimli, here and there, yes, but one left the film feeling that he was a bit of a joke.<br/><br/>Overall, 9 out of 10.  Let's hope The Return of the King returns to the form shown in Fellowship."
"Nigel St. Buggering","7","0","0","19 December 2002"," A bit of a disappointment after the first film
","After the thickly-layered mountains of praise heaped upon ""Fellowship of the Ring"", perhaps it was inevitable that ""The Two Towers"" couldn't live up to it.  And maybe I'm the only one who feels that it did not.  Unfortunately, where ""Fellowship"" managed a near-perfect combination of the book's strengths with a good deal of shoring up to cover its weaknesses (sorry, Ringies, but it does have weaknesses), ""Towers"" shows all too many of the limitations of its source material, and the additions sadly weaken it even further.<br/><br/>Certainly there's plenty to admire.  The new characters are beautifully introduced and performed, particularly in the case of Miranda Otto as Eowyn, and a surprisingly sympathetic and complex rendition of Gollum, who could easily have been extremely irritating.  The new characters, in fact, come off much better than the established ones.  John Rhys Davies' Gimli suffers particularly, reduced to an almost Jar-Jar-like role of comic relief and battle buffoon.  Also of note is the spectacular staging of the assault on Helm's Deep, surely one of the finest mass ground battles ever committed to film.<br/><br/>However, there are many more mis-steps here than evident in the first film. A sequence in which Aragorn is separated from the party ultimately serves no purpose, as he simply experiences a flashback sequence and is quickly reunited with his friends.  Why?  In addition, the pacing is less even than that found in ""Fellowship"".  Where that film managed to pace out its thrills in excellent beats with the story-driven scenes, this one makes the audience wait quite a bit longer for payoff.  ""The Two Towers"" is more likely to test the patience of those not already enamored of Tolkien's world, as it's a long haul from the bombastic Balrog opening to the two battles that cap off the story.  At the same time, the many liberties taken with the structure of the book (especially the characterization of Faramir) may put off the hardcore fans.<br/><br/>Still, there are a lot of filmgoers out there who decided to unconditionally love this series long before the first chapter hit the screens, and I doubt that this will dim their enthusiasm.  I can't wholeheartedly recommend ""The Two Towers"" for everyone, but that really won't stop anybody.  As a means of getting from part one to part three, it does its job in an entertaining manner.  Hopefully, ""Return of the King"" will bring us as rousing a conclusion as ""Fellowship of the Ring"" was an introduction.  But this definitely represents a dip in the road."

","Yes it has its flaws but I havent really seen any film come close to this in terms of ambition and having that Epic quality. The enchantment of Fellowship is replaced by the realities of War and high drama. As you watch it you get the feeling that no, this is NOT Star Wars, not even Gladiator, it themes are so intense it actually feels like the Godfather or something from Wagner. A dark, relentless and complicated film, there are one or two things which are less then perfect. First of all compared to the Fellowship, the score is weak, and secondly the final battle is a little overdrawn. Apart from that its extremely well conceived and executed."

The critics were right. This is a stunning film from Peter Jackson, who must surely now be hailed as one of the greatest directors of our lifetime.<br/><br/>So many go great scenes, with only a couple of small gripes from me that will probably not matter once I have seen the Two Towers a couple of times.<br/><br/>--------------SPOILERS---------------------------- The Battle of Helms Deep has got to go down as the greatest battle in cinema history. The charge out of the Hornburg by King Theoden and his few surviving men, to a guaranteed hero's death at the hands of 7,000 Uruk Hai, (3,000 must have been killed by then) was both breathtaking and very thrilling in its execution.<br/><br/>Then the Ents almost go one better in a fantastic sequence where they sack Isengard, destroying the Uruk Hai nursery and standing Saruman in Orthanc.<br/><br/>Of course the star of the film has to be Gollum, played by Andy Serkis, whose movements had been captured by computer and turned into the best ever CGI character in the history of cinema. His conversation with himself, as Gollum's good and bad parts battle for control of his will, is both amusing and extremely pitiful.<br/><br/>The story itself wizzes along at good speed and the pacing is better than Fellowship. however, I do have a few minor gripes.<br/><br/>The Treebeard sequence looked like Merry and Pippin stuck up a tree with a giant blue screen behind them. It only looked good when they were moving. And cutting away from Helms Deep to the Treebeard story at the hight of battle wasn't a good move as the intensity of battle was interplayed with the slowest creatures on Middle-earth! I just wanted to get battle to Gimli hacking at Orc necks.<br/><br/>Faramir's character was also changed, but this alteration was for the better on a man who is fairly static in the book. By releasing Frodo and Sam at the end he showed redemption, which in the Return Of The King will bring him just rewards with Eowyn.<br/><br/>------------END SPOILERS--------------------------<br/><br/>So how do I rate it? From the opening scenes to the final credits, the three hours wizzes by. A great story well told, and great acting from McKellen, Mortensen, Douriff, Otto and Gollum (Serkis). Superb CGI most of the time, and a couple of battles to end all battles. Until the next movies even bigger one.I am sure that with multiple viewings all my tiny gripes will fall into insignificance as I walk and breath again in Middle-earth.<br/><br/>10/10"

Also, Gollum is one of the most intriguing and fantastic characters ever!!!

"BitOfFish","9","0","0","18 December 2002"," A different telling of the same tale.
","While much more action packed than Fellowship, Two Towers manages to capture the humanity of the events much more emotionally. It is in fact very altered from the original tale. The Lord of the Rings in itself is a tale being told by one man. When one man tells a tale it is different from the last telling. Jackson's version of the story is not a verbatim transcript of the books, nor does it pretend to be. It is nothing more than his own telling of a tale that was told to him. A concept that is at the very heart of Tolkien's trilogy. Whether or not Jackson should have placed the story on a visual medium is not for anyone to decide. Whatever the case may be Jackson executes the film nearly flawlessly. Certainly the story seems a little more empty than the books, due simply to the fact that the visual author is much more limited in his time to tell his story than the literary author. So my advice is if you are unwilling to accept anything other than an unabridged account of Frodo's tale, read the book. Elsewise see this brilliantly crafted film."

Gollum's split personality was ""explained"" (by conversations with himself) a bit too extensive too I think .<br/><br/>Some other things that where never so apparent in the book where visually very good, like when Frodo & Sam cover themselves with the Elven Robe , and from the outside it looks like a giant Rock , because they are in a rock area (like a camelion).<br/><br/>Some other things that are assumed for the viewer to know , like the Lembas Bread, the Elven Rope , the Elven Brooche that Pippin drops where things you never saw them receive in the fellowship , but they speak of them so you understand that they where given . . .<br/><br/>The Ents . I accepted the Ents from the beginning , they are very well done , the CGI is brilliant like Gollum's .The War between the Ents and IsenGard is good , but a part I would like to have put in the film is not there (the Ents breaking the surrounding walls by growing their roots into the walls would have been great . . .<br/><br/>Finally the battle of Helms Deep , Great , but too short when Eomer Arrives , when they ride down the mountain to clash into the Orc Host , is just too HUGE to describe , it is breath-taking . But then they jump to the Ent war which is not as impressive as Helm's , and when they finally return they are already crying VICTORY at the Horn burg . . . should have been a few minutes longer (5 maybe ,after Eomer & Ganalf arrive) . The final scenes  (quite a bit before the ending in the book) between Sam , Frodo & Gollum are sudden , specially because I expected the ending a bit further .<br/><br/>After all this comment I still rate the movie 10/10 , all the minor issues cannot weigh up to the greatness of the Trilogy .

","The Two Towers was incredible.   I love the books.  I love the movies.  Yes, things where changed, but you know what, if you translated the books into films directly, they would be long, and in some parts very boring.  Would The Fellowship Of The Ring been nearly as exciting if the days of travel and talk where included.  It would have dragged on forever.  Books and movies are different mediums.  DIFFERENT.  Not the same.  Different.  Now that you understand that, maybe you can understand why things are changed.  To make the movie better.  Not worse.  BETTER.  And why are people getting upset about Shelob.  If you knew anything about the books and where so avid fans, you would know he wrote them as one book.  Where the books are divided is arbitrary, as is where Peter Jackson divides them.  Peter Jackson has created the best possible movie version of the books.  THE BEST.  If you don't like it, it is because you are too narrow minded and hung up on every minute detail of the book.  You have to learn to let go and watch the movie as a movie, not as the book.  It is DIFFERENT, remember.  And for those of you hoping that someone else will make a different version, after this, it will never happen.

This is a guy who the audience is supposed to like, who is supposed to represent the good in Gondor.  Now all the audience will have is him, Boromir and later Denethor to show them what Gondorians are like, and the picture won't be pretty.

Fifty years from now, film lovers will hold these two films (and their final chapter, due out next year) in the same regard with which we today think of the great films of the 20th century. It is a truly outstanding epic.<br/><br/>Jackson departs from the literal storyline in the Tolkien books somewhat more in this movie than in the first, but he remains very true to the spirit of the author's work. The cinematography is once again awesome, from the sweeping panoramas of Middle Earth (now known as New Zealand) to the sprawling battle scenes. Despite the movie's 3-hour length, I found it continually engaging; there were few (if any) slow parts. Jackson uses the juxtaposition of the three separate subplots effectively in this regard.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most amazing accomplishment is the character of Gollum. There was a great deal of advance press about how the special effects team used computer-generated graphics to produce what we saw (overlaying this on the able acting of Andy Serkis). What amazed me was the astounding reality of Gollum's face. I found myself staring into those large eyes, looking for the shreds of humanity (well, of hobbit, actually) that remained. There was nothing artificial about that face; it spoke volumes about the torment going on within this creature.<br/><br/>This is unquestionably a film to see several times. It is an epic unfolding."

And its down to the fact that too much time is given to tree beard. Although he was done very well and he is an important part in the story...even i hav to admit (and being a mega lotr fan) he did waffle on a bit. Another bad criticism I have is that Gollum, although done well didnt meet my expectations. In fact the model of Gollum in this film is different to the one in the first film. I dont know what it is about him but I felt that Gollum could have been better. Its probably because he's so babyish and in the third film he does get alot better because the evil side comes out. The battle of Helms Deep is ground breaking in every way and is held together by strong performances by Viggo Mortensen and Bernard Hill.

So it's only natural that I'd consider any film which does justice to the book in an equally favorable light.<br/><br/>End disclaimer:<br/><br/>LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring was very good, although much better in its extended DVD edition. LOTR: The Two Towers exceeds the first film in all respects.

The climactic battle for Helm's Deep is difficult to adequately describe. I should probably wait until I can pick up my jaw to write this. Peter Jackson seamlessly blends both live action and some of the most impressive CGI I've ever seen to create a battle that seems more real than the realistic ones in, e.g., ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""Enemy at the Gate"".<br/><br/>Most LOTR fans had been waiting with some trepidation to see how the entirely CGI characters of Gollum and Treebeard would turn out. Whether they match a reader's personal vision or not, they are well done and amazingly credible. Gollum/Smeagol is convincing as a tortured soul being manipulated by the power of the ring, but with some residual trace of decency trying to get out. This was not so obvious in the book, but is done perfectly in the film.<br/><br/>Treebeard and the Ents could have been silly in the wrong hands, but are entirely sympathetic and believable characters here. By the time they attacked Isengard, the audience was cheering them like a stadium full of football fans.<br/><br/>If the Academy and/or the Director's Guild don't reward Peter Jackson for this, then they should simply quit the hypocrisy and post a sign on the door that SF and fantasy films aren't welcome. I consider this and the first film to be 2/3 of what has already become my favorite movie of all time. I can hardly wait for the last third...<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>By now most of my comments have become irrelevant. PJ was overlooked for LOTR:TTT, but amply compensated by the Oscar sweep of LOTR:ROTK. The only thing to add is that the extended director's cut DVD was just much of a revelation as the extended version of LOTR:TFOTR."

With so much in between it makes you feel out of breath after witnessing its brilliance. Tolkien in my eyes had to be a genius he made a world from his own mind and allowed us to venture in and explore. Jackson is the same way, you feel every thing in this film, from every tear shed to every sword stab. It is heart felt and true to Tolkien and his world. I feel and I am sure everyone in the theater with me, that this is the true meaning of perfect. It has something for everyone from the lovers of action, to the lovers of horror, to romance, to comedy it has it all and so well mixed in you won't even feel the transaction till the very moment you cry or the second you laugh. This is the Star Wars of the Twenty-first century, all films from now on out will look at this for inspiration and guidance.

","WOW...There are almost no words to say about this film- it's that good. It takes what happened in the first film and multiplies EVERYTHING by ten. The stakes<br/><br/>are higher, the action is stronger, more intense and intriguing and the<br/><br/>characters are deepened. This has to be the best sequel since ""The Empire<br/><br/>Strikes Back"". It is that much deeper than the first film, ""The Fellowship of the Ring""- as ""Empire"" is much deeper in scope than the original ""Star Wars"".<br/><br/>       Character-wise, if ""Fellowship"" was Gandalf's film, this is Aragorn's film. Viggo Mortensen's intensely good performance gets better here as his love for the elvin Arwen is put in jeopardy. Everything in this movie works. Gollum is an amazing presence. He is the anti Jar-Jar. Gollum is the first CG character to accomplish the feat of forgetting that he is a CG character. His ""schizo"" scenes are especially effective. Frodo also deepens and Elijah Wood is able to show<br/><br/>more of his acting chops as the ring begins taking control. Merry and Pippen are also put to better use here, as they meet up with perhaps the strangest and most magical character in the film. The visuals too are spectacular, especially at the battle for Helm's Deep- probably the best castle-siege scene ever put onto<br/><br/>celluloid. The lingering problems with the first film disappear here as the story deepens. This is going to go down as the best trilogy ever- better than the first Star Wars Tril. (but influenced by it- as that trilogy was influenced by these books)- and MUCH better than the NEW ""Star Wars"" trilogy (ie. BAD Star Wars<br/><br/>trilogy) --While ""Attack of the Clones"" takes the story given to us in ""The<br/><br/>Phantom Menace"" and mangles it and gives it back to us unrecognizable, this<br/><br/>film takes what was there (from ""Fellowship"") and beautifies it, expands upon it, and gives us the ""bridge"" in what will surely be an amazing trilogy."

","I am not a hard core fan of the Trilogy of The Lord of the Rings but as a movie buff, I can safely say that this installment, The Two Towers, is no less than the second in what appears to be a hat trick by Peter Jackson! It is destined for blockbuster business and a slew of Oscar nominations. It may even surpass the original in many ways.<br/><br/>The story starts right into the next chapter without recounting or summarizing the previous feature-bravo for being gutsy enough to trust your audience, Mr Jackson. The film diverges into three parallel storylines following each set of heroes in their quest to merge various groups of people to fight the powerful evil forces.  Without losing the thrust of Frodo and his journey with the dreaded ring, we find several new characters being introduced (including a wonderful computer enhanced creature).<br/><br/>Clocking in at 179 minutes, the film is superbly paced and yet methodical in its characterizations and various subplots.  The action is grand and mind boggling. It is almost breathtaking in its sweep and audacity.  A perfect blend of special effects, set design, and natural scenery. <br/><br/>
One can imagine Pater Jackson and his team expanding on the original source novel by enhancing the romantic aspects and the action set pieces, but as true entertainment, it was a shrewd and successful choice.<br/><br/>For this type of film and story, it is as close to perfection as they come. The finale cannot come soon enough!"

","*Spoilers* There is a film called The Dark Crystal, in it, a narrative voice tells ""In a different place...In a different place...In the Age Of Wonder"" Long have I wondered what it means to be living In The Age of Wonder. Til Tuesday night when I sat at the theater at twelve o'clock eagerly anticipating The movie of the year. Heck, this was the movie I've been waiting for more than any other after truly adoring Fellowship. Well, Tuesday night I truly felt that I was living in the age of wonder, expecting it to be as beautiful, and dramatic as the first one. But after a great opening and great first hour the film diminished to become an exaggerated orgy in effects, Ents, comedians, and lacking every ounce of ""wonder"". This film has a great number of beauty spots. Firstly, the score never lifts, never touches the way it did in Fellowship. Mr Shore has re-used some of the earlier themes an re- arranged them, but the new tunes are hard to distinguish in between them. Then there's Gimli who is acting as the film´s Comic Relief to the point where it´s actually tiresome. And Legolas is oh-so serious, as to somehow balance it up. And sadly, no, the Battle Of Helm's Deep isn't as grand as we are told. It's a rather overkill in heroism and exaggerations. Ok, we are dealing with a Fantasy film here, but there's just no-way you can throw yourself in an pit of hell raised Orcs and survive, even if you are called Aragorn or Gimli. No-way! Dominic M, and Billy B (Merry and Pippin) are showing that they are tired, I could spot a dangerous crack in there, their acting doesn't push the story or the drama further. Last but not least it's Peter Jacksons changes from the book, the first hour is ok, even great, but later on it becomes apparent that all the decisions to deviate from the book weren't very healthy. I missed several anticipated scenes. All in all, a good film that doesn't come near it masterpiece predescessor. 6 out of 10...really."

The Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite trilogies of all time. I only wish this film could get an Academy Award for best Picture or something.

","I'm of two minds as I write this. I must agree with Roger Ebert's assessment that the Hobbits get shortchanged in these films. They get carried along by the needs of an making action film that covers the huge canvas of Tolkien's story. At the same time, I utterly enjoyed this second installment of the Lord of the Rings. I must say it was even better than the first. In my mind I try to separate the book from the movie, my enjoyment of each is not dependent upon the other. The terrific action sequences bring the basic message of this film home- there is a tide of evil that is coming and no one is immune or safe. The absence of Gandalf only adds to the desperate plight of the humans, Hobbits, Elves and even Ents. Peter Jackson has outdone Francis Coppola and George Lucas and made the greatest sequel to ever hit the big screen. The scope and sweep of this film is transcendental as has been said. The story rules despite the liberties that Jackson took, he always came back to the essence of the book. It's too early to hand out individual plaudits to such a group effort, but suffice it to say that in every way this film has become an instant classic that raises the bar for future films This film rates the highest possible score and then some."

","Here in Belgium, lots of movie critics were not satisfied with this film. I don't know what they expected instead, maybe they're just prejudiced. Anyway, it's a must see. It's how the story had to continue to stay true to the book and at the same time be a compelling movie in itself. It's no longer a simple straightforward tale from North to south anymore, the plot thickens, the evil manifests itself more openly and despair grows. The careless Shire is long behind us, it's for real this time. The Aragorn-Arwen thing might be boring to some, but they're forgetting that their story formed a whole appendix in Tolkien's work, so it belongs in the major story. Besides, it explains the tough choice Arwen must make, just like any other character in the movie, they all have to realize the good old times will never return. But for me the best part in the whole movie was Gollum. Sweet, deceitful, tragic Gollum. You can't help feeling sorry for him. His voice, his expression, his dialogues with Smeagol, it all makes him one of the most complex and interesting characters of them all. It's just great how they created him, and developed his character so thoroughly in this piece of cinema with an over 30 man strong cast. And for anyone who dislikes it, I'd like to see YOU get those millions of dollars from the studios and make something better. This what you got, and it's worth every damn penny. Counting down from now till December 2003, with hopefully an excellent extended dvd version to keep us sweet in between."

","My comments will contain spoilers, so don't read on if you don't want to be spoiled:<br/><br/>This time, Peter Jackson has taken too many liberties with Tolkien's vision. Sacrificed some of the depth of the books for action action action. Added totally unnecessary scenes (might I mention Osgiliath? The attack of the Warg riders? The whole will she/won't she issue with Arwen? C'mon, especially that one lost other more ""worthy"" characters screen time.) Oh, and how about the miraculous traveling speed of Haldir? Wasn't he the elf that guarded Lorien's borders in movie one? So how did he manage in the space of a few days to hop over the mountains, zip up to Rivendell and then be in Helm's deep in the nick of time bringing a bit of an army? After all, Galadriel decided only well after the fellowship had left Lothlorien that the cause of Middle-Earth could use some elvish help. As for Faramir and Boromir, how did Peter Jackson manage to reverse my opinion of the characters? Didn't care much for Boromir in the books, love him in the movie. Love Faramir in the books, don't care about him in the movie. Two-dimensional as a cardboard cutout and un-likeable. On the plus side, there is Gimli: a little too much comic relief, but oh so wonderfully acted by John Rhys-Davies. How he manages to convey so much through all the make-up is simply adorable. Merry and Pippin are used too little, but what they do they do amazingly well. I can't help but love them. Gollum is a great creation - but I got that schizophrenia thing the first time he went at it, didn't need it again at such length a second time. Frodo and Sam - aren't they just amazing? Elijah Wood managed to bring Frodo to life for me in the first movie and he keeps going stronger. But on the top of my list there is Sean Astin. He is the true hero, unlikely as it may seem, of the books and this second movie. It started with little gestures etc. in the first movie, but now he's really going for it and has convinced and won me completely. Go Sean!!!<br/><br/>Overall, if you're into loads of fantastic action and a bit of colourful plot and know the story from the books, you will like it or even love love love it. Those who aren't that familiar with Tolkien's world will easily be in trouble or puzzled to say the least. Worth seeing two or three times to get all the little details, but I'll probably not go see this ten times plus as I did with the first one."

"DragoonKain","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," As good as the first, and oh so dark
","Having seen the second part of my favorite epic novel, it once again blew me away.  A word of warning: this one is dark.  The book, like the movie, takes a very dark and violent turn in this second part.  I love that sort of thing, so I was very happy, but be wary if you're taking kids to see this one.<br/><br/>
Spoiler Warning<br/><br/>Rather than seperate the journey of Frodo and Sam from the rest of the story, they interlaced them together, and a lot of changes were made. Many of them for the better, but like before there were a few changes I did not like.  First the bad stuff.<br/><br/>Most of the changes I did not like were simply the things left out of the story.  The Ents, for instance, could have been more developed on.  We didn't get to hear much of their philosophy and lifestyle, which was a very enjoyable part of the book (no meantion of Entwives).  And they made the Ents seem less intelligent then they are portrayed in the books.  Also, there didn't seem to be enough Gandalf in this one.  In the book, he had a much larger role.  It would have been nice to see the events leading up to Gandalf's Battle on the Peak, and I think more explanation was needed as to Gandalf's return as Gandalf the White.  Those that didn't read the book wouldn't know how he wound up in Fangorn forest.  Then again, I really didn't fully understand what happened to him until I read the Silmarillion so I guess a little mystery was Tolkien's intention.  But I think they just left a little too much unexplained here.  I could have done without the whole Aragorn being thought dead part.  Not really a bad part as we get to see more of the story of Arwen and Aragorn, but kind of unnecessary.  The Siege of Isengard was just as cool as I had hoped, but was a bit short. In fact, this movie actually was too short.  It ends quite a bit early in comparison to the book, probably a good choice pacing-wise since you can't top that climax.  But, I hope they make up for those lost chapters in the next movie.<br/><br/>Still, I had simliar feelings about the stuff they left out of the Fellowship, and they made up for it perfectly in the Extended Edition, which is definitely the most flawless movie I have ever seen.  Hopefully it will be the same when the EE comes out for this one.  Pretty much everything else in this movie was perfect.<br/><br/>The battle of helms deep (a favorite chapter of mine) is every bit I could have hoped for and more.  This was the mother of all battles in the book (second only to the battle of the Pelennor Fields in Return of the King), and they really hit the nail on the head for this one.  They didn't change the course of the battle too much from the book, but the additions they made to it were great.  I especially love the addition of the lothlorien elves to the battle.  The look, special effects, score, fight scenes and acting were wonderful.  The performance of Gollum/Smeagol was right on.  Another great addition was the story of Arwen and Aragorn, an appendix to the book I was afraid they were going to leave out.  Although they leave out most of their history, we do get to know enough about their past, and in the process learn a little more about the elves.  Another cool addition was the whole fight with the Warg riders.  We get introduced to Wargs in the hobbit but don't see much of them in The Lord of the Rings novel.  Definitely a cool fight scene (gotta love Gimli).  Gimli was probably my favorite character for this movie.  In the book, Gimli and Legolas were very well developed characters. Two warriors who start off hating each other, then wind up best friends. Peter Jackson, thankfully, managed to develop them well.  Gimli kind of takes a back seat to Legolas in the first one, but in this one he really shines.  He is the comic releif in this one, as he is in the book, and Peter Jackson nailed it.  We definitely needed the comic relief among all this doom.  My favorite bits of Tolkien dialog are the ones between Legolas and Gimli during the battle of helms deep.  They're both pretty much doomed to die, but all they can do in between cleaving orcs is joke around and place bets on the number of kills they can get.  I was very happy to see that this is one of the few bits of Tolkien dialog PJ left unchanged.<br/><br/>This was definitely a wonderful film, go see it, and see the extended edition as well.  10/10"

During, the epic Helms battle sequence the joking between Gimli, Aragorn, and Legolas is totally uncalled for and took away from the drama of the moment.  The tree special effects were not very good at all, but in contrast the Smigel CGI was astounding.  I felt Samwise Gamgee was a little too smart in this film in comparison to where he was when Fellowship left off.  Overall, I gave this movie a seven.  I highly recommend seeing this film, but don't expect too much.  Peter Jackson appeared to think that it would be too much drama for viewers to handle so he softened it up.  Not sure if Tolkien would be as pleased with this one as with Fellowship."

On the surface you see incredible animation and effects (eg. golom) but at the same time, and something I find a lot harder to reproduce, you see incredible integration with ""real"" surroundings.  If you look at how the golom splashes through water and grabes clothes among all its other seamless integration you really see what the goal is in trying to integrate CGI with reality.  On top of that and even more difficult (in my experience) is the incredible humanity as I call it.  I consider humanity not looking like a human, but expressions and motion.  This is where I think the real breakthrough is.  Even in films such as final fantasy (where the models were damn good), at parts things didnt look right because of movement and sheer expression.

I don't agree with this; Two Towers is a continuation of a great epic and deserves **** out of ****.  Peter Jackson has become the best visual director in the film industry right now.  Many reviews are criticizing the CGI job for Gollum; this is ridiculous. Compare it to the 2 best known CGI characters in recent movies: the disastrous Jar-Jar Binks, and perhaps the even worse Dobby.  Furthermore, there are real characters in this movie including: Gollum, Aragorn, Arwen, and Frodo (who for the majority of the film is able to drop the Hobbit go-lucky attidude and present the caricature of a possessed victim).  Two Towers has some faults, like the flatness of Gimili's character, and more noticably the absolutely horrid shots of Merry and Pippin in a tree; these things are screaming blue screen.  But neither one of these faults warrants a *** ranking.  LOTR is like nothing we have seen before, it is a breathtaking epic, and Two Towers does not deserve any of the sophmoric backlash it seems it is receiving."

The first movie was good, but my main complaints were the volume being too loud and overuse of aerial photography. The Two Towers was too quiet actually, and while the A.P. has been toned down and doesn't annoy as much, it's still there. Gimli had a really good sight gag, but they really milked it not once more, not twice but I think 5 times. It was funny ONCE.<br/><br/>
Cate Blanchett has a really good agent who got her listed before 80% of everyone else. PJ was able to justify Liv Tyler even being in this installment, but no need for Cate.  Orlando has the glare, Viggo is cool.

"monious","10","0","0","18 December 2002"," Disappointing
","*** WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>I just saw the midnight showing of The Two Towers, and I must say, I was rather disappointed.  I really liked Fellowship of the Ring, I gave it a 10/10. And that rating didn't change even after repeated readings of the book.  The parts that I thought they messed up were the parts that they deviated from the book, and if I thought they were a minor nuisance in FOTR, man were they huge in TTT. Although I can't speak for those who have never read the books (I've read all three several times, and also other Tolkien works such as ""The Silmarillion""), for me at least, it was a poor redesign of the schemes of the book.<br/><br/>TTT deviates from the book in three majors ways.  First is the actions and character of Theoden, King of Rohan. Second is the same for Faramir, Captain of Gondor. The third is, pretty much every major detail of the sequence of events between when Wormtongue is cast aside to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Theoden, in the book, after he is rid of the counsel of Wormtongue, is a brave, courageous King. Instead, in the movie he is belittled to a frightened King who cannot even go to war without constant nudging from Aragorn.<br/><br/>Faramir is a noble man, learned of books and wise, as well as strong in war. He is a character who valiantly and nobly declines to accept the use of the Ring, without some weird plot involving a siege of Osgiliath and a out of context speech by Sam to change his mind. Faramir was one of my favorite characters in the books, but in the movie he is less a man than Boromir. What gives?<br/><br/>And why is it that his army of Riders, six thousand strong in the book, is only a handful in this movie?  What's the point? Where did those Elves come from to help defend Helm's Deep? Why do the Ents not rouse, until they are ""deceived"" by Pippin? And why, why did Frodo have to show the Ring to the Nazgul? What happened to the meeting of the Kings and Saruman?<br/><br/>To me, it seems like these things were changed for the sake of changing them. To me, they ruin the character relationships that are developed and the plot that is given by Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings is a tale of many heroes, gathered together in Courage and Strength even under despair. Yet the movie seems to put all the burden on Aragorn, Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam, and leave everyone else as puppets of their situation. In many ways, the Lord of the Rings is a tale of the power of the Gift of Men: That they CAN change the Music of the Ainur, that they CAN shape their fate. In that way, I would say that the added scenes involving Elrond and Arwen were good; They deal more directly with this topic than any in the book. But every other scene that was modified seems to destroy the basic fabric that shapes this world for the sake of making the movie maybe just a little bit more exciting for the uneducated.<br/><br/>After all this, it is still a well made movie with great Cinematography and great actions scenes. The acting is well done, and there are many wonderful scenes. However, as someone who loves the books and feels that it is better, I can't give this movie higher than 8 out of 10, simply because I feel that the magic of the world of Middle-Earth was not well presented."

Gollum/Smeagol steals the whole show, with eyes that look more real than those on the humans. I hear there's a Best Supporting Actor campaign to Andy Serkis for his voice work and body work on Gollum, and while I first thought that ridiculous, they've got my vote. I mean...damn.

This film is supposedly much darker than the fellowship of the ring, but when i went to see the midnight premiere, there were twice as many jokes in TTT than FOTR.  There are some genuinely humurous jokes but many were not and were so belabored that it demoted the seriousness of the situation, which was the near destruction of the Rohan people.<br/><br/> 2.  I already knew that Haldir was showing up at Helms deep and thought it was a cool idea and didnt go stark raving mad over the change of the story. But the character development was paper thin for haldir which in turn didn't make me care about his death.  In Fact, you only see him fight in one scene, and thats when he is killed a split second later, so he doesn't seem like such a great elven warrior.  And what happened to the Elves after the battle of helms deep?, nothing was shown of them, or even of people coming out of the Deep.<br/><br/> 3. I liked how the movie emphasized the despair and desperation of the Rohan people by making young kids go into battle, but you never see any of these kids die or fight, or even see any dead kids lying around.  This might have been because it then wouldve given the film an ""R"" rating'<br/><br/>4.  Theres a certain feeling that wasn't there that existed in the fellowship, and that was flow, things flowed well in that story, but that is because there is only one story, not 3 individual ones, and an occasional 4(arwen flashbacks). But even then, the story could have flowed better. Breaking up the battle of helms deep was a bad idea in my opinion, it just isn't suppose to be done and ruins the mood.  I was on the edge of my seat when the Defenders had bows ready and and the Uruk Hai stomped the ground. But then it breaks to another story a few minutes later, then brings us back to the battle, then back to another story and so on...<br/><br/> I know it is easy to criticize and that some do not agree.  It could be because i was watching this film in a packed theatre starting at midnight, when the two previous nights i got 7 hours of sleep total and sitting next to some wierd obsessed fan that smelled bad and kept muttering lines of the book to herself and laughing obnoxiously at every joke and screaming during the battle scenes that brought me to write down what i believed was wrong with the film...<br/><br/> But 10/10 to Peter Jackson and the CAst and im anxiously looking forward to a ROTK trailer that will hopefully come out later with the TTT as was the case with FOTR.<br/><br/> Excellent Movie...but read the book too, as this film strayed quite a bit away from the book"

"WilliamSG","6","0","0","18 December 2002"," Massively disappointing...(minor spoilers for this aged story)
","So, the sequel is upon us. And.... it's not as sizzling as the first. Peter Jackson seems to have taken far too many liberties with this movie and turned it into a more generic Hollywood romp. You could almost tell from the outset that this movie was nowhere near the quality of the first. Something about how it starts... I can't quite put my finger on it...but if you compare the wonderful start of 'Fellowship' to the beginning of 'Towers', you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>There are so very many things wrong with this movie, but, ironically, Smeagol was NOT the worst part, despite being completely CGI. Infact, I would go so far as to say he was the BEST part of the movie. His torment is wonderfully portrayed, and the fact that he was CGI'd did not irritate like a certain CGI Star Wars character. Also, credit is due to the animators for making the human/CGI interaction of Frodo and Smeagol VERY impressive. I looked forward to the Smeagol scenes the most. (Although...there was ONE torment scene I disliked where they shot it in 'takes' - cutting back between Smeagol and his alter ego. It felt wrong in this kind of movie, but then again...a lot of things felt wrong)<br/><br/>Where was the acting in the rest of the movie? There was hardly any. I can't recall a single scene where there was any standout actor. The beginning of the movie was remarkably slow and even my wife - a bigger Tolkien fan than myself - shifted uncomfortably in her seat after almost ninety minutes.<br/><br/>
Oh...and Gimli. Why? Why did they do this? Why did EVERY scene with Gimli have to be one of comic relief? It felt like a bad Disney movie. Once or twice would have been too much, but EVERY scene? <br/><br/>The action too, felt far less orchestrated than it did in the first movie. Again, Jackon took more liberties with the way the scenes played out. Legolas now surfs down stairs on a shield. Somehow this is the sort of thing I expect from a Bond movie...<br/><br/>But, and rather cleverly I might add, - Jackson ends the movie on a high, and the masses will love it. In that respect, this movie reminds me of 'The Sixth Sense.' A quick summary of the 'Sixth Sense' would be: ""zzzz....zzzzzzz.....zzzzzzz.....(insert clever ending here)""<br/><br/>Viewer walks out of 'Sixth Sense' with that 'clever-ending-taste' in his mouth and gives the movie a TEN out of TEN! ""Amazing! Fantastic!"" -he screams, forgetting all about the tedium he had to endure to see said ending.<br/><br/>In much the same way, the end of 'Two Towers' leaves the same feeling in one's mouth. Undeniably an epic ending. (forgetting about the constant Gimli comic-relief throughout it) So that's the movie for you really. Nothing particularly memorable other than a very swish looking Smeagol, and an epic ending. I can't really think of anything else memorable about the movie, except for Treebeard. (- and some very dodgy blue-screen use)<br/><br/>
I'd (almost) go so far as to say just walk in for the end twenty or so minutes, but judging by the cheers at the beginning and end of the movie last night, no-one will listen to me anyway. That sweet taste at the end won everyone over.<br/><br/>Ah well..at least I tried.."

I need to see it a few more times to decide if I like this one better than I like FOTR. <br/><br/>However, it's certainly spectacular, with scenes after scenes that would take your breath away. Personally, I don't mind as much the deviations made by PJ, such as much more ambiguous Faramir. They certainly make better drama. The acting all around are powerful, and the interplay between Aragorn and Eowyn, King Theoden and Gandalf and later Aragorn, Sam and Frodo, Frodo and Gollum, Faramir and Frodo/Sam, and so on all come out seamlessly and naturally. <br/><br/>Oh yes, Gollum although not perfect (there's one or two incidences I felt he's not totally seamlessly fit into the background) is the most amazing CGI character ever. Hats off to Mr. Serkis, PJ and the CGI team! By the way, the change of Gollum, from a menace to a helper back to a scheming snick, came through logically.

Gimli, the dwarf, eases the audience with his hilarious misfortunes and dialogue. The audience is also introduced in-depth to the divided character of Gollum and his desperate desire for the ring.<br/><br/>The Two Towers transports the audience around Middle-Earth, and introduces us to new places like Rohan and Faragorn Forest. Although the movie isn't as mystical as FOTR, the awe at the power of Isengard comes through. The movie starts out a bit slow, but makes it all up in the end, with the great battle of Helm's Deep and the Final March of the Ents at Isengard.<br/><br/>Is the movie better than FOTR? It certainly isn't worse. TTT has more in the way of large-scale battles and military movement while the FOTR has a smaller, more person-to-person atmosphere.

","I'm going to disagree with most of you, but I thought the first FotR was a better movie.  But first my praise: Gollum... absolutely completely perfect. I have never seen a character adaptation from a book to movie that was not only a perfect rendition, but also the improved character.  As with FotR, the scenery was incredible.  The Ents were intense, and they did a good job on the sacking of Isenguard.  The battle at Helms Deep.... wow. Now for my criticisms: Way too much time wasted on the ride from Edoras to Helms deep.  Since when was Théoden King such a wuss. Aragorn's wounding was another waste of time (not to mention a very bad edit). Don't get me started about Faramir... he was supposed to be above temptation.  The battle between Gandalf and the Balrog... to short (got to extend something for the DVD sales). I can understand some of Jacksons departure from Tolkien, but, unlike in FotR, they detracted from the story.  If Jackson followed the book closer the movie would of been shorter, and in my opinion, a bit better.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie. I will see it again, and buy the DVD.  Truthfully it was the best movie since FotR, but I did leave the theater a bit disappointed. (I'm sure it had a lot to do with the smelly nerd that was sitting next to me.

"Juansmith","9","0","0","18 December 2002"," Wow... Just one or two flaws though.
","(minor spoilers herein) Having read the series multiple times, I thought the transition to screen was done fairly smoothly for both of the films so far. Naturally some elements were changed for better storytelling, but the overall epic seemed untouched. As for the second chapter in the trilogy, let me say this: The entire last hour is probably one of the most well done battle sequences I have ever seen. <br/><br/>That having been said, here was the only problem. Remember the original Star Wars trilogy, where three or four ministories would be going on at once, and every five minutes or so the scene would change to give us an update about what was happening with each one? Well, Jackson tries to duplicate this, with this undeniable problem: When Lucas cut between scenes, each one maintained roughly the same intensity level at any given time, so consequently the cuts didn't detract from the drama. In this case, particularly as Merry and Pippin's story goes, the intensity doesn't reach a sufficient level for ""good cuts"" until near the end. In the meantime, the dramatic battle sequence just seems prone to frequent interruptions, leaving the audience wondering... Okay... When do we get back to Helm's Deep?<br/><br/>Despite this, it all tied up wonderfully. The ending, which was altered slightly from the original book, seems to add to the suspense they try to build for ""Return of the King"", so it works well.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the more surprising standout characters is Gollum. Ever since the days of Jarjar Binks, we've all been dreading the next computergenerated monstrosity that would grace our screens. While Gollum does get a tremendously increased number of lines from the previous movie, I'd have to say I was never even once annoyed by him. In fact, a rather schizophrenic exchange between himself... and himself... Is definitely one of the funnier moments in the film. Also, his computer generated movements and look is virtually flawless. Andy Serkis has proven to be a very versatile actor both in the motion capture that was used to create the character, and in the very memorable voice to go with it. I would not be at all surprised if this entirely ""fake"" character sets a new precedent by becoming the first of his kind to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Really... He was THAT believable.<br/><br/>So as they said of ""Empire"", it was far more expansive than the original, and definitely worth your time. Enjoy the show."
"mysteri","9","0","0","18 December 2002"," Wow, what a great film!
","My one and only disappointment of this film is the absence of new music.  My friends have argued that this movie is just the second installment of a longer series, and I agree, but I felt that the first movie's music was new and exciting.  The music in ""Fellowship"" enhanced the experience, drawing out strong emotions in the audience.  I feel the music was ""recycled"" in The Two Towers, and it did not have the same effect.  <br/><br/>Other than that, I think Peter Jackson did a wonderful job, again.  Go see it.  Even if you're not a Tolkien fan, the experience alone is astounding! The CGI is even impressive, and most films cannot quite grasp the importance of good CGI.  Take, for example, the newest Bond flick - the CGI was laughable, and took something from the movie.  Jackson, however, employs an incredible use of technology and the movie flows quite smoothly.  <br/><br/>
I have nothing else to say.  The movie speaks for itself. <br/><br/>
I give ""The Two Towers"" a solid 9 out of 10."

","Really the average earth humans' sensibilities about films these days astounds me. Am I the ONLY one who was miserably bored to death with this hollow nonsense? Oh, no question Jackson does a magnificnt job with the VISUALS and the camera-work, and I'm not denigrating his ability to direct actors either. Nor am I denigrating JRR Tolkiens fine novels. What I am complaining about is a series of films that could very well be retitled ""Stilted Dialogue: the epic miniseries"" For one thing I NEVER thought a straight (or even semi-straight) adapation of Tolkien's books would necessarily make a great film. The story is too spread out, complex, filled with beautiful language and prose, landscapes and characters but that doesn't necessarily translate well in the world of film. Especially with concepts and idea's we've seen explored a billion times before (Dragons, talking tree's, wolf-beasts, snarling creature warriors, epic battles of sword wielding army's, never-ending close-ups of characters with concerned wide-eyed face's, including some very annoying and goofy visages) Sheesus Chriist I was in complete agony.  I mean COME ON it's time for something NEW and different! Doesn't ANYBODY out there have the ability to write something with the intelligence and ambition of Tolkien yet with FRESH new idea's? What is so damned fascinating about sitting through 3 hours of ultra-stilted dialogue and concerned facial expressions?"

They are such a central part of the books that I simply can't comprehend how they could have missed even one tiny song. Okay, Gollum gets to sing a bit, but not one bards tale in three hours.<br/><br/>As so many others have noted, the battle of Helms Deep kept us on the edge of our seats even though we all know what the outcome is. Frightfully thrilling, I must say.<br/><br/>Trees do not grow that tall, though. The oliphants and the wolves disappointed me. There is no doubt in my mind, that the oliphants Sam is so fascinated with must have been elephants as we all know them. The awe with which he looks at them is only funny if indeed they were. And the wolves. Oh boy. They looked like overgrown steel wool fured hyena. Also, albeit a minor glitch, the animation was unnatural at times, revealing computer animated characters.<br/><br/>Still, this is difficult to top. How on Earth are they going to make Return of The King parallel this in excellence? Half of the story there is a slow descent to normal life in the Shire which easily comes to look like an anticlimax in a hard paced movie. I simply can't wait."

"sarah_se1","10","0","0","17 December 2002"," Wow, absolutely fantastic
","I was lucky enough to win a pair of tickets to see a premiere showing of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". Needless to say I was pretty excited because for as long as I can remember I've been a great admirer of Tolkien and huge fan of the first Lord of the Rings film. I wasn't disappointed with 'The Two Towers'. Peter Jackson draws you into the film with the opening score, and leaves you breathless until the very end. The story line picks up where Jackson left off - a continuation of the first rather than another movie altogether. (I'm going to reveal the starting plot so please don't read ahead if you don't want to know.)<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin have managed to escape from the Orks that have held them capture, only to run into even more interesting creatures in the woods: Ents, trees that can move and speak. <br/><br/>Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli are trying to rescue Merry and Pippin when they run into someone they didn't expect, Gandalf - back and now a white wizard, the highest a wizard can go. After being assured of the two young hobbits' safety, they travel to the kingdom of Rohan where Saruman holds the King in an evil spell. After freeing the king they must prepare for Saruman's army, which sole purpose is to destroy the world of men. The Battle of Helm's Deep (which can be quite disturbing at points, not for the very young or those who can't handle that kind of thing) decides the winner. (Peter Jackson spent over a month filming this scene and all that time was not wasted - it was a fantastic scene, well thought out and captivating.)<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam are trying to reach Mordor but find themselves lost. After an encounter with the creature Gollum, who at one point possessed the ring and maddingly wants it back, Frodo (who is beginning to feel the true weight of the ring) decides to let Gollum guide them. Gollum wasn't much different from a hobbit before he possessed the ring, and was called Smeagol. In the movie 'The Two Towers' you are able to see the struggle that takes place within Gollum. Smeagol represents the good left inside of him, and Gollum the bad. These scenes were some of my favourites - they were wonderfully shot and really took the film to another level. <br/><br/>And of course we can't forget the lovely elvish and thus immortal Arwen, who is faced with the choice of staying with her beloved Aragorn or leaving forever with her people; there's the nephew of King Theoden, the strong and noble Eomer who will do anything for Rohan, and his equally strong and lovely sister Eowyn who develops feelings for Aragorn; and lastly Faramir, the brother of the late Boromir, now Captain to Gondor.<br/><br/>
This movie didn't feel like a movie. I honestly felt as though I had been pulled into the screen in the theatre. It was fantasticly shot, preformed, and directed. 'The Two Towers' is the classic tale of good against evil. It is perfectly carried through. There was not a moment I didn't savour - I didn't want this film to end and will be seeing it again in theatres the next chance I get. If anything, I think I enjoyed this film more than the first. And although I understand this movie isn't for everyone, I still highly recommend it to all. I give it a 9 out of 10."

","I can say without any morale reprehension to rush out and see The Two Towers.  While comparing it to Fellowship would be nearly impossible. The way I see it these films are two different types, while Fellowship was character development with enough action to keep you excited, Towers is action with enough character development to keep you caring.  It's hard to say which is better because I feel that I have reached the middle part of one fantastic nine hour epic film, and you don't find people saying what third of a movie they liked best.  The acting in Two Towers is top notch, as it was to be expected. But the true stand out wasn't who you would have expected, it was Gollum.  If ever a CGI character deserved an Academy award or at least a nomination, it is Gollum.  The CGI is so beleivable its creepy and the acting really lets you see whats going on inside of his head.  This was a difficult job you could tell but Serkis pulled it off with style.  The action will keep you begging for more as Jackson never ceases to amaze you with what he can do with the camera.  So go now, stop reading and then wait a year until you can watch the extended edition in preparation for Return of the King"

","After seeing LOTR The Two Towers I only regret that it takes another year to see the final ending of this epic saga. Of course, having read the book several times, I know how it will end, but I'm very curious how Peter Jackson will adapt it to the screen. Judging by this second installment I imagine it will also be grand in every aspect. Watching TTT was an amazing experience with many highlights. First of all there is of course the creature Gollum, which is 'made' absolutely astonishing. Other highlights include the battle at Helms Deep as well as the fight between Gandalf the Grey and the Balrog. For the comic-relief this movie relies on excellent one-liners from Gimli. There are however also some parts that worked less for me. Personally I was not fond of the side-plot with Treebeard in the book and I don't care for it much in the movie. However, it is essential to the story, so who am I to complain. What I also did not enjoy was talking orcs (can't remember them as being whiners...) and can somebody explain to me what the deal is with the immortality of Elves?<br/><br/>All these little things aside, Peter Jackson created another masterpiece in which we follow the trail of three separate groups in their quest against Mordor and survival of Mankind and Middle Earth. Jackson deemed it unnecessary to recap the stories from the first movie. Rightfully so, I would say, because if you have not seen The Fellowship there is no real point in watching The Two Towers. There is some reference to some loose ends The Fellowship left (what happened to Gandalf, who is Gollum etc), but never too much. Anybody who enjoyed the Fellowship will also enjoy The Two Towers. The movie did not feel like three hours and leaves the audience craving for more. And that is good news. I wonder how long people will let the cliffhanger be unsolved. Therefor there is a kind request to everybody who already knows how the book ends: don't talk about it in public, because some people don't want to know yet... Bring on 'Return of the King'!"

","If you liked or loved Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (hereafter: FOTR) you'll most likely be very satisfied with The Two Towers (hereafter: TTT).  I was able to catch an advanced screening and I must say that I was quite impressed with the second installment of this trilogy.  I must confess that while I've read the books (once in elementary school and again about a year ago), I'm not a devote to the written version. The tone and pacing of TTT is much different than that of FOTR, it's faster, darker, and a bit more confusing.  Now by confusing, it's not as if you ever lose track of what's going on, but rather, since it is told by inter-cutting the 3 main story lines it's harder to relate the story lines to one another than I remember it being in the book. It helps keep the momentum of the movie moving along, but I felt as if it hindered the momentum of the individual storylines. Mostlikely a catch-22, so I suppose there's no getting around it.<br/><br/>The movie does not stand alone, if you're going to see it, but haven't seen the 1st one or read the books, do yourself a favor and spend the $4 to rent the movie or $7 to buy the book.  Without this prior info you'll struggle to figure out who these people are and/or what their motivations are.<br/><br/>Ok, to the stuff you want to know.  The battle at Helms Deep is massive and amazing.  Gollum is everything you could hope to get from a CGI character and more, not perfect, but probably as perfect as can be at this point. The Ents, to me at least were a bit disappointing, both in their rendering on screen and how their story was developed.  If anything is slighted in the movie it's the development of the Ent characters.<br/><br/>Bottom line, a very good movie, probably in line with FOTR (although having just seen the extended version, which I see as a significant improvement of FOTR, I might be overvaluing it somewhat).  TTT will also, no doubt, benefit greatly from an extended treatment.  The doom and danger in TTT is palpable and the movie rarely disappoints.  I'm sure that repeated viewings will only serve to improve the movie, as it is a lot of visual and informational material to ingest in one sitting.  I'd rate it at 8.5 (I'd rate FOTR a 9.0 and FOTR extended version a 9.5 or higher), but again with another viewing or two, I'd probably like the movie even more.  Go see it now, er...as soon as you can, despite my soft-selling it, you won't be disappointed! After all, if I can enjoy it sitting in a cramped screening room with a head and chest cold and little sleep, I can only imagine that in a real theater in good health you'll enjoy it that much more.  I don't want to add to the hype, but this is a damn nice movie."

","Wow, what can I say ... I am still speechless and awed from such a breathtaking film. Let me start off by saying that I believe Two Towers was a difficult book to adapt because of the break of the fellowship. The jump from Frodo to Sam, to the three hunters and Gandalf, to Merry and Pippin, as well as the introduction to many other characters made the flow of the film very unorthodox. We are so used to seeing film's introduce the plot and characters, show how characters grow, see them run into conflict and see how it all ends ... and so even when I knew that Two Towers could not flow in that manner, it still took me some time getting used to the hopping around. At first, it made me feel quite uncomfortable, but now I have a growing appreciation for Peter Jackson's choice of storytelling. I hope those who watch it can keep that in consideration; though I fear that critics will not keep that in mind when they see the film.<br/><br/>I am most impressed with the Battle at Helm's Deep. It was absolutely stunning, and one of the best battle sequences I have ever seen on film. Everything from the incredible CGI, the amazing choreographed action sequences, the costumes and settings (working under the rain sequence must have been treacherous), to Gimli's innocent comic relief, was so wonderfully done. For every second of the 45 minute scene I was at the edge of my seat, with my hands clenched and my eyes widened, hoping and rooting for the victory of the men and elves, even when I knew how it would end.<br/><br/>
Next, I would like to say that Andy Serkis was magnificent. Not only did he capture the movement of Gollum, but he also mastered Gollum's voice and his multi-personality disorder.<br/><br/>In fact, all the actors did a exceptional job. The audience was able to see the characters changing, growing and slowly developing into what they are fated to be in the end. Elijah Wood was especially marvelous.<br/><br/>
Overall, Two Towers was remarkable and a wonderful second addition to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Can't wait to see what ROTK is going to be like."

It has no beginning story, and no end story, but is simply the middle chapter, and like most middle chapters, it's darker, a LOT darker than the first film with a lot more action and detail. (Gimli, in my opinion, steals the show with his humor!) If you are waiting for a long exposition like at the beginning of The Fellowship of the Ring, it comes half way through!<br/><br/>The special effects, well, let's just say that Gollum is the best looking CGI character to ever hit the big screen and wait until you see Treebeard and the Ents!<br/><br/>The battle of Helm's Deep, involving thousands of Uru-Kai warriors, is one of the most amazing action sequences ever to be put on film!<br/><br/>This film, like the last one, ends on a cliffhanger with all of the characters facing new dangers. And I won't spoil any of it for those looking forward to it!<br/><br/>It looks like once again, Peter Jackson is indeed the Kiwi George Lucas!!<br/><br/>Great action, cinematography, acting, and direction make this by far the BEST film of 2002!<br/><br/>The Two Towers is quite possibly one of the best sequels to ever hit cinemas!<br/><br/>Harry Potter, eat your heart out, The Two Towers will show the world, once again, who is the top fantasy film series!!!<br/><br/>If an 10+ rating were possible I would definitely give The Two Towers one!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Expect, once again, massive box office returns , and several Oscar nominations next year for The Two Towers!<br/><br/>PRE-ORDER YOUR TICKETS FOR THE TWO TOWERS NOW, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>A 10 on a scale of 1-10."

","I just saw ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" at a preview screening, and it was every bit as good as I expected it to be.  The technical elements are cutting edge, and as in ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" perfect examples of special effects expertly used in the service of the story.  This film will leave you breathless in places, awestruck and bowled-over with the fast-paced action and excitement.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" is certainly darker and grittier than the first film-- as it should be.<br/><br/>Obviously, the question with this new Peter Jackson film, as with the last, is: Is it true to the book?  Yes, it captures the spirit of Tolkien's writing, and in many places surpasses the dramatic tension of the books. Does it stray from Tolkien's plot: Yes, to a degree.  To those that love the books, the differences will be obvious-- and maybe a little jarring-- but once you weigh the changes against the dramatic & visual impact the changes make, you reach the conclusion that these were the right choices for the movie.  After all, this is the movie, not the book.  Don't go expecting to ""see the book,"" with every little plot detail and line of dialogue on the screen verbatim.  It doesn't work that way.  What Jackson has again given us is his visual interpretation of the spirit of Tolkien's Middle Earth, and the results are grand, epic, stunning, literate, surprising, vivid and unforgettable.  A vastly entertaining film.  Sadly, we now just have to wait another year to see the end of the story-- but that film, like this one, will surely be worth the wait."

While riffing on Tolkien's basic themes (evil is bad; benevolence is good), it throws us into wild orc fracases (or would that be fricassees?), gruelling identity-quests (both Frodo and the brilliantly-animated Gollum go quite ringy-dingy) and seemingly endless money-shots for the New Zealand Tourism Bureau.  While there are occasional lapses of logic for the characters (Aragorn: ""Oh, let's just let that evil Wormtongue escape so he can assist the significantly more evil Saruman in attacking us!"") and the writers (""Oh, let's just end the movie on a relatively dull note!""), the overall aura is magical and mysterious.  Not nearly enough Christopher Lee here, and the Elvish Overdubbing -- though beautiful -- is sandwiched in pretty awkwardly, but the ""peripheral hobbits"" are all terrific, the Elf and the Dwarf arouse and amuse appropriately, and Théoden's niece and those wonderful Ents are welcome in my garden absolutely"

","Who could ever imagine that the audience in Indonesia would be the first to watch The Two Towers? No one, including me. I have no idea why, maybe by mistake, maybe on purpose, it played this weekend on screen in one theater in Bandung, Indonesia. Walking around the shopping mall, I noticed that 3 movies were on for the nightmovie: Harry Potter, The Chamber of secrets, Treasure Planet and yes, The Two Towers. Impressive...hardly any words for this movie. Fans of Tolkien can be satisfied, again, a great masterpiece has reached the theaters around the world. In number 2 of the trilogy, the tension and excitement builds up. The separate journeys of Frodo & Sam, their friends preparing for battle, never fighting for the attention of the watcher. The characters come out better in this movie, although I still miss the singing as described in the books of Tolkien. Hobbits like to sing, so why is this not an important part of the movie? maybe cause the actors can't sing? The new introduced caracters are not to many, and it feels as if you know everyone personally. The producers as well as the actors of ""The Lord of the Rings"" do a magic job. The armies are impressive, and you feel almost emotionally connected with the forces who try to win over evil. Actually, there are no words to describe what is happening here. After years of watching movies, this is the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave the theater...... I think in general, The Two Towers is slightly better than ""fellowship of the ring"" and I already voted for 10 points there. Please, can I give 10+ this time?"

"rodmans545","10","0","0","15 April 2003"," Masterful rendition of Tolkien's vision
","In 1994, when Houghton Mifflin Company published a single copy of The Lord of The Rings, Douglas A. Anderson wrote a 'revised note to the text' making it clear that J. R. R. Tolkien's famous epic novel was 'often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes'. The three volumes Anderson referred to, The Fellowship of The Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of The King, were initially developed by the original publishers for purposes of cutting down on the cost of printing (David Colbert, The Magical Worlds of The Lord of The Rings). According to Colbert it was the publishers who first came up with the title The Two Towers for the second volume. Given his fascination with and penchant for referring to dozens of important towers within the novel, Tolkien himself wasn't sure which two towers were in fact denoted by the title and was therefore initially unconvinced by the title itself. However Tolkien eventually conceded and thus the myth of the trilogy of The Lord of The Rings was born.<br/><br/>All of this background is not for want when reviewing Peter Jackson's film version of The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers. In spite of following the traditional lead of breaking the story up into three films, he has essentially remained faithful to the text, as faithful as any movie director can be expected to when trying to adapt such an epic to the big screen, by maintaining a continuous uninterrupted flow from the first film to the second. The Two Towers immediately picks up right where the Fellowship of The Ring leaves off and we are again treated to a movie masterpiece so entrancing and perfectly paced. The Two Towers is filled with rich three-dimensional characters and plotlines, beautiful performances, and numerous battle scenes amidst breathtaking landscapes. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue in their quest to bring the one ring to Mordor and destroy it in the very fires from which it was forged, while the rest of the fellowship is split up into several factions in an effort to find their lost friends and take up the fight against the armies of the Dark Lord Sauron and the traitorous Saruman. New characters are introduced, notably the Ents, Grima Wormtongue, King Theodon and the creature Gollum.<br/><br/>The film is undoubtedly mythical, just as Tolkien had intended, but it also more than adequately explores many of the difficult problems and questions Tolkien had examined during his lifetime; the inevitable encroachment of industrialization, and its impact on modern human society; the quest by some for unfettered power over all races; the onslaught of war in order to both provoke and quell that quest; the longing by others for peace and pastoral tranquility; and the endless forging and breaking up of alliances between the different races to achieve or defeat these varying quests. In many ways Gollum's character is a microcosm of these competing interests, providing much of the film's most vivid and provocative moments and leaving the audience with much to ponder.<br/><br/>It is perhaps to their considerable credit and understanding of today's moviegoers that Jackson and his collaborators did not make one nine hour film but don't be surprised when the movie ends and the credits roll if instead you don't find yourself wishing they had."

Every shot is beyond impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.<br/><br/>And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, precious.

","Very similar feeling to the first film.  Certainly everyone can admire the effort and hard work that must have gone into making these three films.  I have never read the books and probably never will, so I can't comment on whether the original material was worthy of praise, but as films, they are poor.<br/><br/>I can only assume, by the large amount of hysterical praise both films have received, that people decide before even watching the film, that it is great or that audiences just wish to see special FX.<br/><br/>Just like the first movie, there's lots of little sub plots going on, but for what reason, none of the external characters seem to have any purpose or add anything to the story.  The complete mess of a story is virtually non-existent and by the end you realise after all the pompous procrastination you have a very simple battle sequence.  What were the first 2 hours about  ?<br/><br/>The biggest crime of this film is that you don't care about any of the characters, nothing is explained really, none of the motivations of any of the characters seem genuine.  In the end, you see that the main cast of characters basically are invincible, so who cares, they're going to win, there is no tension, no edge.<br/><br/>The FX, which seems to be the main reason everyone is watching the film, range from very good to very average.  The laughable tree sequences never really look real or believable.   Parts of the battle sequence were comedic, they were so over-the-top.<br/><br/>The bottom line is really if people were more honest and looked at this film or it predecessor without pre-judging it as a book conversion, they would see that although there's lots of FX and lot's of things going on, the film is a muddled mess and not really worthy of such high praise."

The love of the ents for Merry and Pippen and the love of Faramir for Frodo. The love of Gimli for Legolas. He tried to make it about Arwen and Aragorn because he seems to think that we can't see men love each other and not be gay. He really beat the horse to hamberger.<br/><br/>Most of all he ended both of the stories in the middle. He added a hour and a half of garbage in the middle and left off all the meat at the end.<br/><br/>
All in all I give this moive a 4/10. If he hadn't changed Faramir's character and had spent 1/2 hrs less on the faked love scenes and 1/2 more on the Ents it would have gotten a 8 or a 9. This movie suffers the unforgivable sin of missed potential."

Granted, the visuals in LOTR: TFOTR was unlike anything anyone had seen before and it was worth double the price of admission just for that, but honestly, I just couldn't get interested in the story.  I do have to say that Christopher Lee's presence was awe-inspiring and the sets were breath-taking.  I felt that ,visually, I was taken to levels I had never even imagined.<br/><br/>But I felt that this installment didn't offer anything new.  It seemed to only draw out TFOTR's worst flaw--endless exposition.  This installment looked to me like a 3-hour montage.  I didn't find anything particularly memorable, except the excellent CGI of the creepy-crawly dude (sorry, I didn't quite catch the name).  It wasn't that there was bad acting--it was more like there was no acting, or rather, no opportunity to act.  It seemed like everyone was either just doing a lot of staring ""out somewhere"" because the odds were so insurmountable, or that they were scuffling about in groups of twos or threes headed ""just over the other side of that tall hill or mountain"".<br/><br/>Kudos to the LOTR movies for staying faithful to the books, but as a non-fan, (yes, I know, I am probably blaspheming) it all seemed rather tedious and silly.  I thought it was bad enough that TFOTR ended with the Fellowship being chased by a crap-load of Orks (sp?) who are easier to kill than the buffalo in a particularly memorable episode of the Simpsons.   I mean, jeez!  Is this the world's most inefficient army or what?!?!  These Orks are easier to kill than the ""middle-eastern"" armies in an early Schwartzeneggar or Stallone movie.  There is just no element of danger. Everything seems just to gosh-darned easy.   TTT ends with a good-guy army of 300 (and eventually some elves) taking on 10,000 Orks.

I'm sure there is some perfectly good, unbelievable reason why other evil rings cannot be made, but I am frankly past caring, because it has been six hours now, and I am really tired of it all.<br/><br/>Especially wearying is the relentless epic-speak employed by almost everyone in the movie, which has made me sick of hearing the preposition ""of."" These people could never say something like, ""We need to go through the Lincoln Tunnel"" or ""We'll have to cross the Golden Gate Bridge."" They would have to say, ""We must pass through the Tunnel of Lincoln"" or ""We must cross over the Bridge of the Gate of Gold."" And even when they say something that might look like normal dialogue when written on paper, the characters utter all their lines gravely and ponderously, as if everything they say is of the deepest significance.<br/><br/>An exception to this is Sam, Frodo's companion. He actually talks normally. As a result, he became my favorite character, the one I most wanted to hear from. And when he made his speech about the goodness of the world being worth fighting for, it had more effect on me than anything else said in the movie, because it was spoken naturally. Furthermore, Sam's face is easier to take than Frodo's look of angelic innocence. I wish Sam had the ring, and one of the other hobbits were his sidekick, leaving Frodo out of the story altogether."

After I saw the Two Towers I said to myself ""CGI can do anything now."" Besides the way he looked Andy Serkis was great as the voice of Gollum. I personally thought he deserved a nomination for best supporting actor. Their two things that ticked me off a little though, one was how Gandalf was not in the movie nearly as much as he should have been. He kinda just came and left. I read the books and I was hoping that Gandalf would be shown gathering the Rohirrim riders. Also something else that confused me in the movies is that, at the battle of Helm's deep elves show up?? That never happened in the book either but I guess their are things that are needed to be changed for a movie. Anyways besides those two things the movie was phenomenal. Peter Jackson did the best job anybody could do on a movie like this and it defiantly deserved it's nomination for best picture. The battle for Helm's deep was truly breathtaking to watch.

"drystyx","10","2","5","18 April 2006"," an Odyssey of three
","Like most good flower children, I read the trilogy, but I cheated and read the Similrilian first, which kind of gives the whole picture. First, to rate the book, because the movie does try to remain extremely loyal to the book, and in fact the director in all three movies manages to convey each character's emotions much better than JRR did, and JRR used a lot of words-three big books. Tokien was not the genius some say, but the cult that followed was of genius. Now the movie. In this episode, there is much adventure, but it is the odyssey of the three characters-Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum, that really holds your interest, much as the Bridge on the River Kwai holds the children in us in interest with Hawkins, Holden, and the other guy trekking through the jungle. Likewise, the scenes with the interaction of Frodo and Samwise with their enemy-guide Gollum, captivate the viewer. The little bits of humor with characterization, such as when Samwise cooks the rabbit. Gollum responds ""Oooohhhhh, you've ruined it!"" That whole bit is priceless. No wonder why during the 70's everyone dreamed of playing Gollum if the movie ever came out. A role you could literally get your teeth into. A delightfully depraved character. The adventures of Merry and Pippin are also likable and well done, and much like the book. They play a minor role, and it is directed as such. The adventures of the others seems a bit overdone, but then the book was a bit overdone. It makes sense that Gandalf never dies in battle, because in the book he was an equivalent of an angel sent by the gods of JRR's world from the beginning of time. One wonders why he can't actually do more. However, why some smart Uruk Hai doesn't just slice off Aragorn's head from behind is miraculous to say the least, but most audiences are accustomed to such miracles for main characters. The battle scenes have been acclaimed, but they lack reality. Never does Aragorn blink, slip, get something in his eye, in all just don't look for realistic fight scenes, but a more modern choreographed look. The bit where Wormtongue goes head over heels for a very pale, plain king's daughter is the hardest thing to believe. But the actress plays her part well, and in fact its hard for a pale woman to look good without twentieth century make-up. All in all, its hard to find fault with this movie. Quite enjoyable."
"m9c9s","5","2","5","25 February 2005"," Plot Direction Change
","Why did they have a whole sequence where Aragorn is thought to be dead and that dumb elf (or the thought of her) brings him back? Why add something so useless and completely non-Tolkien? Who cares about adding ""touching"" scenes for the superficial walking wallets? Tolkien's books became classic and popular without all that garbage. I don't think Peter Jackson did a horrible job on the trilogy, and in fact, I think he produced a great silver screen interpretation of the series. However, I believe that he really fouled up the middle of this movie. <br/><br/>Its true that the book trilogy does not have much involvement for women, but there is no reason to add it now. It was completely unnecessary to add the whole Arwen romance spin. I don't remember reading it in the books. If it was in the books, then it was so insignificant that I merely forgot it. I only recall Arwen being mentioned in the end when they are wed (in a somewhat political wedding). (I've been told there is more to Arwen in the appendices, but I never read those, and they are appendices for a reason: extra and unimportant) <br/><br/>In fact, they actually cut out some of the only ""romance"" that Tolkien actually put in the story. Faramir and Eowyn spend quite a bit of time together while recovering, and that is where they begin to fall in love. If it was so necessary to have romance in this series, why not emphasize that part? This is probably because it didn't occur until the third book, and some Hollywood money-maker thought it would be better to develop a romance from the beginning to draw people in. <br/><br/>I know this may seem like I'm some Tolkien die-hard who will not like anything but the books, but I'm not. I love when books and movies coincide. However, I HATE when money (instead of artistic integrity) dictates production values. If you want a clearer view of what I mean, read Michael Crichton's The Lost World (sequel to Jurassic Park) and then watch the movie."

In the Fellowship of the Ring, most of Jackson's changes to Tolkien's tale were judicious - to diminish the amazing number of subsidiary characters somewhat (substitute Arwen for Glorfindel), even to cut out long sequences made sense to keep the length of the movie reasonable (no Old Forest) since there really wasn't one minute I would want to cut from what was actually in the movie.<br/><br/>Not so with the Two Towers. Many of the most exciting scenes from the book are gone or altered beyond recognition and in their place are long and (I hate to say it) boring sequences which don't further the plot or anything else.<br/><br/>{spoilers, film and book} <br/><br/>* The book's fight over Merry and Pippin between Sauron's and Saruman's orcs, essential to why the book and the movie is called the Two Towers, is completely gone. <br/><br/>* The unexpected beauty and courage Frodo and Sam according to the book found in Ithilien on the threshold of Mordor are in the film changed to depict violence and power abuse. Faramir's role in the movie is instead a quick and superfluous recap of Boromir: He wants to use the Ring, but in the end he comes round. <br/><br/>* In the film Frodo here comes face to face with a Nazgul - but if Sauron thus knew the Ring was just outside Mordor, he probably wouldn't march on Minas Tirith, as he (I presume) will do in Return of the King. <br/><br/>* The added scenes include Aragorn being left for dead and dreaming of Arwen, who is being bullied by Elrond into leaving Middle Earth. This seems completely pointless, and I find the added scenes with Arwen annoying to a degree that makes me root for Eowyn as Queen of Gondor. <br/><br/>* Another added scene is Haldir arriving at Helm's Deep with an elf army out of Lorien - this may seem to be a detail, but it changes the story on a fundamental level, so instead of being about Man rising to the challenge it becomes Elf going out with a bang. Also, it contradicts the opening sequence where the voice-over (quite rightly according to the book) states that the defeat of Sauron by Elendil and Gil-galad was ""the *last* alliance of Man and Elf"". <br/><br/>* Another change for the worse is to the Ents. First of all, Fangorn brings the hobbits to Gandalf to ask him what to do. Would the leader of the most ancient species do that? Second the Ents' decision of going to war. In the film, the Entmoot is a joke - it goes on forever because entish is a very slow language (as in the book) but they decide not to do anything (unlike in the book). However, when Fangorn sees the trees felled by orcs (how come he didn't know about that already - he is after all tree-herd of the Forest) he can suddenly give a lot of information in a single shout and in the blink of an eye all the composed Ents are suddenly marching to war. <br/><br/>* Then there is the film's crude exorcist scene with Theoden. That would have been a lot more effective if it had been more subtle. And I sorely missed the dialogue between Theoden, Gandalf and Wormtongue which is among the book's finest. <br/><br/>* Lastly, we see nothing of the book's growing, unlikely friendship between Legolas and Gimli. Instead Gimli is only in the movie as comic relief. A movie needs comedy, but maybe it could have been distributed a little more evenly so a whole character didn't have to be eliminated. <br/><br/>{end of spoilers}<br/><br/>Besides these alterations to the story, I just found the movie long and at times boring. Where its predecessor jumped from one amazing scene to the next and almost seemed too compact (I enjoyed the extended version even more), for all its battle scenes this movie is at times almost at a stand-still.<br/><br/>All that aside, Jackson continues the most vivid and captivating visualisation of Middle Earth ever. Gollum is really spot-on. The viking theme chosen for Rohan works out well. This movie gets 6 from me."
"mdenvee","1","3","10","26 March 2013"," Lord of the most overrated...
","Actually, correction- nearly the most overrated. The 3rd installment clearly holds that title due to its baffling best picture win. But Part 2 is just as awful. Coming from a sci-fi and fantasy fan, I take no pride in my distaste for this movie franchise. And Part 1 was at least ""watchable"". But Part 2 almost succeeded with me walking out of the theatre from boredom. I can state the positive aspects easily- the film has wonderful scenery and special effects. So, if that is the limit of your appreciation of films, then you will love the movie. But all that is left is disappointment and painful boredom. Let's begin with the bad acting- everyone overacts, looking too serious at the wrong times and to whimsical and emotional at equally wrong times. The movie and the director makes the assumption that the audience immediately empathizes with the characters in the movie, without proper build/development. It is quite presumptuous of the director to think that most people are as in love with these characters as he is and the loyal fans of the books. Next, there are way too many close-ups on the faces and eyes of everyone, showing every pimple and every gray hair... do we need this? This also goes double for the orks and bad guys- how disgusting do they have to be? Way overkill- the director tries too hard to exaggerate the grossness. These close-ups are made more painful from the slowness of the filming, which is 3x longer than normal movies- it is like each expression is in slow motion. Combine this with tortuously long dialogue- each character carries on forever it seems expressing thoughts that are ""force-fit"" into Shakespearean prose. This makes the film incredibly ponderous and worsens the overacting. Some further points of disgust for me is the time and focus on the hobbits and making them out to be such a vital part of the good guys winning- newsflash, they are all completely useless and trouble-making and it's annoying and humiliating to have them all play such important roles. Other things that bugged me bigtime is the fact that Gandolf exhibits little or no sorcery or magic in all 3 films! All he does is make speeches and talk in a deep voice and use his staff as a sword- what is so powerful about him? Yawn. Another stupid aspect is the ratio of bad guys to good guys during the battles- it's like 100 to 1. And the bad guys each look 10x bigger and stronger, yet are felled by a single arrow in the shoulder? Please. The worse thing of the 2nd and 3rd films is the introduction of the special effects Gollum creature, whose irritating raspy monologues occupies a large portion of both films- I felt incredibly stupid paying attention to this computer animated creature whine and eat fish. Finally, the whole trilogy is about a silly ring which is utterly ridiculous and especially difficult for the audience to believe as so important and earth shattering. And as others have pointed out, the ring (and hobbit) could have been easily flown via Gandolf's winged creatures to the fire pit in an hour and avoided all the battles and quests and pointlessness. To any who not seen the film- avoid this slow-moving yawn fest at all costs."
"pacothinks","1","3","10","22 June 2003"," should be on the worst 100 list
","This movie had a difficult task; to bridge the gap between the introductory ""Fellowship of the Rings"" and the conclusive ""Return of the Kings.""  But that doesn't take it off the hook for delivering a decent product. Tolkien's trilogy is an incredibly written story with a multitude of intricately woven plots and subplots.  The films have dumbed all of this down into a simple fight between good and evil.  Even the Star Wars trilogy had more depth to the relationship between the warring sides, the hero, Luke, was the son of the biggest, baddest guy of them all.  And in the end we see how affected Darth Vader was by the fight for his son's Jedi power. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" ought to replace ""The Two Towers as number 11 on this list. Every film-goer will acknowledge how difficult it must be to adapt a book, but when the book is so good, the worst thing the movie can do is make the story and experience of it mediocre.  The Two Towers did worse than that; it degraded the struggle for Middle Earth to a few love interests, a wicked spell overturned by a gleaming white savior and two long hours of brutal violence.  Perhaps the brightest part of the movie, or its dimlight, was Gollum's inner struggle between temptation for the ring and desire to do what is right.  The other characters, indeed Mr. Tolkien's story itself, deserve to be developed with as much vigor as Gollum's has been."

"vtah236","7","3","10","3 January 2003"," Poor in places, but an enjoyable 3 hour diversion
","There is something mildly offensive about people in this forum taking issue with `nitpickers'. This attitude is wrong because it takes as its assumption that a work such as The Two Towers is beyond criticism, and how dare anyone find fault with it?<br/><br/>There are two threads to the pro- and anti- TTT arguments: those who compare the film with the book, and those who comment on just the film.<br/><br/>
A body of work such as Tolkien's trilogy is bound to have a plethora of devoted defenders, and their opinions on the divergence of the film plot from the books are valid. The issue I have against this argument is that a faithful reproduction of the books onto film would have been tedious: the council of Elrond from the Fellowship of the Ring was over 10,000 words long!; the battle of the Ents on the film of TTT took place in real-time, whereas in the book it happens in retrospect (arguably, like in the conventions of classical Greek drama, adding to the sense of surprise by having minor characters describe something that has happened in the past).<br/><br/>
Jackson's treatment of TTT is good, but not brilliant. The other breathless reviews of this film reflect an unquestioning readiness to be seduced by overwhelming spectacle. There are nevertheless some elements for which Jackson deserves praise: the rendering of Gollum into a genuinely pitiable character; the beefing up of Faramir's character and role (the antithesis of which works well in the book, but would have made this episode pointless in the film if he hadn't been seen to be a more aggressive character - probably a Jackson decision to darken Gondor's predicament prior to the climactic conflict in the final film); the warg battle and Aragorn's interlude; the suspiciously Arab-looking human allies of Sauron being both mysterious, mute and menacing; Grima Wormtongue's tears when he sees Saruman's army; and my favourite bit - the representation of Fangorn Forest as something mildly sinister and the genuinely quite sweet looking ents.<br/><br/>The battle of Helm's Deep could have been shortened, though my main gripe is with the absolutely pointless introduction of Haldir and his doomed elf stormtroopers. Jackson's adjustments up to this point can be explained away under the protection of dramatic licence i.e. to speed the plot along, but what was the point of the elves? That they didn't appear at this point in the book is a minor point, what is unforgivable is that in an already over-lengthy battle scene, their introduction served absolutely no dramatic purpose. I would even go so far to say that it spoiled this episode: it pointlessly lightened the mood as the forces of darkness were closing in on the refugees and small force of human soldiers. Maybe Jackson has a thing about bows and arrows.<br/><br/>On paper, the climactic battle of Gondor reads better than Helm's Deep, and I am hoping that the film of the Return of The King will be as thrilling as the literary version.<br/><br/>Overall, TTT is a good film, but the Fellowship was better."
"JJStudCty","1","3","10","20 December 2002"," Surprisingly Dull and Uninspired
","If you're not an avowed fan of J.R.R. Tolkein's novels, there's little way around it: ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is a snooze.<br/><br/>By devoting an entire three-hour film to a plotless middle section of the longer ""Lord of the Rings"" story, director Peter Jackson may have satisfied true Hobbit-loving fans, but he has committed an unpardonable sin for other moviegoers. He has created an epic-length movie that is surprisingly dull and uninspired, devoid of any real forward-moving narrative thrust or characters who generate excitement or interest.<br/><br/>There is one notable exception in the CGI-created character of Gollum.  At once humorous and moving, Gollum is the heart of the film, and the screen comes alive whenever he appears.<br/><br/>Alas, that provides only an hour or so of amusement.  That means there are two hours remaining, and for non-devotees who enjoyed ""The Fellowship of the Rings,"" those hours are interminable.  Jackson assumes the audience knows the nuances and relationships presented here, and makes little effort to indoctrinate those of us who aren't sure which son-of-the-nephew-of-the-godson-of-the-wife-of-the-kindgom we should be rooting for.<br/><br/>There is, without doubt, some real cinematic beauty here.  For a few moments, the battle sequences really hold thrall, and the aforementioned Gollum is truly a wonder.  But for those of us who have always wondered what the strong allure of Tolkein's world is for so many, ""The Two Towers"" makes the answer even less clear than last year's ""Fellowship of the Rings."" Undone by stilted dialogue, mostly colorless cinematography, and some unfortunately designed supporting characters who look like rejects from a Rankin-Bass Christmas special circa 1971, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is epic alright. An epic bore."

","Good reviews aside, I sat through an incredibly choppy and badly-paced, eternally long and boring film with no characterization to speak of, one that essentially leaves us at the same place we were at the end of Fellowship of the Ring.  No good character interaction, a CGI-Gollum that is blurry when he moves quickly--in fact, all the CGI is pretty hokey--and a final battle at Helm's Deep which, I just don't get it, it's really not all that special.  Maybe the Extended Director's Edition will rescue this one the way it did Fellowhip.  I hope so, but this film is more like a bad summer movie than it is a sweeping fantasy.  The pacing is terrible, characters disappear, the dialogue is a hollow retread of the first first. Aside from one schizophrenic dialogue between Gollum and himself, we could have skipped this whole film.  Certainly, the meager story on display here could have been told in two hours.  A bore.  A jerky mess.  A shame."

","When I came out from the movies after seeing this one, I was upset and annoyed like mad. I don't think any movie could've achieved that. This was supposed to be an adaptation of the story we used to read when kids. It was supposed to be beautiful and makes us happy. On the first movie they just skipped some really important parts and focused the plot on some random stuff they invented. On this movie, they confirmed they had no intentions on coming back to the regular plot... they stole our story and modified it for the masses. This one is specially bad because it just starts ignoring the important aspects of the story and starts cutting content for no reason. The movie is also extremely short and when it finishes you're wondering, well, what did just happen, did they really end it here? Did they really miss all that? Where are the happy parts where I can rest and smile for a while? All the 3 movies have this issue, everything's wrong all the time... this movie is not an exception, and it shouldn't be like that. This is not Lord of The Rings. Want a good story? Go buy the books, spit at this blasphemy. If you don't know the story, this movie will probably be OK... maybe a 6, the book is a hundred stars out of ten, and they killed it. But this was supposed to be an adaptation, and it's a really bad one. The only reason it has 2 stars is because well... graphics, money. I can't argue that... You can see cool stuff like Ents, but I could've seen that on a 3 minutes video and I would not feel disgusted like I do now only by remembering this thing."

Those films had low budget but they was made very well: dynamic, funnily, with good concept. There is different in cause of LOTR. All ""LOTR"" trilogy is bad but ""Two Towers"" is especially crappy. Cinematography is average, music is horrible (one lame theme in 2,5 h film) and absolutely nothing happens. And when finally Jackson starts with action scenes, he makes them possible worst. Battle scene is chaotic and stupidly edited; I didn't see what going on, where are good people and where are bad. Watching this film is total waste time and money. If you want good fantasy, watch better ""Willow"", ""Neverending Story"", ""Excalibur"" or ""Conan the Barbarian"". If you want good battle scene, watch ""Alexander Nevsky"", ""Seven Samurai"", ""Breaveheart"" or ""Joan of Arc"". 1/10"

"hopealso","4","3","11","22 December 2002"," play that emboldening theme song one more time...
","Perhaps it was the fate of the 'middle film' in the series, but Two Towers suffers from excessive plot and excessive pulls to the heart-strings to match.  It seemed that every character with at least a five minute span of character development eventually got their own democratic turn at dramatic lighting and sappy music with us all supposedly marveling at their remarkable valor as they marched into their next challenge.  After about three or four turns at that and about an hour and a half into the movie, I began wondering when the intermission was going to be.  The problem was, given very little time to get to know these characters, we began to wonder why we should care about their valiant acts or their noble deaths.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that I can forgive the almost predictable, certainly tiresome, and problematically vapid bravado of the film to simply an excess of things going on.  The beauty of the film and the worthwhile performances of the cast might have induced me to forgive the relative lack of depth or magic in this rendering, had I not felt that I was being clumsily and unsuccessfully manipulated at every turn.<br/><br/>I very much enjoyed Fellowship due to a skill I saw in distilling Tolkien's complex world into a meaningful exploration of character difference and temptation, as regarded each character's current and historical relationship to the ring of power.  This film continues to do so in the sequences that are perhaps the most rewarding, those involving the trio of Frodo, Sam, and Gollum, a bizarre relationship but psychologically riveting.  We understand the complexity of the task of Frodo through both his own tortured visage and the reactions of those around him.  Conversely, the minute long introduction sequence between Aragorn and his new would be human love interest is hardly enough to inspire us to any level of emotional involvement, yet somehow we are supposed to believe that this two sentence exchange should be enough to carry the sub-plot through the rest of the film.  There is simply far too much that happens in this film for us to even understand the depth of what is going on, and there are far too many times when we are left with the feeling that at this moment we are expected to be moved to tears. Whiplash is probably a better description for the reaction.<br/><br/>Despite my disappointment in the Two Towers, I still do look forward to the final film.  This film never relents in its lively and magnetic exposition of a rich other world.  Despite its inability to rouse me to any heights of passion in the battle of good versus evil, I am left still anxious to watch 'what happens next'."

","Words cannot express the joy I felt when this second installment of Lord of the Rings hit the screens. My joy was short-lived, however, as I discovered that this second in the trilogy was as painful as exercising on a push bike with diarrhoea.<br/><br/>The first of the trilogy was an excellent film, even for someone like me who isn't a big fan on there so-called 'fantasy epics'. Did no one mention to Tolkien that he'd just rewritten the Conan Chronicles, with the only difference being that he couldn't even be bothered to make more female characters? Okay, so we know Tolkien must have been gay for that reason. No matter. The film of the first book was spectacular - battle scenes like I'd never seen before, dialogue that was crisp and sharp, and I really felt for the characters.<br/><br/>The Two Towers was just the opposite. The fight scenes were nothing new - in fact, if they had taken out all the fight scenes, there would have been nothing left in the film! I'm very disappointed that they didn't make this film more dialogue-driven rather than effects and battle-driven. Granted that the book has numerous battles, to me this translated badly onto the cellular screen. For me, films must be ADAPTED from books, not merely copied scene-for-scene.<br/><br/>One person commented that this film require a new scale because 10 cannot do it justice. Erm, 10 means perfection; and as far as I'm concerned, no film ever deserves a 10. The Godfather comes close, so does Star Wars (episode 4), and perhaps Casablanca.<br/><br/>Watching the Two Towers gave me the same feeling of disappointment that I felt when I watched Matrix Reloaded - it put me off wanting to watch the final installment. Which is a shame, because the last of the trilogy (both Matrix and LOTR) is much better than the second of the trilogy in both cases.<br/><br/>In terms of 'completeness', I would recommend watching this film only because you need it to bridge the first and third LOTR films. If you want to watch a film purely for its entertainment value, you're better off watching ""I, Robot"". At least you get to see Will Smith get beaten up many times lol.<br/><br/>The Two Towers scores a generous 3/10 for me, only because you need it to watch the far superior final installment."
"zetes","9","2","6","5 January 2003"," Huge improvement over the first installment
","I found the first installment of this series pretty good, but ultimately sloppy. It was just too repetitive, with the characters doing nothing but travelling forward, stopping sporadically to fight battles against forces of faceless monsters which ridiculously outnumbered them. The second installment, of course, picks up right where the first one ended, although it has broken into three narrative tracks. The cutting between the three makes the first half of the film rather uneven. The plotline of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas defending the people of Rohan is especially slow, and there isn't enough exposition to explain what the heck is going on. I'm actually glad for that, as I'd rather sit through incomprehensible plot than have to listen to twenty more minutes of explaining who the heck these people are and what the heck is going on. I turned to my friend, a long-time lover of the novels, and asked him and he quickly caught me up. Pippin and Merry, the two Hobbits who were captured by orcs at the end of the first movie, escape and run into a sacred forest and are captured by a giant talking tree called an ent. This plotline is slow, too, but the tree monsters were neat enough to hold my attention.<br/><br/>The third plotline, the one with Frodo and Sam, is by far the most interesting. Gollum, the former owner of the ring, now obsessed with it, attacks them and is captured. He soon becomes their guide when Frodo begins to sympathize with his downfall. Gollum is by far the most interesting character in the film, like Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back. This is the first computer-generated character to work completely. Except for his eyes, I'd accept him as a physical entity. And his story and performance are just so tragic that these parts were nearly overwhelming at times. It's too bad they don't award voice characterizations (and I can't find who did it on imdb). The special effects guys really, truly deserve to win an Oscar for their work here. He was so interesting, I wanted the whole movie to be based from his point of view for a lot of the film.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the other two stories do begin to work after a while. There's a great, kinetic battle scene with some wolves that was apparently not in the novel, which, of course, angers all the nerds. This leads to some material about Liv Tyler's character which was also not in the book. My LOTR nerd friend admitted that these scenes were good, and, in my mind, that was the first real scene that got me to give the slightest care for Aragorn, who seems so important but, to me, seemed so uninteresting in the first movie and a lot of this one. The elf and dwarf also begin to come into their own, although the dwarf is often used solely for comic relief, and it's not especially funny. A lot of the movie focuses around a huge battle fought by these characters. They have armies now, so this battle scene is much less ridiculous than the ones in the first film. It's actually enormously entertaining. Pippin and Merry also become more interesting, although they're never going to be, I fear, as interesting as anyone else. The ents whom they hang around with are really cool, though. The ents' attack on one of the towers (I do have to admit that I didn't even realize there were two myself) makes for a very neat scene.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is about the same as my biggest complaint about the first film. Why are the villains so boring? The orcs and their kin are just dull, faceless villains. They're fodder for the good guys' armies. They run around and yowl, and that's about it. Why can't there be a few generals or something that have interesting things to say? Christopher Lee, who did make a bit of an impression in the first film, is totally shafted in this one. He does little more than sit in his tower and watch his troops march away. There's also a new villain, an Ozzy Osbourne-looking guy named Wormtongue, who is controlling the king of Rohan with magic. Do you really believe that they would allow a guy named Wormtongue to come into their palace, let alone advise the king?<br/><br/>Despite this film's numerous flaws, I can't think of another film of 2002 that really entertained me more than this one. 8/10."
"MovieAddict2016","6","4","17","6 May 2005"," Good movie; incredibly overrated
","""Lord of the Rings"" continues to disappoint. The entire trilogy has never had any real effect on me; when I saw ""The Return of the King"" in the cinema it was the closest I came to loving the series -- the last hour was really gripping stuff... then the conclusion went overboard and I couldn't wait for it to end.<br/><br/>Before I saw ""RotK"" I thought ""The Two Towers"" was going to be my favorite from the series -- it's certainly more entertaining than the first film, even if it doesn't contain as nice scenery and cinematography (it's not as lush).<br/><br/>My concerns in regards to this trilogy (and specifically ""The Two Towers"") is that it tries too hard to be an epic, creating far too much overblown, dramatic material that fails to equate into poignancy. Case in point: I'm sure the entire trilogy contains about an hour of footage entirely of Frodo and Sam crying in each other's arms. There's a certain point where too much is simply too much and I grew weary of the constant drama-queen syndrome. Put a female's wig on Frodo and he's a transvestite. I mean, seriously. He cries more than Halle Berry at an awards show.<br/><br/>The better parts of ""The Two Towers"" follow Aragorn's story, but then there's too much exposition: ""I ride at dawn to Minis Tirith in search of the mighty plot MacGuffin!"" Just do it already! Half the film is wasted because the characters tell us what they're going to do, and then we spend more time watching them do it. Once is enough. Example: ""I'm going to kill that monster!"" (Aragorn kills the monster.) ""I'm going to walk over to that cliff and pretend to jump!"" (Aragorn walks over to the cliff and pretends to jump.) Overall I feel this is incredibly overrated because a majority of the voters are those who are duped into buying this as the ""epic of our times"" when in fact there have been far better so-called ""epics"" made and more relatable ones, too. I found the human story of ""LotR"" quite weak and because Peter Jackson spends so much time exaggerating it to such overly-dramatic effect... it leaves a bad aftertaste.<br/><br/>It's worth noting the only people I know who love this film are those who infrequently watch films, and/or are under the age of 13.

There's a sensitivity here not usually applied to middle films in a trilogy but making the groundbreaking meld of CGI and characterisation of Sméagol/Gollum the central arc of the story is very smart. It gives the film thrust and purposeful connective tissue to Return of the King. His arc from Gollum to Sméagol and to Gollum again is sad, important and due to Andy Serkis also hilarious. It does everything a middle film should, introduces new characters, fleshes out old and builds tension to the third film. The battles are bigger but no less well crafted and every side story is a worthwhile one.<br/><br/>The extended version is a difficult bag, all the scenes removed are extraneous certainly, but are all brilliant moments and in any other film, indispensable. Boromir and Faramir scenes manage to actually give more relatability to a character that's already dead and the funeral of Théoden's son is incredibly sad, poignant and pertinent."

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>The sequel to the masterful Lord of the Rings films lives up to its name. The 
Two Towers is another epic created by Peter Jackson. It is grand and the battles are bigger then ever. The dialogue is fluid and the characters are all amazing. The introduction of the people Rohan is amazing. They are all interesting and add so much to the story.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin, Cate Blanchett, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Andy Serkis, John Rhys-Davies, Dominic Monaghan, Viggo Mortensen, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving were all perfectly cast once again. Bernard Hill, Bruce Hopkins, Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and David Wenham are great editions to the cast. They are also perfectly cast in this film.<br/><br/>The pacing and runtime are once again perfect.<br/><br/>The special effect and scenery are amazing.

","Unpopular opinion: this movie is the best of the trilogy. The Return Of The King might have had a better full movie but nothing can compare with the final hour of The Two Towers. The first hour was kind of meh, nice characters and good plot but it wasn't anything special. It got special though, when our characters made it to Helms Deep. The battle scenes were both awesome and intriguing. As the battle roared through ups and downs on of my favorite in cinema happens, Gandalf comes down the hill, this scene makes the movie for me. Frodo, Sam and Gollem were great. Awesome performance from Sean Astin and Andy Serkis. The whole trilogy had awesome moments such as Peregrin Took lighting the fire, or Boromir's death but this one was my personal favorite. Awesome trilogy, Peter Jackson."

","The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is a 2002 epic high fantasy adventure film[6][7] directed by Peter Jackson and based on the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. It is the second installment in The Lord of the Rings film series, preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) and concluding with The Return of the King (2003).<br/><br/>Continuing the plot of The Fellowship of the Ring, the film intercuts three story lines. Frodo and Sam continue their journey towards Mordor to destroy the One Ring, meeting and joined by Gollum, the ring's former owner. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli come to the war-torn nation of Rohan and are reunited with the resurrected Gandalf, before fighting at the Battle of Helm's Deep. Merry and Pippin escape capture, meet Treebeard the Ent, and help to plan an attack on Isengard."

","Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002): Dir: Peter Jackson / Cast: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis: The Two Towers is suppose to represent good and evil but the subplots do not interlink very well due to spacing. It opens where Fellowship of the Ring left off within a battle. Frodo and Sam are joined in their quest by a scheming Gollum, which they captured then they continue their quest to destroy the ring. There are tree creatures that are the film's biggest treasure. Then we are given another useless cliffhanger within a huge battle. Director Peter Jackson tenses the action with impressive visual wonders. Ian McKellen as the wizard Gandalf returns after having apparently died in his battle concluding the first film. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn is involved in much combat until nearly meeting his death after a horrendous fall. Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam struggle as keepers of the ring and the deceit as the Gollum attempts to sabotage their friendship. Andy Serkis is the Gollum and his performance is all the better because of what viewers do and don't see with his performance. The special effects are overwhelming and top notch with detailed structure but the film cannot stand alone. Fans of the books may enjoy it, otherwise it is an overrated spectacle with the two towers being the previous film and the next one to which viewing this relies. Score: 6 / 10"

","Some see it as the lesser entry of the trilogy. I see it as the vital bridge which allows the characters to develop. Samwise and Frodo spend more time with each other. Gollum gets significant character development as his dual personality leaves the two main characters split on whether he is helping them or not, weakening their loyalty to each other.<br/><br/>Merry and Pippin, with the help of Treebeard, get to where they need to go in a subplot that adds humor and character to an otherwise rough movie. Saruman and the surviving Gandalf are also in conflict. And there's plenty of meaty battles. The Two Towers combines immersive setting, intense action and strong storytelling together in an overall essential experience for fans of fantasy.."

"mgruebel","Null","1","2","18 January 2014"," A strong second act
","Is this the first time Hollywood trusted a director to just make a 9+ hour movie and serve it up in three slices (not sequels)? I think so. It was a good call by New Line, especially considering that the director of ""Heavenly Creatures"" and ""Dead Alive"" did not exactly have mega-credentials.<br/><br/>When I first read the book many decades ago, I learnt Feanorian script and basic Sindarin. I have read it many times since. So my expectations were high when I sat down for the film. In part 2, I must say I was mesmerized from Gandalf's aerial battle with the Balrog to Smeagol reverting to Gollum on the way to Mordor. I forgive the liberties Jackson took with Faramir manhandling Smeagol, as it does provide a reason for Gollum's re-emergence.<br/><br/>The full opus takes quite a few liberties with the book, from omissions (Tom Bombadil) to transpositions (Warg attack on Rohirrim in episode 2 rather than on the Fellowship in episode 1) to inventions (Sam being sent back home by Frodo in act 3). It merges and deletes characters (Arwen and her brother, Eomer and Erkenbrand), or invents them (the orc Sharku, a play on Saruman's nickname in a part of the book cut out entirely). Many of them are preferable to the alternatives that were considered (for instance, Arwen in film 2 showing up in Aragorn's dream, rather than as a battle maiden at Helm's Deep). Only rarely does it have plot holes (like Frodo suddenly brandishing a sword at Sam in Osgiliath, when they are prisoners of Faramir who surely removed all their weapons). Perhaps the greatest liberty is the constant weakening of the moral fibre of characters for the sake of creating short-lived dramatic tension (like Treebeard only making up his mind to fight when he sees that Saruman has killed his trees; or Faramir originally taking the ring towards Minas Tirith to echo his weaker brother).<br/><br/>There is one incomprehensible artistic and business decision: Why did Jackson not just end the third film with the crowning of King Elessar, and let Saruman live (as in the book, and as was potentially implied in the theatrical release)? Then they could have made a fourth film to take the hobbits to the scouring of the Shire. Anticlimax, you say? I bet film 4 would still have made a tidy sum because LOTR mania was at a high level in the early 2000s. And it would have avoided that awkward never-ending-ending in Return of the King. After seeing the income stream from 1-3, New Line would have gone for #4 and given the hobbits their own little final battle. As a positive side effect, it would have toned the scale down a little at the end, thus allowing The Hobbit, which is vastly overblown, to stay a little closer to the smaller scale of Tolkien's earlier book.<br/><br/>All of this is easy to forgive because the films hews close to the spirit of the book overall, and departures are usually corrected, as in Sam's ""By all rights we shouldn't even be here (Osgiliath)"" - and soon they weren't. It is visually a masterpiece. Many have remarked that Jackson has finally trumped Kurosawa as the best big battle auteur, and I grudgingly admit it's true (although I still like RAN better than LOTR; it's one of a few films I give a ""10""). Jackson forces bold acting out of the actors sometimes, with pathos and tears pushed to the verge of what is acceptable. The level of detail in the scenery, weaponry, sets, costumes, just everything, is absolutely amazing; and yet the filmmakers resisted the temptation to gloat over it. So much work for a few seconds of screen time! The film is complex and textured, a classic like Gone with the Wind and the better costume dramas of the 50s when it comes to big bold scale.<br/><br/>In the end, the film became my visual impression of the books for the most part, and that's a great compliment because I had read the books multiple times and certainly formed mental pictures of what everything is like. Even the young Frodo worked for me in the end: who knows what a 50 year old hobbit looks like in a world where Dunedain can still reach 100s of years of age?<br/><br/>With all its flaws, this mammoth film is great cinema, and deserves its Oscars and other accolades. It will be a long time before this story is remade."
"vanhalen144","10","1","2","7 November 2013"," Not about 9/11
","Wow what a flick, totally was not expecting this. Hobbits? Elves? Giant eye towers? What even the heck!!1??? I rented this from my local video store (""Local Video Store"" in Newark) expecting to see an insightful retelling of the 9/11 events. No dice. What I got was a grade-A spectacle to the senses directed by skeeter Jackson. Not sure what this film was based on and there might have been another movie before it, but I did pick up on a couple of allusions to the Warren Commission's report. This was literally enthralling as I feel that the Warren Commission never got much recognition and wouldn't expect it to have influenced a film in the mythical realm. Trill, nonetheless.<br/><br/>At one point a couple of the hobbit guys and a bunch of talking trees come up to a large, steel tower and aren't sure how to topple it. Fuel and airborne aluminum projectiles are not a feasible option because this is like mid-evil times, but that couldn't have possibly brought it down anyhow. Instead they throw some rocks an stuff at it, but can't knock it down. They settle for breaking a dam instead and it's kinda rad. Then there's the other crew which is a man and some minorities and they are chasing after other hobbits who are carrying a weapon that is capable of mass destruction. This is their excuse for pursing said hobbits and not helping with the tower. I guess I should mention that there is a whole lot going on at one time. The good guys that we are following have had a beef with the bad guys (orcs, some snitch wizard, and a giant eye that's on fire) for a long time and want their land a resources as their own. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil too much so I'll stop there, but wow! what a movie. I really like it, 10 stars all the way. Watch it if you can. Hell stop by my place if you're in Newark and give it a view with me."

","Every film consists of three acts; The first is where you introduce your story & its characters. The second is the middle part where the majority of the plot surfaces & character development takes place. And the third & final act is where you tie up all the loose ends to bring your entire tale to its conclusion. Almost everyone has a definite idea of how to begin & end their stories but the middle act is always the most difficult. Because no matter how great the other two acts are, if this part isn't handled well, then the overall experience ultimately amount to nothing in the end.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is that middle act of Peter Jackson's on-screen adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's Middle-Earth saga & just like the novel, it has no definite beginning or ending. What's even more challenging this time is the fact that unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, which had a single plot to focus on, The Two Towers deals with multiple story lines & all need to work. And the good news is that even though The Two Towers doesn't follow the novel as faithfully as its predecessor did, it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that improves upon the original.<br/><br/>Picking the story right from where it was left off, The Two Towers tells the aftermath of the breaking of the Fellowship & intercuts three story lines. The first concerns Frodo & Sam who, on their journey to Mordor, find their peril deepen for there is another who hunts the ring. The second deals with Merry & Pippin, who were taken as hostages in the last film. And the third covers the trio of Aragorn, Legolas & Gimli who, along with an unexpected ally, head to Rohan to warn them of an impending war. The title refers to the union between the two towers; Barad- dûr, fortress of the dark lord, Sauron, & Orthanc, stronghold of the wizard Saruman.<br/><br/>Narrating multiple stories within the same film is never an easy task but director Peter Jackson manages to do it once again & what's even more admirable is that he gives equal importance & value to all three story lines as the film smoothly switches from one plot to another without confusing its viewers & the decision to conclude it at a different event from the novel sets a perfect stage for the finale. Also, it is extremely well written & narrated for enough time is given to develop its new characters, without ever interrupting the development arc of any of the reprising cast.<br/><br/>Coming to the technical aspects, all filmmaking departments get significant upgrades & are more fine-tuned this time. The production design continues to impress with its meticulously detailed sets & is ideally fused with the gorgeously photographed landscapes of New Zealand. Camera-work is at its absolute best during the action sequences, Make-up, Costume Design & Sound retain their qualities and Editing trims it down to 179 minutes but just like the last time, I recommend the extended edition for it adds 45 minutes of new footages which further enriches its overall experience.<br/><br/>Weta Digital's VFX team made history with The Fellowship of the Ring but the enhancements it brings in The Two Towers is even more groundbreaking. Gollum & Treebeard are entirely CGI & it was a VFX milestone of its time. But it's the Battle of Helm's Deep where the visuals are at its finest and without this team's creativity & breakthroughs, it wouldn't rank today as one of the greatest screen battles of all time. Howard Shore's magnificent score continues to enhance the emotional journey of this exceptional adventure & is an outstanding follow-up to its predecessor.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, The Two Towers adds even more strength to its ensemble cast as the reprising actors once again chips in with faithful performances while the new ones instantly make their mark felt. But the most notable amongst both the new & reprising cast turns out to be none other than Andy Serkis' rendition of Gollum/Sméagol. Heartwarming & heartbreaking at the same time, Serkis' gives this CGI character its very own soul and delivers such an intense, energetic & jaw-dropping performance that it's easily the finest acting of the saga, so far.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Two Towers is a smooth continuation & a worthy expansion of the world that was brought alive in The Fellowship of the Ring. There are a few artistic license taken but it all stays within the realms of Tolkien's world & remains true to its spirits. Succeeding as another spellbinding & engrossing masterpiece that effortlessly blends art & entertainment into a staggering epic, The Two Towers is an immensely satisfying sequel that ably meets & exceeds the genre-defining standards set by its predecessor & signs off by setting an even higher bar for the final chapter of Tolkien's legendarium. One hundred percent recommended."

","The Two Towers is that rare type of movie: a sequel that is better than the original.<br/><br/>With the fellowship in splinters, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue on their quest to destroy the ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) has his own duties to attend to, and we all mourn Gandalf (Ian McKellen). Peter Jackson's midpoint of the trilogy is even greater than its predecessor and successor. Every shot is impressive; there isn't any adjective that I can use that would do the movie justice.<br/><br/>And Gollum? Now there's an intriguing character, my precious. An awe-inspiring, if pitiful, being, he makes you really want to see part 3, just to see what will happen. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is truly one movie that will continue to inspire people for years."

","This somehow did not work for me. If this was supposed to be serious, it was verging on the ridiculous. I could excuse the first one for a little low-brow humour considering it didn't get right into the journey at first, but it was too overdone to at least lighten the mood in a serious context. It also had massive pacing issues, as it either brought everything to a standstill or hurried everything on, and it's suddenly strange how they stray off and bring to your attention scenes of no point whatsoever.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the acting wasn't affected too much. The scenes with either Legolas, Aragorn or Frodo were beautifully done, so I have come to terms with the fact that the acting can still be good even when the pacing isn't. Despite that, they should have taken a few of the characters out, because they were kind of pointless. I liked Gollum (or Sméagol), but I think he was just there for the crazy factor. <br/><br/>Overall, it was good, but was not as good as the first one. This could definitely have been better. Maybe they should just have done two films if there was going to be such a big gap in the middle."
"fredrik-bendz","5","1","2","29 August 2012"," Misleading title - should have been called The Two Lovers
","I was VERY disappointed by this movie when it came out. True, Jackson does a great job in bringing Tolkien's world to life, and the shots are epic. However, as a Tolkien fan, I find the film tantamount to blasphemy.<br/><br/>I understand that you have to remove parts of the book to keep the film at reasonable length, and I understand that you need to make adaptations of the story for the screen. What I don't understand is why you take a literal masterpiece and remove most of it just to include a love story that adds nothing, and isn't very romantic even. Apart from the battle of Helm's Deep, almost none of the events are taken from the book, and those that are have been changed beyond recognition.<br/><br/>I (re-)read each book prior to watching the movies - bad mistake! If I didn't have the book in such fresh memory when I saw the movie, I might have appreciated it more.<br/><br/>Don't watch this movie with the expectation that it's an adaption of The Two Towers. It isn't. The story is rather based on the Aragorn/Arwen story in appendix A to The Return of the King, with ""a little"" imagination from Jackson. They should have included much more from the book and made this story a movie on its own.<br/><br/>A love story staring Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler could have been a hit. It would have given the scriptwriter an opportunity to really focus on the love between Arwen and Aragorn, and Arwen's decision to become mortal, thereby forsaking her chance to ever see her family again. That's some powerful love right there! ""The Two Lovers"", as this movie should really have been called, fails in capturing that love. Neither does it capture the sorrow Elrond must feel, knowing that he will live an eternity without his precious daughter.<br/><br/>If you liked the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book for the REAL story."
"Steffi_P","9","1","2","7 April 2012"," ""The stories that stay with you""
","Of the three pictures in Peter Jackson's epic treatment of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, this one probably takes the most liberties in adapting JRR Tolkein's book. Middle sections in a trilogy are often problematic, especially in the movies. Tolkein would have expected his readers to work through the books chapter-by-chapter, the split into the three volumes being mainly to keep the actual tomes to a practical size. A movie however is more of a stand-alone thing, and it needs a satisfying beginning and ending even when it's the middle of a larger story.<br/><br/>Jackson, along with his co-writers Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair have done a neat job. The Two Towers has an added problem in that the characters get split into three groups, and three separate narrative lines. The novel devotes half a book each to the different sets of characters. The script for The Two Towers must find more fluid ways of integrating the different story lines, and there is some canny balancing of pure action and 'human' themes. They insert a little episode of the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, which is a bit dull in itself but provides a brief moment of tranquillity to build up tension before the next burst of action. There's also an implication that Eowyn slightly fancies Aragorn, which as far as I recall was not in the book, but it actually works far better than the official romance because it is tied into the sense of danger at the battle. Finally, the writers leave off some of the book's material for the third movie, to put more focus on the Helm's Deep climax and wind towards satisfactory conclusions for each of the story's strands.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson is very much a craftsman of his generation, with all the pros and cons of modern filmmaking. As with The Fellowship of the Ring, the movie is over-edited, with shots never lasting more than a couple of seconds. But this is Jackson's style and he knows how to do great things with it. He's especially good at switching between the inside and the outside of a situation. When Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas encounter the Rohirrim, the riders surge into view over the hillside, and Jackson really gives us a feel of the power of this army with breathtaking shots from above and then ones inside the throng with horses towering over the camera. Later he creates a mighty ""wow"" moment when the black rider appears, a gauntleted hand at first, before pulling back to reveal the massive winged steed. And the detail in Jackson's close-ups is if anything more meaningful than his massive CGI crowd shots. When we see Frodo's hand moving for the ring round his neck, his fingers are rough and dirty, just as they would on someone who has spent weeks travelling in the wilderness.<br/><br/>The breaking of the fellowship into smaller groups in The Two Towers allows individual characters to come out a bit more, and it's the better movie for it. As before though there are a few problems with the acting. Elijah Wood makes a dismal and unsympathetic Frodo, moaning his way across Middle Earth with a perpetually forlorn look. Andy Serkis's Gollum is certainly a spirited little fellow, but I feel he's just a little too pathetic, and not convincingly cunning enough – or perhaps that problem lies more in the way he's been animated. Once again it is Ian McKellen who brings most dignity to the proceedings, but this time he is aided by solid turns from the likes of Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto. Alongside the development of characters, most of the players from the previous movie perform a little better this time around, and John Rhys Davis is particularly good as a loveably comical Gimli.<br/><br/>Perhaps what really makes The Two Towers is Jackson's deliberate tendency to be somewhat silly. Who else would come up with a Tolkein adaptation featuring an Olympic torch-bearer orc or Legolas surfing down the steps on a shield, unless it was a deliberate parody (which it never for one moment feels like)? Above all, he seems to be having fun with what he's doing. I don't think the oliphaunts were supposed to be quite that big in the books, but Jackson clearly wanted the Imperial Walkers from The Empire Strikes Back in his movie. It's his ability to adapt the material with dignity but without taking it too seriously, that means generally the audience is having as much fun as he is."
"Kubris","8","1","2","21 August 2011"," The middle one
","IMDb Top 250: 30 The Lord of the Rings: the Two Towers continues the epic story that began in Fellowship of the Ring. We meet new characters, develop others, and see epic battles.<br/><br/>There is such a phenomenon in film called 'Middle film syndrome' or something of the sort. It means that in a trilogy, the middle film is the weakest because it isn't exposition like the first film, or conclusion like the third. The Two Towers is a perfect example of this concept. The awe of Fellowship isn't present, and the finish of Return of the King doesn't happen, leaving... the middle.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to say Two Towers is a bad film. But compared to the other Lord of the Rings films, it is. They're AAA, Towers is AA. The characters introduced, like the King and nephew in Rohan, are thrown into the story without a reasonable introduction. The battle for Helm's Deep isn't that spectacular. Humour is misplaced. Even the films colour is wrong. Some of these factors can't really be fixed, because of the books, but some of them should've been dealt with.<br/><br/>There are still some great parts of Two Towers. Gollum is nuts, batty and crazy. His presence helps Frodo and Sam's scenes, which don't actually go anywhere. The Dead Marshes are creepy. Ringwraiths return- on new mounts. And the tree battle, the only epic scene in the movie.<br/><br/>Most of my problems with Two Towers are that the scale is diminished, no scenes other than the battle at Isengard leave the viewer in awe. The battle for Helm's Deep was also... not great. The sides weren't even close to being reasonable, making the result unbelievable. The colouring of the last battle made it seem very dark and bleak, but Gimli became a walking joke and Legolas rode a shield/surfboard. Clashing themes. The orcs didn't have anything special in that battle to make the battle interesting. In a series with groundbreaking battles, Two Towers came up short.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a good film, but a mediocre Lord of the Rings film. If for some reason you see it before the other two, the others are far better. Not much else I can say, you're either in it for all 3 or not in it. Fear not, Return of the King is the strongest, a worthy finish of your time. 8.3/10"

The story continues from the Great River, where Frodo and Sam part away from the rest of the Fellowship and embark on a journey never to be forgotten: that of destroying the One Ring, by taking it deep inside Mordor, into Mount Doom.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood and Sean Astin once again steal the show with supreme performances of Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee respectively, while the return of Gandalf is welcomed appreciatively. The story takes on two difference courses, both of which are equally vital and are given almost the equal amount of time throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has not disappointed one bit with the visuals. The screenplay is simply magnificent and war sequence of Helms Deep will always be one of my favorite scenes in the Lord of The Rings. Faith, trust, loyalty and friendship is shown throughout the movie, as in the epic book of J.R.R. Tolkein. The music is wonderful, quite similar to its previous installment, but nevertheless a hundred percent effective. The fall of Isengard is shown in a splendid way and Jackson shows it takes more than mere directing to achieve it. A great effort taken by the entire crew for the movie and full appreciation deserved.<br/><br/>Quite a few would be of the opinion that The Two Towers is relatively disappointing with respect to the other two movies. I beg to disagree. The movie has been fantastically captured, and pays tribute to the book perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a captivating movie, taking the story to its final part, the epic ending of the Lord of the Rings. A must watch for any movie fan, let alone an The Lord of the Rings fanatic. It is a visual treat, great story telling and great performances. A 10 / 10."

The sheer scope of the project and the fact that Jackson was able to wrangle it into three blockbuster and seamless films is cause for admiration.<br/><br/>But it's a monumental project that left me cold, and if you're a movie goer who's made to feel like a pariah by the series' idolatrous fanboys for not thinking it's the greatest thing to ever befall our civilization, give me a shout, because it would give me comfort to know there are others out there.<br/><br/>After nine hours of Elijah Wood's one expression of wide-eyed bewilderment; of Viggo Mortenson's uber-sombre line readings; of Orlando Bloom's silly hair; and of relentless gray and brown battle scenes, I'd had enough. I think it says something about your endeavor when the most interesting character in the film is the one who's computer animated.<br/><br/>The person who really deserves the most credit for this trilogy is its editor(s), who had to take god knows how many hours of footage and shape it into something resembling a movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"Jakethemuss","10","1","2","4 September 2007"," Number One Film
","Out of all the films I've seen during my life, which is easily hundreds, it would be most fair to say that LOTR: The Two Towers stands as my favoured film. The middle of the stunning Peter Jackson trilogy, it is not the biggest or boldest, or most important, but I feel it is scene for scene the greatest film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The film is basically split into 3 separate but intertwining plots. First, we see our warrior trio (Aragorn the Ranger, Leglolas the Elf and Gimli the Dwarf) as they track across vast plains in hot pursuit of the somewhat depleted Uruk Hai party that has kidnapped Hobbits Merry and Pippin, before making way to the ruling town of Rohan. Then, there is the ring carrier Frodo and his trusty sidekick and friend Samwise, who wearily hike across rocky unfamiliar terrain en route to Mordor, which is where Frodo's mission lies. Lastly and by no means least, we follow the path of Hobbits Merry and Pippin, who find themselves in the huge, dark Fangorn Forest upon escaping their green skinned captors. It is here where they see an old friend, and stumble across the ancient natives of the wood, who just might join their cause.<br/><br/>My favourite sub story would have to be the Aragorn one, as not only does that have the most battle and combat, but is also the main attraction of the film for me. It is the 3 fearless warriors who must help defend the people of Rohan as they take the dangerous but necessary journey to the mountain fortress of Helms Deep. Which is where they stand firmly together and await the sinister Saruman's next move.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this to anyone who has not already seen The Fellowship of the Ring, as this carries on directly and the viewer would be trying to fill in the holes as events progressed. It would also not be as enjoyable if you hadn't seen the build up to where they are now. It is immensely gripping and exciting to see the story unravel, almost impossible to not be totally swept in by it all. Everything has been handled just as it should, there is a little humour, passion, stirring scenes of valour, plenty of sword fighting and battle to keep the action fiends happy. As for the violence, it is not disturbing or malicious, but brave and uplifting. The men of the West, Dwarfs, Elves and Co. are fighting for a reason, to save themselves from extinction, they do what they have to do for survival. It is a true case of good vs evil here, light vs darkness.<br/><br/>Anything else? Oh yes, glorious cinematography, excellent and effective use of CGI, amazing New Zealand scenery, captivating dialogue and character interaction, not to mention great performances from Viggo Mortensen as the softly spoken yet ultra strong, bearded uncrowned King of Middle Earth, Bernard Hill as the noble Theoden and as always Ian McKellen shines as the wise and knowing Gandalf. Very few performances were bad in fact. Then again, this film has VERY little wrong with it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Chibichasechan","10","1","2","12 June 2007"," One of the Best Films in the history of LOTR
","The one thing about this movie that really catches my attention, is the special effects. THe director really did everything that he could, and what is needed in this movie, and made a movie from the book spectacular, and beyond stunning. This is my favorite Lord of the Rings movie of them all, and I have watched the 3 hour Extended version of the movie about 10 times over, and watched the extras on the DVD, which takes about an hour to complete. I must say I am one of those Lord of the Rings geek.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of all time, and the best movie I have seen in all my time. The actors are so good with their roles it's unbelievable that they were acting, and not actually feeling it themselves, because I definitely did. This movie also housed a lot of my Favorite Actors, and they picked perfect people for all of their roles. Elijah Wood played an excellent role of Frodo Baggins, his character being the small, lost Hobbit in the movie, wandering with his one friend Sam Gamgee, who was also very perfect for his role. They made the elves look so real I wondered sometimes if they were born with those ears or not. The fight scenes in the movie also blew me away, especially the last one.<br/><br/>This has to be the only movie from the book where I liked the movie better than the book, and I am not a person like that. I believe you get more involved with the movie than the book, and that is not normal for me. I am glad they haven't ruined the book with the movie, like a lot of directors do. Take a look at something like that Da Vinci Code, or Eragon, and you will see what I mean. The book is very good though, but also very long.<br/><br/>I can easily just sit through 3 hours of this movie whenever I want to, and watch it over and over again at my pleasure, I know few people like me who can do that, and a lot of people watch a movie once and throw it away and never watch it again. I try to convince them to continue to watch it, but no one listens. The same thing happens with King Kong, I can watch that over and over again and never get tired of it.<br/><br/>Definite 10 out of 10."
"aji-mohan-1980","10","1","2","18 April 2007"," A great cinematic achievement!
","Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers stands out as the second best of the Trilogy, the first being The Fellowship. The directive skills of Peter Jackson and how he managed to draw up nearly six units working together, is really awesome. The cinematography of Andrew Lesnie is very enthralling and I think he must have won the Best Cinematographer award for all the three movies. The guys at Weta Digital are really marvellous. Its because of their imagination that we got to see such a spectacular portrayal of moving images on the screen. Hats off to Stephen Regelous for creating the MASSIVE CROWD DEVELOPER software, which was used in the battle scenes. The soundtrack by Howard Shore is mind-blowing and the track, Gollum's Song by Emiliana Torrini stands out.<br/><br/>The creation of the fully computer generated creature, Gollum is the highlight of the three movies. Its really amazing how such a character can be created using the keyboard and mouse of a computer. Each of its facial expression seems to be so realist, just like a human being. Andy Serkis's performance as Gollum is awesome. Gimli, the dwarf provide some humour to the movie, when all the other characters speak only serious stuff. I liked the Helm's Deep battle scene, where he asks Aragorn to throw him into the crowd of Orcs at the gate, provided he does not tell the Elves about it.<br/><br/>Frankly speaking, I have never read the Lord of the Rings Books before watching the movie. But the movie has left me captivated into thinking how the imagination of human beings work. Its so marvellous.<br/><br/>I guarantee that it is going to be the greatest movie for a long, long time to come."
"general-melchett","10","1","2","18 February 2007"," Hugely epic and well-made, The Two Towers is another success for the Lord of the Rings.
","The Two Towers dwarfs The Fellowship of the Ring in size, scale, and the grandeur of the action scenes. While FOTR followed Frodo and co. as they started their journey across Middle Earth to destroy the Ring, TTT is our first glimpse at what happens in the bigger world as the Fellowship breaks - a war is being fought over this Ring, and the war is starting now... Needless to say, TTT is a bigger film than FOTR. Instead of about 100 Orcs and a troll against nine men, we have armies of thousands of Orcs and Uruk-hai, against armies of thousands of Men, and proper big weapons. And the results are amazing. The battle for Helm's Deep is brilliantly done - Braveheart can pack its bags and go home, this is the new champion of sword-fighting epics. The way tension was built up to the battle was brilliant - you found yourself practically drooling by the time the Men were gathered on the outer walls of the castle, ready for battle. And besides from ending with the smaller fights and starting with the larger wars, this film also started off some new plots - the story of King Theoden and Eowyn and the first meeting with Gollum (we got some glimpses of him in the last film but this film is his real introduction) - and develops these plots sufficiently for them to be continued and ended in the next film - the epic close to this great trilogy. This film definitely did not pass on anything, and though the relatively slim budget (believe me, $93,000,000 is not much for a film of this scale) tells you that a lot of it is CG, it is still bloody impressive, and builds more on the LOTR trilogy's status as an epic series. The Fellowship has broken, but the story is still far from over... 10/10"
"tnzk","8","1","2","23 January 2007"," Amazing sequel.
","One of the best sequels of all time, and that's saying something when the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time.<br/><br/>The Two Towers picks up pretty much where the first one left off: Frodo and Sam are traveling on their own to Mordor, Merry and Pippin have been taken by a band of Orcs and Uruks with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli hot on their tail. Saruman is now building a great army, Merry and Pippin run into a giant race of Middle Earth, Aragorn and co. go forth to save the kingdom of Rohan, and Frodo and Sam have some unexpected company in the form of Gollum. New paths are crossed, old ones are found; each and everyone of them as captivating as possible.<br/><br/>Once again, everything is exceptional. From the sets to the acting to the visual effects - everything is top notch.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson and crew have done a tremendous job of topping the original in terms of storytelling. The lines are bolder, the cinematography even better, and the direction spot on.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, you can see Frodo being taken in by the Ring's power. It is also obvious that Sam is trying hard to keep Frodo from falling into the Ring's power, whilst Gollum's character arc is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>Aragorn's struggle as he comes to face the realization that he must take on the responsibility of his forefathers' is done extremely well. Comic relief comes in the form of Legolas and Gimli's relationship (Elves and Dwarfs don't usually get along), and how hobbits Merry and Pippin react to the ways of the Ents. By no means aren't they informative, because they are, but they are at the same time humorous.<br/><br/>The action pieces are once again on par with the drama and have clearly gone beyond what was done in ""Fellowship"". From the Warg attack to the climactic battle at Helms Deep, Peter Jackson truly shows his imagination is leaps and bounds beyond any other director.<br/><br/>The cinematography is once again superb, and it deserved every bit of the Oscar it won. Sets are realized on a greater scope than Fellowship of the Ring. Edoras is truly a magnificent town upon the hill, whilst Osgiliath looks like it really has been war-torn.<br/><br/>I didn't mention Howard Shore's score in my review of ""Fellowship"", but my thoughts on his music for the first film are the same for this one: It's amazing. Simply amazing. The score is now synonymous with the term fantasy. A melodious orchestra piece highlights the drama, whilst the trumpet sounds as the the bodies pile up during the fights.<br/><br/>Like the first film, my gripe is that this is quite a long movie. This is necessary for an adaption which source is amazingly detailed, and besides, you won't get bored easily. Also, major characters could be off screen for over half an hour, almost as though they have been forgotten. But you'll be so intrigued by what's going on screen, that you too will forget about the other characters. It also helps that the change in character plots are seamlessly changed from one to the other.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson has once again made a must-see movie. This will be loved by the most die hard Tolkien fan to the most ignorant of fantasy. As Saruman said in The Two Towers: ""A new power is rising"". With hindsight, we now know what that means."
"karenlynn1","10","1","2","16 January 2007"," Great Story, Epic Battle Scenes, Absolute Classic!
","First off, let me just say that I love Tolkien's original story The Lord of the Rings. It's absolutely a classic, and deserves much praise--as well as the cult following it's gathered the past few decades. <br/><br/>But of all of the three parts of the story this one stands out apart from it's predecesor, The Fellowship of the Ring, and it's Sequel The Return of the King. <br/><br/>The second part of the saga is definitely pivotal. Why? We are introduced to Gollum, The Kingdom of Rohan and it's characters, and Faramir of Gondor. Let's not forget the Battle of Helm's deep, Gandalf the Grey becomes Gandalf the White, or the The breathtaking March of the Ents.<br/><br/>Despite certain liberties--artistic and cinematic--taken by Peter Jackson, it still does not mar the beauty or enjoyment of this film for me. <br/><br/>While Boromir's death should have been the beginning of This film instead of the end of the last, and the spider Shelob should have made her appearance earlier I respect Jackson's decisions in that respect. <br/><br/>With all that went on in the film version of The Two Towers--Battle of Helm's Deep and all--Shelob's Lair interjected into the mix would have made this seem ""too busy"" after all. (That's just my opinion, however.)<br/><br/>Many viewers scoff at a miniscule modernism by Jackson, involving Legolas using a shield in a skateboard-like fashion. But honestly, if you blink you would miss it. <br/><br/>All in all, it was well done--relatively true to the source material, exciting and entertaining."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","2","11 January 2007"," By far the best of the three: courage, temerity, resilience and tenacity
","After death, severance, separation, loss and confusion, we must regroup and recoup, rejoice and return. So let's save Gandolf first who shifts from The Grey to The White, from powerless to finally magical. The details are all accounted for in the DVD. Then the two hobbits that were captured and thought dead were only prisoners and they will manage to escape and even win the battle of the film, without anyone knowing it really. They will make friends with tree-herders and they will lead the forest against the bad wizard in his tower. And then the trio man-elf-dwarf will liberate some king in some city from the power of some middle man of a wizard and lead his people and troops to a mountain citadel, and this same man and same elf and same dwarf will have the surprise to see the king of the elves and his army arrive to reinforce the humans against the orcs. Some kind of slow growing seeds of courage and commitment. Some call that love too. And the battle will start, spectacular and grandiose, and many will die on both sides and the final salvaging reinforcements will arrive under the authority of Gandolf The White. The orcs will be defeated. During that time the two lost hobbits and the tree-herders will start a tree war against the malicious bad wizard in his tower with his mine and giant smithy underground at the foot of his mausoleum-spire that had provided the army of orcs with all kinds of arms, weapons and armours. And it will all go drowned and soaked, overflowed and flooded. That's how a battle is won, with some courage not to feel pain, with a lot of luck not to hear the warnings of Ms Caution, Miss Prudence and Mrs Carefulness, the three witches of passivity, and a fair dose of blindness not to see danger. And here we are with a long film for a young audience, though the audience of the first film must have aged a little and the film is becoming a lot more human. We even have several heterosexual kisses along with quite a few man-to-man embraces. Going on that way we may have a couple of weddings at the end of the third episode. And it all ends with two hobbits raiding the cellar and kitchen of the bad gloomy dangerous vicious wizard and we even find that funny, even if we are slightly worried for their waistlines. And the real end of course comes with the declaration of total trust from Sam the hobbit gardener who guards no one but cultivates friendship and Frodon the hobbit adventurer guardian of the ring and carrier of its powers to the final destruction site somewhere in hell. This episode though manages to leave monsters and other diabolical figures behind, which is good, and to emphasize more on the human qualities of all these characters. It even gets in a way marvelous for children with walking trees even if this is nothing but the rewriting of Macbeth, but Macbeth deserves many rewritings. And we recognize what is going to become one essential sign of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The main human hero in the Fellowship of the Ring, even after scattering and especially after it, is the surviving son of the long ago destroyed Northern Kingdom. He is a Ranger, a dying out category of peacemakers and justice executioners, just like Roland is a Gunslinger. But still, and that is going to last till the end I imagine, no bridge or door from this medieval fantasy world to our modern world and it is a shame. It is some kind of model for many sagas to come, but it stops short of real science-fiction when the fiction speaks of our own world through another layer of time or space.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

","Peter Jackson did it again! He made another beautiful movie! <br/><br/>However, this is, in my opinion the least good of the 3 films! But that certainly doesn't mean I didn't like it!!!!

Amazing! <br/><br/>Peter Jackson is in my opinion one of the best directors I know!<br/><br/>I don't know what I have to say more about this excellent movie!

"UACW","Null","1","2","15 November 2006"," Famous Last Words
","Yes, I too was duly impressed with The Two Towers. I found it a better film than Fellowship, and still found Fellowship to be a great movie, so my impression of The Two Towers is that it is a great work.<br/><br/>It's the second of three, and has not had the advantage Lucas had with The Empire Strikes Back. Potentially it suffers the same fate as Titanic, where everybody knows the outcome.<br/><br/>(I was very surprised to hear Jay Leno broadcast that he has never read LoTR - that he has not read it is no surprise, considering who he is; that he should admit this is amazing: He's telling the whole world what they might not already understand about him.)<br/><br/>Understanding that it takes jumping through quite a few hoops to pull off makes it all the more interesting to watch, but Jackson's sense for the dramatic is great. There are scenes leading up to Helm's Deep where the editing does it all - scenes that had the public in our theatre wrestling with themselves and their emotions, and there is no way Tolkien himself could have brought out such matters in the book itself.<br/><br/>I think the music got a bid grandiose at times, a bit overpowering, but on the whole it was a good score, unlike the 'art' of composers Arnold and especially Williams who have this uncanny ability to totally ruin a movie.<br/><br/>Gollum was a major feat. Many have said it's the best CGI ever, and one would be hard put to not agree. It certainly shames ILM thoroughly.<br/><br/>Woods' Frodo is still a disappointment. One reviewer in the UK praised Astin for saving the scenes where Woods looks like he's going to make a pass at him. I agree: Woods more or less looks the part, but I don't think we're seeing great acting here. Astin, however, does a remarkable job - he does impress, and much more than in Fellowship.<br/><br/>The girls love Orlando Bloom. His is a bit of Errol Flynn. My hero is Viggo, who doesn't have a clean face in 179 minutes. The portrayal of Strider brings home the gritty reality of a story that in book form was cloaked in niceties.<br/><br/>The sex angle is mostly lost in the book too, but here we have lots of it, and a possible love triangle as well. This is well done of Jackson in my opinion: LoTR is otherwise too much of a 'guys story', and it makes it all so much more real.<br/><br/>Time and again I found myself in a position - a predicament - unlike that of the reader of the book. Where the book offers a fantasy with lots of cool characters and a derring- do plot, the movie, with its incredible realism, makes you a part of the story, and you can't really close your eyes and fall off to sleep - you live in this world, a world that is basically an evil, threatening one.<br/><br/>I think Jackson has transcended Tolkien: He's taken LoTR and given it a vision, and I am sure he and his crew have studied the book meticulously, and therefore been able to bring out detail most readers did not notice or soon forgot.<br/><br/>Elsewhere at the IMDb one can read of dissatisfied surfers who don't want to wait another year for the finale, who think that six months is too long to wait for a SE DVD; and I think the irony here is thick.<br/><br/>For starters, JRR Tolkien was a professor and expert and lover of the English language; and yet here we find some of the worst abuses of it ever. And no one seems capable of even reflecting on the themes presented by JRR; it's more about how good the CGI is, how good other special effects are, or in the best possible case how well the movie follows the book. And yet JRR had something very important to say. Here's a message that could be debated for a long time, with the human race the great benefactor.<br/><br/>But no. We shall instead agree that Smeagol is well done and that some of the helicopter landscape shots are well formatted and that Treebeard is convincing, Mr Greenleaf is still the swooner, and that Aragorn son of Arathorn is a fitting successor to Middle Earth."
"FilmFanInTheHouse","9","1","2","16 October 2006"," If you thought the first film was a MASTERPIECE, you should see this.
","There are not many films which produce superior sequels. This is one of the few which do. If you thought the first film was great, wait till you see this once.<br/><br/>The story is a lot more exciting, with it continuing straight after the last film. The actors which brought this world to life. They all gave outstanding performances again. Brad Dourif created a sinister Wormtongue and Andy Serkis really brought Gollum to life. I feel that if Serkis didn't portray him, to character wouldn't seem as real.<br/><br/>All the special effects were superb. The use of 'bigatures' really improved the environment. If Peter Jackson and his team used CGI instead, i feel they wouldn't have captured it right. The CGI which was used was also very impressing. Trying to figure out which orcs and soldiers are actors and which are CGI, can be a real challenge. The character of Gollum was also a CGI masterpiece. Andy Serkis together which the characters looks, really brought him to life. <br/><br/>The music was a wonderful treat again, and Howard Shore did another great job again. He really added to the characters and moved the story along. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen any of the film before, i would highly suggest you catch them, as they are really a HUGE part of cinema history."
"Youngbuck11","10","1","2","4 September 2006"," A gritty masterpiece
","I'd say that this is the most action oriented film of the trilogy. It has so many CGI achievements that it isn't even funny. And, in terms of action, tops the Fellowship by a long shot.<br/><br/>This is a much more gritty war film, though, and doesn't have the cheery magical feel that the first film has. This is an action packed film that is pretty long. The only problem is, though I wouldn't really call it a problem, that it is kind of slow until we finally get to the big battle at the end.<br/><br/>The Merry and Pippin story is, obviously, the slowest because they are with tree-beard. But I enjoy watching those scenes. They are so awesome from a animation point-of-view.<br/><br/>But once you get to the battle and when the Ents start destroying Isengard, it's awesome!! (Not that the whole film isn't).<br/><br/>I think, though, that this is of the three films has the worst replay value. This is an awesome film to see in theaters and, maybe, watch it on DVD once or twice. But you can't watch it all the way through like you can Fellowship without nodding off a few times.<br/><br/>But still, this is an epic film that I love and wouldn't change a thing.<br/><br/>-Chris"
"Self_Proclaimed","4","1","2","3 September 2006"," Decent movie, read the book first
","The entire Lord of the Rings movie trilogy is a complete travesty. I read these books when I was very young (I'm 24 now) and after watching the movies and seeing the new covers for the books, my disappointment was heightened. One of the major purposes of any work of fiction is to exercise the imagination in the form of creating images of the things in the work, especially the characters. Now, when someone reads these books after watching the movies (even The Hobbitt) the reader will have a preset image of the characters that they've seen. The Lord of the Rings is one of history's greatest series of fictional books simply because of the imagination put forth in creating an entire world to base it on; that's now basically ruined because of the movies. A good comparison would be the Dune series, which I now feel uncomfortable reading simply because I saw the Sci-fi channels presentations of the book and Children of Dune. The only reason that the movie deserves a 4 is because of the quality of it."

Obviously, I didn't think this was as good as the first and the third parts of the trilogy, but it was still good. The battle sequence near the end was pretty much the high point of the second movie, but everything before that didn't have a whole lot of action attached to it.<br/><br/>Of course, I would never, ever, ever give any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies anything below a seven or so, so I am giving this an eight. At least more exciting action was found in the movie that came after!"
"brianbush","6","1","2","13 September 2005"," Not at all what I expected, on two counts.
","This second installment, from a production standpoint, was far ahead of Fellowship of the Rings visually. The effects had a much more tangible, polished feel to them. The story also carried less ""pomp"" to it, less feeling of faked excitementthe ""look at us we're excited and pumped and you should be too no, really"" effect. That being said, I could not escape the injury done to Faramir, whose character had a solid nobility that lent so much to the Faramir/Boromir and father storyline. Without it, nearly a sixth of the storyline loses its solidity of purpose, and is an excellent example of how to cheapen the power of powerful stories.<br/><br/>I could live with splitting the books at different moments (though it meant I felt like I was gypped at the end), and I could even see the appeal of diverting Frodo's quest, but cheapening Faramir's character for a conveniently timed ""emotional moment"" between Sam and Frodo just left me feeling like I'd been used like a cheap date."

I think A perfect murder was a great suspense movie and I love his character in GI Jane because it was so different from his other films. I'd love to see his paintings and poetry more on the internet. He adds so much excitement to his movies I think he is just a fantastic actor and I can't wait to see him do more films.

"Evangelion_Fan","8","1","2","13 May 2005"," Good movie, but the weakest of the three
","The Two Towers is a good movie, but out of the three LotR movies it is by far the weakest.Peter Jackson's terrible choice in casting Elijah Wood as Frodo (a truly terrible choice that you would realize if you have read the books, given Wood's weak acting ability) is overlooked due to the mesmerizing performance of Andy Sirkis as Gollum, and Sean Astin's increasingly strong performance as Sam Gamgee.<br/><br/>Other weak points include the Battle of Helm's Deep, which is completely changed for the simplistic cinema-goer having only a dozen remaining men ride out on horses (absolutely done for Hollywood's sake)as well as being poorly designed strategically. Then there is Peter Jackson's choice to make Faramir tempted by the ring, which completely changes the character from the book. As well, having to have Treebeard actually see the cut down trees to make him go to war (I can only suppose that having it this way instead of all the Ents deciding to go to war at their meeting, as done in the book, was done to accurately reflect the views of many people today: don't go to war unless it's right in your face, don't do anything to prevent loss unless it affects you). Then making Rohan look pathetic and having 2000 elves show up to help out was a little weak.<br/><br/>Overall though, this movie is strong, and anchored by Gollum. Good but not great, though I would still place it above most movies these days."
"fivemagix","10","1","2","10 March 2005"," Grima Wormtongue rules!
","If you ask me, Grima Wormtongue is the coolest character in TTT. Gollum is great too, but Grima takes the cake. The script and the way Brad Dourif acts it out, it's just amazing. Grima is an awful guy, but he makes me laugh and his scenes are my favorites in the movie. I did not know the name Brad Dourif before, turns out he's the voice of Chucky too! Awesome.<br/><br/>What makes the LOTR trilogy so great to me is all the supporting characters in small roles, such as Grima. ""The Mouth of Sauron"" in the extended version of ROTK is another favorite. And Denethor, too.<br/><br/>All in all, the cast is doing a pretty incredible job. My only complaints are Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Boromir (Sean Bean), and, of course, the fact that Cate Blanchett talks like a man. She's supposed to be this breathtaking elf, the most attractive female you'll ever find. And here she is with a voice like somebody's grandfather who's been smoking for fifty years. Still, these movies are brilliant and already classics. Bottom line."

Boromir (Sean Bean) is dead, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom), and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden (Bernard Hill). The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction. The corrupt wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee), under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth. The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White (Sir Ian McKellen), who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him. One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum (Andy Serkis), has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt. Doom. The War of the Ring has now begun! Will the War of the Ring cause mass destruction and chaos or will the ring be fallen into the hands of the Dark Lords?<br/><br/>TO BE CONTINUED..........<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: WOW AGAIN!"

","In my comment on 'The Fellowship of the Ring' I made the mistake of stating I had not written any of the Tolkien books. Although not untrue, obviously what I meant to say was that I hadn't read any of them. And with this I again like to begin my commentary, as to make clear I value 'The Two Towers' as a movie, not as the filming of a book.<br/><br/>The fellowship of 9 from part 1 are reduced to 7... uhm 8 and split up: Sam and Frodo keep on carrying the ring to Mordor, Pip and Merry are captured by some mean looking orks and the man, midget and elf trio are following these orks to rescue the two hobbits. Gandalf meanwhile takes a part as well, as he's 'reborn' even stronger and mightier than before. Talk about your deus ex machina...<br/><br/>If 'Fellowship' was rather boring and one-directed (with events just happening over and over again until the three hours were full), 'Two Towers' is more intense but also more unclear and messy than that. It is darker than part one, but is introducing way to many characters that doesn't really matter for the continuing of the story. If part one had that problem, part two is taking it to new heights. Worst part are the dream sequences with Liv Tyler... what was that all about? Too long, boring and unimportant. Bad film-making.<br/><br/>One of the main treats of Two Towers should be Gollum, or Smeagol (why not give every character 2 names so nobody understands it anymore). Gollum wants the ring Frodo carries, but finds himself loyal to his master as well. Now this could be interesting. Too bad nothing is really happening with this conflict, except the endless and countless monologues of Gollum... a missed chance.<br/><br/>The end battle should cover up for everything, but it's more silly and slapstick kinda funny than intense (dwarf-tossing...). And of course it had to end with the second deus ex machina scene by Gandalf. On the other side of middle earth though things get even wackier, with silly looking trees (did they run out of budget?) attacking the Tower of Saruman. Watch out for the flooding scene... it has B-movie written all over it.<br/><br/>Although I can understand why these movies are appealing to some (in particular the ones who love the Tolkien books), there is no way you can say The Two Towers is one of the best movies ever. There are so many moments the tension drops, so many silly hold-ups, a cast (although trying) undermined by the CGI. In a way, Two Towers is more compelling than Fellowship, but on the whole it doesn't even live up to it's very mediocre prequel. Let's just hope for the best for Return of the King. 5/10."

","Lord of the rings...<br/><br/>When I saw the first LOTR#1 I was really confused about the plot, couldn't match one with the other, but since it was one of those movies with elves,I personally adored the idea so much to leave out the next two movies and first of all read those books! So I did. And now that I finally saw LOTR#2 I am disappointed. I watched it with a friend that didn't read the books, but saw the first movie, and he kept asking why and what and who and where, I don't think that is the way a good movie should be! The only pleasure part was the battle (good atmosphere, screenplay) and not to forget good chosen music! I know that this movie is a really hard job to do, but still this is no excuse. And after all the special effects aren't that great(Golum), but they aren't bad either. I'd call it all together a good try. But the movie as a whole has no atmosphere and that is sad because it's the most important thing to feel what you see. IT could have been amazing with that great story, cast, photography,... the effort to make it good looking can be seen and it looks great, but after all this is only the background ""for"" a movie.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Over a year ago, during my winter vacation, I was surfing through the internet for movie showtimes. I had wanted to watch a movie with a cousin, and did not know what to watch. Curious, I looked up for this very movie and asked my cousins if it was okay to watch. My feelings towards the Lord of the Rings trilogy has never been any different since then.<br/><br/>Having watched this before ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", I was introduced to a completely different world and at an awkward time, mind you. I was amazed at the many creatures, all the battles, and other bad things going on in this distant world. ""The Two Towers"" displayed many wonderful things on screen, including all the special effects, which was amazing to many audiences.<br/><br/>A bit of advice: Do watch ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" before taking your time to watch this movie. In my opinion, ""Fellowship"" was a more joyful and more fun movie than this one, which was more appealing to me. This movie does not match up to it, but is nonetheless, great.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8/10--Great!"

I feel that The editors had given in to pressure and 'hollywood-ized' the movie. Making the pace faster, the action more pronounced and the plot, well, not making much sense.<br/><br/> Let's say, helm's deep. Great sets, big army (which, I must add, looks like recycled effects from the Mummy Returns) and lotsa fighting and loud SFX that kept me awake. However, it seems that they have caved themselves in without so much preparing to fight (say, traps in the plains, what not.) There were NO flyers here, so why were there trebuchets in Gondor and not here? Sorry, none of it makes sense to me. It just seems to be a way to make the movie look 'Epic'."

"DarthBill","7","1","2","19 December 2003"," The Dwarf... beware the Dwarf...
","Picking up where ""Fellowship of the Ring"" left off, Frodo and Sam continue to trudge towards Mordor - with the annoying CGI monstrosity Gollum leading the way and mixing it up with Faramir (Boromir's brother) while Aragorn, Legalos, Ghimli and the newly resurrected Gandalf try to save the people of Rohan from Saruman's monsters and reunite the alliances of men. Chaos and mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>Sadly, I didn't like this film as much as I hoped I would. It's a good film overall, but marred by the occasional slow pacing and unnecessary camera mugging. In other words: the dwarf, Ghimli. John Rhys-Davies is a great actor and he was good in ""Fellowship"", but he was terrible here (almost as bad as Rupert Grint in ""Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets"" though not as bad as Jar Jar Binks). He doesn't even feel like he's playing the same character. Ghimli was a capable adventurer in ""Fellowship"" but in ""Two Towers"" he's suddenly become an idiotic clutz who can't ride a horse without falling off or get down a hill without tripping over his stubby feet. And then there was that ""Toss me! Don't tell the elf!"" bit. Oh god that was horrible; it's as if Aragorn was stalling just to make Ghimli say toss me. Peter Jackson wanted comic relief obviously but this was the best he could come up with? Pretty pathetic. I'd rather have a dull, ugly humorless fantasy epic than one who's only source of comic relief is an idiot dwarf. Oddly enough, John Rhys-Davies fairs better at being the voice of Treebeard of the Ents than he does at being Ghimli.<br/><br/>Then there's Gollum, the most over-rated CGI abomination in the history of special effects. I can't even go in depth with this one...<br/><br/>I did like Miranda Otto as Eowyn though, and of course I prefer Treebeard over Gollum, and I liked Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. The battle of Helm's Deep is spectacular, as is the Ents trashing Saruman's castle. Too bad the dwarf and Gollum had to ruin what should have been a classic."
"aah35","6","1","2","19 December 2003"," Good, but not Great
","Clearly, the Lord of the Rings fanatics are taking over ImDb. They have managed to voted ""The Two Towers"" into the number 4 spot on the all-time list. Ridiculous. Certainly, ""Two Towers"" is a good movie, but it has several problems that prevent it from attaining the greatness of its predecessor, ""Fellowship of the Ring"".<br/><br/>First, all those useless, lingering shots of Liv Tyler make me conclude that Peter Jackson, as great a job as he has done on the series, could not resist the Michael Bay-like tendency to use his film as a platform for admiring the goddess-like qualities of some members of the fairer sex. Second, the slow-motion, close-up shots of the women and children cowering in the shelter of helms' deep, anticipating a gory fate. I certainly understand their fear, but all of these sequences seem manipulative and heavy handed. Frankly, I was plenty worried about the fates of the defenders without having to be reminded (repeatedly) by Mr. Jackson that there were mothers and children present, too. Finally, in ""Fellowship"", Mr. Jackson had a little less confidence in the patience of his audience, and he was therefore much more economical in his translation of Tolkien's narrative onto the screen. In ""Two Towers"", he throws economy out the window, and the film suffers as a result. When your film exceeds three hours AND you find yourself cutting in numerous slow-motion sequences, a little self-examination is in order. I am not calling for elimination of crucial elements of Tolkien's story, but successful adaptation from page to screen requires some clever narrative devices to truncate long passages into digestible visual material. In this regard, ""Two Towers"" is far inferior to ""Fellowship"". I hope that Jackson, in ""Return of the King"", shows more self-control.<br/><br/>Still, Mr. Jackson is on the verge of one of the most extraordinary achievements in film history. He deserves all of his success."

","Spectacular truly it is. And magnificent and epic. And another long list of nice adjectives. But it distorts heavily the character of the original novel. Most who voted did it thinking of Tolkien's work, I believe, and not of this production. I mean Jackson is an excellent director and I am a great fan of his, and even the first chapter was quite ok (although not astronomically great), but THIS chapter is quite bad. Battles are changed (for example no elves appear at Helm's Deep in the book, especially not high elves!), Gimli becomes a parody of himself, parts are added to the events (poor Faramir!), epic parts like the Ents are resized and reduced... the best actor is definitely the only non-human: Gollum. Or at least he's the one who respects the most the original script, in words and thoughts. As usual, those few who haven't read the book will love this movie. The others will probably just tolerate it. I hardly did."

","This movie fails where Part I failed too: only about half the movie is interesting.  This time round the boring bit was Sam and Frodo who seem so stupid (they get into mortal danger each time we see them) and their journey tells nothing interesting.  Even the appearance of Gollum can't save this dreadful story. The second of three stories is Aragon and friends who meet humans and then battle it out with orcs.  This is quite interesting, but the battle and the end takes too long too keep me awake. But then there's the third story with Merry and Peppin and their fantastic story in meeting Treebeard.  This part definitely saves the story from boring me to death and the end with the destruction of Saruman's Lair (the name escapes me) by the ents is one of the most impressive scenes I ever saw.<br/><br/>Overall not a bad movie, but could be a bit more exiting in the Frodo Sam story line, I almost hope when they do something stupid again  they just get killed or featured much less in Part III."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>I must admit that the Two Towers was my least favourite book of the trilogy which was why I was reluctant to go and watch the film when it came out at cinema. To be quite frank I was blown away by it! I felt mesmerised and bewildered by the fact that I enjoyed it more than the novel itself.<br/><br/>The battle at Amon Hen in the first film is belittled by the massive siege of Helm's Deep with an army of 10,000 Uruk-hai. The battle is spectacular and has brilliant special effects; each person is individually modelled and the battle just looks magnificent.<br/><br/>Also, a new addition to the trilogy is the interesting character of Smeagol who is completely computer generated. He also adds a light of humour to the otherwise dark, evil based film. We also see for the first time the Ents (giant tree-like creatures) who wreak destruction at Saruman's tower of Orthanc. <br/><br/>The best scene, hands down, is the battle of Helm's Deep; the scope is so frighteningly effective it makes you feel like you're standing on the wall yourself. It easily surpasses the first film and stays in my top ten best films.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is truly a movie masterpiece."

I am saddened that this installment did not get named Oscar Best Picture for out of all of the Nominees, I would have chosen this over the MUCH overrated 'Chicago' any day.

The book is filled with immense detail of every surrounding and every person, thing and story happening. If that was to be included into the movie, it'll be a 6 hour (boring) movie instead of the exciting three.<br/><br/>I have to agree though, the scene where frodo, sam and gollum went to gondor wasnt necessary, I wanted to jump out of my seat also and exclaim that the scene shouldnt be in the movie.

The film is not here to replace the book, some Tolkien berserk Fanatics don't seem to get it. The film is not perfect, I agree, but perfection doesn't exist. Some things are changed from the book because it is a different media. Yes, Arwen has more scenes, the elfs join men in the battle of helm's deep; it's all part of the adaptation process. Arwen brings the emotional depth of the movie to another level. The elfs join men in the battle because there would be no tension if the audience thought there was no hope at all for the people of Rohan. Peter Jackson and his wife have done a fantastic job.

Once again, I have been proven absolutely correct. However, I must concede that I didn't expect a sequel so soon (within about a year)!<br/><br/>The good news is that this movie ups the ante on its predecessor with a considerably greater emphasis on action. It's a swords and sorcery roller-coaster ride with battle scenes of epic proportions. Once again, the fine landscape of New Zealand is the true scene-stealing star, and Mr. Jackson has impressed me considerably with his burgeoning directorial talent.<br/><br/>It is an impressive film; probably amongst the very best of the large blockbuster films of the last decade. However, I do not agree that it should maintain position 9 on the IMDb top 250 where ""Jean de florette"" makes little impression at 246. For this reason I gave ""The Two Towers"" a 1, hopefully to bring it down a little. I implore the amateur movie critics of the IMDb to consult my greater knowledge and experience before making their own embarrasingly ill-judged opinions.<br/><br/>Owing to the continued popularity of the subject matter, I believe this particular movie franchise could run and run.

The acting is great and the scenery and effects are awesome. I'm not quite as excited on later watchings. What has me bothered (particularly during the second half) is when the movie strays from the source material. The original story is one of the great fantasy works ever, why go off in other directions? It's not just that the movie is unfaithful to the book, it's that there's no reason for it to go elsewhere. I'm quite sure there's no one working the script with credentials approaching Tolkien's. So I just don't get with the point of following the books 80% of the way and playing with the other 20%, but I'll reserve final judgment until Return Of The King. Post script: I should have qualified my reservations about the changes - Haldir and the elves coming to Helm's Deep is a Jackson invention and the coolest thing in the Two Towers. Enjoy."

","**SPOILERS INCLUDED**<br/><br/>I must admit that I was surprised to see how much fanfare and praise LOTR: Fellowship of the Ring got when it was first released.  I'm not really a fan of fantasy films, I just enjoy good movies and, to my surprise, Fellowship was a pretty good one.  In my eyes it was flawed no doubt; me not being versed in fantasy stories, much less Tolkien's books, there were some aspects of the story/characters that I didn't particularly like.  But hey, that's my bias I guess.  Nevertheless it was a very good film and I was actually anticipating its sequel, The Two Towers.<br/><br/>Like almost all sequels, The Two Towers is a victim of the sophomore jinx. I wasn't as moved with Two Towers as I was with Fellowship.  The battle scene was good, and the landscapes as expected were spectacular.  But the story truly lagged at some parts.  The whole business with the tree people' was pretty boring; although in the end we finally see what their purpose to the big scheme of things is.  What was also annoying was how hard it was to understand what most of the characters were saying.I found myself rewinding many times to try and make out what was being said.  What was pretty surprising was how little we see of the hobbits, who are at the crux of the story.   <br/><br/>The Two Towers attempts to move at the same pace that the Fellowship moved at, but ultimately fails to do so.  So many new characters were introduced to the point where you just lose track and cease to care about what is going on.  So much was crammed into this film without much background.  Fellowship kept you interested throughout, even through much dialogue and so-called slow spots'.  The story of The Two Towers, however, lacks the same punch that Fellowship had, and simply lags at some parts.  <br/><br/>With all this said, this is the 2nd in a trilogy, so I can only hope that the final installment brings everything together to make the whole LOTR experience memorable.<br/><br/>One more thingI am surprised that these two films are rated so high here at IMDB (LOTR 1 at #6; LOTR 2 at #10)????  They are good films, but to be rated in the top 10 along with undeniable masterpieces like Godfather I/II, Shawshank Redemption & Casablanca I feel is a travesty!!  To the biggest fan of these types of movies/stories, could they really put this aside The Godfather, Usual Suspects, Memento or Casablanca and HONESTLY say that it ranks equally with any of those films?  NO WAY!!  I see nothing in these films that make them as groundbreaking' as the ones listed.  Aside from the CGI eye candy what really is there to hold on to, like the marvelous ACTING in the films listed above?  Will LOTR really be remembered 20 years from now as timeless classics like those?  For the hype and monetary aspects, maybe..but for the actual movies, I doubt it very much.  I really feel the hoopla around the LOTR franchise is undeserved and exaggerated.<br/><br/>The Matrix remains the only trilogy that hasn't disappointed, and for all of its groundbreaking leaps it still doesn't get the respect and recognition it truly deserves."

I mean, even in the first movie when he left out Tom Bombadil I could understand the reasoning.  But if you're going to cut something for reasons of time, DON'T ADD ANYTHING! Everything that was added to this movie was total crap from an oliphaunt's ass.  Any true fan of Tolkien should be incensed at the utter butchering of the story.  I could go into examples, but I'm sorta strapped for time currently, and I'm sure they've been discussed at length here (I'm a little late, but I just registered here, so... well you know).  The only redeeming qualities were the first 10 minutes, and the way they did gollum (although the portrayal of the character was more humourous than it should have been).<br/><br/>

With the absolute genious of the Fellowship of the Ring, this movie had a lot of hype to live up to.  However, I can safely say that this certainly does a more than adequate job of doing so.  This movie picks up shortly after the other leaves off, both in terms of the plot, and in terms of the brilliance of the acting, directing, and cinematography.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson once again proves himself to be the genious that he is.  The first movie was more of an introduction piece, allowing those unfamiliar with the story to get acquainted, and those fanatics a chance to reengross themselves in the tale.  This installment follows a much different course, as it focuses on the different internal conflicts of the characters.  In particular it focuses on Aragorn, Legolas, Gimlee, and Frodo.<br/><br/>While Fellowship of the Ring followed the hobbits around, this movie focuses more on the three warriors, Gimlee, Legolas, and Aragorn and has a bit more action because of this.  The plot does not suffer from this added action, and still retains the balance of action and plot that was so essential in the first movie.<br/><br/>The first movie had fight scenes, but they did not even compare to the fight scenes in this movie.  Helmsdeep is one of the most impressive battle scenes in memory.  Tens if not Hundreds of thousands of Orcs swarming the castle at Helms Deep fighting against the desperate people of Rohan.  It is truly astounding.<br/><br/>As in the first one, the acting is superb, and they do not ever really let the script slip.

","If this movie sucked so bad, then why did it get an Academy nomination from an academy that generally does not put fantasy movies in high regard? Remember, that Fellowship was also nominated for Best Picture, and it will not surprise anyone if ROTK also be nominated.  I don't think an entire trilogy has EVER been nominated for Best Picture.  Think about that. <br/><br/>
Also, if this movie sucked so bad, check out two sites which have collections of lots of critics reviews.  Metacritic.com gave an aggregate rating of 90 to Two Towers.  That blows almost every movie in 2002 away. Also, check out rottentomatoes.com.  Same story.  I'm not saying movie reviewers are god, but they sure watch more movies than anyone writing on these message boards.  Hell, they do it for a living.  Being as cynical as they are, they still by all accounts gave TTT (and LOTR) generally rave reviews.  What does this mean for people who trash TTT and LOTR?  It means that they are either incredibly cynical and will rarely enjoy movies.  Or they are just incredibly stupid, and don't have the intellectual capacity to do so."

","Artistically beautiful, but bored me to tears.  I could not stay awake. Most of the film was watching people walk around not doing much of anything.

","These films are little more than eye (lesser eye) candy. There are hideous omissions by Jackson. `A director ought to know better"" Jackson DID know  better. There is no curse in Elvish, Entish, or the tongues of Men bad enough for such treachery. Down with Jackson's and his movie!' - Book II, paraphrase. How many people will NOT read Tolkien because of this 3 part film fiasco? Jackson could have stayed close to the text.  The first glaring departure from it was when Gandalf did not use his staff to create a flash when Bilbo put on the Ring at the party.  This allowed for many sins. There are worse faux pa, but I shall not mention them here, except for one other particularly nasty flaw... the mis-attribution of lines both to and by movie chaarcters.  This is unforgivable. Here's a bad one- Wormtongue: `Ah, but you are alone. Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all your life seems to shrink, the walls of your bower closing in about you, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in? So fair, yet so cold like a morning of pale Spring still clinging to Winter.' I mean really, what have we here?  Wormtongue the White?  Grima the Poet? Gandalf said these words to Eomer.  And there is worse to come. Alas that Peter Jackson does not drink from the chalice of  misattribution folly and horror as we who have read Tolkien well! In sum, this quotation from Denethor II will suffice: `Have I not tasted it (the vileness of his straying from the written word) now many nights upon my tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so!' I even fell asleep during the second flick...in the heat of the Battle at Helm's Deep.  I do not think I care to see the third installation. One's imagination is brought to life by the words of J.R.R. Tolkien and said images are precious to me.  Jackson's works are a denigration -- not an enhancement for me. I do not need my mind's eye disturbed so.<br/><br/>Foo.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>Dr. Prevarite"
"mictlantechutli","6","1","2","20 January 2003"," Pretty but Sad (spoilers)
","I want to like this film, but I can't.  Why?  For starters, and yes, I'm sure I'll get a lot of flack for this, I feel the main thing going for this picture, and the trilogy as a whole, is that is kowtows to geeks and makes them feel as though a geek film can be a great film.  Unfortunately, as this movie and the first installment show, that's sadly not true.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  I've been a ""geek"", by society's definition, for most of my life.  Comic books?  Check.  Roleplaying Games?  Check.  But what you really have ask yourself when you view this film is, ""If it wasn't based on this book that we've all read and love, would we think it was so damned fantastic when compared to truly great films?""  The answer, if anyone is truthful, is ""Probably not"".  The reason for the trilogy's ridiculously overinflated ratings is simple:  It had a ready-made tribe of fans ready to love it, no matter what.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is beautiful.  The effects are a treat for the eye. The battles are sweeping and epic.  Unfortunately, due to the massive number of characters in the stories, and the one-note nature of many of them, each and every one comes off as a cutout.  Only the love story between Eowyn and Aragorn, and Smeagol's madness, have *any* moxie, and they don't have enough to buoy the whole picture.  Shameless catering to modern tastes has Legolas ""skating"" on a shield.  Yeah, that was in the book. (It wasn't, but you knew that).  Gimli is portrayed as a bumbling fool, solely for laughs.  We're shown 50 zillion times how the ring corrupts. (We got it the first few thousand times the point was belabored in the first movie).<br/><br/>It's sad that people in search of validation for their lifestyle feel that they need to champion such a flawed film.  All it takes is one look at IMDB's top 250...when you see that this movie is ahead of classics like Apocalypse Now and Rear Window, you know that the fanboys (and girls) are taking over the asylum."
"Malk","4","1","2","7 January 2003"," Translation is not an excuse for a movie filled with cliché
","I may not be a movie maker, or writer, or even a Phd in Tolkien World. Nevertheless, I am a great fan of him and of his books. I saw many commentaries around said that the issues on the movie are because of the difficult to make a book translation to the movies.It seems to me people are trying to refuse their own disappointments with the movie with this argument. The movements in the timeline of the movie are the first cliché, much like episode I and dozens of other movies. Lets make a quick comparison, episode I and Two Towers have three stories running at the same time: Frodo and Sam going to Mordor, Anakim Skywalker in a space battle, Gungans going to war in the fields, Merry and Pippin and treebeard, Obi-wan Kenobi and Qui-gon Jin against Darth Maul, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in Helms Deep. 1) Chances are against the characters (Ok...we need drama) 2-TT) Frodo is captured by Faramir at the same time that treebeard and the ents decide to do nothing, at the same time the fortress begins to fall. 2-EPI) Anakin is lost inside the Trade Federation Ship, at the same time Amidala and hers guard are captured by the Vice Roy at the same Time Qui-Gon dies. 3-TT)The new hope appears with Eomer coming to help Helm´s Deep, at the same time treebeard discovers that fangorn is being destroyed (how could he not know that already remains a mistery) and calls the other ents to destroy Isengard at the same time Faramir set Frodo free. I have only looked to this small part of the movie, but there´s more to tell about the whole of it, I will just tell about some more clichés: 1) The father that does not want his daughter to marry 2) The hero that everyone know is a main character falls in battle (and everyone knows that he will return - it adds no Drama) 3) The hero that does not want the power that is his. 4) The king that does not listen to counsel. 5) The calm heroes that doesn´t want to enter the war, although all evidencies seems that they had no choice. 6) The useless character that has a great idea (Pippin).<br/><br/>There´s many more that I will not put here now. In my opinion, Tolkien´s world is greater than this and much more interesting."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","2","7 January 2003"," It's not quite the same earthquaking cinematic experience of the original Lord of the Rings film, but The Two Towers still comes across as one of the most powerful and entertaining fantasy action films this
","The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the greatest adventure films ever made, so it's really no surprise that its successor, The Two Towers, falls just slightly short of achieving the same powerful cinematic experience, but it is certainly a worthy installment in what is growing to be a tremendously well-made trilogy. The film starts off a little bit slowly, as it picks up where the last film left on in true sequel form, following Frodo and Sam as they continue their journey that was interrupted so suddenly by the end credits of the last film. <br/><br/>This fabulously written film, which only takes artistic liberties in clarifying points that may have grown vague from the last film (the way the best adaptation films do), may go  a little too deep into the amazingly intricate storyline to keep the attention of some of the younger viewers or some of those not familiar with the novels, but the experience remains just as intense and entertaining. The war for Middle Earth is officially underway, and the battle scenes are some of the most impressive that I've ever seen in a film. <br/><br/>Generally, I think that a film with as many computer generated special effects as can be seen in The Two Towers is destined to suffer at least slightly from them, but they are so seamless and impressive here that they really do not take away from the quality of the film. The majority of the battle scenes are done almost entirely on computer, but are still incredibly entertaining and convincing. There are walking talking trees in the film, which was a little off-putting at first, but are successful adaptations from the novel and are amazingly convincing on screen. <br/><br/>(spoilers) Pippin and Merry, the two characters from the original film with the insatiable appetites and the endless sources of comic relief, are back in the second film playing the same characters with very little change other than that they seem to have matured quite a bit from their original roles, quite possibly because of their increasing experience in the war for Middle Earth. They spend the majority of their screen time in the film with the walking trees, trying to get them to take them to the battle but having little success. But once they finally make it there, they make a surprisingly effective and creative contribution to their side's participation in the battle.<br/><br/>Clearly, a black and white movie review written by some guy you've never seen or heard of (me) cannot do justice to the breathtaking things that happen in this film, you just have to see it for yourself. Brad Dourif, who is most famous for his role as the voice of the lovable Chucky, the doll from the Child's Play films, and for, I might add, his excellent contribution as the gas station attendant at the beginning of Urban Legend, takes on a role in The Two Towers that fits his iconography perfectly. This capable actor who has been acting mainly in B-movies for the majority of his career has made a seamless jump to a part in one of the greatest trilogies of all time. Now all we need is a part for Bruce Campbell and all of the underrated B-movie actors will be back in the spotlight!<br/><br/>The comic relief in this movie is one of its best features (aside from the startlingly brutal and convincing battle scenes, of course), and none of it is cheesy or just thrown in to get a cheap laugh. There is a delightful scene where Aragorn (once again played spectacularly by Viggo Mortensen, in another of the best performances of his career) and Gimli (the lovable but amazingly powerful dwarf played by John Rhys-Davies) sneak around to the outside of the castle as it is being bombarded during the battle, and Gimli timidly asks Aragorn to toss him to the bridge because he can't jump over the gap himself, stopping Aragorn to ask him shyly not to tell the dwarf (Legolas, played by Orlando Bloom).<br/><br/>This is a powerful adventure film that knows when to be funny, when to be romantic, when to make you cringe, cheer, cry, and gape. It entertains even through the slow parts, even going so far as to throw in a little schizophrenia scene with the little goblin that Frodo and Sam enlist as a reluctant guide. This scene is reminiscent of Geri's Game, Pixar's exceedingly amusing animated short film that precedes A Bug's Life, but like the rest of the comic relief, it does not dampen the effect of the rest of the movie by making it laughable, but rather allows us to relax between scenes of breathtaking scenery and cringe inducing battles. For the second year in a row, The Lord of the Rings is sure to be an enormous contender in the Oscar race."
"Anthony_Boyd","10","1","2","25 December 2002"," the nitpicks with this movie are accurate, but insignificant
","Although I'm not going to comment on WHAT the ending was, there are spoilers here.  Be wary.<br/><br/>I read the first 200 comments (or so) that came in.  And now that I've seen the movie, I mostly agree.  Treebeard DID look like a puppet, with the background obviously bluescreened in (the lighting was different between the foreground and background).  I also agree, after Galdalf appeared at Helm's Deep, the battle scenes pretty much just stopped and the movie moved on. That made a terrifying battle feel less powerful, because the audience didn't get much of a taste for how the battle turned.  And I agree that Faramir is a different man onscreen than in the book, and Gimli is made to look far less threatening since he's the brunt of a lot of jokes.  And I'll throw in a couple gripes of my own.  The Ents took a long time to decide to stay out of the battles.  Lots of discussion.  But then Treebeard lets out a howl when he sees some trees cut down, and suddenly all the Ents march to war without comment.  That made the Ents appear inconsistent with their own ways.  Made 'em look like a plot device.  Another gripe: Sam gives a speech that didn't sound like it was written by Tolkein.  Perhaps it was, but it felt more to me like outsiders were messing with the writing.  Finally, when the last few men of Helm's Deep ride out on horses, the enemies basically fall like dominoes as the riders pass.  This is unrealistic.  Part of what I liked about the first movie was that, although the odds seemed impossible, the movie showed you how they survived, how heroic the men were.  But in this scene with the riders, there is no way to explain what is happening, it's just cheap.<br/><br/>But having read and agreed with almost every complaint, I still give the movie a TEN out of TEN.  Faramir's character wasn't destroyed, he'll be fine in ROTK.  The Ents were still quite cool.  The audience I was with needed some comic relief after all the seriousness (and the sheer length of the movie!) and welcomed it from Gimli.  The battle at Helm's Deep was still spectacular -- I whispered, ""I'm actually scared for them"" even though I knew who would win.  You see, all the little gripes that people write about the movie are exactly that... little.  On the things that mattered greatly -- did the plot move forward, was the scope of the battle properly conveyed, did the audience feel that they were experiencing a fantasy world with a rich and interesting story -- on all fronts, I say yes.  I was fascinated. Riveted.  And I'll go back to see it a second time without hesitation."
"Jorgosch","8","1","2","21 December 2002"," Stunning visuals but story leaves to be desired
","Quote: The Good: In terms of cinematic and visual scope - astounding. The camera sweeps and the battles were awesome. I really felt like I was there. Gollum was probably the best aspect of the whole movie (his inner struggle was nicely done). Gimli's comic relief was nicely done too.<br/><br/>The Bad: After watching it, I just kinda sat there going, ""ehh..."". I dunno, the first one has this magical appeal to me (seen it 4 times already) but this one just kinda fell flat. Maybe I set my expectations too high.<br/><br/>For one, the musical score failed IMO. I could only discern one new musical track... everything else was either from the first or too ambient (Enya-like female choirs)<br/><br/>Character development was nil for the new characters. It was too hard to get any feel for them. It just felt like, ""here's blahblah, son of blahblah"" and that was it. Grima appeared to come out of nowhere. The King's son also had barely any development and there was one other guy that I had NO IDEA who he was the whole movie (he was always around the King, helped put his armor on).<br/><br/>I could tell that the main focus was the Helm's Deep battle. While that was awesome, the rest just felt kinda shallow and long winded. The first half was especially slow and the last was all fighting w/ no story to back it all up. What was with Gandalf riding in the last scene? Where did he find King Rohan's son? How did Rohan's son's army turn that big??? (in the beginning he said only him and his small legion still fought for Rohan). How did they manage to kill off like the remaining 2,000 or so of Sauraman's troops. Why did that Rohan lady fall in love with Aragorn... they only met for like 2 seconds.<br/><br/>All in all it left me awed but a little unsatisfied. 6.8 out of 10"
"Aaron1375","10","1","2","19 December 2002"," As good as the first.
","This movie was as thouroughly enjoyable as the first chapter in the story. The acting was great, the special effects were great, and the story was great.  It is shaping up to be my favorite trilogy of all time.  This one follows three stories one of Frodo and Sam on their way to Mordor, one of the two hobbits kidnapped in the first one, and the other of Aragon, Gimley, and Legolos and their encounters.  The one that is the main focus to me was the Aragon tale and it was by far the best.  The other two were good as well, but most of the battles happened in the Aragon parts of the story.  I also really enjoyed the expanded roles of Gimley the Drawf and Legolos the elf.  Great effects also abound in this one as the creature Gollum looks a lot better than I thought it would.  Just a great movie, I can't believe there are people that gave this movie a 1.  I mean even if you hated some part of it the scenery alone makes the at least a 3.  I am thinking these people were dragged to the movie kicking and screaming which is why you should never take someone to a movie they don't want to see cause then they give it a 1 out of spite.  It is either that or they are star wars fans who can't stand that there movies don't get the great reviews anymore."
"fred-287","Null","1","2","18 December 2002"," Money well spent
","The crucial question about Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy seems to be: Is it just for Tolkien fans, or a ""general audience""? I went to see it with my mom who's never read Tolkien; she liked Part I last year and liked Part II even more, but then she has her own cinematic agenda (based largely on sets & costumes, plus she loves horses).  As for the story, it was basically ""good vs. evil"" again; she noted that it's easy to tell one from another: the bad guys are hideously ugly, & the good guys aren't.<br/><br/>I read the trilogy over 20 years ago and confess I don't remember most of the middle book, so if Jackson made lots of changes, he could have fooled me.  I remembered certain plot details from Ralph Bakshi's animated 1978 version.  So I knew in advance more or less how Jackson's ""Two Towers"" would begin and end, the rest was up for grabs.  By and large it didn't grab me, but talk about money well spent! The physical authenticity from last year's movie is, if anything, exceeded here, and as for SFX, the Gollum character alone deserves an Oscar.  Can a computer-generated character be said to steal a movie?  It's almost too good; I couldn't take my eyes off Gollum, even when he was off in the corner of the screen; I forgot the various heroic events occurring elsewhere.  Inasmuch as I already know how the story ends, the warped ""humanity"" of Gollum afforded a poignancy to what I know will occur that I never would have anticipated.  If there's a ""tragic figure"" in this tale, Gollum's it, whether it be ""Greek"" tragedy---""What a shame it had to be this way"" -- or ""Christian"" tragedy  --""What a shame it was this way when it could have been some other way.""<br/><br/>But for the most part I found this movie curiously uninvolving in an emotional sense.  There's nothing here remotely as gripping as the death of Boromir in Part I, which made me cry each of the three times I saw it in the cinema.  Part II doesn't even take time for a recap, just plunges in more or less where Part I left off and after a while I felt like a tourist on one of those meticulously planned whirlwind foreign tours, events kept rushing along--""Okay, here's this! Here's that! Let's keep it moving, folks, you can take pictures from the bus!""  Part I told a wonderful story at what seemed it's own natural pace, and the three hours just flew by.  Part II always seems to be running late, and IT'S three hours just pile up.    **** POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWING  *******<br/><br/>
When the new Gandalf appears with the cavalry to lift the siege of Helms Deep, that should have been a real cathartic charge for the audience, but it almost seems over before it starts; there should have been more depiction of the tide turning, as was the case in Bakshi's version.  Also there seemed to be too many things occurring simultaneously, what with Helms Deep AND the tree creatures showing up at Saruman's tower AND yet another battle with Frodo & Sam on hand.  It all seems to get cleared up lickety split so we can send the dynamic duo (plus Gollum) on their not-so-merry way to Part III.  I remember Tolkien's Book 3 much better than 2.  Jackson has his work cut out for him getting everything in.  If he just does justice to the Harrowing of the Shire, I'll settle for that.  Plus Sam's closing line.<br/><br/>I almost envy the non-Tolkien viewers who can just watch a good yarn. Special mention for my single favorite shot, the procession of elves going away with the lanterns, plus the lugubriously juicy Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, a performance every bit as career-capping as that of black-eyed Christopher Lee as Saruman.  Watch them in the tower scene with the army out front, it's two old veterans of cinema shlock working their magic.  I can't wait for their big Harrowing scene in Part 3.  DON'T SCREW THAT UP, JACKSON. <br/><br/>Kudos to Jackson for the shots of the women & kids helplessly awaiting their fate in Helms Deep, reminding us that those most hurt in war aren't necessarily the warriors."
"retributionpublications","10","1","2","18 December 2002"," Absolutely Incredible
","This is a fantastic movie, incredibly filmed without a detail spared. The action sequences are among the best I have ever seen. While it's easy to say that the development of the familiar characters does not hold up well as a film would be by itself, if you take this film within the context of a second installment of a larger series it is a flaw that can be easily omitted. 	The parallel editing sequence that occurs between the major battle scene and that of the hobits talking to the tree people is also oddly paced, making you wonder why Peter Jackson chooses to cut up a fast-paced action sequence with a slow, drab monologue. However, the pace of juxtaposed sequences definitely heightens the feeling of general anxiety that grips you by the throat as the film approaches its climax. The dialogue can also be trying at times...the Sam/Froddo dialogue about being ""brave and strong"" towards the end of the film is trite and cheesy. However, there are also times in the film where we find wonderful prose emitting from the same characters, allowing me to forgive their occasional verbal blunders. 	At the end of the day, I can forgive the film's tiny flaws for the greatness that shadows over it. This film will take home some major awards next year. I have to say...seeing this film on opening night, I felt like a kid again. This is the Star Wars for a new generation. Let's just hope that Peter Jackson will keep this story sacred, and will never have the temerity to pull a ""Lucas"" and to rehash these great films into Hollywood train wrecks 20 years later. Highly recommended."

","I gave Peter Jackson the benefit of every doubt I heard prior to my first viewing of the Two Towers.  For this reason was I doubly shocked to see that it is no more than Mr. Jackson's own version of the story with nothing more than original names and settings.  There was not one aspect of the book he did not manage to alter.  This would not be such a problem, were it not for the fact that this book NEEDED NO ALTERING!!!  These movies remain the most ambitious cinematic endeavor to date, but this most recent installment makes me desperately hope for an even greater one in the future.  This movie shows no respect for the actual story, changing timelines, personalities, events, and everything else that could be changed while still seeming to be based on the book.  In conclusion, the best thing I can say about this last effort is that it was thorough...thorough in its deforming the story, and thorough in disappointing this avid Tolkien reader."

","It is a great pity that people cannot distinguish between great works of literature and the failure to exemplify these works in the cinema graphic medium.<br/><br/>These three films adapted from the great work were shot on low quality film and in a manner to make the greatest profit from as much exploitation of its artisans as possible. For example Peter Jackson knew that he could New Zealand Citizens to be extras at no costs due to the novelty of under taking such a project of this magnitude and glamor in a parochial isolated hometown New Zealand Countryside.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philipa Boynes bought the film rights of the great literature for a massive cost and then hired scriptwriters to prepare the screenplay adaptation in their names at great cost. This was a very poor screenplay if you really loved the books and actually read them which most of the films audience probably never could or did. How the motion Picture Academy members voted it best screenplay adaption and gave the award to these three people is rather suspicious.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very poor with many shots out of focus and overuse of various camera techniques. This has been supported many Cinematographers in many blogs.<br/><br/>The acting performances were very mediocre and the selection of actors was purposefully chosen from Australians and New Zealanders due to Peter Jackson's view that they are better actors than Americans and the British. In fact Australians and New Zealanders have this strange dislike Americans despite consuming their films.<br/><br/>The animations of various creatures was so similar to the vampires in ""dusk till dawn"" it makes you wonder if the CGI people had much imagination. The many gratuitously violent scenes, not described as such in the books, would have been very frightening to children let alone the ridiculous characterization of the Golum. In fact most of the CGI was carried out by Americans hired by Peter Jacksons multi-million dollar CGI suite.<br/><br/>Which at the end of the day makes you wonder where Mr Peter Jackson got the money to not only buy the film rights to the books but to build a multi-million dollar film effects studio in New Zealand.<br/><br/>The whole thing was obviously a massive profit making exercise in profit making with Peter Jackson and his mates securing huge merchandising deals in the planning of the project.It is further proof that the very wealthy and privileged can always demonstrate what their money can achieve not what they themselves can achieve due to any talent or real imagination.<br/><br/>It was not made for the sake of love of a great work of literature but for profit and self aggrandizement. I fully understand that films must make profit but this one really couldn't go wrong with the material and the present day innovations in CGI. I am certain that one day someone will remake it and do it properly and maybe some one like John Boorman who was originally going to make the film.<br/><br/>I am so content in thought that there is a great difference between people like myself and the people who glorify this film and Peter Jackson."

It took 3 hours to tell what could have been told sufficiently and more interestingly in 90 minutes. The main plot elements were: 1) Frodo finds thats the ring is getting heavy 2) Saurons forces are rising 3) Pippin and Merry spend the whole movie in a tree 4) Gollum has 2 personalities. <br/><br/>The use of helicopter shots became very irritating after the 15th use the technique in the 3rd minute of the movie. Also in the middle of the final battle sequence they kept cutting back to a bunch of trees talking, what an idea to keep the action flowing. <br/><br/>The long battle at the end was the same thing over and over. Not to mention both sides had stupid battle plans. The humans defense wasnt even slightly planned out. It was totally unbelievable. <br/><br/>Then the boring subplot with Arwen aerosmiths daughter, I mean really, who cares if she dies. She was in the first one for 5 minutes anyway.<br/><br/>
It is also very silly that this movie is already number 9 on IMDB top 250 movies of all time. I can easily name 10 movies much better than this. The only reason it is so high is because people want to have a little geek war between star wars and lord of the rings so the movies can have a higher rating. <br/><br/>I contemplated leaving early as I started to fall asleep and I had to wake my girlfriend many times.

"cardmongerkaren","2","2","7","3 March 2012"," Weak
","The movie was about as interesting to watch as a dripping faucet. It doesn't do the book any justice. Perhaps the most irksome feature is the fact that the classic novel is so grossly tampered with in order to accommodate well-known Hollywood actors (particularly the character of Arwen, played by the poorly-casted Liv Tyler). If the idea is to incorporate more female characters, they did a terrible job, as the Arwen scenes basically involve overly illuminated close ups of her face contorting into various crying scenes. As for other female characters, Eowyn is decent but doesn't live up to what I imagined her to be like in the book (strong, steadfast), but at least she gets some coverage. Galadriel is wonderfully portrayed by Cate Blanchett but her role is minuscule. Anyway, enough of that. There were some good scenes, like when the hobbits meet Treebeard, and most scenes involving Frodo were decent although Gollum is way too cute to be anything like the book's version. Worm tongue is also weak (not creepy enough). So my main issues are poor character renditions and alteration of plot. Wish they'd stuck to the story more accurately instead of turning it into a cheesy soap opera."
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","2","7","12 January 2008"," An Indepted Fanboy's Love Letter to The Lord of the Rings: A Critical Essay on the Film Trilogy, Part Two
","(click on my name for Part One) <br/><br/>Okay, that's that. Now for some deconstruction.<br/><br/>First, to the visual side of The Lord of the Rings. Visually, it is indeed ravishing in every sense of the word. Its scale and technological wonders make it heaven on your eyes, and in every frame there are so many beautiful things to look at that with every viewing you notice something there that you never noticed before (something that defines any true classic). The design is so richly detailed and by turns shimmeringly beautiful and powerfully arresting that you feel like you can just reach into the screen and touch the rainforest treetops of Rivendell or Lothlórien, or smell the gritty underbelly of the almost dystopic caverns of Isengard. Much of this is due to the many spectacular New Zealand locations on which the movie was filmed  indeed, Jackson's choices of locations were so beneficial overall to New Zealand's tourism industry that then-New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark stated, ""Peter Jackson has done more for New Zealand's tourism industry than any man since Captain Cook!"" <br/><br/>Still on the visual aspect of The Lord of the Rings, overshadowing the sets and costumes are the indisputably awe-inspiring special effects. They have the same effect as the sets and costumes, however they overpower other technical aspects of the production when we learn there was much more at stake with the special effects. And the special effects are, it must be said, nothing less than special. In fact, what am I saying? To merely write them off as ""special"" is both an understatement and an injustice. It's almost as if Peter Jackson has made a 3-D movie that you don't need to watch while wearing those stupid glasses, to get the adrenaline rush that 3-D brings. The dragon firework; Frodo's blurred and almost otherworldly vision when he puts on the One Ring; the dormant demon erupting out of Cate Blanchett's Queen Galadriel when she sees the Ring; the river flooding Isengard to the ground; Mount Doom blowing its top and the tower of Orthanc collapsing to the ground, causing an earthquake after the destruction of the Ring; and the afore-mentioned showdown on the Bridge of Khazad-dum to name but a few. All become indelibly etched in your memory forever. And then there's Gollum (played to sheer perfection by Andy Serkis), the first completely lifelike (if that's the right adjective to use in relation to a non-human character) computer-generated character ever committed to celluloid. Gollum was the main reason as to just why the realism of the visuals in The Lord of the Rings was so critical to the outcome, especially in The Two Towers and The Return of the King, because he is the character through which the story's moral of how power corrupts is delivered. Visually, The Lord of the Rings is, to put it lightly, a dream come true.<br/><br/>Another visual plus is Andrew Lesnie's exhilarating cinematography  indeed, the effectiveness of the picturesque New Zealand locations in the overall look of the movie has a great deal to do with his camera and he deserved every gram of the Academy Award he won for Fellowship. Two photographic shots in the entire piece that never fail to leave me awestruck are the tracking shot of the butterfly flying along the caverns of Isengard then up and over the tower of Orthanc (despite that shot being mostly computer-generated) and the haunting mise-en-scene (following Arwen's (Liv Tyler) vision of Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) passing) of leaves floating over Aragorn's casket to show the withering passage of time. Sublime.<br/><br/>Click on my name for Part Three!"

","This movie disappointed me very much. As a fan of Tolkien's works, I rather liked 'the fellowship of the ring', even if there were points on which I could argue. I was hence quite impatient to see 'the two towers' and I spent 3 hours of fluctuation between smile and tears looking at this pathetic adaptation of one of the greatest books I read.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson should reconsider its so-called 'tolkien specialists' 's salary as my 8 years-old cousin understood the book better than them.<br/><br/>
But besides the point that the film is a total heresy compared to the book, the scenario is weak, some situations ridiculous and the battles are really badly filmed.

","This movie was horrid. I think that's the best place to start. This movie was the biggest disappointment I have ever had. The worst part was that for the first hour I actually thought they were going to follow the book. Then the pain began. By adding and changing scenes from the book, they completely ruined a good movie. Some people argue that if the movie exactly matched the book, people should just read the book. I argue that if they want to make up there own story don't try to remake a book by someone else. The things added to this movie were not put there to improve the story anyway. They just added a level of badly acted drama that the film did not need. Why they felt the need to change the story to emphasize the plight of Frodo and Middle-earth with bad drama I will never know. The whole movie is already bent on these ideas, so why they felt like shoving it down our throats is a mystery. Maybe they want to try for Oscars... I've got an idea let's do another close up of Merry's face full of determination...<br/><br/>Another problem is the fighting scenes. These were insulting. There is a difference between unrealistic fantasy fighting, like in the first film, and in your face crap that wouldn't even be shown on MST3K. If you can just run over 10,000 orcs with 5 horses and be fine, why didn't they just do that in the beginning?  Obviously, the orcs have no momentum and no ability to even hold a spear up against a horse...<br/><br/>I could go on about the problems of this movie for much longer but instead I'll just say this. If you have invested any time at all into this series, do not watch this movie, because it is horrible and will only irritate you.<br/><br/>1/10"

","First of all, I must say that I'm a log time fan of Peter Jackson and of Tolkien's trilogy (Oh, and by the way, excuse my English, I'm from Belgium). And I'm soooooo disappointed to see that such a master director (Braindead!!!!!!) has caught so few the spirit of the book.  For me it's like the Bible. If you had to put it in film, you have to catch the essence, not to shoot every scene described.  And that's the problem with Jackson's first two episodes of the Trilogy: it's a scene after scene movie, you don't have a leading line, unless you've read the books.  Well, of course, the special effects are incredible (although I'm not as surprised as with ""The Fellowship...""), and the universe showed is incredibly realistic...  But don't you think that this is only some make up upon vacuum? And let's not talk about the camera points of view and moves, quasi never justified.  (Except the 5 seconds during Aragorn and his horse get up after the fall during the embush of Saroumane's skirmisher Orcs, the camera is sort of shy, hesitating, interesting! Probably the best part of the Trilogy) Except the mono- dialogue of Smeagol/Gollum, which is stolen from the Pixar short which went out with Toy Story 2, the movie is very disappointing..."

And while the second part is exactly as long as the first, it's even more eye-grabbing with it's visual wonder, the scope of Middle Earth the most impressive thing about Two Towers (it's deserved of an Oscar).  Another impressive feat is the computer animated creature of Gollum, a schitzophrenic, deformed Hobbit who finds Frodo Baggins his new master, alongside Samwise Gamgee, and he may just be the most compelling of the characters, along with the somewhat downsized role of Gandalf the Grey, er White, played still with skill by Sir Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>So, for the fans of the Fellowship, and for Tolkien's core audience, they may find a few story strands missing from the original novel, but it is highly reccomended viewing anyway, and if those are concerned about not seeing a scene they visioned from the book, keep in mind that probably a year from now will see the release of the Two Towers extended edition on DVD.

","What a joke this so-called ""trilogy"" is.  It's even worse than ""Star Wars"". Basically, this is just a typical Hollywood blockbuster movie.  The only reason it's not treated like that is because it's based on a series of ""classic"" books, and it came out in December rather than the summer.  The high box office total of this film (and the first one) show how dumb and guillable north americans are.  It proves that all Hollywood needs to do for big box office for a film is put some cheesy CGI effects and pointless action sequences in it to send the people running to the theater.  This film is really no different from similar stinkers like ""Battlefield Earth"" and ""The Scorpion King"".  Gollum isn't all that impressive, either.  I can't see why the Gollum character is getting so much praise... didn't people see ""Attack of the Clones"" or the new Harry Potter movie?  Newsflash: it's already been done before!  Basically, this is just a clever money-making machine. As you can see, the movie features an inexpensive, talentless b-list cast (with the exception of Sir Ian) in roles that just about anybody could play.  That way, they could spend the rest of the money on the supposedly ""awe inspiring"" special effects (which i've already seen in a dozen other films hollywood has churned out this year).  This film is far from awe-inspiring... those who consider it that obviously don't get out much.  Anyone who prefers a movie with hobbits and wizards rather than real life, obviously leads a very empty existance.  Go see a movie with REAL actors giving REAL performances instead of relying on god-awful CGI tricks. I honestly think in a few years time ""LOTR"" will suffer the same backlash ""Titanic"" did.  Another thing I can't understand is how the critics have praised this one so much.. well, go figure, i guess..

"gibscreen2","1","2","8","22 December 2002"," Ambitious, yet unengaging
","First let me just compliment everyone involved in the production of this movie for their ambition.  This was a monumental project, and they get a lot of things right, unlike any other.  But the things they get wrong are really wrong.  Most of the blame falls on the director Peter Jackson.  Yes, he did play a HUGE part in bringing this thing together, and his organizational skills amazing, but he lacks skill as a storyteller, and his roots as the director of The Frighteners and Braindead really show through.  Although the images put on the screen are downright amazing, with the exception of portions of the Battle of Helm's Deep, I don't think I was ever really engaged during this movie (or Fellowship of the Ring for that matter) with any of the characters or the story.  And this is a tough feat considering that the characters and story are very well drawn.  But there's nothing really connecting the audience with the movie.  It's like looking at a picture taken of the Mona Lisa.  Although you see everything that is on the painting, there's just something missing when compared to looking at the real thing.<br/><br/>Plus, in my opinion, there were some HUGE fumbles in my opinion.  Gollum got downright irritating at the end of the movie.  Ok, we get it, he's having a moral crisis.  We got it the first three times you told us.  Say it and move on.  And the one part they got right--the Battle of Helm's Deep--was almost completely destroyed when they cut away to Merry and Pippin yackin with Treebeard.  Couldn't they have done this a little earlier?  And then intercut Helm's Deep with the tree battle.  That's just plain filmmaking 101.  When you're at the end (even in a movie without an end) you shouldn't be setting things up FOR the end.  That's what the prior 2 hours was for.<br/><br/>There's a lot more nitpicking I can do.  And I know a lot of people will violently disagree with me.  But just wait a few years.  Or even for the second viewing.  I think this is one of those movies where upon first seeing it, it seems really good, but the more you think about it, the more flaws just start jumping out at you."
"wolfef","1","2","8","18 December 2002"," What book did they read?
","I've read every book written by Tolkien concerning the Ring and all its adventures. I made it a point to read the book before seeing the movie and after the first movie was quite expectant about what the Two Towers would entail. My rapture lasted less then 30 minutes and by the time one hour was through I thought I read the wrong book. Everything that happens in the movie loosly resembles what goes on in the book. Lines are said by the wrong people and at the wrong time. Events occur out of order and utterly wrong from the book. If the tickets hadn't cost as much as they did I would have walked out. No lover of the Lord of the Rings should waste their money to see this movie. It was an utter disappointment and I can see Tolkien not just rolling but doing an entire gymnastic routine in his grave. What was Peter Jackson thinking as he shot these scenes which were unlike the book as the night is different from the day? He said that he held the books in respect and he treated this one as garbage. I could have compiled it better by shreading the book and having an ape paste it back together."

I'd bet the farm on that wicked sorceress to take both gandalf and saruman white hand man who wills the uruk-hai (elvish for negroes) to their deaths in what was one of the greatest siege warfare blunders of all time but only because superflamer white pony gandalf shows up and uses all of his magical powers to reverse braveheart's calvary-killing logic. classic siege warfare people. when your opponent pens himself into a defended corner, you don't throw your army right at him. you wait him out or run amok wherevertheheck else you wanna go. and you especially don't throw yourself at a king whose kingdom basically amounts to a hill with a puny castle and some wooden shacks on it. TRANSITIONS: the transitions and timing in TTT were as bad as the one I used to start this topic. it bounces around the action with little if any regard to transitioning. this was done right in the first part where when you switch locations there is a still shot or a zoomed out view of where you're going. in one part of triple T you've got Ent-riding to Frodo back to Ent-riding for no relevant reason at all. also on that Frodo part, where he's taken to Gondor, i was told by a book-reader that boromir's brother let's him go at the waterfall, a much more logical, consistent and not completely retarded decision. jackson gives us a jerk-around the mulberry bush and a visit from the buck-toothed dragon. this ain't about book vs. movie though.

","The second film in Peter Jackson's series of screen adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's internationally popular Lord of The Rings trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers literally begins where The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ended, with the Fellowship splitting into three groups as they seek to return the Ring to Mordor, the forbidding land where the powerful talisman must be taken to be destroyed. This fantasy film directed by Jackson is based on the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is the second film in The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, preceded by The Fellowship of the Ring and concluding with The Return of the King.<br/><br/>Frodo,who carries the Ring, and his fellow Hobbit Sam are lost in the hills of Emyn Muil when they encounter Gollum, a strange creature who once carried the Ring and was twisted by its power. Gollum volunteers to guide the pair to Mordor; Frodo agrees, but Sam does not trust their new acquaintance. Elsewhere, Merry and Pippin are attempting to navigate Fangorn Forrest where they discover a most unusual nemesis -- Treebeard, a walking and talking tree-shepherd who doesn't much care for Hobbits. Finally, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas arrive in Rohan to discover that the evil powers of Saruman have robbed King Theoden of his rule. The King's niece Éowyn believes Aragorn and his men have the strength to defeat Saruman, his henchman Wormtongue, and their minions. Éowyn soon becomes infatuated with Aragorn, while he struggles to stay faithful to the pledge of love he made to Arwen. Gandalf offers his help and encouragement as the Rohans, under Aragorn's leadership, attempt to face down Saruman's armies, but they soon discover how great the task before them truly is when they learn that his troops consist of 10,000 bloodthirsty creatures specially bred to fight to the death.<br/><br/>The second chapter of Peter Jackson's seminal epic differs from the first in narrative and tone, there are more battle scenes and the mood is darker.But nevertheless,it was a wonderfully entertaining piece of filmmaking, filled with as much spectacle and wonder as any motion picture as compared to the first movie.It was outstanding but has very violent battle scenes.But still,what's remarkable is how immediately, after a full year, The Two Towers seizes your attention, and how urgently it holds you through three seamless, action-packed hours with a conclusion that makes you excited for the next film in the series."
"gigan-92","10","1","3","7 January 2011"," When One Thought It Couldn't Get Any Better
","A+<br/><br/>Definitely among my personal favorite films, LOTR 2 is as good if not better than the last one. Now the main reason why it's better: story is already in motion thanks to the first film. Secondly, just a whole lot less of those damned Hobbits. Still, there are some funny moments, like Sam uttering ""Your Sam."" I don't know if it's a running gag to insinuate this almost romantic relationship between the two, but it shall pass (kudos to McKellen). Thirdly, the sense of doom created by the images is quite awesome. The acting was once again class A work, and there were some interesting new characters. I particularly like John Rhys-Davies as TreeBeard, and loved Andy Serkis as the twisted Gollum. Plus David Wenham was great as always. Orlando Bloom's character delivers plenty of action, quite the bad-ass really. And Gimli of course was the ever constant comic relief. He does get to kick quite bit of ass despite all this, so it's a okay in my book. <br/><br/>Once the action starts, it never lets up. And Peter Jackson's cinematographer doesn't let us down with some amazing cinematography and breathtaking shots. I mean the end battle is truly one to remember and was probably among the most epic battles in fantasy history. The amount of time, craftsmen, and effort put in by the production team and cast is definitely worthy of note. The Battle at Helm's Deep will surely go down in cinematic history as one of the most beautifully orchestrated climaxes ever. Howard Shore's score isn't as dark and as menacing as it was in the last film, but still very, very, good. And so with all this, a very good film is born worthy of recognition."

Well, fear not, because it's all very good, all the way to the end. Once more, Peter Jackson serves up some great visuals and story as we see so much turmoil with the characters.

"griffolyon12","10","1","3","14 March 2009"," The Best of the Trilogy!
","There is something special about the Two Towers that makes it more enjoyable than the other two parts of the trilogy. That is not to say that the other two films are inferior in any way, I just am simply more entertained by this one than the others and this is a large part to due with the Battle of Helms Deep. The Battle of Helms Deep is simply one of the finest battle sequences ever in movie history. Though not only is the battle exquisitely crafted, but thanks to Peter Jackson's wonderful direction, he makes us feel for the heroes and makes you want to continuously jump up and cheer each time Aragorn mows down a row of orcs, or Legolas rides a shield down a flight of stairs, pummeling enemies with his arrows on the way down. Still the battle is not the only thing that makes this film more enjoyable. I felt for these characters more so in this film than any of the others. Part of that is because this film puts more focus on the characters and who they are than either of the other two films. In the first one it was all about exposition, the third one it was all about drawing it all to a close, but this one was all about getting to know the characters better so that by the time we reach the third film we are so emotionally attached that we could not bear to see any of them pass.<br/><br/>Overall Two Towers is a terrific film and is easily one of my more favorite movies of all-time.<br/><br/>I give the Two Towers a perfect 10 out of 10!"
"jerman13","10","1","3","8 March 2009"," The Greatest Movie Of All Time-Part 2
","Another fantastic layer to the film is the art direction, which is not only elegant and organic at times, but rugged and industrial. It also fabricates a realism into itself that creates infinite impact on the audience.<br/><br/>The cast is also very good, they play off each other perfectly, different nationalities keeping each character fresh and interesting. Due to the huge number of characters in this film, I will only mention the most notable performances: As far as Hobbits go, Elijah Wood gives us a brilliant transformation from a wide-eyed innocent to a paranoid ring-junkie. Sean Astin gives us a beautiful portrayal of boundless friendship and unlikely courage. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd provide delightful comic relief when together, compelling character development when apart. Ian Holm has only a small amount of screen time, but in it he is incredibly memorable as Bilbo. Ian Mckellen is powerful as Gandalf, as well as providing hope and exposition along the long journey. Now we come to the miss-matched Three Musketeers: Viggo Mortensen is powerful, rugged, and tortured as Aragorn, where as Orlando Bloom and John-Rhys Davies are both simply awesome when they get to play off each other. When it comes to Sean Bean as Boromir, during the course of the story, he does a villainous deed, but we still feel sympathy for him, as we do for his younger brother, Faramir, played to perfection by David Whenham, who strives to please his father by emulating Boromir. I see no reason why John Noble, who plays Denethor, the tragic, corrupt father of the two sons mentioned earlier, should'not receive an Oscar for his Shakespearean performance.<br/><br/>The film also holds its own brand of visual amazement. Combining fantastic lighting that further effects the tone of a particular scene, elaborate sword fights that give each character their own method of fighting, incredible action scenes including a single warrior climbing a giant elephant and single-handedly taking him down, 2,000 horses sliding down a hillside, a giant staircase falling down a chasm, a man and a fiery beast fighting while falling miles down a tunnel into an underground lake, and a mile-high tower falling and exploding on it's way down, and dynamic camera moves, that include something of a roller coaster ride through massive tunnels, a minute-long shot of a moth flying over a tower, or a pan past a mile-high life-like statue of a forgotten king.<br/><br/>In a film with so much spectacle, CGI is expected, but here, not even noticeable. Giant monsters, CGI sets and landscapes, and fabricated armies, all flawlessly integrated into the film by a computer, looking as real as if they were all there right in front of the camera. But for all the films technical achievements, they hail in comparison to one: Gollum. His movements are flawless, his voice perfect, his amazingly realistic flesh tones breathtaking. Whether you hate him, pity him, or identify with him, is your decision. The film portrays him in such a way, unbiased, unprejudiced. But one thing we can all agree on, he is quite simply, one of the greatest technical achievements of all time."

","This story (all three films) is truly art on film! I was blown away by this film and still am today as I watch it over and over again. Peter Jackson's talent is beyond belief. This film draws you in like nothing I have ever experienced before or since. The fact that the actors were not nominated for Oscars is appalling! If Elijah Wood is not Oscar worthy they need to quit giving the damn things out! For the people that don't ""get"" the Lord of the Rings and why it's so great, this thing is NOT complicated it's a story of human emotion and the struggle between good and evil so I don't understand why that is so confusing...maybe some are just to shallow to understand those things. My 9 year old nephew gets it so trust me it's not complicated. Lord of the Rings is just simply a great work of art and if you haven't seen it you are missing out on the greatest film ever made, there is nothing else to compare, not even close"

","I saw this film in 2003, before the release of Return of the King. Of course I had already seen The Fellowship and loved it. I found Two Towers to surpass it. Upon viewing Return of the King, I felt it was the best. Now I find myself saying Two Towers is the best because it is a much stronger film that 3. I hope I'm not including spoilers, but the battle of helm's deep was more exhilarating than minas-tirith, Gollum was better (not visually but spiritually) that in 3, and above all it had a sad and slightly depressed feel compared to the other films. Even though Return of the King is a great conclusion for the series, Two Towers is a better film with more emotional depth."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","3","10 February 2007"," ""The Two Towers"" is the finest of the epic trilogy
","While I do cherish and enjoy all three epic parts of Peter Jackson's film adaptation of the Lord of the Rings, I do prefer ""The Two Towers"" over its prequel and sequel films. It's not as cleverly made as the first one, not as heart-wrenching as the third one, but it is overall the most powerful of the three.<br/><br/>What mostly motivated me to give it a 10/10 was the fact that it is the only one of the three films where I can sit down and watch the entire film without thinking ""This could've bit just a little bit shorter"". That was the reason why I only gave the other two films 9/10, because they were a little bit too long to keep me fully interested in their three-hour runs. ""Two Towers"" is also three hours long, but it has the energy and motivation that can keep me interested to watch the entire thing without thinking afterward what scenes were expendable.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" has the most action of the three films, which is one of the biggest reasons why I can stay entertained without getting the slightest bit of boredom throughout its running time. And the final hour of the film has one of the most epic and well-made battle sequences ever brought to the big screen.<br/><br/>All viewers need to see the Lord of the Rings trilogy in chronological order, but ""The Two Towers"" is the best of them all. Great performances by Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Bernard Hill, and all the others involved in this masterpiece. Good job, Peter Jackson. This is your second-best film."
"John_Q_Citizen","Null","1","3","13 January 2007"," Great Epic Film-making (Part 2--Even Better Than FOTR)
","Jackson's second film installment of the JRR Tolkien trilogy is large in scope and vision. It is truly a great cinematic experience--rollicking good fun, scary monsters, human themes, and big battles. This film delivers the goods many times over. In my opinion, it is better than the first film.<br/><br/>This one does not center on the Ring. It centers on Aragorn's journey to Rohan--a horse kingdom--to warn its leaders of an onslaught of Uruks sent by Saruman to conquer them. What follows are some of the greatest and most exciting battle scenes ever put onto screen.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson directs this with the same type of style as was in the first movie--big, sweeping shots, lots of VFX, dark lighting, bombastic and rousing music. And it works just as well in this movie as it did in the last. The script is far better than the Fellowship's script. It is much more flushed out, much more interesting, and has a lot more action. I like it! The acting is on par with part one. Ian McKellan gives the best performance out of all the actors. His return as Gandalf (the White) is memorable. While not as likable a character in this movie, he still serves as a wise, all-knowing and powerful figure. I repeat, he is NOT the grandfatherly figure he portrayed in the first film, but a wise, lethal wizard that is strict and on the nose.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is great as well. John Rhys-Davies serves as some much-needed comic relief. His performance as Gimli brings a lightness to the film (a film that basically coincides with The Empire Strikes Back). Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn brings a gritty and badass-type of quality to his character. He is more fleshed out in TTT than in FOTR. Orlando Bloom still plays the pretty boy elf that has a great CGI stunt double. I daresay the girls in the theater were drooling over him.<br/><br/>Overall, a worthy, if not better, installment on the trilogy. Epic film-making at its best."
"wereuat06-1","10","1","3","10 December 2006"," Truly my Favorite out of the 3
","I still find this my favorite one even though Peter Jackson himself has admitted The Two Towers was the hardest part of the trilogy to achieve, at least in terms of narrative structure since, unlike The Fellowship of the Ring, it has no proper beginning and no emotionally packed climax (Boromir's death in Fellowship was one of that film's most moving moments).<br/><br/>Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their journey to Mordor in order to destroy the One Ring, and find an unexpected guide in that item's previous owner, vicious creature Gollum (Andy Serkis); Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reunite with the reborn Gandalf (Ian Mckellen) to save the dying kingdom of Rohan from Saruman's (Christopher Lee) evil clutch; Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) have a close encounter with the Ents, ancient creatures which have unfinished business with a certain bad wizard.<br/><br/>Helm's Deep aside, the movie's most remarkable element is the mad, schizophrenic Gollum. He's got ""ambiguity"" and ""unreliability"" written all over him, as we see him struggle with his two persons, one the good fella he once was, the other a filthy, treacherous freak who wants nothing more than his ""preccciousssss"" back (the conversation between the two personalities is one of the most beautiful scenes ever made). He makes us suspicious about his most insignificant gesture, and has us thinking the worst may happen in The Return of the King.<br/><br/>Not as good as the previous part (at least the theatrical version, which I rate 9/10), but still a really good fantasy movie, and one of the best pictures of 2002."

The battle for ISengard matches anything Sergei Einstein has done as well as the sequences from Bondachurks ""War and Peace"". It is gloriously realized piece of cinema. Something like this will never be seen again. This is a must have for everyone of this generation. There is no movie lover in this day and age who has not viewed this film at least once.

It's really hard to to a second part of a trilogy and make it just as awesome as the first and better in certain ways as well. Peter Jackson definitely has talent in his directing and you can definitely tell when you see this movie.<br/><br/>The special effects are better than in the fellowship of the ring and the stories keep jumping around from the different people at different places. It takes off right where the fellowship of the ring left off focuses very heavily in each and every one of the characters in their different paths. The story is excellent and the acting is wonderful. Andy Serkis as gollum takes away this movie with his excellent acting ability for doing gollum's voice and stuff. There is a battle scene in this movie that is just unbelievably well done with outstanding visuals and special effects.<br/><br/>This is continuing the great trilogy of the lord of the rings and making everybody just dying to see the return of the king. I can't I absolutely can't wait for it to come out. It's gonna be the closing to the trilogy and gonna be and awesome ending to it as well. Frodo started changing and becoming more effected by the ring in this one so he will probably be even worse in the last one. The battle for middle earth will be absolutely incredible and it's definitely gonna be at least as good as the other movies in the trilogy.<br/><br/>This is an overall stunning movie. Lord of the Rings are my favorite movies and I think a lot of people will agree that this is the best movie of this year and the best movie anybody has seen in a long time. A great movie full of even more wonderful creatures, special effects, an equally good story line as the first, great plot and character development and even better acting. A little less adventurous than the first but not by too much. Still an equally good movie and my favorite."
"inceoglu","6","1","3","27 August 2003"," Could have been better. Should have been better...
","I believe anyone who read Tolkien's masterpiece will be disappointed with this second installment of the trilogy. If you haven't read the book though, then this movie may be pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Why I don't like this movie? First of all it is not completely true to the story (you can very well argue it doesn't have to be), and unfortunately the additions made by Jackson and his screenwriters consist of childish, cliche scenes or dialogues. The new lines sound like they have been written by Kevin Costner rather than Tolkien.<br/><br/>The action scenes are exaggerated and overacted (with Legolas surfing down the stairs on a shield while firing arrows etc etc). The characters are all the time overcome with emotion, which toward the end of the movie makes you sick (Why is Frodo on the verge of tears all the time? Why does everybody hug and cast meaningful glances at each other every other minute?).<br/><br/>The background music gets to my nerves after the first hour. There should be a substitute to this Nordic chorus singing at extremely high pitch whenever something grave happens.<br/><br/>And then, back again the changes in the story are unforgivable for someone who loves the book. The removal of some parts of the story is, of course, necessary. But fiddling with characters (Oh Faramir!) is not.<br/><br/>What you have is a Hollywood blockbuster based on a great book. I guess it could have been worse, which is the only good thing I have to say about this movie."
"kg61410","7","1","3","16 January 2003"," Nothing near as good as the first one
","As the summary points out, I didn't find the two towers nearly as enjoyable as the first episode. Reasons for this are I believe quite obvious: The two towers is a mix of many things and tales and fails to grab the audience in the manner the first one did. In FOTR you felt enchanted as we were treated with beautiful images (and emotions in particular!) from the shire and from along the journey of the fellowship.<br/><br/>In TTT there is really no single plot. The movie consists of the combined tales of different characters and groups and they fail to connect. Even Gandalf, who in the first was a loveable wise man has become more of an action oriented character. In FOTR for ex. you could see Gandlaf pondering matters of great importance, and then find out that his wise decicions were based on a better odor in this corridor than the others. This kind of subtle humor and intelligence is missing in the second film.<br/><br/>Acting is excellent, as is everything else - technically. Soul and feeling is what is absent. And the ring. The ring is all but gone, it just hangs on Frodos neck.<br/><br/>Having said all of the above, I still liked the film quite a bit. It's just not as good as the first one, which is obviously the only film you can really compare this to. I give this one 7/10, which is a good grade. (as a side note, I suggest users would learn to use the FULL range of votes, instead of always giving tens to movies they happened to like a bit)."
"BaronWincott","5","1","3","20 December 2002"," Don't believe the hype. A very average film.
","First of all I should say that I think that The Fellowship of the Ring is an amazing film and is quite easily one of the best films of the new decade. I also think that Peter Jackson is a great director, so my expectations for The Two Towers were huge. Unfortunately the film failed to deliver in so many ways.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw is the script, which is almost no better than the abysmal episode 2 script. The trilogy has gone from being darkly epic to fun for all the family. For example, the only purpose that Gimli seems to play in the film is to add comic relief. This is okay for a while, but his one liners soon become extremely irritating and only truly funny to the most stupid of film-goers. Aragorn has become very bland, but you can't blame this on Mortenson who does the best he can with the throw away script that he is given. As well as the script a lot of the acting is shockingly bad. Sean Astin yet again proves himself to be painful to the eyes and ears. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are both awful (what idiot cast these films?). Even Ian Mckellen is average. Christopher Lee could've been good, but Jackson decides to only give him about three lines. Bernard Hill is far to young to play Theoden (again, casting issues!).<br/><br/>As for the special effects, it would seem that Jackson has taken a leaf out of Lucas's book and gone cgi crazy. The beauty of Fellowship was that cgi was kept to a minimum, but at times The Two Towers is a horrible computer generated mess. Why computer generate the forest of Fangorn? I'm sure there must be at least one forest in New Zealand to fit the bill. But, the ents destroying Isengard really took the biscuit for badness. The whole scene just looks cheap and nasty. As for the battle of Helm's deep, the special effects look really good, but the whole scene is ruined by awful script, dreadful pacing, rubbish fighting (did they actually train the actors how to use those swords?) and a lack of continuity.<br/><br/>Fans of the book are saying this film is bad because it strays so far from the original text. Essentially I don't have a problem with changing things if it means the narrative will flow better. But it doesn't. The films pacing is abysmally bad. I realise this is Jacksons  'intepretation' of the books, but it is a very average one at best. What really p***es me off is the way all the critics are patting Jackson on the back and saying that The Two Towers is even better than fellowship. Someone needs to stand up to this guy and tell him that he has done bad things. If Jackson or any of the cast receive oscar nominations I will be absolutely disgusted. I could go on and on with this rant, but I won't bother because my review is only going to become lost among a sea of other reviews claiming The Two Towers is one of the greatest films ever."
"jessied","7","1","3","18 December 2002"," Tepid Two Towers
","New hideous beasts join the Balrog and Orcs as audience members return to Middle Earth during Director Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.  Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), and five other members of the original Fellowship continue their arduous journey to Mordor to destroy the Ring.  Conditions are often intolerable.  Powers clash and collide.  The battles are fierce and unrelenting.  Friendships and alliances are tested.  Innocent people and brave warriors lose their lives.  Love is found and lost and unreturned. The world is simply a darker place.  But even this enormous amount of conflict and drama does not engender a superior sequel to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>The team of screenwriters (Frances Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Stephen Sinclair, and Peter Jackson) undeniably undertook a difficult task in reproducing J.R.R. Tolkien's epic in script form, but this fact does not excuse the film's slow pace and occasional incomprehensibility.  Both major and minor characters are introduced too quickly and little or no time is invested in many of these people, which prevents audience members from connecting and sympathizing with the characters.  Théoden (Bernard Hill) orders elderly men and young boys to fight an impossible war, but one cannot connect with the weeping women or terrified men as leaders outfit them in helmets and swords and send them off to a likely death.  The writers have not given audience members the time or reason to care.<br/><br/>The overriding theme in The Lord of the Rings is that the good in the world is worth a tremendous fight and that evil cannot prevail despite its overwhelming force, but other themes evolve through various characters and subplots.  Few people can miss the dominating theme; Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) even states this Truth at the end of The Two Towers just in case it has eluded anyone in the story's first six cinematic hours.  Unfortunately, many other themes are lost not simply because of exclusion from the original text, but again, because the writers did not invest enough time in explaining the details and significance of certain events.  Allowing Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) to return momentarily to clarify certain points and clever monologues by Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis) avoid complete disregard for intelligibility, but more of these not-entirely-innovative but nonetheless helpful techniques would have benefited the film.<br/><br/>Gollum embodies the possibility that any inherently good creature can be transformed into something evil.  The entire cast delivers laudable performances once again, but this computer generated character steals the spotlight in every one of his scenes.  He appears deformed and acts maliciously, but the writers gave him a tremendous amount of depth and so his deformities and deviance is forgiven.  Gollum is complicated, and he is endearing.  He has become a slave to the desire for power, but traces of his former Sméagol self penetrate his dominating ugliness--especially in an intense but entertaining forest monologue.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Gollum also represents the most disturbing reality of the second part of this film series: The Two Towers relies too heavily on its computer generated characters and special effects and not enough on the story and the abilities of its human actors.  Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) prances off boulders and dramatically flies onto a horse during battle, which elicits laughter during serious moments and detracts from Bloom's natural ability to play the part.  The Fellowship of the Ring is not entirely void of these non-human creations, but the focus is on the nine-member Fellowship.  The actors are responsible for the overall success or failure of each scene in the first film, but the exact opposite is true for the second film and pure spectacle does not afford cinematic greatness.<br/><br/>Jackson's talented cast is not as present in The Two Towers, but they make a valiant effort to carry the film even through too numerous sweeping landscape scenes.  Still, few of the actors exhibit flawless or even nearly flawless performances.  Wood and John Rhys-Davies, who plays Gimli, occasionally overreact with melodramatic reactions and facial expressions, though it is admittedly the exception to Wood's otherwise skillful and intriguing performance.  Rhys-Davies is particularly guilty of this amateurish act, however, and these poor acting choices coupled with a script that portrays him as a fool cheapens the overall story and discredits the Fellowship.  The most troubling acting problem, however, is the lack of chemistry between the lead male characters excluding the hobbits.  Every single leader is captivating in his individual monologues and scenes, but their camaraderie seems forced and unauthentic.  The camera does most of the work, and the actors rely on background music and other visual effects to compensate for their collective inefficiency.  Thankfully, the believability of all other relationships balances this inadequacy, and newcomer Miranda Otto as Éowyn shines.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers lags behind its predecessor, but Jackson and his cast and crew have created another film well worth the price of a movie ticket.  The story begs for more explanation and the actors are undermined by technology, but the special effects and computer generated characters will keep audience members content through the three hour duration.  One Ring was forged to bind all creatures in the darkness of Mordor--despite the film's faults, don't be the only one to miss this continued journey that will determine if the dark prophecy will come true and send Middle Earth into catastrophic ruin."

But after an hour I was getting bored a bit, after two hours I was asking myself where is ""a LOT more action than in the first one"" as seemingly everybody is talking about??? I still think it is a good film, but it was by far not what I expected after the excellent first part.<br/><br/>CGI-Gollum is terrific and beats every cgi-character with dialogue we have seen before. End battle was good but not great (it always reminded me of the fortress attack in Starship Troopers but with orcs). The nasguls are just there but not frightening as they were in the first part. Gandalf has only a small part. Saruman as well. The tree-guys...well they were cool in the end-battle.<br/><br/>Sorry to say that I am disappointed.

","I dislike these films. I dislike all this films with witches an wizards and other inhuman beings which are demonstrated to be good and the demons are mostly primitive. Humans should not turn to such kind of supernatural forces and produce fairy stories for entertainment. I went into one of the three ""ring""- films with my children, who were already half grown up. After half of the film I left the cinema because I could not stand any longer this high quality-nonsense. In spite of the vast occult imagery, these movies and their literary counterparts are being praised by some professing Christians to be an allegory for the Bible story in which the good prevails in the end over the bad. World magazine's review is titled ""Powerful Rings"" and says that the ""movie version of Tolkien's book speaks to today's culture."" Unfortunately the today's culture is a very doubtful sort of thing. What about the increasing preference of our Youth for the occult, for violence and obsessions? Is the Lord of the Rings harmless fantasy or even a wholesome Christian allegory? I think neither nor. If the film or the books contained Bible truths it would not attract so many atheists. If they attract Christians it is apparently because these sort of Christians have a liking for the belief that wizards, hobbits, dragons and the kind could be of the good buddies, maybe also a liking for pagan contents which also had the author Tolkien. His books are filled with occult imagery, such as witches, goblins, warlocks, wizards, fairies, and such things; and though these are strongly and unconditionally condemned in the Bible, they are often portrayed as good and desirable by Tolkien. Many of the heroes of the Lord of the Rings, in fact, are of doubtful nature. The books became in the sixties and seventies popular with the generation of drug headed hippies. When Tolkien was eight years old, his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, and he remained a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, ""I'm a devout Roman Catholic."" Catholics have a different approach to the Bible as Protestants as well as a different approach to pagan symbols and cults. As a professor of literature at Oxford University, Tolkien specialized in Old and Middle English and loved ancient pagan mythology. His first fantasy novel, The Hobbit, appeared in 1937, and The Lord of the Rings, in 1954-55. Several others were published later, some posthumously. Like Tolkien Lewis and perhaps most of the so called Christians they did not accept the Bible as the infallible Word of God and he picked and chose what he would believe about the New Testament, rejecting it in parts. And like Tolkien, C.S. Lewis loved at least some things about Catholicism. He believed in purgatory, confessed his sins to a priest, and had the last rites performed by a Catholic priest.<br/><br/>The books depict the calling up of the dead to assist the living, which is plainly condemned in the Scriptures of the Bible as every Protestant knows. Sympathy with the devilish is not so much fostered and demonstrated as in the dominant occult Harry Potter series but Tolkien's fantasies are certainly not of a Christian spirit. Some Christians regard them as potential dangerous message. Films are to a younger unexperienced audience always a strong influencer. In a film review this should also be taken in consideration. For agnostics the films should be rejected as they depict the bad as something too less subtle. The enemy of man is not outside him, it is inside him and everybody should know this. In US schools young students massacre their fellows, there are no Hobbits who come to give the defenders of the right and good a helping hand, no flying by of Harry Potters. The bad is inside man and we have to take means to keep it down and promote the good. Films like that are not helpful. In his last interview in 1971, Tolkien stated that he did not intend The Lord of the Rings as a Christian allegory and that Christ is not depicted in his fantasy novels. Tolkien said, ""But that seems I suppose more like an allegory of the human race. ... they (the humans) struggle on, almost blindly in a way"" A blind struggle? It is going to be a blind struggle if we do not take care to which direction our offspring goes! Survival of the fittest? Are the good the fittest? May be, maybe not! Tolkien also said: ""I dislike allegory whenever I smell it."" He had definitely no Christian aims.<br/><br/>Fantasy role-playing games are very influential today. Dungeons and Dragons, which appeared in the early 1970s, was based on Tolkien's fantasy novels. Tolkien certainly did get his ideas from pagan religions, and the message promoted in his fantasy books is strictly pagan. And so do the films. The morals in the books and films is of a very doubtful nature, it is primitive and not endurable. It can carry nobody to nowhere."

","The second part in the Lord of the Rings installment is a great masterpiece. In fact, all three movies are masterpieces. I believe that this film is slightly better than the first one. In the Two Towers, Frodo and Sam are being led to Mordor by the beast, Gollum. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are hunting Merry and Pippin, are involved getting Theoden of Rohan away from Saruman's control, and fighting Saruman's Orcs. Gandalf is better than ever in this film. He is not dead as we all assumed. Gollum is great in this film. Andy Serkis should have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The CGI is amazing, so amazing it makes Gollum appear life-like. I liked Treebeard in this film. He serves as a mentor to Merry and Pippin. I liked the chemistry between Legolas and Gimli. They provide comedy in perilous times of Middle Earth. The acting is excellent especially Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen. Howard Shore continues with his captivating music. The effects, especially the visual effects are great. This is truly an epic. The whole theater was on it's feet doing a standing ovation when the end credits rolled along. If you haven't already, see the Return of the King. I rate this movie 10/10."

"abknor","7","1","4","30 December 2003"," competent, but not compelling
","This series seems competently made, but it lacks the drive that Tolkien displayed. Even if I look past the fact that a lot of the visuals seem to be based on the works of doodler Allan Lee, I cannot get past the vision of good and bad, which seems to be the same as in any other Hollywood movie, and so far removed from the conservative, cold-romantic view of the original author. <br/><br/>There's history. There's written history. Then there were a bunch of irreverent hobbits, who figured they could write the history from a hobbit's eye perspective. That (red) book got translated by an English professor.<br/><br/>
I remember the doubts from Tolkien fans when they heard Peter Jackson was going to film LotR. At first, I shared those doubts, but then I realised that he was only following tradition. Of course, he would be making a romanticized, Hollywoodized version of the story. He would be making a fiction based on a true story, and he would be doing that true story injustice in the process. Taking that as a given, would the end result still be an enjoyable movie, all by itself? And I think that largely it is; but I don't see it as more than a competent re-telling of the subject matter. I liked Tolkien's more factual translation better. The LotR trilogy is hastily told, at times it feels like I am looking at abstracts of the book."

","Having seen FOTR and loved it - the acting, the scenery, the sets, and the fact that the film captured the spirit of Tolkien, I was desperate to see TTT. I knew that it was going to be changed from the book more than FOTR had been, but didn't know that it was going to be changed to the extent that it was.<br/><br/>1. The nauseating 'Arwen' inclusion is a disaster. It has nothing to do with Tolkien, however romantic and 'beautiful' they tried to make the scenes, and despite the fact that they had Hugo Weaving's seductive voice in one of them (in point of fact that was the only scene with 'Arwen' that bore a remote resemblance to Tolkien, i.e. the appendix). Putting this virtually new character into the film has meant that various changes were made which took away from much needed time that could have been used to explore the real Tolkien story. For instance, why have the Warg fight - just so that Aragorn could fall over a cliff and have 'Arwen' change into a horse over him? It was totally unnecessary to change Tolkien's storyline - the original story is brilliant enough in itself.<br/><br/>And why does 'Arwen' appear everywhere in the promotional stuff - is she being used to promote the film? The main characters in the story are FAR more important, and they are who most people feel is important to the story, and want to see.<br/><br/>2. Why did Eomer disappear for virtually the whole film? Why was Treebeard - supposedly the oldest and wisest being in Middle-earth - portrayed as stupid? Where was the noble Faramir? Why wasn't there more of Gandalf, who is the figure around which everything turns? Where were the wonderful Huorns, and all the action involving them, which we were so much looking forward to? Why was there so little about the Hobbits, who with Gandalf are the main characters in Tolkien's LOTR? None of this is the fault of the actors, because the casting for the film is excellent - it is great that they used mostly British, New Zealand and Australian actors who weren't known 'movie stars', which would have completely ruined the film. It is to do with the way the story was rewritten.<br/><br/>Certainly there are brilliant things in the film - Gollum, Gandalf leading the charge on Shadowfax at the end of the film, the three running at the beginning of the film, the horses, Edoras, Helm's Deep, the marching Uruk Hai, New Zealand as Middle Earth, the costumes, among other things . . . but it would have been so much better if the story had been stuck to. The changes just seem so pointless, and I've heard far more criticism than praise for them.<br/><br/>I really, really hope ROTK will go back to the books, but think this may be a forlorn hope - for one thing, I don't know how they could squash everything in from TTT that wasn't included in the film, and still do ROTK justice."
"irishjabba","3","1","4","25 February 2003"," The Two Towers? But that wasn't in the book I read...
","The Two Towers.after seeing the Fellowship of the Ring, I was very excited about the release of this chapter of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Though FOTR wasn't totally true to the writings of Tolkien, the changes director Peter Jackson made to the story were minor, and seemingly necessary to translate this great work of literature into the theatrical medium of film. All in all, FOTR was pretty darn close to the book and helped bring my childhood imaginings of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli to life. Having read all of the books a number of times since I was little, you can imagine how I was looking forward to seeing The Two Towers in the same visual format as FOTR, as the book was full of action and exciting new monsters like the giant spider Shelob waiting for Frodo and Sam in the caverns of Mordor. But what a HUGE disappoint it turned out to be!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, we are treated to about 10 minutes of footage that we've already seen in FOTR, of course intermixed with some other footage of Gandalf and the Balrog, all but confusing the viewer. This opening footage was completely unnecessary for the viewer to follow the story, and just eats up valuable story telling screen time. I'll get to why this is important later.<br/><br/>After this, things seem to recover.Jackson follows the story line of the book for the most part, and then towards the middle of the movie, things go bad. Jackson begins taking liberties with the storyline.a story line written by a great author whose works are what made the fantasy of the LOTR popular. Are these changes necessary for the translation from book to film? Absolutely not. For example, the Ents are only persuaded to go and stop Saruman after Treebeard sees the destroyed forest surrounding Isengard.basically since Saruman is destroying trees, now it's the Ents problem when it wasn't before. The book of course shows the Ents deciding to attack Saruman because of the deeds he's already committed, his affiliation with the hated orcs, and the fact that they know if he wins, the Ents and trees will be doomed as well. The book shows the Ents being wise creatures, acting when necessary. The movie shows them as being uncaring separatists, who have to be persuaded by a couple of idiotic hobbits (which by the way have a REALLY lame persuading speech to the Ents, also not in the book).<br/><br/> We also have a scene with the Orcs riding on Worgs, attacking the Riders of the Mark and our remaining members of the fellowship. This whole scene isn't in the book at all, and though is a great action scene, and the Worgs are beautifully done, this whole scene wastes about 15 to 20 minutes of screen time. I'm unclear as to why this change was made; the original story line from the book accomplishes the same tasks, but with less time.<br/><br/>Next of course we have the Elves of Rivendale showing up at Helm's Deep. WHAT?!?! This change was made obviously to show some sort of good neighbor attitude from the Elves, but that wasn't of their nature. They were leaving, and made it clear that this fight was that of man. A totally unnecessary change. This fight scene is also full of slow motion camera tricks that are suppose to make the fight more dramatic and intense, but only stetch out an already long fight scene and actually take away from the intensity. For example, one of the Elf captains (who we see from the FOTR) ends up getting killed by an orc, and this scene is slowed down that it ends up taking almost 5 minutes to happen.and this is for a minor character who wasn't even in this scene in the book!!<br/><br/>And towards the end of the movie, the change that actually made me angry, was when Boromir's brother (Faramir) is charmed by the ring and takes Frodo, Sam, and Golum back to Gondor, and this point, the rest of the movie is basically NOTHING like the book. First of all, the book has Faramir turn down the chance to take the ring from Frodo while they are in Mordor. This shows the strength of character in Faramir, which was lacking in his brother. This action leads to events in the next book, the Return of the King. Also, with Faramir letting Frodo go free inside Mordor, this allows Frodo to continue his trek to Mount Doom and of course encounter Shelob and the fun twist of thinking Frodo has died by Shelob's bite. But of course, we are denied this, and instead get some lame battle against the Orcs at Gondor and the appearance of a Nazgul who Frodo basically gives himself up to. This whole scene goes against the strength and integrity contained in Frodo that allows him to get all the way to Mount Doom with the Ring in the books. If he wants to give himself up at the mere sight of a Nazgul, how is he going to make it past Sauron into Mount Doom? Of course a the end of this movie, Golum alludes to the fact that he's taking them to Shelob's lair, which of course indicates that the story line for The Return of the King is already screwed up.> The funny thing, is that without all these storyline changes, extended action scene `slow downs', and reused scenes from FOTR, Peter Jackson could have had plenty of time to follow the storyline created by Tolkien almost exactly, removing some of the longer speeches from the book, and delivered a much better movie to LOTR fans of the book as well as the first movie. Some LOTR movie fans would say to me that it's a great movie, and that it doesn't have to follow the book to be good, and normally I would agree. However, all this series of movies is now, is a stepladder for a mediocre director to make a name for himself by butchering a great piece of literature to fit his vision. In interviews he talks about how big a fan he is of Tolkien's works, and how he wanted to make these movies be as close to the books and stories as possible. FOTR did show that intention, however, The Two Towers did not, and in fact showed a bit of disdain for the original work. Characters are changed. Events are changed. The storyline is changed. How is this movie allowed to be called the Two Towers? In my opinion, this movie is terrible. Not as bad as say.Pluto Nash, but is an insult to any true LOTR fan. The special effects were great, but the rest of the movie (the substance of it) was trash.<br/><br/> I should say that this movie does have one saving grace.and that's the character and creation of Golum. Probably one of the best CG characters I've ever seen, Golum definitely embodies the character from the book in mannerisms, actions, and attitude. However, I would attribute the success of this character to Peter Jackson, rather the great writing of Tolkien and an obviously excellent CG crew.<br/><br/> P.S. This movie, or any of the LOTR series, should never be directly compared to the Star Wars Trilogy, as they are two completely different genres of movie making. Star Wars is a Sci-Fi fantasy, while LOTR is just plain fantasy. One has spaceships and laser guns, while the other has elves and dwarves. One Trilogy has affected generations of fans since it's creation and is an integral part of pop culture, while the other has p****d off literary fans while affecting only the lives of D&D players living in their parent's basements. One has a great director, who created an entire universe out of his imagination, while the other has a director who pirated a great book, and twisted it to his limited vision."
"jeffbmgd","7","1","4","1 January 2003"," 7 out of 10...and mainly for technical achievements.
","Perhaps a second viewing will change my mind.  But as of now, I was generally disappointed in ""The Two Towers"".<br/><br/>Not much in the way of character development, too much cross-cutting between scenes which oftentimes left me reeling. The FX were generally brilliant, though Merry and Pippin riding on Treebeard offered some pretty obvious green-screen backgrounds.<br/><br/>I suppose I was left cold the most by the end of the battle at Helms Deep. It just sort of ended...with no real explanation on how it ended...or why, etc.<br/><br/>The ""snowboarding"" of Legolas down the stairs was a real laugher, and not in a good sense.<br/><br/>I'm mainly p***ed that Andy Serkis as Gollum didn't get any sort of acknowledgement from the Oscar folk. He was absolutley brilliant. Was he left out because he was covered in CGI? Obviously. But is covering him in pixels any different than covering an actor in prosthetics/makeup? John Hurt was nominated for ""The Elephant Man"" in 1980...and no, he didn't win. But he was just as unrecognisable as Andy Serkis is in ""TTT"".<br/><br/>
As an aside, a brother-in-law and I saw it in it's second week of release. Both of us were left somewhat cold. He gave it an 8 out of 10, and I gave it a 7 out of 10. I gave it a 7 mainly for the sheer scope of the project, the cinematography, the costumes, the FX; all technical achievements. The only acting nod I can really give is again to Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>He saw it again just yesterday, and said it was way way (8 times he said ""way"") better the second time. And he has read the books until the pages fell out and bought them again. Perhaps I will feel the same when I use my free pass to see the movie again.<br/><br/>And there will be an extended version of all the ""Rings"" movies on DVD. I'm hopeful that ""TTT"" extended version will make it a more enjoyable film<br/><br/>
The extended version of ""Fellowship"" was far and above a better film than the theatrical release."
"jfritch53","2","1","4","22 December 2002"," i'm horrified...
","Spoilers!!!! That the makers of this movie can claim that it is based on Tolkien is amazing to me.  I'm not an official ""purist"", but I have read the books, and I know that the books are far better in every aspect.  But I won't even compare it to the books... even compared to the average movies coming out of Hollywood, this film is money-making trash.<br/><br/>In its defense I would say that the movie has excellent computer animations. I was very satisfied with the way the Ents looked and moved (and stomped on orcs!), and also was impressed with the oliphants.  In particular I liked the image of Gandalf and the Balrog falling towards the Underworld ocean. (even if it is not from the book)<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie is a mess.  Peter Jackson obviously could not handle the diverging plot lines.  (for example, Merry and Pippin are stuck on Treebeard's shoulder while about a week of movie time goes by - quite a long hike through the forest!)  The transitions between plots are interrupting, and jumble the flow of the story.  I can't imagine trying to make sense of what everyone was doing if I had not previously read the books.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie are completely boring, even the new ones. Now that the heroes have been introduced, it appears that the director has lost any energy to develop them further.  Gimli becomes the comic stump (and if I really want a dose of midget humor, I'll go to a frat party or watch Jackass).  Arwen's weepy narcissism goes out of control.  Way too much time is given to her and the other Elvish leaders to act as if they are speaking profoundly and weep prettily in screen closeups.  Legolas is now the stunt man, with very little character left to express.  Faramir is weak (should have followed the book, Mr. Jackson).  Eowynn will hopefully get more attention in the last movie, but she was well-done in the movie, as were Wormtongue and Eomer.  Gollum is also fairly amusing, even if he must be turned into a schizo-comic Hamlet.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie ended on a somewhat upbeat note (victory of Helm's Deep) instead of the darker, almost hopeless note of the book (Frodo taken captive by orcs after Shelob), is a critical flaw.  Precisely what makes one so eager to read on in Tolkien is the situation of near despair, which makes the reversals of fortune, or eucatastrophe, so welcome.  Maybe it's true that the middle book is the hardest one to pull off, but that's no excuse for making a poor movie.  I had hoped that Peter Jackson could rise to the occasion.  Instead he has made a mush of weak emotions, contrived nobility, and lots of slimy orcs.<br/><br/>I don't see how a fan of Tolkien can watch the movie and not feel at least a bit cheated, and a bit insulted.  This movie is neither beautiful nor interesting, in the artistic sense; it is flashy sensory entertainment produced for universal ease of consumption.  If you like the Tolkien-flavored yogurt, well then, enjoy."

","The Two Towers does something incredibly rare these days,that's outdo the 1st in every way possible. While Fellowship Of The Ring is technically good,and very well made,it wasn't very fun to watch at all. The Two Towers manages to grip you for the whole 170 minutes or so and that's quite a feat to pull off,because often for me that's way too overlong. The Battle sequences are quite a sight to be hold,it honestly never stops,it's just so action packed you won't have time to catch your breath. Everyone seemed so much more comfortable this time around,they all seemed to know there roles this time around,unlike the last time where everyone seemed all tense. I've never read the novels so I can't compare them to the films,but what I liked most about this film was the growing tension of Gollum's obsession with The Ring. He is frighteningly unpredictable and managed to make my skin crawl. I hadn't felt that much growing tension in a long,long time with Gollum and Frodo it was really harrowing stuff. While not quite the extent to ""Return Of The King"" you start to see the pressure Frodo has of being The Ring holder.<br/><br/>You slowly start to see him have a growing obsession for it,it just created a great storyline if you ask me. I also must mention how frightening Christopher Lee was as Saruman. he really gave me the creeps often and was the perfect foe. The Two Towers is everything Fellowship is not,it's exciting,tension filled and downright gripping.<br/><br/>Performances. Elijah Wood is perfect this time around. He is often a complete revelation. We feel for him,we feel his pressure,we also see how strong his friendship with Sam truly is. Sean Astin continues to grow as an actor. He is even better as Sam this time around,he has more to play with,his charisma with Elijah is even better this time around,if that's even possible. Ian McKellen is pure class all the way. He put on an intense show,Ian can do no wrong in my mind. Viggo Mortensen as i've mentioned before in my reviews is not a favorite of mine,but he is much better this time around as Aragorn. He is strong,charismatic and only had a few wooden moments,good job!. Billy Boyd&Dominic Monaghan provide decent comic relief and make a likable tandem. Christopher Lee plays one of the most frightening villains in years as Saruman. His banter with McKellen is a treat to watch. Miranda Otto is pretty cute and was quite likable as Eowyn. Bernard Hill carries quite a strong presence with him. I enjoyed his character as Theoden. Brad Dourif is always great as slimy characters,so it's only fitting he played Grima. Orlando Bloom is once again too cool for School. I normally despise Elves,but he is simply a bad ass. Cate Blanchett is OK,like the 1st. John Rhys-Davies is less annoying then in Fellowship,but really that's not saying much. Liv Tyler is quite wooden this time around,I often felt her scenes were worthless. Hugo Weaving is also wooden,unlike the 1st where he was a required presence. Rest of the cast do there jobs fine.<br/><br/>Bottom Line. Two Towers is excitement like no other. I am usually not a fan of this type of genre,but Two Towers is so exciting,I will make an exception in this case. You won't find excitement like this in a lot of place,so it's only right I give Two Towers my highest recommendation,I can possibly give.<br/><br/>10/10"

They meet Farimir and the rangers, they go to Osgilioth and then head towards the staircase, thats where they where that part of the story ends, but during this time several other stories are intwined. The stroy of Merry and Pippen who are captured by the Uru-kai and then run into the forest and meet treebeard and they try to convince the ents to attack Saruman and help fight the war. Also during this time it follows Aragorn Legolas and Gimli who try to find the hobbits bu meet with Gandalf who is a white wizard after his near death expirence they head to Rohan and free King Theoden from Sarumans wrath and flee to helms deep to fight Sarumans forces.

I enjoyed the first one so much that by the time this one came around I had no option but to, again, expect nothing but excellence. The bar was set, the standards were made, and they were already as high as they could be...and they did it again! Flawless execution in adaption, remarkable cinematography, convincing acting, exciting battles, great choreography and overall storytelling.<br/><br/>This chapter in the series is the most action oriented. I mean sure, the last movie may have had the largest battle scene ever seen on screen today but ""The Two Towers"" was the one to actually go deep into the battle and really bring about a great war epic. This one incorporated a lot of eye candy for the typical everyday movie viewer. Yes, slashing, hacking, bow work, and massacres of bloody orcs aplenty! But don't let that fool you, it's also filled with an excellent story and expansion of character development.<br/><br/>This time around the story focuses even more in on the world of men. It deals with men struggling to survive in a war that is quickly turning directly toward them. And while J.R.R. Tolkein's books dealt a lot with the half lings and their journey to destroy the One Ring, he also dealt a lot with man and their common struggles of power, love, and honor. He was after all a man himself...most of his writings in fact actually reflected his own life when it came to stories of men.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this movie; how the music captures the heart of Middle Earth, how the sets for Rohan (the mountainous land of men) looked so convincingly real and inhabitable, etc. But I'll stop it short and just let you know that this movie is no let down, just like ""Fellowship"" was no let down either. It continues to give justice to Tolkein's work and it's pulled off with style, integrity, and excellent workmanship. ""The Two Towers"" will inform the public of the wonderful work Tolkein did 50 years ago, and entertain even more."
"sharonlowen","2","1","5","22 December 2006"," The only words I can say about this movie....
","It's a movie about walking! That's it. It really is one of the worst, most boring and tiresome films I have ever seen, and I've watched loads of films! I do not know how they managed to make the film this long with not much storyline to it. I would not recommend this, there is no point to it.<br/><br/>I can't say much more about it as it is walking, more walking and a ring. I think how they made 3 films about the same storyline is beyond me. I think the books were just as boring, and can't believe the publicity they have got of how 'good' they are, they are not. The effects, set and acting is reasonable, but that is nothing if there is no storyline."
"Spleen","3","1","5","2 January 2003"," The earlier film was a disgrace; this one is even more of a disgrace.
","One hears a lot about the overwhelming majority of people who think otherwise (as if overwhelming majorities cannot be wrong), but I don't believe that this majority exists. Many of the people I talk to know full well how bad Jackson's films are, and most of the rest are ambivalent; moreover, as I watch the people walking out of ""The Two Towers"", few are genuinely excited. Most of them look as though they've been bludgeoned into submission by crude overkill and sheer boredom. I'm sure many of these poor souls come to THINK they liked the film, but I think they're wrong even on this point.<br/><br/>Before I launch into my attack (the film itself did nothing but attack ME for three hours; now it's my turn to attack IT), I'm obliged to point out that it does improve on ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" in some respects. It looks better. Rohan really looks like Rohan, or if not like Rohan, at least like some place in particular (in the original, Jackson mixed unrelated and mostly unattractive locations with wild abandon), the CGI is marginally less offensive, and there is one (1) effective use of imagery: the bit in which Frodo's elven cloak makes him look like a rock. This is not to say that the film is on balance a visual success. The camera still swoops around too much (reminding one of a British Airways ad, and composer Howard Shore has obligingly written music to complete the effect), and the endless hordes of Nintendo creatures in the interminable battle scenes fail to look one tenth as thrilling as a real shot of a handful of real people standing on a real hill (when the camera stays still enough to let us get a good look at either, which isn't often).<br/><br/>But let's look at some of the changes Jackson has made to the story and the characters. I'd like to make it clear: I don't object to changes per se. The day I say ""The Two Towers"" I also saw ""Treasure Planet"", which (disappointment though it was) was a far more intelligent adaptation of an original work  it moved the entire sequence of events centuries ahead and into outer space, yes, but it neither made complete nonsense of nor wilfully misunderstood its own story. It's the NATURE of Jackson's changes, not the mere fact that changes were made, that show us just how inept a film-maker he really is. Consider (spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>(1) Faramir in the book finds out about the ring in a private conference between himself, Frodo, and Sam, and has the wisdom to let it be then and there; Faramir in the film decides to pounce on the ring immediately as extras run around behind, in front of and between the various parties, and he even binds the hobbits and drags them to Gondorso that we are forced to sit through YET ANOTHER tedious ""action"" sequence before he changes his mind. One wonders: what's the point in even hiring two actors to play Boromir and Faramir, rather than one, if their characters are identical? And why not have Tolkein's quiet moment of truth in private, when we've already sat through more than enough sword-clashing? Not content by this blunder, Jackson compounds it, by letting us know that not just Faramir, not just the underlings he carelessly discusses state secrets in front of, but everyone of any consequence in Gondor, knows all about the ring. We're told that Faramir is LEGALLY BOUND to seize that ring, and that his life will be forfeit if he does not. ""Then it's forfeit,"" he says, thrusting out his chest and waiting for the curtain to fall. No doubt these words sound very fine to thirteen-year-old Dungeons and Dragons players, but if Boromir was merely obeying the law on pain of death when he tried to take the ring, doesn't this make COMPLETE NONSENSE of all the earlier characterisation, such as it was (and destroy any sense we may have of the way in which the Ring corrupts genuine goodness)? Indeed it does.<br/><br/>(2) The Ents, we are told, are ""not hasty"" (and the film is concerned to make sure that this trait is played for cheap laughs). They deliberate at great length before deciding to remain neutral. Then  at the sight of destruction they knew about anyway  it takes them FIVE SECONDS to change their mind and go to war. (Five seconds is the time it takes all of them, collectively, to mount an invasion. Individual minds switch track more quickly still.) Does Jackson have the SLIGHTEST CLUE what he is doing?<br/><br/>I could multiply examples easily: the contrived suspense of Aragorn's ""death"", the intrusion of elves into those parts of the story where their intrusion makes no sense, the fact that the elves look like the kind of stormtroopers that vampires would have used if vampires had invented fascism, the bickering between Frodo and Sam and between Theoden and everyone. But it's not just the idiocy of these changes individually that worries me, but their effect collectively. Jackson says that his version of ""The Two Towers"" is ""darker"" than Tolkein's; for ""darker"", read bloodthirstier, more cynical, more redolent of right-wing nastiness, less variegated. HIS world is one in which people squabble constantly, in which nobody has an unprompted noble thought or impulse, in which the forces of good have little left worth saving and in which power has little left worth the trouble of corrupting. It's the small-minded and mean-spirited work of a director who (as we know from a thousand flat-footed errors) is unable to handle a large canvas  whose mind is unable to encompass a large world containing more than one kind of thing.<br/><br/>It's a disgrace."

Most of the ""great"" reviews on here were constructed by the crowd that has a low IQ, goes to malls and drinks 2 gallons of soda each day, suffice it to say, this is merely ""eye candy"" to folks like that but when you analyze the actual picture, it is absolutely worthless garbage even on that level.  I sat through 4 hours of this junk simply to be amazed at how terrible it was. The plot is so thin and the dialogue so silly that one is amazed at how many people were hired on this picture.  Spending millions of dollars, on mostly awful animated sequences that aren't done very well, the director has given people expecting a story nothing but reason to critique him. In one scene the light is very bright and when the scene is cut to a part which is illustrated with computers, it becomes dark, such inconsistencies are obvious throughout.  The battle scenes are supposed to be funny because some of the ""heros"" should have been killed long ago but they hack about 600 orcs.  Gosh, is this made for teens?  My grade: D."

Characters were eliminated and added for no aparent reason. The personalities of characters were different for no apparent reason.

","Both in relation to the book and as a movie in its own right, The Fellowship of the Ring was far better. If The Two Towers is a must-see nevertheless, it is thanks to the computer-generated character of Gollum. He comes out incredibly life-like, which is even more remarkable as that creature does not resemble anything on earth, at least not in appearance. This is the one point where the movie actually surpasses the book. I am willing to forgive the addition of a loincloth to Gollum's body (naked in the book) because I understand that otherwise there would have been trouble, especially in the USA.<br/><br/>If for the sake of action Moria was overdone in The Fellowship of the Ring (a scene reminding me of Indiana Jones), here the same happens to the Battle of the Hornburg. Among the changes to the plot the one that annoyed me most was Faramir's taking the hobbits as far as Osgiliath and to release them without obvious reason. Boromir was Faramirized in The Fellowship of the Ring, recognizing Aragorn as his King (""king"" being his last word - oh, how I loathed that!), and now Faramir is Boromirized. (I am afraid in The Return of the King Denethor will be Sarumanized.) Aragorn's fall from the cliff, leaving him presumed dead for some time, was an unnecessary addition; could it be that in Part III his ride on the Paths of the Dead will be omitted instead?"

"bthack","5","1","6","2 January 2003"," How to turn a masterpiece into schlock
","Anyone who has read the Lord of the Rings trilogy and has an appreciation for the depth of characters and the richness of the dialog will be absolutely appalled by this screen play. I've seen movies where the writers/directors have taken ""artistic license"" with the original story, but I've never appreciated how deeply a story could be debased until I saw this film. The screen writer did to this movie what a 10 year old with finger paints does to a masterpiece painting.<br/><br/>Most of the new characters introduced in The Two Towers - Faramir, Theoden, and Treebeard - were dumbed down and converted to antagonists, whereas in the original story, each was a character of unique nobility and wisdom. I found myself shaking my head at the end of the Entmoot, groaning at Theoden's decision to ostracize Eomer and send the civilians to Helm's deep, blinking in disbelief when Faramir stuck his sword into the Ring around Frodo's neck.<br/><br/>It's not easy to capture the majesty and integrity of Tolkien's characters on film, but given that the story ranks as one of world's greatest, the writer and director should at least have treated it with some respect, and not defiled it the way the orcs defiled the king's head at the Cross Roads in Ithilien (which was not in the movie).<br/><br/>For those moviegoers who have not developed a deep appreciation of Tolkien's masterpiece, the Two Towers is an extravaganza of special effects and brilliant imagery, and a great action movie. But for those of us who revere the original trilogy, we'll probably have to wait another 20 years for a true-to-the-story remake."

Having drifted from the source material, the choices made by the filmmakers seemed puzzling.  This adaptation contained a heavy dose of screenwriting cliches in place of character development.

It is just a different movie and in the end, falls flat with its overblown battle scenes and contrived story-telling.  After watching the movie, ask yourself: where's this film's Mines of Moria? Unfortunately, there isn't.  Helm's Deep was just a big mess, especially the part when Aragorn and Gimli swung themselves from the trapped door onto the gate of the keep, in order to slow down the Urak-hai.  Merry and Pippin's story-line with Treebeard and the Ents was just a waste of time and they should had either cut thte scenes to a bare minimum or spend more time developing it.  Faramir was another popular character that shows up late but was vastly under-utilized.  In the end, we get little from his character, kinda like Boba Fett in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.  The only saving grace from the film is Gollum who I thought was a terrific CGI character. Miranda Otto is also easy on the eyes and I wished she had a larger part other than looking good.  So save yourself the 9 bucks and rent it next August when it comes out on video/DvD.  6 out of 10 stars."

","OK. Lord of the Rings is an amazing book. I agree. The story is incredibly well told. What it just seems to me is that everyone wants to love this movie so much. Everyone wants it to be the best movie they have ever seen and therefore they vote it to that position. Has anyone really sat down and looked at the cinematography? What is so amazing? Whwat is so groundbreaking? It tells a decent story...based on a story that is already great. I mean King Arthur was terrible and that is a great story so I guess there is something to be said for LOTR. Bur really. I mean The Matrix (original) brought so much more to film than LOTR will ever bring. The Wachoski's bring amazing cinematography with great writing and a great story that is not already someone else's. Not to say there is anything wrong with remaking a great story into a movie, just that it doesn't bring anything new to the table. I agree that these films are good. I enjoyed them. However, that doesn't mean that they are great cinema. They are not. They are great entertainment. Period. For this movie to be rated so highly on IMDb just shows that this forum is not for people who really pushing the bounds of film making but only for those who like what is considered to be a blockbuster. The Matrix was not a blockbuster, although it was rated highly, but many other films are not. If the Harry Potter movies were made 30 years after they were then I feel that they would get this same reaction. I mean really think about that. If these films were made right after the books had come out and when they were just popular, would the movies have been as successful? No. They wouldn't have been. They would have been regarded the same way HP is. They would not have been given the Oscars etc. It just makes me sad that people don't look at the art of cinematography in the movies anymore. Many writers have written great stories that can be told in many mediums, but I feel that something extra needs to be added other than just tons of special computer battle scenes to make a movie great. This movie is not great. It is far from it. It is a mediocre telling of a great story, and although the battle scenes are phat as hell, the rest of the movie, including Orlando Bloom's atrocious acting are a disgrace to it. An 8.8 is much to overrated for this pop-culture infested excuse for cinema."

"TheOny13","10","0","1","25 May 2019"," Still to this day one of the greatest achievements in cinema history!
","Before saying anything about this masterpiece, I will say that this is my favorite Lord of The Rings movie by far. While the first is an adventure that is just basically filler from the moment the Fellowship is formed and until it is broken and the third one is basically Deus Ex Machina after Deus Ex Machina, this one is the perfect balance between storytelling and epicness on a biblical level.<br/><br/>Ever since I watched the trilogy as I was a little boy 12 or 13 years old, this was the movie that made me fall in love with middle earth. I still remember the excitement I had as I watched this movie the first time and how amazed I was seeing all the pieces of the movie's story come together in what is one of the best third acts of any movie I've ever seen. So why is this movie for me the best one of the trilogy?<br/><br/><ul><li>Unlike the first one, where after the Fellowship is formed they basically just pass one obstacle after another with no connection whatsoever between them (not to say that it introduces so much lore and stuff that probably only book fans would know like the ancient creature by the end which serves absolutely no purpose to the story other than killing Gandalf), this movie takes the pieces left by the first movie and just develops such an interesting story with each of the characters. Merry and Pipin have their adventure discovering Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas go to Rohan and prepare for the ineviatable battle which will come upon Helm's Deep, while Frodo and Sam continue their Journey encoutering Smeagol and trying to make him lead them through the mountains towards mount Doom. And that is probably the best part of the movie: the urgency of the situation. The impending doom that's coming from Isengard upon the realm of men and how can they stop this. Every story goes at the beginning it's own separate way just so that by the end they all come full circle and connect with each other for a masterfull ending.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Unlike the third movie this movie doesn't rest on Deus Ex Machina to resolve it's conflicts but rather develops each story in it's own way and lets you think they have nothing to do with each other, only to have them come together by the end in an epic finale. For example: Gandalf's intervention by the end is well developed and is NOT a Deus Ex Machina since he went to get help and by the end of the movie he brings indeed help. Merry and Pipin's story seamingly unimportant at the beginning of the movie it does play and enormous role by the end of this movie and also in the beginning of the next, by having the threes intervene and destroy Isengard.</li></ul><br/><br/>All the other things about cinematography or visual effects not to mention the music (which is spectacular) make this movie a fantastic fantasy movie and an example on how to adapt a fantasy source material to the big screen. This is and will remain for me the best Lord Of The Rings movie and one of the best acomplishments in cinema history. A shame this movie wasn't nominated for many oscars like the other two did, since it is at least as good as teh other two if not better."

Starring Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Astin.<br/><br/>The story continues with Frodo and Sam trying to destroy the ring, during the journey they met Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, drawing closer to his kingly destiny, rallies forces of good for the battles that must come.<br/><br/>If you read my first review of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so you already know that I loved how they set the characters and how they made the special effects, etc... And you also know that I didn't like the performance, and the direction sometimes wasn't good for me. So I watched this one and I was hoping to see these flaws got fixed. So, did they fix it? Not that much to be noticed, but as a middle chapter of a trilogy setting all paces for the final one, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is completely amazing, also for the fans of the book and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers has lots of amazing special effects just like the first one, I was still amazed of how talented and unique the creators of this movie were, I mean some movies were released in the same year but the special effects weren't that good, not even close.<br/><br/>The performances on the other hand are the same, the only one that was brilliant is Andy Serkis as Gollum, all the others are the very same, and I didn't like them before, so it's the same problem, but Andy Serkis improved it.<br/><br/>I liked the direction a little tiny pit more than the first one.<br/><br/>So technically, as it's obvious, I liked The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers more than The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, especially the story, which was fast-paced and better than the first one. So as it's improved, it's definitely getting a higher grade, so I'm gonna give The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers an A!<br/><br/>I really had lots of fun, while talking with you about The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, and I'm so excited to talk to you about The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, and it's gonna be very soon.<br/><br/>Alright, guys thank you for reading my review, hope you like, and if you do, please, support my work to encourage me to carry one."

There are so many characters to introduce and develop which is not easy, but Jackson does an amazing job.<br/><br/>My only real complaint rewatching it now is the amount of comedy that occurs, especially during intense fight scenes. I understand that Gimli is comic relief, but at times it gets a bit much. My only minor gripe. Its not enough to take away from my 10 rating.<br/><br/>If you havnt seen these movies you need to watch them, this one being my personal favorite. The actors, pacing, tone, everything is spot on.

","Let's be honest, the Lord of the Rings saga is the best saga ever made!"
"Wuchakk","6","0","1","10 March 2018"," That Damned Ring
","RELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien's popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving 'Fellowship' of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour. <br/><br/>This three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there's a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there's not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you'll likely appreciate this installment more than me. <br/><br/>There are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they're also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be. <br/><br/>Another problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that's about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. ""Mythica: A Quest for Heroes"" (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. <br/><br/>Despite these negatives, ""The Two Towers"" was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie. <br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. <br/><br/>GRADE: B-/C+"

","Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.<br/><br/>The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).<br/><br/>For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.<br/><br/>In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, 10/10."

"ElMaruecan82","7","0","1","11 November 2016"," Too much of an ""in-betweener"" to be fully enjoyed, except for the introduction of one key character...
","I called ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" the first instant classic of the 21st century and one of the many accomplishments the film achieved was to be listed as the 2nd Best Fantasy Movie by the American Film Institute and to be the most recent film to make it in the AFI's Top 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. What I forgot to mention is that it wasn't the most recent to be listed in any AFI's film for this privilege goes to its successor ""The Two Towers"" listed in AFI's Top 100 Movie Quotes. Do I need to mention which line made it in the Top 100?<br/><br/>The line says a lot about the key element of ""The Two Towers"", it introduced one to one of the most emblematic characters of the trilogy, the creepy yet weirdly cute in his childlike attitude: Gollum. In less than ten minutes, Gollum is as fully developed a character as all the members of the Fellowship of the Ring put together, from his voice and speech mannerisms to his elastic moves and constant crawling as if he was constantly looking for something one might have accidentally dropped, something of high value, that he'd call, with his raspy and ominous voice, ""my previous"". And if it wasn't for the introduction of Gollum, I'm afraid the second opus of the trilogy might have only been a continuation. <br/><br/>And even being the continuation of a classic full of so many characters and based on the rich, dense and labyrinthine plot of Tolkien's book isn't enough to grab you by the eyes and hook you to the story, unless you're hardcore Tolkien's fan, and even then. A second opus isn't just the 'what-goes-next' but also the second offering of a director, and apart from the hypnotic presence of Gollum and his mysterious and fascinating split personality, I must admit that sometimes, throughout the film, I stopped paying attention to the screen. I know everything looked great, and everyone did justice to their roles. But it seemed like the novelty was gone, and the plot dragged on for too long. Ironically, the Tolkien purists complained that five chapters were abandoned and the story went too fast.<br/><br/>I trust their perception but I think this says a lot more about the difficulty to adapt a story of such epic scale. At one point, there were new characters every ten minutes, and they all looked the same: dressed with medieval fashion, long hair, bearded, noble looking or close enough. So I tried to focus on the faces I knew, the ones I could name, and eventually, I could spell, I felt secure as long as I had Frodo in the screen, and Sam, Gollum who won me instantly, Araghorn, Legolas and Gimli (whose height relegated him to the rank of comic reliefs after the two side- kicks hobbits were gone). But by the second third of the film, even these characters couldn't carry the story. There came a moment where Frodo's wide-eyed expression started to annoy me, where I didn't much care for the talking tree subplot and when even the return of Gandalf left me perplex.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" confronted me to the one reality that the first installment miraculously prevented; I'm not into Fantasy movies. Not to be pedant or cynical, but I'd say the problem of Fantasy is that it has too much fantasy indeed, it is so virtually full of possibilities that even death loses its realism, anyone can kill but anyone can be saved, I knew Gandalf would survive and was I glad to see him back on the screen, but when you have a character falling to a certain death in a mountain of lava and coming back triumphant, you know the notions of odds is relative. It's like the entire storytelling is governed by the primitive pattern that good guys will win, inevitably, because they're good by essence not because of some powers or skills. Inversely, the enemy contains so many hideous creatures that you know they're like naturally inept to win, on the long term.<br/><br/>The film was great in every technical aspect, the production design, the special effects, the battle sequences, but the offering was nothing new once you've digested the first part. The film certainly works as a link between the introduction to this magical universe and what will be the climactic confrontation of the end, but that's what it is, an in-between movie highlighted by the introduction of Gollum, which is the equivalent of Master Yoda in ""The Empires Strikes Back"", but ""Two Towers"" is no ""Empire"" equal. ""Empire"" is a classic on its own, not a continuation. Besides, the ""Star Wats"" trilogy was built on a three-year span between the movies while ""The Lord of the Rings"" provided each opus one year after another, the first one was the immersion, the last one was the farewell. The second was probably the one that had the least time to be appreciated. <br/><br/>And maybe Peter Jackson knew it and you can tell some unusual hastiness in the storytelling, the one pointed out by the Tolkien fans. Maybe this is why it focuses more on the human characters and on more conventional war/history movies tropes, while the Hobbits are left in the background. Somehow, anyone would get the feeling that the third one will be better, so perhaps the merit of ""Two Towers"" lies on the frail shoulders of Gollum, the first CGI character played by an actor, Andy Serkis. The combination of electronics and real acting, seven years before ""Avatar"" is the one milestone, the film achieved. Not that bad, after all."

I will never forget how I eagerly awaited this movie trilogy, as well as the thrill of the movies when I first saw them in the cinema. And with each new viewing, enjoyment is no less. Although I don't like movies this long, the twelve hours of ""The Lord of the Rings"" just fly by.<br/><br/>It is far from being the perfect movie, as many seem to perceive it. I find many changes to the book to be unnecessary hollywoodization. Elijah Wood never felt right in the role of Frodo, and his latently gay relationship with Sam will never stop poking my eyes. It may be up to me, but I've never experienced it in a book. There are a lot more of all sorts of minor complaints, but in spite of them, the overall impression of this epic trilogy in every respect is an unforgettable experience. A very well adapted story, camera, directing and effects that take your breath away, mostly excellent cast choices and ingeniously blended music that greatly enhances the already perfect atmosphere, make this film a masterpiece of the genre and, in my opinion, one of the best film achievements of all time.<br/><br/>10/10"

There are newer characters and few old ones seem to have been rested, for good. Yet, the fascination does not stop and it gets more engaging with this one.<br/><br/>I am actually happy revisiting these films as I seem to understand more points about the story than I did earlier. I cannot put them here and become a spoiler as I am an ardent fan of the Lord of the Rings. Rather, I can say that everyone must see why this is one of the finest fantasies brought alive on celluloid.<br/><br/>The fellowship of the earlier film is split and yet each one is in the same pursuit. Their ways are different now, but the goal is still the same. The characterizations are still consistent and it makes it easier to understand the intention of each one. Also, it makes the story all the more fascinating.<br/><br/>I love the technical aspects of the film, and that's one of the very reasons why this fantasy is highly appreciated. The visuals, the sound, the whole landscape. It seems so unreal and yet is so very connected. Peter Jackson is a genius who brought the whole middle earth in front of our eyes and yet everything seems like it existed at one point of time in reality. Also, he knows when to end and what to do with the material at hand. That's where his genius is. This film takes off from a good point and lands at a very wonderful point, making us more eager to be on the next adventure.<br/><br/>It's a 5/5 for this one and is one of the greatest films and adventures ever."

","Well, I'll be darned if this isn't one of the best epic movies I've ever seen in my life. And am ever likely TO see in my life. Following in the footsteps of THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, Peter Jackson's second instalment of the trilogy ups the ante tenfold, offering one amazing movie packed with heart, action, romance, dazzling effects, and brilliant characters. Thankfully free of the time-consuming introduction needed to begin the first part of Tolkien's trilogy, Jackson now has time to focus on developing characters, perilous quests, and, of course, out-and-out action. I'm an action lover at heart so I was in seventh heaven watching this movie. Everything you could want from the second book is here, up on screen and even more amazing than Tolkien could render. Plus, Jackson has done his magic and inserted a few memorable scenes of his own so there are plenty of surprises even for those who know whats coming.<br/><br/>Where to begin with such a film? The characters, I guess. Jackson takes the option of cross-cutting repeatedly between the three different sets of principal characters and his method pays off nicely, offering a well-rounded film that never lets up with the drama (I was astonished that three hours had passed by the time this was over – it felt more like just one hour). Merry and Pippin's encounter with the Ents is awe-inspiring stuff. Of course, a walking tree is a hard thing to portray, but with the aid of some outstanding special effects Jackson does it and does it so superbly. Then we have Frodo and Sam crossing the dead marshes (complete with creepy corpse ghosts – the horror imagery is strong in this movie folks, and Jackson doesn't skimp on the splatter either) and meeting up with totally CGI-created Gollum. Gollum is fantastic, a breath of life straight from the book; Andy Serkis does wonders with his voice and movements and helps to craft the flawed, schizophrenic psychology of the ugly but hugely sympathetic creature.<br/><br/>The main action, of course, comes from the whole Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli storyline, mixing in plenty of incident and nasty creatures along the way. The bear-like Whargs are violent and unpleasant; the Oliphants are amusing and breathtaking in equal measure; the Nazgul and their winged demons are fantastic to behold. Visually, the film is always spectacular, splendid and sweeping; it makes even better use of the varied New Zealand countryside than the last film which is no mean feat. Howard Shore's sweeping score is better than before and highlights the evocative nature of the movie, often threatening to overwhelm us with the sheer wonder of it all. This IS Tolkien.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie finishes off with the battle of Helm's Deep, a forty-minute non-stop barrage of carnage and destruction, explosions, mayhem and might. It's easily one of the best battles ever put on film and the special effects are entirely convincing (as they are throughout). I'll confess that I was close to tears at a couple of points – the white light streaming onto the battlefield, the breaking of the dam at Isengard – these flawless moments just choked me up and made me glad to be able to appreciate the true wonder of cinema. The cast is flawless – exemplary performances from the recurring cast members, kudos to newcomers Brad Dourif, Miranda Otto, and Karl Urban, and especial mention to Bernard Hill. Nothing more can be said. A modern classic I'm only too privileged to have seen on its opening night."

","The Fellowship has gone their separate ways. Some shed of their mortal coil, others to recover captured friends, while two Hobbits venture towards Mordor to destroy the ring.<br/><br/>The skillful Kiwi director Peter Jackson along with co-writers Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens top the previous instalment not just in scale, notably the battle scenes and attack on Helm's Deep, but in character development. The Two Towers is a near on perfect a fantasy epic with more digestible dialogue, which builds tension and momentum that complements the action with its chases and lengthy and difficult conflicts. <br/><br/>Again Howard Shore's score is outstanding and heightens the emotional scenes and battles. The groundbreaking practical and digital visual effects, sets, costumes, props and locations are commendable. We have more weird and wonderful inhabitants of Middle- Earth as well as the introduction of new characters King Théoden (Bernard Hill), Miranda Otto is delightful as Eowyn and Gollum (CGI performed and voiced tremendously by Andy Serkis), is revealed fully. David Wenham is Faramir (brother of Boromir), worming calculating Wormtongue played by Brad Dourif and warrior Eomer is played by Karl Urban.<br/><br/>Gimli, Aragorn and Legolas becomes closer. With a telling flashback of his Balrog fight Gandalf the Grey returns as more serious Gandalf the White. There's sagacious interplay between Sam, Frodo and Gollum as their journey to destroy the ring is met with obstacles. Aragorn's love for Arwen is tested. With the drama of Théoden being under a draining mind control spell there's also plenty of action, Rohan's soldiers slicing and dicing Orcs and Uruk-hai, and a showdown with Warg riders where Aragorn seemingly dies. There's also two great battles, an army of Tree Ents taking on Saruman, while Rohan's army along with warrior Elves go head to head with a countless Orc and Uruk-hai armies at Helms Deep.<br/><br/>The extended version of The Two Towers like its predecessor improves on Jackson's theatrical cut, Sam uses his Elvish rope (which ties in with an extended scene in The Fellowship of the Ring), Merry, Pippin and Treebeard have more screen time and we find out how old Aragon actually is. Flashbacks reveal more of Faramir's family dynamics as well as more backstory to the sadly missed Boromir. <br/><br/>As a fantasy sequel and midway part you couldn't ask for much more, excellent entertainment."

","""The Two Towers"" has just the same amount of heart as ""Fellowship"", but on a much bigger scale. In this film, the fellowship from the first film is now split up into small groups of two or three, but in a way they are closer than ever. The last film showed how the characters care for each other inspired courage in them, and how without each other they were nothing. This film shows this on a bigger scale, not just uniting the characters even closer, but the races of humans, elves, and ents, showing that in the end they are all fighting for the same cause, for some good in the world. This film introduces one of the most tortured and iconic characters of the series, Golemn... or, Smeagle. At first glance he seems like a monster, but really he is just torn into 2 halves, one loyal and scared, the other dominating and deceitful, and everyday is a struggle fir him. Sam dislikes him and distrusts him, but no one understands his struggle more than Frodo. Frodo has seen it almost happen to Bilbo, and its happening to him. The ring is beginning to overtake him. Frodo needs to know that Smeagle/Golem can get better, because then he can believe that there is still hope for him that he can go back to the way he was. <br/><br/>There is a large war in this film with great action, but the action also highlights the way in which the characters have developed. They work with each and help each other not to survive, but because they care for each other, and they know that they must unite against the bad that there is in the world. There are great character moments such as the moment where Gimli asks Aragorn to throw him, showing his trust for him while in the previous movie he states, ""No one throws a dwarf"".<br/><br/>Mary and Pippin are almost killed, but they run into a forest and are taken away by ents, who turn out to be rather friendly. But when they meet to discuss what they should do about this war that is happening, they choose not to intervene. Mary is upset because he knows the long term effect of what will happen if the orcs win the war (""There will be no shire""). But when the ent sees fields of his fallen friends, he knows that he must fight with those that are still alive with him, because you can use apathy to hide from the dangers of the world as much as you'd like, but eventually they will catch up with you, so the only thing you can do is fight for what you have left. <br/><br/>At many times it seems there is no hope for the characters, specifically Aragorn and Frodo, but Aragorn continues on because he knows that Arwen will be waiting for him on the other side. Frodo continues because, as we find out through an incredibly heartfelt speech by Sam, they believe that there is still good in the world, and it's worth fighting for. That is just one line from his fantastic speech, but it embodies what I love about the Lord of the Rings movies. There may be hobbits and elves and orcs and magic and dwarfs and wizards and even talking trees, but it is a deeply human story. Just like our world, there is also lots of hate and temptation and evil, but eventually it all passes, because we have people like Frodo and Sam, who are not super heroes, but normal human beings who are scared and absolutely need each other to regain courageous, but they know that there is good in the world that is worth fighting for."

","It's a thrilling three-hour epic that flies at a gallop, boasts the most impressive computer graphics yet created, and succeeds smashingly as grownup drama and kid-captivating fan. When Gandalf arrives with reinforcements, descending a near-vertical slope using horses where you or I would use snowboards, the spirit of triumphant rampage is something rarely glimpsed since the days of Olivier and Henry V. To live up to expectations, The Two Towers only had to be as good as its predecessor -- and, astoundingly, it's better. The battle for Gollum's mind also provides a fitting teaser conclusion to the second act of a story I'm beginning to wish would never end. Part two is more a straight-ahead action flick, substituting brawn and brawling for the pastoral radiance of the first film. this three hour epic is one of those few films where you leave feeling they could have spent even more time with story explanation and exposition"

","This is the continuation of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel that J.R.R. Tolkien wrote after his passage through the trenches in First World War. This film was shot by the same cast and crew of the first, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a strategy that has given a great cohesion to the entire trilogy. In this film, the plot thickens with the division of the Fellowship: Frodo and Sam desperately trying to get to Mordor while the men, grouped around the kingdom of Rohan, begin the war against the orc's and uruk's of Sauron and Saruman. The climax of the film, the battle of Helm's Deep, is probably one of the most tense and epic battle scenes in history of contemporary cinema. From this point of view, this film surpasses in adrenaline the first of the saga. For the action scenes, the expertise of digital computerization was key. Proof of this is the character Gollum, a completely digital creation that received the voice of Andy Serkis, or Treebeard, who has the voice of John Rhys-Davies (actor who also plays Gimli).<br/><br/>This film helped to increase the interest of the audience for the trilogy that until then, and despite the success of the first film, had gone unnoticed for many. In fact, if we think rightly, the trilogy has even popularize Tolkien, an English writer who, until then, was an illustrious unknown to almost all those who weren't English or don't speak English as their mother tongue. Suddenly, not only everyone spoke of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and Tolkien, as well as the novels it had to be translated into new languages ​​and were the subject of an important and positive revaluation.<br/><br/>Epic in the true word of the term, this film, and the whole trilogy, learned once again become popular this genre of cinema, that now became more affordable for studios thanks to the computerization.

","The Two Towers - aka: ""the one that usually gets mostly skipped during a LOTR marathon"". Perhaps a film that was continuously mistakenly referred to as ""Lord of the Rings: The Twin Towers"" released the year after 9/11 was always going to have a bit of a rough go standing out amidst the splashier, more gratifying bookending acts of its franchise. It's obviously still a masterpiece - no one disputes that - but, being heavier on the action, hardship, and lacking major punctuations of narrative momentum, definitively the black sheep of the trilogy (notice the lack of Empire Strikes Back comparisons from those talking' Tolkien). But this marginalization isn't fair, as it overlooks how much The Two Towers does accomplish - arguably, the subtlest, cleverest film of the trilogy - and how indispensable it is to the meat of Tolkien's triumph. <br/><br/>If Fellowship is all about ""why we fight"" with its vision of the joyful, utopian tranquility of the Shire worth preserving at all costs, and Return of the King is all about triumphant closure, The Two Towers has the tricky task of being the 'the night is darkest before the dawn' hump of the trilogy, establishing the full scope and ripple-effects of the battle for Middle Earth, and how crucial victory is for an increasingly fleshed-out world. Jackson takes this to heart - fittingly, The Two Towers is literally darker, filtered through barren browns and blueish-greys. This darkness also amps up the violence in the notoriously most action-heavy of the trilogy. At the point where Bilbo was extolling the virtues of pipe weed in Fellowship, in The Two Towers, we're greeted with a pile of steaming, charred orc bodies and heads on stakes, having just waded through the massacre of a helpless village, and an interlude of orc cannibalism. Yum. <br/><br/>But Two Towers isn't just viscerally grim: it also delves the most into addiction subtext. Andy Serkis' sublime, show-stealing work conveying the schizophrenic eager puppy dog and warped spitefulness of Gollum (including Frodo's tearful plea regarding why he has to believe Gollum can be saved) and Rohirrim King Théoden (proud, powerful Bernard Hill) withering at the hands of the seedy Wormtongue (the sickeningly perfect Brad Dourif) allow for quieter, moving moments of pathos amidst the more grandiose macro conflicts. It's also easily the most political, with the Ents vs. Isengard vignette proudly hammering (ha) Tolkien's anti- industrialization theme, while Treebeard's Entmoot conference is a deliciously sly parody of the slowness and inefficiency of bureaucracy in crisis situations, especially when intercut with the ferocious battle of Helm's Deep. Meanwhile, the Rohan refugee crisis has a distressingly topical political urgency of its own, keeping a human face on the devastation of Sauron and Saruman's machinations.<br/><br/>That said, this is still the same movie where Viggo Mortensen makes out with a horse. Astutely aware of the heaviness at play, Jackson mines for comedy respites whenever he can, with many thanks to John Rhys-Davies' 'Gimli the comic relief dwarf', while Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd may as well be playing Harold and Kumar given Merry and Pippin's glut of pipe weed gags. It's a testament to all their exemplary work that their characters still integrate loveably rather than feeling gratuitous. Similarly, the fight scenes are as exhilarating as can be, with the warg fight and Ents releasing the river each invoking cathartic roars of joy, while the rain-drenched battle of Helm's Deep is a classic setpiece of vintage war tension (the opening Gandalf/Balrog plummeting fight is also fun, but a weirdly video- game-y note to open with).<br/><br/>Jackson, now faced with cross-cutting between parallel story lines, masterfully keeps track of his overwhelming deluge of story while keeping the pace ticking. While the dour whininess of the Frodo/Sam segments do grate over time (perhaps the resonant work by Elijah Wood and Sean Astin conveys suffering too well), the addition of Gollum and, later, Faramir (the subtly magnetic David Wenham) keep the dynamic interesting. The new cast all shine in their respective moments, including Miranda Otto's feisty, lovestruck Eowyn, and Karl Urban's bold Eomer, while Ian McKellen finds interesting notes of metaphysical remove to play as the resurrected Gandalf, and Viggo Mortensen makes every beat of his hero's journey achingly, inspiringly empathetic. All the while, Middle Earth is as sumptuously gorgeous as ever (a panoramic shot of Rohan framed by the mountains with Howard Shore's soulful single violin theme in the background is arguably one of the most beautiful in the trilogy), while the CGI remains seamlessly magnificent (Treebeard in particular is a gloriously detailed creation, each notch of bark and creak of movement stunningly realized, while the Ringwraith's 'winged beasts' are also fearfully entertaining creatures). <br/><br/>Then comes the final payoff: a montage of triumphant victory between Helm's Deep and the conscientiously objecting Ents turned Isengard-flooding activists, coupled with a show-stopping, tearjerking speech about ""stories that really matter"" speech by Sean Astin. It's a long time coming, and the film's middle lags in anticipation of it, but dear god is it worth the wait - an inspiring triple-whammy that brings the house down more than almost any other moment in the trilogy. All of the immaculate, dazzlingly intricate visuals, blood-pumping combat and moving characters aside, it's these moments that really sell the soaring, larger-than-life, transcendent emotionality of the franchise. And this is why, black sheep or not, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers remains classic movie magic, and one of the most essential, incompatible films of all time. <br/><br/>-10/10"

","Somehow the two towers, despite featuring some of the greatest battles in the LOTR trilogy, is the movie I like the least out of the three. <br/><br/>In the extended edition it's just really, really long. I can handle Tarkovskijs, so usually I don't have problem with long films. There's a flashback that allows us to see Boromir at Gondor before going to the council of Elrond, which might have been unnecessary, as we learn about his and his brother's singular relationship with their father in the next chapter, that eats up a lot of the extended edition. <br/><br/>While I understand that this is a 2002 movie, and Gollum was well portrayed both by Andy Serkis and the CG department, I don't like some of the CGI in this film. Those oliphants in a scene just look fake. Personally, I believe that ILM did some better job on attack of the clones, despite even Episode II of the Star Wars prequel trilogy lacks of some realism.<br/><br/>The two towers was a movie I liked, just didn't like as much as the other films in the trilogy."

","{This review is for the 179-minute theatrical release.}<br/><br/>The quickest way to burn three hours from your life is to sit down and watch this crisply structured, breathlessly paced, yet thematically rich dose of cinematic CPR. You will come out feeling refreshed, revived, and wondering where the time went.<br/><br/>It's a bleak time for the denizens of Middle Earth, the evil powers of Sauron and Saruman forming a union against the beleaguered forces of good. While a small army of men from Rohan make a forlorn stand in a mountainside redoubt, two hobbits, joined by a nasty critter who answers to the name of Gollum (Andy Serkis), make a lonely, harrowing trek into the heart of enemy territory, on a mission that seems unlikely to end in anything less than their doom.<br/><br/>""Do not trust to hope,"" is a characteristic piece of advice offered to another party of good adventurers. ""It has forsaken these lands.""<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson reshapes the problematically structured middle novel in J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy into a stirring centerpiece for his own epic cinematic adaption. Each shot has almost a painterly quality, a classical shape and texture that informs every frame.<br/><br/>While Tolkien's source novel is the weakest of the saga, Jackson's film is the best of his own trilogy. Instead of long narratives, Jackson and his editors, Michael Horton and Jabez Olssen, present a triple-track approach where something is always happening, often very fast. <br/><br/>At the same time, the script by Jackson and his writing team plumbs story elements for drama and tension that Tolkien at times barely limned. Gollum's story is the film's emotional arc, as we see in him a tortured soul not quite beyond the reach of redemption, however dangerous. His mad lust for the Ring of Power is not only dramatic in itself, but ominous for the lead character, Frodo (Elijah Wood) who now carries the Ring and sees in Gollum the potential for similar madness in himself.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" does an effective job reintroducing the characters, good and evil, we met in ""The Fellowship Of The Ring"" and investing all of them with qualities of deeper interest and humor to extend our investment in them. At the same time, ""The Two Towers"" broadens things with a slew of new characters, most especially Gollum (Serkis is never seen on screen, but he was both a voice-actor and a motion- capture artist on screen) and Faramir (David Wenham), brother of troubled Boromir seen in ""Fellowship."" Both Gollum and Faramir find themselves tested by the very same thing, and their different reactions help drive the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There are minor weaknesses in this film, most particularly a needless detour where the brave human leader Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) temporarily goes missing. Some lengthy exposition elements featuring my least favorite characters, the Elves, grate on my nerves. But the spectacle and storycraft overall are brilliant in the main, and even better, become more enjoyable when the film is watched again.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" is a one-of-a-kind thrill ride that keep you as mentally stimulated as it does visually ravished."

","Let's cut to the chase. The Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers is everything you've been told and so much more. <br/><br/>The second part of JRR Tolkein's Middle-earth trilogy is a cinematic rush of blood to the head that exhilarates, astounds and enchants, and leaves you hungry for more. <br/><br/>Following the death of Boromir and the apparent demise of Gandalf in the pit at Khazad-dumb, The Fellowship divides into three groups. Hobbit friends Frodo and Sam head for the Black Gates of Mordor. <br/><br/>En route, they befriend Gollum (voiced by Andy Serkis ), a mysterious creature deeply scarred by his previous encounter with The Ring. The path ahead is riddled with dangers, including Faramir, the brother of Boromir who hopes to use The Ring's powers to save his kingdom of Gondor. <br/><br/>Aragorn, elf archer Legolas and plucky dwarf Gimli make haste for the besieged Rohan kingdom, where they pledge their support to the beleaguered King Theoden and his beautiful niece Eowyn. <br/><br/>The advancing armies of evil wizard Saruman force the Rohan people to abandon their home and head for the sanctuary of Helm's Deep. However, the king's duplicitous adviser Wormtongue, a spy working for Saruman, anticipates Theoden's risky strategy. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, hobbits Merry and Pippin escape from their Uruk-Hai captors and head into the mysterious Fangorn Forest, where an age-old ally offers a glimmer of hope to tipping the balance back in favour of the forces of light. <br/><br/>The visual effects in The Fellowship Of The Ring were nothing short of staggering, bringing to life hordes of fantastical creatures including platoons of snarling Uruk-Hai and the monstrous Balrog. These achievements (which were rewarded with an Oscar and a BAFTA) pale into comparison next to the technical wizardry conjured up in The Two Towers. The digital artists have surpassed themselves, creating jaw-dropping action set-pieces such as the climactic battle at Helm's Deep, which features more than 10,000 warriors fighting to the bitter end in a vast mountainside fortress. The scope and richness of detail is breathtaking, and it's hard to believe that many of the landscapes in the film exist solely in the hard drives of the animators. They look so real. <br/><br/>Of course, luscious visuals would mean nothing without equally powerful performances, direction and scripting. Thankfully, The Two Towers delivers on every single level. The ensemble cast continues to excel, evoking a menagerie of wondrous beings caught in the midst of a titanic battle between good and evil. <br/><br/>Wood gradually reveals the desperation and rage bubbling within Frodo as The Ring begins to take hold of him, and Astin is intensely moving as the best friend who would sacrifice everything - including his own life - to ensure Frodo reaches Mount Doom and achieves his goal. The rapport between the two actors seems so easy and comfortable. <br/><br/>Once again, McKellen is majestic as the wizard guiding The Fellowship on its perilous path, and Mortensen accepts the hero's mantle with gusto, cutting a swathe through his enemies and facing death head on. The love triangle involving Aragorn, Eowyn and the elf princess Arwen simmers tantalising in the background, and will undoubtedly boil over in the final instalment of the trilogy, The Return Of The King. <br/><br/>The Two Towers continues Tolkein's trilogy in grandiose style, casting a spell that is impossible to resist. The only disappointment is how quickly the three hours fly by, and the agonising 12 month wait until Frodo's quest is finally resolved. And you get the feeling that will be something very special indeed."

","""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is the middle piece of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings""-trilogy. Awards-wise the least successful, I would also classify this film inferior to 1 and 3. It starts with the plot twist that Gandalf is actually alive and we see Gollum for the first time, the visual description of what the ring does to people. For the most part, we follow Sam and Frodo (group 1) and Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli (group 2) after Boromir's death. Sam's behavior towards Gollum stood a bit in contrast to his warmheartedness with Frodo, but apart from that I liked these two story lines and also the introduction of Gollum (possibly the most interesting character from the trilogy). I really was not impressed at all with the storyline of the king who obeys to his evil snake servant and the whole family business of the king. Aragorn looking at the traces and seeing that the two Hobbits must still be alive was complete nonsense. The tree creatures (on which the Hobbits spend pretty much the whole film) were quite nice though. However, there were some problems with these too. The tree promised Gandalf nothing would happen to the Hobbits. So how come these Hobbits climb right that tree who vowed to protect them? He sure did not follow them. He was even sleeping before they woke him up. And why does he think they are Orcs at first? And when did the other hobbit duo become brave enough to scream at the trees to get them to help? They were just fools before all that and I just cannot see them transforming into credible heroes. Nonsense, I say. Also they don't even ask if Gandalf is still alive.<br/><br/>Another thing I wondered was how Aragorn knew that Sam was with Frodo. But that's just a minor criticism. One hour into the movie, Frodo and Sam are at the gates of Mordor. So what would happen the next 2.5 hours. Well.. the kingdom story happened and it did nothing for me. You can say yes it was in the book, but still you can cut the uninteresting parts and maybe make this an hour shorter and avoid the dragging. And that guy's name was Wormtongue? Really? That sounds like it would be the villain from a children's film. Or Harry Potter maybe. Anyway, the character was played by Brad Dourif, roughly three decades after his most significant role in Cuckoo's Nest, an interesting snippet in my opinion. Also the farewell song for the King's son did not move me at all. The whole story of Miranda Otto's character and Aragorn I could have done without. It added nothing really.<br/><br/>Saruman stays the main villain here just like in the first film, so it is a bit surprising as everybody keeps talking only about Sauron when it comes to LotR-villains. The creatures in this movie were top-notch, just like in the first, especially the Wolves of Isengard. Gimli provided comic relief again and it helped a lot that he had Bud Spencer's dubbed voice. Great fan here of the spaghetti westerns. That scene in which he asks Aragorn to throw him and not tell ""the Elf"" was very funny. The main characters keep surviving under the most difficult circumstances that you sometimes wonder if they are actually immortal (Aragorn here in particular, and Gandalf early on as well). Liv Tyler looks pretty nice and so does Orlando Bloom, but the latter did not do really much for me. His character is so interesting, but acting-wise and story-wise it was all very underwhelming about Legolas. Back to Frodo and Sam, I liked the issue if Frodo's friendship with Sam could survive Frodo's ring connection with Gollum. Which of the two is stronger? You may need to wait for film 3 for a final decision. And please disregard Frodo's constant visions and deliria. These were not done convincingly at all.<br/><br/>The big problem this film has that despite its stunning visuals, it is fairly uninteresting from an emotional standpoint. Neither the kids having to go to war as soldiers nor all the groups of fighters spectacularly coming to help our heroes at Helm's Deep I found particularly captivating (except the trees maybe, that was slightly intimidating). The second half of the film was weaker than the first I felt, mostly thanks to Gollum's introduction and presence early on. At least Gollum gets the final scene, so we can look forward to him in the final film. Random note: Why is Smeagol not naked and why does he wear a slip if he cares about nothing but the ring. We will never know. After that scene, we hear the closing credits. And while I liked Enya's song from the Fellowship, this one is a disappointment. It sounds much more like a Bond song and brings none of the fantastic aspects of the film to the table. I recommend this film to fantasy lovers. If you somehow enjoy the very overrated ""Game of Thrones"" and still have not seen Jackson's LotR trilogy, it is high time. They will enjoy it, but I cannot call this film an epic, let alone the entire trilogy."
"Geeky Randy","7","0","2","1 December 2014"," Inferior, but still worth it
","The adventure continues with two separate stories (readers of the book will notice that the stories have been sandwiched together): one with Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Bloom) on the trail of orcs who have kidnapped hobbits Pippin (Boyd) and Merry (Monaghan); the other with Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) making their way to Mordor accompanied by troublesome guide Gollum (Serkis). No longer obscured by the shadows, Serkis almost steals the movie when brought to the foreground. While undeniably more action-packed than FELLOWSHIP (fans particularly love the intense Helm's Deep battle), this movie is really the start of the corny-lines and moments-of-boredom that plague the rest of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films. Hill and Otto are frustrating as the hope-driven king and princess of Rohan. Regardless of how disappointingly inferior it is compared to FELLOWSHIP, it makes for an excellent story-bridge between its predecessor and the following RETURN OF THE KING. TWO TOWERS is still a pleasure for Treebeard (also voiced by Rhys-Davies) and the ents.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

","Enough has been said about this now I think so I'll keep it short. Just watch the extended edition, it has better character development and just plain better story telling.

"tuhin94","9","0","1","30 May 2014"," Utter brilliance marred by not sticking to the formula of the first
","Everything aside from the plot was marvelous. The novel's split of the eastern and western events were skillfully interlaced with one another in the film to create scenes that progressed together chronologically. Many of the light moments in the novels were brought to full light and made quite funny in the film. Gimli got the majority of these entertaining lines. <br/><br/>The huge helpings of makeup and CGI were a monumental undertaking and they were executed so perfectly that they had me saying ""WOW!"" even 12 years after the original release in front of a TV. In this sector, the film's makers stepped up from the first. I cannot wait to see what is in store for the third. <br/><br/>It pains me to have to give this wonderful masterpiece a 9. Alas, it did not stick to the books as it should have. By this I do not mean every single detail; I mean that there were major story and geographical alterations that should not have happened. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there were scenes like the hobbits' adventures with Tom Bombadil that were completely omitted. This is understandable as it would not have contributed significantly to the story as a whole and, thus, would only be added weight in terms of runtime. Also, minor changes (eg., ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" and flashbacks) served to improve the quality of the movie. <br/><br/>However, in The Two Towers, things such as Aragorn being shown defeated and near death after the Warg fight (which was a semi-major battle that never occurred in the novel in the first place) are major changes to the plot and tend to harm the movie, especially with fans that love this fantasy series so much. It seemed like a clear attempt to milk the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen to its fullest, while this aspect of the film was not given too much attention in the novel. Additionally, Faramir was shown to be drawn in by the power of the Ring. This bothered me the most because Faramir was quite a good character and one to look up to in the novels. His respect was earned when he immediately showed he was unlike his brother and did not lust after the Ring. Changing Faramir to possess the same traits as Boromir is a bit of an insult. <br/><br/>But, like I said earlier, minor changes serve to ameliorate the movie or add as much of the story as possible given the budget and time constraints. Adding an army of elves at the battle of Helm's Deep made the already enthralling action even more so. Having Éowyn present at Helm's Deep as opposed to Dunharrow allowed the heat between her and Aragorn to grow more quickly. Frodo hiding Sam and himself with his cloak in front of the Black Gate added more suspense. <br/><br/>Lastly, it must be said that the music played throughout the movie was incredible. The film would not be nearly as impactful without its presence.<br/><br/>For the ""everything else"" portion, a solid 10. If only the plot had adhered to the novel.... Watched (Extended Edition) and written 05/30/2014."

","Rarely it is seen that sequels manage to keep up to the originals, generally heavily criticized by the fans of the original. But The Two Towers is a gem of a film and a jewel of a sequel. Nor does it go astray, neither it looses its pace. It is as beautiful as the The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring. Also as beautiful as the book itself.<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam continue with their quest and are finally united with Gollum, meanwhile Merry and Pippin finally get to play their part in the war. Aragorn and others fight to protect the Rohirrims from the armies of Sauruman's Uruk High.<br/><br/>Just like the fellowship of the ring this film excels in breathtaking Cinematography, sound, original score, make up, set designs and visual effects. Also the character design, creating a haunting and pitiful Gollum, straight out of the book, I wonder if Tolkien actually wanted Gollum to be like that? Also It's superbly digitally acted by Andy Serkis, who reaches new heights of digital acting.<br/><br/>The film also has some superior character development as it further sketches the characters of previously Un-scketched characters like Frodo, Aragorn and too some extent Legolas. Eoweyn brings in a good deal of famine element in the movie. According to the book, Ents are the most sluggish or boring creatures in the middle earth, and Jackson made sure to make their parts 'boring' (A little tongue in cheek).<br/><br/>Direction: Flawless as before.<br/><br/>Script/Screenplay: Strong and superb.<br/><br/>Acting: I feel sad the Andy wasn't nominated in any major award ceremony, he was superb. Elijah shines too. Others are convincing.<br/><br/>Music: Extremely good, though not as good as the Fellowship but still great and haunting.

"AsifZamir","10","0","1","28 November 2013"," They'll never make a better remake of this movie!
","This is my favourite of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. The movie The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is based on J.R.R. Tolkien's second novel in the Lord of the Rings series. The series is an extension of The Hobbit and carries on the story of The Hobbit Bilbo Baggin's nephew, Frodo. On Bilbo's original dragon slaying quest he comes across a ring, whose original bearer was Smeagal. Smeagal was originally a hobbit, but when fishing one day with a relative he came across the ring and killed his relative for it. The ring has show much power that Smeagal migrated to deep down in the mountains and became a shell of a man fading away but had his life prolonged by the ring and in the end becomes Gollum who has a split personality and talks to himself. Gollum becomes barely recognizable as a hobbit and Bilbo stumbled across the ring and Gollum deep in the mountains, ends up with the ring and carries this burden a while and then passed it on to Frodo. Now Frodo and his best friend Sam escape from their hometown and embark on an epic adventure filled with danger in order to have Frodo return the ring to where it was forged and destroy it. The ring was made by dark lord Sauron who is a wizard gone rogue and Sauron's life source is bound in the ring. When it was forged it was forged with this curse: One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is the middle part of this epic journey and simply sheer genius. The book is phenomenal and the movie a classic. They'll never be able to make a better remake of this movie. - Asif Zamir"

","It's a shame to see that the Two Towers did not receive quite as high of a rating as Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King. In my honest opinion, Two Towers is the best of three.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is a great follow-up to Fellowship. The great thing about Two Towers is that it is a bit more complicated than Fellowship, since in Two Towers the fellowship has broken up and the movie follows each of their own stories. I love the introductions of the new characters present in this movie.<br/><br/>The landscape scenes are even more breathtaking than in Fellowship.<br/><br/>My favorite parts of the movie are the battle sequences. They are intense, complete with Howard Shore's epic score, and feature realistic effects.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is practically perfection. Like with the other two, I have hardly anything negative to state about this movie. Peter Jackson absolutely nailed it in a way that I don't think any other director could have."

","The second opus of ""The lord of the Ring"" was one of my favorite of the Trilogy. This second opus shows the different path the main characters take and how they will deal with the different obstacles they must overcome.<br/><br/>The main stage of this opus is the Battle of the Hornburg and it's really epic. Showing the allegiance between humans and elves. It was for me one of the best scene of the trilogy, maybe because I'm such a huge fan of Legolas and his peers ;) , because this Battle of the Hornburg will decide the destiny of the human race and this scene was so so beautiful. You feel all the emotions in this particular scene : fear, rage, pain, sadness, hope, joy,  We have a mix up of our feelings and you are really into this movie. <br/><br/>One of my favorite moment was when Gandalf shows up with the Theoden's army with the light of the sun behind his back. It was like a miracle. Because during all of this time during the crucial battle, the spectator has suffer of this whole mix of emotion that in the end you thing that Gandalf will never make it in time and it's over. You see a sea of blood with corpses everywhere and you feel desperate like ""They will be dead"" and ""Bam"" Gandalf is back as he promised and you regain hope as for the others characters.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was extremely wonderful and well done. They have insert some extract of the music from the first opus and remix it to give it a new color. It was a fantastic job to have incorporate some extract of the first opus."
"alexxchiodo","10","0","1","1 November 2013"," The Two Towers Transcends its Antecedent
","'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is everything I could have hoped for in the second movie in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. In this film the fellowship has broken and the film now follows three different adventures taking place - you have Aragon, Legolas and Gimli fighting to protect Rohan, Pippin and Merry occupied with the Ents, and of course, Frodo and Sam lead by Gollum to fulfill their quest to destroy the ring. I really liked how these concurrent endeavors were told without feeling, as the viewer, disengaged from the main idea of the story. For example, it didn't feel like there was intolerable jumping between different scenes to follow these different adventures, so I thought the movie proceeded at a good pace. <br/><br/>Hats must be taken off to a perfect embodiment of Gollum's character and it is probably one of the most memorable performances I have ever seen in a movie. This twisted, tortured and disturbed creature is the epitome of the consequences of holding the ring for prolonged periods (500 years in Gollum's case). The ring is so evil and corrupted that Gollum represents the end result of it's control, which should signal to Frodo to make haste of his quest or else he'll end up just like Gollum. <br/><br/>The amount of action and fighting in this movie has increased compared to 'The Fellowship of the Ring', and I loved it. It was so satisfying to watch Legolas and Gimli kill Orcs so proficiently to the point where they keep a running tally of how many they kill. This form of humor embedded in several fighting scenes was much accepted and it wasn't too excessive to the point where it felt like the humor was forced. <br/><br/>Just like the first movie there are some epic panning shots as Aragon, Legolas and Gimli cross some stunning terrain, and I feel that just the mere scale of this movie is so much bigger in magnitude to that in 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. In the previous film, there was a lot more dialog and felt like more of an introduction to the characters and the 'culture' of the 'Lord of the Rings' film, which isn't condemned, but 'The Two Towers' steps up the fighting scenes to another level without losing the dialog and character development. The sheer size of Saruman's army sent a shiver down mine when I first laid eyes on it. You think to yourself, ""hold on, how are 300 'good guys' supposed to defend themselves against 10,000 of these brutal and viscous Orcs?"" Thoughts like this that leave you wondering what's going to happen next or how are the 'good guys' going to deal with this crisis is one of many reasons that kept me engaged in the film from start to end. <br/><br/>Furthermore, I loved Gandalf's return as 'The White', and the scene at the beginning where he battles the Balrog was an epic way to begin the movie. In addition, when the Ents destroy Saruman's headquarters was just insane to watch. I loved that feeling of gratification, yet also some sorrow, when you see the Tree Beard begin to lose it after what Saruman has done and the Ents just unleash chaos on Saruman. It was satisfying to see the 'good guys' (I dislike referring to them as this) finally overpower Saruman as he has been the one with supreme power and authority throughout the film (excluding Sauron). You can't also help but feel when the Ents take revenge on Saruman for destroying their 'friends', that one day, in today's modern, developed society, nature will reclaim what is rightfully theirs one day. The idea of conveying the trees as having emotions and allowing them to feel anger and sorrow just like humans do, makes you condemn things like deforestation around the world and the negative impact human consumption is having on the earth. In essence, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen and cannot wait to watch the final film in the trilogy."

The gigantic story that was told in six books, in film it was told in one film. A film of more than 10 hours, it had to be divided into three parts forming the best trilogy already made.

I know that's kind of the point, and the Ents' behavior is even remarked upon, but it didn't make it drag on any less. Gollum was awesome. Andy Serkis really knocked it out of the park with this character, setting a whole new standard for performance-capture.

","Peter Jackson and friends apply their epic vision to LotR's second chapter, although this material doesn't sparkle in quite as many ways. While the sweeping vistas and jaw-dropping landscapes are again fantastic and memorable, a noticeably slowing plot means we're seeing more of them, for longer periods of time, than in the previous installment. Rather than the perfect balance of action, adventure and fantasy seen in Fellowship of the Ring, much more time is devoted to romance, pontification and elaboration in The Two Towers, with the wealth of talking heads lending the picture a very long-winded, literary feel. There's still room for a bit of warfare, of course, with the lengthy battle for Helm's Deep gobbling up nearly an hour by itself, but the road to get there often feels terribly long and dry. Perhaps that's just a case of too much material in the Extended Edition, though. Andy Serkis is a revelation as Gollum, while Elijah Wood's performance as Frodo is an improvement over his one-dimensional turn in the first film. It's also worth mentioning that the CGI creature effects, which looked so convincing on the screen back in '02, don't benefit from the crystal clarity of a Blu-Ray translation."
"dragokin","7","0","1","19 May 2013"," a prelude to a mediocre finale
","The Two Towers is where The Lord of the Rings trilogy reared its head. The excitement about the first movie wore off a bit due to a year's wait until the release of the second installment. It was still romantic and epic, as you would expect as a proper movie based on J.R.R. Tolkin's book.<br/><br/>However, there were elements of a regular Hollywood blockbuster which would eventually get hold of the third movie. The battles are becoming larger, the special effects grander, yet they were still well balances with superior plot in order to capture my attention. The merit for latter goes to Tolkin, though, not to writers who managed not to get carried away.<br/><br/>In The Two Towers we were still in a magical world with some dark changes. The characters are multi-layered and are developing as the dark menace of Mordor is slowly unraveled. There were some twists and surprises, but also we knew that there was one more movie to go until the ending."

","There is one word that can describe 'the lord of the rings: the two towers' : incredible. The best epic movie of all times. The stories blend in with each other, forming the scenery of Middle earth in war. The characters, tempted by the power of the ring, straggle between the good and the bad. The battle of Helm's deep is one of the highlights of the movie, as well as the transformation of the gollum, who is one of the most interesting characters. The scenery is wonderful, adding to the main epic atmosphere a realistic note. The soundtrack too helps to the magic of the movie that captures the audience from the beginning. Great performances, in addition, give the movie the excellence."

","I thought this movie was great. I loved the sense of tension, hopelessness, and buildup at the Helms Deep battle. It really made you feel like all was lost. And finally, at the end when backup arrives, you feel a sense of relief. The simultaneous occurrence of this and the trees helping at the other battle really gave a good climax.<br/><br/>Acting and scenery were great and the pacing of the movie was great. One issue, I had, though, was that the size and power of the help which finally arrived at Helms Deep didn't seem that grand. They should have better emphasized or shown greater numbers to show the overwhelming great win which occurred.<br/><br/>I liked this one way more than the first one and it was my favorite of the three.

","I give the extended version of Two Towers on DVD a 10 out of 10. But believe that the theatrical release is only a 9 out of 10. The theatrical release had some holes that were nicely filled in the extended DVD release. The theatrical release was a little confusing when it came to some of the scenes with the exiled Rohirrim. I truly enjoyed all 3 movies and recommend them. I do believe Two Towers was the most difficult of the books to translate to the big screen. I remember when reading the series that Two Towers always felt like work to get through, where the Fellowship of the RIng provides the joy of discovering Tolkien's fully realized world. The Return of the King gives us the climax of the entire venture. Given the extra time in the extended DVD version of Two Towers, Peter Jackson delivers a more compelling coherent story than the original book.<br/><br/>Michael"

"thewillt08","9","0","2","5 February 2013"," Simply a Masterpiece
","Now I'm aware the Lord of The Rings is three movies but in my eyes it is one giant movie and story. They next one also picks up right where the other left off. Here we go the review of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy, The Lord of The Rings. Lord of the Rings is a trilogy of books written a long time ago by J.R.R. Tolkien and it is the most cliché story of good vs. evil. The story is stereotypical, but it works. Tolkien created his own world of Middle-Earth and it is filled with different races and languages. In the beginning magic rings were made but there was one ring made of pure evil, ""one ring to rule them all."" The maker of this ring was named Sauron and long story short, he was defeated but survived through the ring. The ring passed from person to person and it ended up in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. He has been chosen to destroy the one ring before the armies of Sauron destroy Middle-Earth. The storyline is very cliché. It is a good vs. evil story of epic proportions. If you think you have seen this before, you have, but this is completely different. The little guy saves the day and nobody expected the hobbit with hairy feet to defeat the dark lord.<br/><br/>One of the major aspects of this movie is the relationships between characters. Gandalf's relationship with Frodo and the ring. Frodo's relationship with Sam, Gollum, and the Ring. Gollum's relationship with the ring. Merry's relationship with Pippin. All of these relationships drive this movie. Nothing is more powerful then the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Samwise Gamgee is more than Frodo's best friend, he is basically his protector. Sam acts as a barrier between the evil of the ring. Frodo could not have survived without Sam and the roots of this trilogy are the relationship between Frodo and Sam. Sauron has all the power of persuasion, power of armies, fear, and all the power in the world. The only thing more powerful is the love and friendship between two young hobbits who take on this evil power.<br/><br/>Coming in second with relationships is between Gollum and the Ring. Think about it, Gollum spent more time with the Ring than anybody else, excluding its master Sauron. Gollum lived with this ring for 500 years. It literally poisoned his mind and turned him into a gangly creature that you can't help but pity. He is easily my favorite character with his complexity and how it isn't his fault that he is the way he is. He is obsessed with the ring and calls it his precious. Any fan of these movies knows what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Over the span of three movies the audience gets their favorite characters and sees them develop. Gimli and Legolas didn't like each other at first because one was a dwarf and the other an elf. ""I never thought I'd die side by side with an elf,"" Gimli says in the final battle. ""How about side by side with a friend?"" Legolas answers. These two against all odds became friends and were inseparable. You also see Merry and Pippin evolve into something I know I did not expect. In the first movie they were silly and naïve but in the second movie Merry begins to understand the dangers of the world and that it needs saving. Pippin matures a bit late but nevertheless they are two of my favorite characters.<br/><br/>These three movies are filled with incredible action scenes and special effects. From Hobbiton to Rivendell to Helms Deep and all the way to the Crack of Doom, every place in Middle-Earth comes to life. The designers of these sets and CGI went into extreme detail and any fan of the movie should check out the six discs of special features. You learn how Hobbiton was actually dug out in a hill in the ground in New Zealand. My favorite battle has to be the battle of Helms Deep. It was 10,000 Uruk-hai vs. around 500 men and elves fighting at a castle that has defended the country of Rohan for centuries. Aragorn falls into his place as a leader and he develops into the man he needs to be in the third movie.<br/><br/>These movies are made with incredible detail with every movie being made at once. Peter Jackson and his cast and crew spent 15 months in New Zealand and filmed this masterpiece. Costumes were made and WETA Workshop made all of the sets they needed and used miniatures and made the world of Middle-Earth come alive. Actors took the books and looked for details fans would look for from the books. The only real problem with these movies is that if you don't know the story you cannot really enjoy the full experience. I saw the first movie when I was really young and I had no idea what it was about and I had to see the movies many, many times before I knew what was going on. As soon as I did, I was hooked and now I know almost everything there is to know about these movies.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lord of the Rings is possibly the best trilogy ever made. The way the filmmakers dove into the world of Middle-Earth with such detail is commendable. This movie won so many awards, made a bunch of money, and it deserves everything it got. These are movie that need to be seen by anybody who even remotely likes the books and even if you don't, go in, pay attention, and join the experience. Lord of The Rings is my favorite movie, next to Titanic, and gets the WillyT Seal of Approval."

He also has a dark side to him that scares me. the wolves of Asgard was epic too. The movies are long but you don't notice because of how good it is. I always thought that fellowship of the ring was the best but i was wrong. the two towers were the best. It Gullom talks to him self a lot witch is very funny. Peter Jackson's Idea for the talking and moving tree s were pretty cool. You have to watch this that is all i can say. This movie will not waste your time. IT SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE!"
"lagudafuad","8","0","1","6 January 2013"," an awesome follow up to the fellowship of the ring
","The captivating thing about Two Towers is the fight choreography and the battle at Helm's Deep (which was kind of the movie's climax), it is one that you will not forget that easily and the movie is just another powerful extension of what Peter Jackson could do, the movie is filled with a lot more CGI (from my view) than the first, and it may not be the best of the three, but Two Towers delivered some powerful performances, especially from Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys- Davies) and the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom).<br/><br/>After you have watched The Fellowship of the Rings, you are ever so eager to see what the Fellowship, (which is now broken into three groups Frodo with Sam, Pippin with Merry and Aragon with Legolas and Gimli) will be able to achieve on their own, as part of the master plan to destroy the ring at Mount Doom. The interesting thing about watching this flick is that some managed victory in their own areas, giving you the viewer a delightful hope, while Frodo (Elijah Woods) and Sam (Sean Astin) were moving closer to their target.<br/><br/>The movie's plot is focused mostly on the battle at Helm's Deep. The other fellowship members except Frodo and Sam and after the fall of Gandalf when he battled the Balrog, chased after the Uruk-hai who took Merry and Pippin so as to rescue them. While they chased Merry and Pippin found an adventure of their own in the forest. The rescuers Aragon, Gimli and Legolas found themselves in Rohan and had to save the king and defend the city from an attack from Saruman's forces, this defense and intense battle happened at Helm's Deep.<br/><br/>The three most notable changes in the movie compared to the book that I picked up instantly are (although many other differences can be found) 1. In the book Theoden is just depressed and deluded by Wormtongue but in the movie he is possessed by Saruman. The second is about Theeoden, who didn't just run to Helm's Deep as the movie made it see, he actually fought at first. The last was the exclusion of Shelob, who was later included in the final movie of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Not winning as much as the first, Two Towers won two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best sound Editing. It was a commercial success making close to 10 times its 94 million dollars production cost. Not as much of a powerful score like The Fellowship of the Ring the movie is a nice follow up to the first, and it served like a bridge from an excellent beginning in the trilogy (in the fellowship of the ring) to a magnificent ending (in the Return of the King). You can't watch the first only without seeing this also, so get the DVD box set and enjoy.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

Not a thing. The Bad: The Two Towers' theatrical cut runs the same 3 hour length as the first installment original cut. The extended edition runs at almost four hours. My Rare The Great: A rare sequel that is as good as or better than the first. The Two Towers was the best sequel since Toy Story 2 three years earlier.

"adoyle444","10","0","1","15 December 2012"," One of the few sequels that is considered better than the prequel...but they are both awesome.
","The lord of the rings: Two Towers(2002) continues the story epic story following three individual tales of the main characters. First is Frodo and Sam meet with Gollum to find a way into Mordor, Pippin and Merry who meet with Treebeard to destroy Saurman and finally Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf have to save Rohan from Isengard. What can I really say: it's awesome and better than its predecessor, but you really can't say either is better because the lotrs as a whole is what makes this film franchise popular and loved by millions. The difference between the first and second is that the second increases the scale of the film to a whole new level (by only increasing the budget to one million more?) this is the reason why Jackson is just a genius as a whole. Jackson knows the core material of the book and mixing his own ideas into this project gives it the extra touch of creativity thrown in along with cool visuals, good character development and touching emotional storyline. You do in fact notice major character development with this movie and it is what I think Jackson had in mind when creating the second. First for build up, second for character development and third for massive impact and climax. that's what I think but may not be true but its how I see these movies. The acting is great as usual with more characters included such as the vile grima wormtounge, faramir captain of gondor and the noble and strong eywon(maiden of rohan) plus they are allowed more action to enhance more physical and mental personality expressed which in turn shows that legolas is swift whilst Gandalf is defiant. The music by Howard shore is always the thing that lets you know you have entered into middle earth with its iconic, powerful and medieval themed that always makes you just want to stand up and say ""fuck yeah that's awesome"". One thing that was improved from the last movie was saruman's character who conjures up a massive army of ura Kai to destroy rohan as his voice echoes with defiance and power to emphasise his evil and dominance as the main antagonist of the second movie. The Two Towers is a great follow to the fellowship of the ring and is filled with so much a lord of the rings fan could want; massive battles, spectacular landscapes and cool characters to cheer and fear. 5/5"

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","1","26 November 2012"," The saga continues with even more richness and complexity
","""The Two Towers"" continues J.R.R. Tolkien's epic as interpreted by Peter Jackson, and though it lacks the same degree of suspense as ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" it delivers when it matters in the first culminating battle sequence of the series.<br/><br/>In ""The Two Towers,"" the Fellowship has been disbanded following the death of Boromir (Sean Bean). Having bent the great wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) toward his will, Sauron now has armies in both Mordor and at Isengard (the two towers). Saruman's army of Uruk Hai have turned their attention to the kingdom of Rohan, where Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) venture. Meanwhile, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) set out for Mordor on their own, though they quickly find themselves with another companion, the creature Gollum, who lusts after the Ring that once was his.<br/><br/>The script for this middle installment involves a lot of setup and building toward the climax: the Battle of Helm's Deep. Given the rich texture and detail of Jackson's Middle Earth, we are swept up and intrigued by the new characters and locations rather than bogged down by them. The subplot of the catatonic King Theoden of Rohan (Bernard Hill) and the treacherous Wormtongue (Brad Dourif) makes for great theater though it complicates matters, as does all the focus on Theoden's niece, Eowyn (Miranda Otto), who becomes quite fond of Aragorn despite knowing his heart belongs to another.<br/><br/>With the Fellowship divided, the narrative must bounce around and entire characters become left out for what seem like hours. The one weak limb of the story that we come back to time and time again that really sticks out in a negative way is the subplot with Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), who have been rescued from a band of Uruk Hai by the great Treebeard, leader of the Ents. The film cuts back numerous times to the two hobbits riding on Treebeard's back as he slowly delivers exposition and back story, and the scenes are few and far between, so they really make the length of the film stand out in a negative way.<br/><br/>All is cured, however, at Helm's Deep. This is the major action payoff we've been waiting for since the opening prologue in ""Fellowship,"" the first major arrival point in the series, one that the script foreshadows hours before the battle begins. The people of Rohan have retreated to their refuge hoping that the fortress's high walls will allow their few hundred to pull off a miracle against the thousands of Uruk Hai. It's a classic Greek mythology setup and the payoff makes Helm's Deep the most rewarding sequence in the series thus far.<br/><br/>But what makes ""Two Towers"" great is not just the spectacle in the end; we also get even deeper into our cast of characters. The film really explores the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen (Liv Tyler) and their likely ill-fated romance. Although they're mostly comic relief, we become closer with Gimli and Legolas through greater use of humorous dialogue.<br/><br/>The acting standouts of the film, however, are once again Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White, given a renewed life for the purpose of saving Middle Earth, and Andy Serkis as the motion-captured schizophrenic creature, Gollum/Smeagol. McKellen continues to draw so much attention to his character and the 100 percent pure gravitas he brings to the role cannot be over-appreciated. Adorned in white and given greater power this time around, he literally sparkles.<br/><br/>Gollum is a curious character who carves out a pivotal role in the series in just a few hours after hints at his relationship with the Ring. The character's voice and mannerisms could drive a viewer insane, but he's such a technological breakthrough and Serkis gives the pitiable and ugly thing legitimate complexity. Whether Frodo and Sam can trust him becomes a huge piece of this movie, and ultimately it becomes about whether or not we trust him. Frodo believes that Gollum is capable of doing the right thing and that he's their only chance to make it to Mordor, whereas Sam is ever the skeptic. This thread of doubt runs through the entire Frodo- Sam-Gollum subplot. <br/><br/>In the end, once again the script uses such moving dialogue delivered by actors so fiercely committed to their characters' emotions to really cap off ""The Two Towers"" in a way that will have you forgetting how long it took to get to this point and eagerly awaiting the final chapter. Sam's speech to Frodo in the end is nothing short of inspiring, capturing where the narrative is from an emotional and thematic standpoint. <br/><br/>All the characters by the end of ""Two Towers"" have passed the point of no return; they've stared down certain annihilation and come to the conclusion that they are too far committed to their responsibilities to not be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice. The notion that the ""storm is coming"" foreshadows the Battle of Helm's Deep, but it's really about what lies beyond. Hope is the unspoken theme in play — they all have to believe in it.<br/><br/>Bridging the first and last chapters makes ""Two Towers"" the weakest of the series, but it's also among the most memorable for its stirring conclusion and rousing segue into ""The Return of the King."" Having had first exposure to this incredible cinematic vision for Middle Earth, it can be easy to forget the incredible production value, but that has to be noted and assures this second ""Lord of the Rings"" film a certain baseline of absolute excellence.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","When I watched ""The Fellowship of The Ring"",the first entry in the LOTR trilogy,I thought it was a very good adventure movie,but there were two flaws that kept me from rating it 10/10-the characters didn't have the amount of development I expected(from a 3 hour movie) and some of the fight scenes seemed kind of over the top and abused slow motion way too much .Although these flaws weren't that major,they did kinda spoiled the experience for me.<br/><br/>""The Two Towers"" corrects these flaws and manages to create an almost perfect epic.The characters feel as if they got the development they needed.I especially liked the new character the movie introduced to us- Gollum. He was,in my opinion, a very complex and well thought out character and from now on-my favorite character in the franchise(before that it was Gimli).<br/><br/>The fight scenes are also done better,than in the previous film.Most of them are battles of epic proportions,rather then just the fellowship fighting a larger group as it was in the previous film.They still abuse slow motion a little too much,though,and they actually use the Wilhelm scream at one point.<br/><br/>Overall,""The Two Towers"" is a worthy sequel,that even manages to surpass it's precursor."
"illbebackreviews","10","0","1","15 November 2012"," Middle Earth is back and is as PERFECT as it has always been
","'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' marked the beginning of a new era of film making. The first film was made with such care and love for J.R.R Tolkien's work and many people were unsure if 'The Two Towers' would be as good. One word answers everyone's doubts: YES<br/><br/>This is still a legendary film, although I prefer the first and third a little more than 'The Two Towers' but by no means was this a bad film. The film may seem like it dragged on in certain situations but the film came off in style. <br/><br/>J.R.R Tolkien's two biggest strengths with the Vol 3 and 4 of his Lord of the Rings novel, or 'The Two Towers' novel were the way that Gollum was introduced and everything about Rohan. This film caps it off in amazing style. Gollum was brought to the big screen in the most amazing way possible. It was so well done. Edoras and everything about Rohan was superbly filmed and I loved the addition of Grima Wormtongue into this film. He, much like Saruman, is filled with pure hate for the good guys. <br/><br/>However, both the acting by EVERY single cast member was brilliant. Sir Ian McKellen was back, and he ABSOLUTELY NAILED the role of Gandalf the White. Legendary actor Sir Christopher Lee also nails the role of Saruman, whilst Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis and pretty much every actor puts out such a powerful performance. <br/><br/>The special effects and the cinematography was superb. The way they showed several places such as mountains and Mordor with descending or ascending shots was superb. The special effects are beyond amazing! The score for the film is untouched. Howard Shore ABSOLUTELY KICKS-ASS with his music. Many may say that John Williams or Hans Zimmer would've been better, but I disagree. Howard Shore was able to pull you right into Middle-Earth and the Elvish-type soundtracks were amazing. <br/><br/>The film did choose to go through different paths from the book but the film was purely amazing! One of the best scenes in this film were Gandalf releasing Theoden and the entire build up to the Battle of Helm's Deep. It was so intense and full of drama. <br/><br/>****FULL SPOILER DETAIL**** -The Battle for Helm's Deep- Every single thing about the Battle of Helm's Deep was awesome. I loved how they should some awesome moments for all three characters and the whole idea of 'seeing higher kill count' was awesome. The fact that the elves joined the battle and that they all die is extremely sad. Legolas' badass moments where he skateboards the shield and shoots down the ladder holder were awesome. I liked the entire Dwarf-tossing idea. The end of the battle where Gandalf and the Rohirrim arrive is done so well and seeing the Uruk-hai finally flee was brilliant<br/><br/>-Gollum- Gollum is one of the greatest motion picture history characters. From the very moment you see him in the films, Gollum casts such a strangely awesome feeling to you. Andy Serkis absolutely kills at being Gollum! The way it ended with Gollum finally betraying the Hobbits once more was brilliant<br/><br/>***end of spoilers***<br/><br/>Definitely a must see!"

","Peter Jackson and his team did not disappoint again, another epic film with tremendous scope. I also have to mention again the original music by Howard Shore; another great score with some really great themes. As far as performances go, well everybody did a great job but those that stood out (for me) were; Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, Sean Astin as Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn and Bernard Hill as Theodin (King of Rohan). Also worthy of note were; Billy Boyd as Pippin, Dominic Monaghan as Merry, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, John Rhys-Davies as Gimli/Voice of Treebeard, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, David Wenham as Faramir, Christopher Lee as Saruman, Karl Urban as Eomer and not forgetting Andy Serkis as Gollum/Smeagol.<br/><br/>Having recently read the book I did find that this departed from J.R.R.Tolkien's original to a much larger extent than the first instalment 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. Much more is put into establishing background and motive than in the text and, to a large extent, it works pretty well. It does, however, distract from the task at hand in places and I did find it a little heavy going here and there. I can't, on the other hand, fault the production; it is all brilliantly brought together and it looks fantastic! The battle scenes are immense and to be admired. It's certainly one, despite a couple of misgivings, I still rate very highly.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>My score: 9.1/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

Every single scene from this movie has an incredibly level of beauty without comparison, having all of them the perfect mood and atmosphere for each part of the history. All the scenes are wonderfully directed, showing a great love for the original story and the characters from it: The music, the performances, the visual effectsEvery single elements fits perfectly, creating in that way an outstanding cinematic experience that possess the timeless greatness and magnificence from the original books.<br/><br/>While ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" serves as an excellent introduction to this fantasy world and the main characters of this story, ""The Two Towers"" works incredibly well as an inner exploration of the personalities of the characters, as they struggle against their personal conflicts. Finally, ""The Return of the King"" closes the story in a more than satisfying way, with a moving resolution that is happy, sad and nostalgic at the same time.<br/><br/>Those three films will always have a very special meaning for me, being not only a great trilogy which is incredibly well done and its very entertaining to watch, but also, a unique cinematic experience that, at least in my opinion, couldn't be matched.<br/><br/>Personally, I consider this trilogy the ultimate example of the genre of fantasy in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>10/10 (I would rate the 3 films with eleven stars if I could.)"

","I was still in high-school and first LOTR:FOTR came out. I watched posters all over the place, on the bus stop, in subways and everywhere. I went to watch a movie and saw the trailer. it has very ancient type look and has no interesting feelings. The only part that looked very surprising was the end of the trailers with humongous army. Then, one day i was surfing the web and hit the download link on Kazza (if people may know what Kazza was at that time). AFter few hour the download was complete. So i sat on the chair in front of the 15 inch computer screen with video size of iphone screen (600*400). After more than three hours my mind was lost in that small screen. I could not believe what i saw. I was a spectacle of life. A sheer journey to the land of fantasy, warriors, and elves ( I kind of fell in love with Arwen at that time). Then i realized that some how the end was not complete. It stuck in my mind for few days, then started surfing the web again. Eventually, i found out that it was the first part of the trilogy. And after 10 years its is still the best movie ever made. The movie rewrote the scale ad scope of making movies. I hope The hobbit turns out to be of similar calibre."

","Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.<br/><br/>Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.<br/><br/>Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto.<br/><br/>The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.<br/><br/>The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's OK. Closure will come next year. I look forward to the Return of the King.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is now my favorite movie of all time."
"tyler-bruce23","9","0","1","31 January 2012"," Epic awesome film
","The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.<br/><br/>As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.<br/><br/>As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears."

","Breathtaking. Unique. Captivating. Enchanting.<br/><br/>Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen. And we had nearly three hours to go.<br/><br/>The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth. And believe me, it is BIG. Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.<br/><br/>But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters. Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time. The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades. I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.<br/><br/>Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so. The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.<br/><br/>The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft. We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.<br/><br/>Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year. George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.<br/><br/>For everyone else: don't you dare miss it."

","Rarely is a sequel better than the original. But for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, that is definitely the case. It surpasses the Fellowship of the Ring in every way. More elaborate battle sequences, and more mythic monsters. But I am not in any way saying The Fellowship of the Ring was not a fun movie, because it is, I just think The Two Towers is a little better. It is more action packed and some characters that are seen briefly in the first movie now have a bigger role in this one. The character of gollum was an amazing addition to the series. And the actor who played him really was just outstanding. He gives the character a very good sense of realness and believability. The best movie of 2002. This movie is also not one to be missed."

","After doing a successful job in bringing the details and imagination of J.R.R Tolkien to life in The Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson fails to disappoint us in bringing the second installment to life and it's a big hit it has the same emotional level/depth as The Fellowship of the Ring and even surpasses it.<br/><br/>The cast are as compelling as ever, but I think Andy Serkis steals the show for his terrific performance as the creepy and realistic Gollum, the creature who has been driven by the ring for a few years until Bilbo Baggins found it and is now following Sam and Frodo into Mordor to destroy the one ring. It's great to see that he won an award for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>Aside from the cast, the story from the second entry is faithful like the previous installment was with emotional moments including the scene where Elrond tells Arwem her future and the fate of Aragorn when she's married to him, astounding action sequences including Helm's Deep, beautiful visuals including Isengard, the same mountain that Gandalf battled the Balrog (It's great to see Gandalf surviving his fall and he explains how he killed the Balrog) along with the same detailed themes as TFOTR's, lovely CGI effects, the powerfully emotional music score from Howard Shore and a great ending where the battle of Helm's Deep ended along with the battle of Isengard.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is another entry that captures the same emotional depth and level of The Fellowship of the Ring, making it a huge hit back in 2002 and would always be recommended to not only to fans of JRR Tolkien, but to children and adults young and old.<br/><br/>10/10"

","The second film has its own set of problems. It includes some of the most worrisome changes to the original text... I don't get too defensive about Tolkien, but I do hate how Treebeard gets turned into a moron. Gimli's attempts at comedy are still terrible, and let's not forget about Surfin' Legolas and Indestructible Aragorn. However, this one endures better than the first. Switching between the multiple plot threads cuts down on the tedium, and excitement level is way up. You've got the introduction of Gollum as a real character, the development of the Frodo/Sam dynamic, and despite their dumbing down, the Ents are way friggin' cool. The most fun and probably the best-paced part of the trilogy."
"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","10","0","1","12 December 2011"," Epic movie that will leave you hungry for the third and final installment!!
","First of all, I would like to apologize. I know I was supposed to make this review a day after the first one's but I got caught up with other stuff (including finals, which I am unfortunately still enduring :/). So here it goes...<br/><br/>This film is nothing short of EPIC!!! ANY adjective used to describe this has to come from ''epic''. The fight scenes, the emotional ones, the beautiful landscapes, the timeless characters, the humor... EVERYTHING!!! <br/><br/>LOTR: The Two Towers is split into three parts- The adventures of the three groups of the now separated Fellowship (after Boromir's epic death in FOTR: Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli; Pippin and Merry; and Sam and Frodo. Aragorn and the other two are searching for Merry and Pippin who were taken away from them when they were captured by Orcs in the first film. Sam and Frodo, of course, are traveling towards Mordor to destroy the evil One Ring. And now they are accompanied by the creature Gollum, who has pledged to take them to the Black Gate of Mordor.<br/><br/>That's technically it for the premise. Telling you anymore would be spoiling the movie for you. And, believe me, there are some twists and turns in the movie's great plot.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are deeply developed. They have deep and rick personalities; some gentle, some fierce and some purely evil. Nonetheless, even the villains are likable do to the incredible amount of care given to the character's development.<br/><br/>The film stays true to the book while making some minor changes for the best, although the heart and soul of the book is left intact. The character's personality are also true to the book's intentions.<br/><br/>The special effects in Two Towers are AWESOMEEEE!!! The battle of Gandalf and the Balrog at the beginning as they are falling down the Bridge is greatly handled and has some impressive effects. The color palette is less varied as the environments are grimmer than the first film. The Battle of Helm's deep is awesome too in the film's finale. The epic scale given to it is great.<br/><br/>The acting in this one is top-notch, which special nods given to Sean Astin and Ian Mckellen. Miranda Otto also gives a stellar performance as the grief-ridden Eowyn, who falls in love with Aragorn.<br/><br/>The sound effects are cool. Orcs growl epically, swords clash which a ''clang!!'' and arrows speed across the landscapes to eventually land in another person's helmet which a metal clinking sound or flesh tearing when it hits bare flesh. You'll even laugh when Aragorn kicks the Orc helmet in the pyre at the beginning. The reason he screams so realistically is because he broke his toes on the helmet when he kicked it in real life. (LOL!!!). The soundtrack is moody and greatly integrated into the movie's scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, excellent movie. Epic fights, beautiful special effects, great soundtrack, top-notch acting and true attention to the book combine to make a great movie. You'll enjoy this one greatly if you love the books, or are simply looking for a great fantasy-action film."
"mstkls","10","0","1","29 November 2011"," LOTR as a genre film
","Despite the amazing feat that was The Fellowship and the fact that Return of the King has won the most awards in the trilogy, Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers still takes the cake was the best LOTR movie. Although the standards for the movie were already set by J. R. Tolkien, Jackson's direction fulfills (and even surpasses at some points) all expectations of the LOTR fantasy world through the settings, the cast, and special effects.<br/><br/>The fairytale-like settings Jackson achieved by shooting on location in New Zealand do total and complete justice to their counterparts in the books. Rivendell and Hobbiton were absolutely gorgeous as well as accurate, and both are entirely fantastical. Along with the scenery, the special effects were spectacular throughout the entire film. The actors had to be digitally enhanced so the hobbits and dwarfs looked the size they were described in the book. In some scenes were special effects or stunt doubles may have been used, Orlando Bloom's Legolas shines as a rugged elf prince when he performs his own stunts (most notable in the scene where he swings himself up into a horse's saddle during the Warg battle and the scene at the battle of Helm's Deep where he surfs down the stairs on his shield. Jackson went above and beyond fantasy genre standards in his creation of the Two towers. The film continues and even gives further insight into the myths and fairy tales of elves, spirits, dark forces, and the strength of man that is prevalent in every myth. It follows the traditional Hero's Journey arc, and follows it beautifully. It pioneered many filmic techniques on a massive scale was accurate in every detail. Overall, the film stands out on an epic masterpiece and a tribute to the fantasy genre as a whole."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","1","28 October 2011"," The war of the ring begins to heat up.
","It is not that Tolkien is original in his stories, he is not, but rather it is the way that he uses his knowledge of European literature to create such a colourful and engaging world. His characters are not shallow, nor is he strictly black and white in his characters either. Granted, there is absolutely nothing good about Sauron, but his better characters are not necessarily pure either. In this regard I think of Gandalf. He is the closest character to what one would consider a good guy in his story, but instead of calling him good, I would say that he is incredibly wise. However it is not that Gandalf is immune from corruption, it is just that he is wise enough to avoid it.<br/><br/>Now, Gandalf is what is called an Istari. He is one of an order of magicians who were sent by the Valar to Middle Earth to combat Sauron. The Valar chose not to physically come to Middle Earth for fear than any war against Sauron would leave the Middle Earth a desolate wasteland, so instead they sent agents in the form of the Istari. The two major ones are Gandalf and Saruman. Now, it appears at first that Saruman is a 'good guy' but it ends up becoming very clear that he has been corrupted by Sauron and has switched sides. In this part of the story Saruman is the main protagonist as he raises his army of orcs to destroy the land of Rohan. However it should be clear that if Saruman is not beyond corruption then neither is Gandalf.<br/><br/>When we are introduced to Theodren, King of Rohan, he is gripped with a madness and is the puppet being manipulated by Worntongue. Now, Wormtongue is dealt with quickly, but it is interesting how Tolkien's characters show mercy. While Wormtongue, a traitor allied with Saruman, deserves death, Gandalf causes them to hold back their wrath and let him flee. In that sense he is shown mercy, and this mercy is indicated because to act on instinct and give Wormtongue what he deserves is to sink down to his level.<br/><br/>The action in this book evolves around Frodo and Sam attempting to make their way to Morder, and the others defending themselves against Saruman. The idea is that Sauron's forces are to attack the lands of men (Gondor and Rohan) from the east while Saruman attacks from the west. Sauron's army is dealt with later and the main focus of this book is the battle against Saruman. However Saruman is not killed. While Pippin and Merry trick the Ents into going to war against Saruman, Saruman is not necessarily defeated (and we discover that at the end of the third book).<br/><br/>I want to finish this section off exploring another of the themes that runs through these books and that is of friendship. We see the theme of friendship most clearly with Frodo and Sam. While Frodo is innocent, Sam is loyal. He refuses, point blank, to let Frodo go off by himself. Now this friendship is stretched at times, but Sam never gives up. He is determined to stand by Frodo until the end, even if it means that both of them die.<br/><br/>Another element of mercy that is seen in these books is in relation to Gollum. I will say more on Gollum in the next section as he is a very important character in the story. However, he is also a very pathetic and pitiful character, and while he does things deserving of death, we are reminded that he is not killed because the character's pity him. It is in this that Frodo shows friendship to him, even though he is not deserving of friendship, and is also very traitorous, but more on that later."

","Honestly, I was scared that the movie will go down after Fellowship's great success. I felt the same before watching Aliens, Bourne 2, Pirates of the Caribbean 2, etc. But, they made it...<br/><br/>The first part only had a single story line. This time there are many things happening at once. In this part, the tension is raised. More characters are introduced who will play crucial roles in the next part. The feeling of hope, despair and absence of lost ones was captured very beautifully in this movie as though there is a continuous flow of energy. This movie enhances these feelings and we get attached to the characters. This movie is also rich in imagery. Each and every character is given equal importance, not just Frodo and Sam, as they too are a part of this war. <br/><br/>This movie is also well-known for Gollum: the double-minded creature who is stuck in a to-be-or-not-to-be state. He is the character who does poetic justice to the book and keeps the thrill never-ending.<br/><br/>But with Gollum, we have the prowess of Saruman and the evil gaze of Sauron. These two stand tall on their towers (Hence the title) creating a massive army which would result in explosive endings in the current and next installment. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, Two towers is better, bigger and more stronger. I promise, you will be left spellbound...<br/><br/>10/10"

","I said this before but I highly recommend anyone to watch the extended edition for this. It was a real treat seeing this in theater, but seeing the extended edition you can't help but appreciate this film even more. The first film in this trilogy was mesmerizing, and for the most part this movie is mesmerizing as well with it's amazing action set pieces and design but just not as much as the first film. And although it's engrossing I didn't feel the magical experience that I had with the first movie. But that still isn't to say this movie is any less, this film really leaves a mark in cinema and is a memorable movie that will stick with the audience for a long period of time. The first movie in this trilogy is inspirational in many ways but this film is inspirational as well with it's fantasy, magic and action. It will inspire countless movies and especially when it comes to video games. The story is superb although the whole movie leads up to a huge battle at Helm's Deep. The atmosphere is more dark and blue this time which adds a lot to the feel of this film. And I couldn't help myself but care about the cause for the big battle to come and the actual main party that is fighting against Sauron's army. Yes, there are some one liners in this but those one liners stands out in a good way and gets the emotions going and kept me pumped up for whats to come. The speech during battles was actually one of them and it works. The characters in this with the circumstances made honor and virtue really stand out while some characters must fight through temptations. To be honest I liked Tolkien's book this movie is adapted from but found it a bit dry so I didn't really see that big of a problem when Jackson decided to spice things up a bit while staying true to the main story at hand. Even if few great parts of the book is different in the movie, the movie makes up for it for the most part. Although a lot of Tolkien fans might disagree with this, but it's just my opinion. This movie wasn't as enthralling or magical as ""Fellowship"" but it holds it's rightful place in this trilogy and is a great film. Just wasn't enthralling as it's predecessor which was a masterpiece but this one comes pretty close. Some may say this movie isn't well edited but like I said before you have to watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this movie, it just has those key scenes including battle sequences that is missing from it theater release. Anyways this is a awesome second part of the trilogy that should not be missed although it's probably not good as ""Fellowship"".<br/><br/>8.8/10"

The story concluded from the previous part and it have more wars going on which is a treat with marvelous CG effects. This time the pace was faster than the Fellowship of The Ring. The same efforts from Peter Jackson are clearly visible. Again everyone has done a great job in their respective acts. I could easily watch the extended version without getting bored. The character of Gollum is quite interestingly made fit in the story. The battle of Isengard is what this one is wholly about. Its quite a lengthy war but its one of the jaw-dropper. Overall I think again every technical aspect touched almost perfection. Although I feel this one was better a little still I don't feel like giving it a perfect 10. Again a must watch."

"mcgarv03","10","0","1","2 May 2011"," Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers review
","The second movie in the trilogy, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, is a fantasy/action movie about one hobbit and the continuation of his quest to destroy the all-powerful ring to save mankind, hobbits, and other creatures alike. Saruman, played by Christopher Lee, is building his army of orcs to destroy mankind under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and anyone who fights with them. He has an eye that can see the ring that Frodo, played by Elijah Wood, carries around his neck. The ring is drawn to the eye, and the burden of carrying it gets harder and harder for Frodo, as he and Sam, another hobbit played by Sean Austin, make their way to Mordor. In the meantime, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, and his companions continue on to Rohan, to warn them of Saruman's army and intentions. The King Théoden, after being released from a spell, has his people flee to the walls of Helms Deep for safety from the orc army. As they prepare any man or child that can bear arms to fight, Saruman's army approaches Helms Deep. The massive army is too much for the untrained forces of Rohan, and the orc army blows a hole in the supposedly indestructible wall. The women and children flee into the caves, as the remaining forces try and fight off the orcs. When there is only a small group left to fight, Gandalf the White and his forces he recruited come over the hilltop at sunrise to take the orcs by surprise and end the battle.<br/><br/>This film is full of exciting battle scenes, and ones full of emotional turmoil as Frodo fights the urge to give up the burden of the ring, as the eye feels its presence. Another movie that resembles the Lord of the Rings is the Harry Potter series. In both story lines, it is basically good versus evil, with wizards and creatures in a fantasy world, but ultimately run by humans. Both Harry Potter and Frodo are relied upon to carry a burden, while having companions to help along the way. I think the director, Peter Jackson, did a great job using dark lighting in the nighttime battle scene, and just about any time an evil character was in shot. It brought a kind of eeriness to the scenes and brought the evil persona's to life. The angles were well used also, such as in the battle scenes which showcases each character in quick shots, one after another, so as to keep up with the fighting. All in all, the movie tells quite a bit of story with detail and awesome visuals, which keep up with each character's story on the ultimate quest to destroy the ring and defeat Sauron."

","OMG, this next part of the trilogy blown me away once again. Peter Jackson has created a film called Lord of the rings: the two towers and it is as good or even better than the first. If i compare these to the books so far, the first two has overdone it ten fold. There are absolutely great visuals, acting is still pretty good, and really entertained the crowd with a stunning cheer. There is a character you meet called gollum and he sets off with a lot of laughs and delight. The main hobbits were OK in my opinion. Sam was brilliant and I really felt for him, but Frodo was kinda a shame. He was fine in the first, but i found he was kinda idk, a wimp. be sure to ignore how he was kinda bad as the movie was great. This one kinda had an ending so it knocks that complaint out of the park. This film is magnificent, check it out!"

","This trilogy is the BEST ever. I love it ! Every time i watch those movies i realize that i'll never be bored to watch them again. Every thing is awesome from the story - till the screenplay,picture,makeup,fashion design and the EXCEPTIONAL actors that make those movies a cinematic MASTERPIECE! And now after 10 years remains just as good! From my point of view, i think Viggo Mortensen would have deserved an Oscar ( best actor ) for his role as Aragorn ( it fit's him like a glove ). Congratulations to Peter Jackson and his entire team, for his achievement and i look forward to see the movie "" The Hobitt """

","Someone said in another review: If you are not entertained by this movie then it is not possible for you to be entertained. A Vision appears in my mind of Russell Crowe shoving two huge swords into a guys gut and then lopping off his head while screaming ""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?"" As this film is the centerpiece of the most complex Trilogy ever made (even more so than ""Avatar"" Which Weta also did the majority of Computer Graphics for)... Then the problem lies with the viewer, not with the Filmmakers.<br/><br/>And for myself after watching this film a multitude of times in both Theatrical and Extended versions plus the hours of extra material, I feel that Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens, Fran Walsh, Barry Osbourne, Rick Porras, Howard Shore, Jamie Selkirk and all of the cast and crew of LOTR are all personal Friends of mine who have visited me in my living room whenever I've watched the extras. My favourite person is Gino Acevedo, the Prosthetic makeup artist who did Limbs and Gollum's digital ""makeup"" - And he was one of the ""Pirates"" in Return Of the King.. Don't know why, I like the way the guy describes his work, I can get along with someone like that. There was also a woman, she was only shown a few times but I was impressed, did all the motion capture for the digital hordes, Carrie Thiel: Also modeled all the moves for the Massive Agents, quite deft and professional, and she looked like she means business. Christian Rivers... The Miniatures Unit, they can come to a party at my house ANY day, I owe all of these people. Each person who worked on LOTR was a consummate Professional, chosen for specific jobs... Even Alan Lee, hired as conceptual artist along with John Howe stepped out of his slot to assist Dan Hennah with the set decoration, so these people did a lot of multi-departmental work. The atmosphere must have been something to see! Insane artists designing the Witch King's Spiky Helmet! These people made a permanent dent in me and I'll never forget them, I'll remember them forever.<br/><br/>The most amazing sight is our first view of Edoras as Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas ride up... Which was a real place that existed for just Six Months, the most convincing set ever built for a movie. ""You'd find more cheer in a graveyard"", Gimli grimly offers as they ride up... These films were made in the midst of a time of great upheaval and change, just as the characters face in the film: Pippin tells Meriadoc... ""Maybe we don't belong here, it's too big for us, besides, We still have the Shire"" - Whereas Meriadoc rebukes him, telling him, ""The fires of Isengard will spread, The woods of Tuckbourough and Buckland will burn, and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone... There won't BE a Shire"". Our choice is to make our world good or bad: So I challenge anyone watching this film to let this be a cautionary tale - How would you like your world? And Ironically, Weta Digital also worked on another film which makes the same statement... ""Avatar"". Do we want to live in a world with NO Brazilian Rain Forests or African Jungles or Polar Ice Caps? We cannot live without these things, they are necessary for our survival and also the survival of our precious animals, our most valuable resource. And so we stand at a crossroads and we must go up the Morgul Vale to the Dead City and up the secret stair through Shelob's Lair and right into Mordor. And we can't stop there, then we have to wade through troops of Orcs and then up a volcano that keeps threatening to erupt! And then it DOES erupt, so then we get to surf on huge Rocks and then if we are lucky we can catch a ride on the next Eagle that flies by... Perhaps Lord of the Rings is a Prophetic Story, Prophetic and representational of us today, although Tolkien never wanted it that way.<br/><br/>Considering this is a landmark film using brand new MoCap tech, the computer graphics meld into the practical and miniature sets perfectly. I KNOW there is no ""Warg Attack"" in the book, and in the book we do not get a troop of ELVES showing up just in time to help defend Helm's Deep and Legolas never takes a Skateboard Run down the outer steps of the deeping wall, but Jackson made the best Lord of the Rings he was able to make and thank The Lord Bob Shaye shelled out the money to make this, and in Three films... And the story is basically intact, so please no complaining about no Gandalf fighting the Balrog Under the Mountain! Peter Jackson interpreted Lord of the Rings for us, and handed it to us on a platter. But if all you have seen is the Theatrical version of all of these movies, then I can say with authority, you really have not SEEN Jackson's Lord of the Rings - So go out and rent you that Extended Cut- Soon to be released in Blu-Ray HD!"
"BA_Harrison","9","0","4","30 October 2010"," The middle film from Middle Earth.
","The Two Towers is my favourite film from the entire The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It starts with my favourite scene of the trilogy—Gandalf's breath-taking battle against the Balrog in the bowels of Middle Earth; ends with the best action scenes of the trilogy—the epic battles at Helm's Deep and Isengard; and features many of my most memorable moments from the trilogy, including Gollum's schizophrenic conversation with Smeagol, a hilarious discussion between orcs about whether they should eat Merry and Pippin, and Legolas shouting 'They've taken the hobbits to Isengard!' (check out the dance music remix of this on YouTube—it's hilarious!).<br/><br/>A few minor niggles prevent me from awarding The Two Towers top marks—the rather slow scenes with Treebeard in Fangorn, Legolas surfing down some steps on a shield (a portent of the excesses of The Return of the King), and the fact that it took me three viewings to completely understand all that happens—but on the whole this is an excellent film. Did I mention it was my favourite of the trilogy?"
"FilmFanatic03","10","0","2","17 October 2010"," Another epic masterpiece!
","Peter Jackson comes back with such a fantastic and epic masterpiece. The thing i love about the second instalment is that it has a slightly darker tone to it which is very captivating. We go from ""The fellowship of the ring"" where we see Frodo as an innocent hobbit and all is well with the world but now we progress into the tale we see the effect the ring has on everyone,things start to deteriorate such as Frodo and Sams relationship, especially with the involvement of the sneaky and deceptive Gollum (and of course because of the ring) which is interesting to observe. The narrative is more complex as the fellowship has split so we follow Frodo and Sam, Aragon and the gang and Merry and Pippin which is interesting as they all have a connection yet they are not together. You see as the film progress Yet again peter Jackson and the writing team make another success with this film and yet again there is nothing offensive with this film which is what most films could do with. Amazing acting from the whole cast. I love the ending as it is a chilling ending giving the audience a little something but giving us the rest in the third film. Another epic masterpiece form the amazing Peter Jackson."
"RyanCShowers","Null","0","1","5 September 2010"," Continues the trilogy with VERY long action scene...but with a BANG!
","It's not completely easy to sit through a 3 hour movie, with at least one-fourth being action scenes. But with Peter Jackson's signature touch it works magnetically. It's visually intoxicating, there are some moments where you're pushed back in your seat gawking at the screen trying to get the word ""How?"" between you lips. <br/><br/>It's the second chapter from the legendary trilogy novel, and it's a magically entry in the landmark series in film history. Though it's a filler between ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" and ""The Return of the King"", it stands by itself as a iconic film. <br/><br/>Like I've said before, you'll be wowed by what you see. Dazzling visuals here--especially Gollum. The sets are unbelievingly rich and detailed. The cinematography is so beautiful, the photography looks like it could be featured in an art museum. The costumes are wonderful, as they were in the first film. Special effects had never been put to better use anywhere else, than here. Oh my goodness are the only words you'll be thinking. It's incredible what happens here whether it's computer generated or not...it's believable. It's worth seeing for that reason alone. <br/><br/>Ian McKellen's well-known role of Gandalf is minimized from the Fellowship, but McKellen does what he can with what's given to him, as usual. Besides, it'd be hard to top his original portrayal. It's one of the best the cinema has ever had. Gandalf's fate from the mysterious and misleading disappearance from the first opens the film, and it's a great move to remind the audience what happened in the original. To catch up so that they can begin the next part of what seems like the never ending journey. He also his a great entrance to the film itself after his intro. <br/><br/>There's a great cast effort here. Andy Serkis, who maybe had 60 seconds of time in The Fellowship delivers a knockout performance here. Viggo Mortensen also shines here. The rest of the cast is also very good. You become emotionally attached to the great love story of Aragon and Arwen. There part of the film is one of the many highlights. <br/><br/>The Two Towers contains intense and exciting editing. It's masterful and would've been perfect if some of the final battle could've been cut. We didn't really need a half hour battle scene, in my opinion. The only flaw, I'd say, is that scene. It's way too long, which makes the already lengthly film longer. Only flaw in a near perfect sequel. <br/><br/>It ends on a fantastic and suspenseful note from first a monologue from Sam, then a shorter monologue from Gollum. Darker and scarier than the first, but all so visionary, it won't disappoint fans. Jackson's directing is continued with great class for the most part. Essentially, there are three story lines in this chapter because all the Fellowship has divided and split up, but the transitions are smooth and well-done, creating a marvelous adventure; 10"
"muppet134","9","0","2","3 August 2010"," Excellent!
","I have to say that I'm a LOTR fan, and this movie is my favorite film out of the three. Even though some Frodo-Sam-Gollum, Merry-Pippin scenes were a little bit boring, the final hour compensates it all. I think it's one of the greatest battle sequences we have seen in the last 10 years, it keeps you at the edge of the seat; the directing, the location, the acting, the music, even the rain, it all comes perfectly together to make us feel the chaos, the high, the rush that the characters experience. I've read the books (after watching the films), and I have to recognize that there are a lot of episodes missing, but it is for the best; Tolkien created a whole new world: culture, languages, thousands of years in history... it is impossible to put it all in a movie, but the very essence of the books can be seen on the big screen. So, kudos for the writers.<br/><br/>Going back to where I started, maybe the first two hours are a little slow, but those 60 minutes at the end make the ticket worth it, it is EPIC; and it is deep story too, because it's not all about whether they are gonna lose or win the war, it's about friendship, loyalty, inner strength, going against the odds, this is a good movie because the characters have a soul, they are not hollow (like Avatar).<br/><br/>Love this movie"

Many people consider this to be the weakest of the 3 films, but I think that this stands with the first in excellence. In this film we are introduced to Gollum. Gollum is the thing that most people remember about this film. His visuals are fantastic, and the character's split personality is commonly parodied.

","Gandalf is SUCH a badass! <br/><br/>Wizard against Balrog in a film opening so power-hammering it is astonishing that writer-director Peter Jackson didn't score a cross-promotion roller-coaster ride at Universal Studios called The Falling Balrog.<br/><br/>THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS opens at the middle of the last film, THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (2001), as our friends (hobbits, men, elf, dwarf and lots of poo) flee through subterranean caverns, pursued by a towering flaming demon that only Gandalf (Ian McKellen) has the 'nads to face down. When he thunders at the advancing Balrog, ""YOU - SHALL – NOT – PASS!"" and thwacks his staff upon the stone floor (in a sound which any comics fan should know is written as ""KRA-KHOOM!"") it is every superhero personified and every man-fantasy of impressing chicks combined.<br/><br/>Then they both fall.<br/><br/>There is that ""falling"" metaphor passim in Tolkien's writing. (Only to rise again - the Superman trope, which is Nietzsche's Ubermensch, formerly Christ's resurrection, which in turn was plagiarized from every life-death-rebirth deity that came before, from Asia to Akkadia.) Later, Aragorn is swept off a cliff by a wolf, and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) reports to Eowyn, in a poignant moment that is moving as much for Rhys-Davies's throat-catching performance as for his words, ""He fell."" <br/><br/>When Gandalf is resurrected as Gandalf The White and thwarts the surprise attack of Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (what a badass!), Aragorn, dismayed, says to him, ""But you fell..."" Even the ultimate fall of Gollum into the lava in THE RETURN OF THE KING, though it means the death of that poor conflicted special effect and the destruction of the One Ring, signifies a ""rebirth"" of Middle-earth.<br/><br/>TWO TOWERS is where ""that gangrel creature"" Gollum (motion-captured performance by Andy Serkis) comes into his own, in a mind-blowing, pioneering special effects coup for WETA Digital, Peter Jackson's efx company. Like an evil Gandhi on crack, Gollum allies with the two star hobbits, Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) on their quest to Mordor; they go to destroy The One Ring, Gollum goes for any opportunity to reclaim the Ring, his ""precious."" Thus opening a new era in effects creatures interacting with humans on screen. The sight lines between Gollum and the hobbits never falter, and when they engage in physical contact, their interaction is so ""real"" we never doubt it, watching the movie completely entranced by its story rather than marveling at Gollum's ""reality"" or how his scanty panty never falls off.<br/><br/>In THE TWO TOWERS, all our friends from the previous film wend their separate adventures in a dynamic, kinetic story full of middles. Being that TOWERS is - ahem - Middle-earth's middle film (the red-headed child of Peter Jackson's nonpareil RINGS trilogy), it very sensibly has a middle, more middle, lots of other middle, a legendary medieval battle that will stamp itself into filmic history, and more middle.<br/><br/>Frodo and Sam find Mordor with Gollum's help, decide to backtrack and find it again from the other side; the fruity B-hobbits, Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) stop being carried around by orcs and get carried around by a tree; the Nazgul have graduated to riding excellent bat-winged dragons with VOOMP-VOOMP! wing-beats; sexy Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), his blonde elfin babe, Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and their husky child Gimli, run around the countryside, presumably in search of a good hot shower; while the mighty Gandalf slays a Balrog, drives the spirit of Saruman (Christopher Lee as Edgar Winter) out of Theoden King, and leads a cavalry charge on the Uruk-hai at Helm's Deep - what a badass! <br/><br/>So many characters, so many strands of plot, yet Jackson holds it all together with an iron grip that never flags - from its broad battle strokes to its poignant personal relationships. <br/><br/>Jackson focuses maybe a little too much on Aragorn pining over his elf-boo Arwen (Liv Tyler, with pointy ears that just scream ""Do me Elf-Style!""); add Arwen pining over Aragorn in slomo and whole chariots of tiresome love butter clog this film's arteries. (And it's hard to sympathize with Aragorn missing his pointy-eared woman, when Eowyn (svelte Miranda Otto, a shield maiden of Rohan) is bursting all over him like a romantic raincloud.) <br/><br/>Left for dead, when Aragorn arrives solo at Helm's Deep, a grand, sweeping 360-degree pan frames him, in a scene befitting a resurrection, and necessitating the invention of big screen plasma TVs.<br/><br/>There is only one way to describe The Battle of Helm's Deep, which somehow does not lose us in its madness, conveying clearly the pitch and yaw of victories and defeats, focusing on every character involved yet encompassing the grand scope of the madding war tableau... actually, there is NO way to describe it. Just watch it. I don't know how he did it, but Jackson keeps us hanging in suspense and excitement during every minute of what most other filmmakers usually turn into generic rumbling. A truly incredible feat of direction, editing, choreography and creativity.<br/><br/>I wonder what a Tolkien scholar would think of THE LORD OF THE RINGS?<br/><br/>Jackson rewrites certain plot points for drama, but cannot escape broad strokes: so 10,000 orcs are sent to decimate 300 people? If Saruman just ignored this veritable ""village"" he could still rule Middle-earth pretty much without any resistance.<br/><br/>At the end, while a montage of battles cascades before our wondrous orbs, Samwise Gamgee gives one of those speeches that makes your flesh crawl, whereupon the hobbits share a moment so romantic we feel we shouldn't be watching them.<br/><br/>And just like the movie, I'm going to end in the middle--"

","I've always considered 'The Two Towers (2002)' to be the black-sheep of the ""Lord of the Rings"" family; still completely amazing, of course, but perhaps less so than the two instalments that bookend it. Whereas 'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' is an episodic introduction into the breathtaking world of Middle-Earth, and 'The Return of the King (2003)' is the climax to which the entire trilogy builds, 'The Two Towers' has neither a concrete beginning nor end. On initial viewings, the film seemed to centre on the Battle of Helms Deep, an epic conflict that pits a few hundred men and elves against Saruman's 10,000-strong Uruk-hai army.<br/><br/>If the theatrical cut of 'The Two Towers' lacked the narrative depth of its siblings, then the Extended Edition – which I watched this week for the first time – rectifies any such shortcomings, breathing new life into the lands of Rohan, Gondor, and their human inhabitants. Most significantly, Faramir (David Wenham) is given a back-story that makes clearer his motivations, via an extensive flashback featuring his father, Denethor (John Noble), and brother Boromir (Sean Bean). The newly-introduced characters are no less three-dimensional than their more familiar counterparts: Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, Saruman's grovelling, serpentine apprentice; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, a pro-feministic noblewoman lusting for glory; Bernard Hill as Theoden, the King of Rohan, and possessed by the treacherous hand of Isengard.<br/><br/>Unlike its predecessor, 'The Two Towers' is split into three parallel story lines, but once again balances the epic and intimate, abruptly (but never jarringly) cutting between the epic battles of Aragorn and Co., and the slow, tortured trampling of Frodo, Sam and their slippery little guide (played by Andy Serkis in a rotoscope suit). I recall that, when the 'The Two Towers' was first released back in 2002, Gollum was the main focus of reviewers' attention, and I was pleased to discover that the technology utilised in the CGI-character's creation remains completely authentic and convincing. Serkis, despite never actually appearing on screen, brings an astonishing depth to the character, highlighting Smeagol/Gollum's schizophrenia by subtly altering his voice, posture and mannerisms.<br/><br/>I'm about to take another trip down memory-lane, so bear with me again. When I first saw 'The Two Towers' at the cinemas – in the last week of 2002 – I remember telling a friend that I preferred the first instalment, because it was ""more about the ring."" While it's true that the second film somewhat relegates Frodo and Sam's struggles to the sidelines, one must consider the bigger picture. 'The Two Towers' takes Tolkien's Middle-Earth beyond the guise of a simple fantasy world, and, with its vast scope and attention-to-detail, almost convinces us of its historical authenticity. I still recall emerging from the blackened cinema satisfied with where the trilogy was heading, but horrified at the prospect of waiting an entire year for the story's conclusion. Well, I waited... but no longer than I had to. At least I'll only be waiting a week this time around."

","All the good things that The Fellowship of the Ring started, The Two Towers continues without a hitch. Sometimes the middle part of trilogies can be the weakest, but that's not the case here.<br/><br/>The viewer is introduced to more of the world beyond the Shire, including Rohan, Fangorn Forest, and Mordor. All these locations are crafted with as much care and skill as the Shire  and Rivendell.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are Gollum and the epic Battle of Helm's Deep. Gollum is still my favorite CG character in any live-action movie, even several years later. He feels just like a living, breathing character. And as for Helm's Deep, it's hands-down one of the most impressive battle sequences ever in a fantasy film.

"neil-476","9","0","3","28 April 2010"," Yes, but what about the start? And the end?
","The central part of Peter Jackson's 3 part adaptation of Lord of the Rings suffers, inevitably, from the fact that it doesn't have a proper beginning (unless you watch Fellowship of the Ring immediately beforehand) or end (unless you watch Return of the King immediately afterwards).<br/><br/>What it does have, however, is Gollum, an extraordinary creation to the joint credit of voice and movement artist Andy Serkis, dressed up on screen by the amazing work of Weta Digital, Jackson's in-house digital effects team. What results is what, at the time, was the most convincing wholly digital on-screen character yet seen. Even more extraordinary, the movie Gollum acquired an element of pathos which his creator seemed unable to give him on the page. Gollum's actions are driven by evil - Gollum himself is tragic: Tolkien said this, but I think he must have disliked Gollum, because I always felt that he was unable to translate the truth of this onto paper. Yet Jackson and his team manage to.<br/><br/>This film, ultimately, though, chronicles the trials and tribulations of the separate elements of the Fellowship as they move onwards, introducing the Riders of Rohan on the way, and culminating in the epic siege of Heml's Deep, something of a smokescreen to conceal Frodo, Sam and Gollum creeping quietly ever nearer to Mordor.<br/><br/>As with part 1, the casting, performances, pacing and look of the film are flawless."

","During the theatrical release I liked Two Towers but not as much as the other two. Only on watching all three again side-by-side did I truly appreciate what a great film Two Towers is - better late than never. It is tightly paced and probably has the best character development of all three. I did always think the changes that were made from the book were cinematically for the best as the book drags the most. While it is also the only extended edition I thought really added quite a lot to the story (although there are some great moments in the other extended editions), the theatrical version is still an exemplary piece of film-making. I urge all those who dismiss Two Towers as 'the black sheep' of 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, to give it another go in context of the trilogy."
"rooee","8","0","2","12 April 2010"," The centre of Middle Earth
","Chris Cooper's performance in 2002's Adaptation was skillful and memorable, but the Academy Award for Actor In A Supporting Role should surely have gone to Andy Serkis for his performance as Gollum in the second part of Peter Jackson's seminal movie trilogy. The Two Towers (correctly) received the Visual Effects gong, but the Academy may have missed a trick - we couldn't have felt pity for poor Smeagol without the Englishman's dazzling talent.<br/><br/>The Two Towers is the heart of the story in Jackson's (and Fran Walsh's, Philippa Boyens', and Steven Sinclair's) take on the tale. The book has been seriously and necessarily rejigged to suit the demands of the classical narrative. The battle of Helm's Deep, for instance, has been promoted beyond what was essentially a precursor to the final battle to something more immense: a grand, emotionally-driven climactic battle which represents arguably the best single action encounter of the trilogy.<br/><br/>But this last stand would be nothing were it not for the quality of the drama that precedes it. The Fellowship of the Ring set the scene; The Return of the King tore the scene to shreds on an awe-inspiring scale. The Two Towers, meanwhile, sows the seeds that will bloom into the enthralling narrative conflicts concluded in its sequel, as well as containing numerous character arcs of its own. The reluctant feud begins between Boromir (Sean Bean) and Faramir (David Wenham) for the love of their father, Denethor (John Noble); the adversity between nature and industry, represented by the mighty Ents and the tyrant Saruman (Christopher Lee), comes full circle; Grima Wormtongue's (a particularly superb Brad Dourif) fleeting power over the troubled king Theoden (Bernard Hill) and his adopted son, Eomer (Karl Urban) is a wicked war waged by an opportunist weakling. And I haven't even mentioned the surviving members of the Fellowship...<br/><br/>Pleasingly, Jackson et al continue their exploration of Arwen (Liv Tyler), as well as introducing another prominent female character. Miranda Otto's Eowyn is spiky and obstinate, and yet hauntingly bereft; a pale ghost wandering the prison of her uncle (Theoden). She's the most interesting female character in the series by far, deservingly foregrounded for the latter two movies.<br/><br/>Epic, exciting, heartfelt, and frightening - this is a brilliant hub for the trilogy."

"mada1366","Null","0","1","4 March 2010"," What are some of the underlining things in the movie.
","The Opening scene opens up with mountains and a faint voice yelling, if you have watched the first movie you realize that the voice is Gandalf. Gandalf is fighting the balrog from Mordor. He saved the rest of the fellowship in the first movie, and we were all left hanging wondering what happened to Gandalf? Not until later on in the movie do you realize what exactly becomes of Gandalf. Gandalf kills the balrog from Mordor, dies, and then comes back to life in white robes. He is now powerful enough to face Saruman and better help the fellowship.<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien wrote the Lord of the Ring series. Which then became the movie trilogy, but the movies did a very good job of portraying the books. Tolkien wrote the books with a lot of hidden meaning, a lot of... Christian hidden meaning. Isn't it peculiar how Gandalf and Christ both did similar things? If you believe the stories of Christ, you will notice that Gandalf died saving the Fellowship and similarly Christ died to save mankind. Gandalf came back to life, he also came back white and more powerful. Christ, according to the Bible, died then came back to life. He came back pure and ready to visit God the Father in heaven. Both of them died to save the lives of those who they cared for.<br/><br/>I always find it interesting how movies and books can portray so much more than the story line itself. In the Lord of the Ring series there are many lessons to learn apart from just watching a great story. One of those lessons is the power of friendship. Gimli, and Legolas are races that hate each other because of their past, and their differences. While they are chasing the uruk-hai they run into some riders of Rohan. The riders surrounded the group, and the first thing out of Gimli's mouth was a rude gesture to the horse master Eomer. In return Eomer made fun of Gimli's height, and told him he would cut off his head. Legolas pulled out and arrow, strung it, and pointed it at the man's head. He told the man he would die ""before his stroke fell."" The world is full of different races and different cultures. I think that these two are a good example of how people can overcome their differences in order to get along with one another. In America I know that there is still a big problem with racism. People from different countries might annoy other people. Tourists can be annoying. If people would take the time to talk and get to know the people they have problems with, then maybe one will find out that they are not that bad.<br/><br/>At the Battle of Helm's Deep, Gimli told Legolas that he never thought he would die in the company of elves. Legolas responded, well how about beside a friend. In the book, after the battle the two of them explored the crystal caves that were at Helm's deep. They both decided to travel together back to visit the caves when the war was over. A friendship out of a war is a bond that is very hard to sever.<br/><br/>Eomer's story is one that we can look at for a good lesson on perseverance. He was banished from the kingdom by Grima Wormtongue, who was providing a way for Saruman to control the King. In spite of this he was determined to rid the King's land of the uruk-hai and orcs that came from Saruman.<br/><br/>At the end, when the king was back to his normal self, he needed help. The king desperately rode out on horses to try to buy the women and children time to escape in the caves. While in the middle of thousands of uruk-hai Eomer ran down the slope with hundreds of riders to save the king and win the battle. Eomer persevered to do what he knew was right. He didn't second guess his intuition that he needed to protect those who he loved.<br/><br/>There are many things we can learn from the LOTR trilogy. The theology and lessons we can bring to attention from the movies and books are numerous. I just hope this gave you a taste of some of the things you can pull from the videos."

","After the success of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring exceptions were sky-high. Peter Jackson undertook an epic production, shooting all three Lord of the Rings back-to-back and making the most epic trilogy ever. Here Jackson makes an ever more epic film, and make it even better then the first.<br/><br/>After the events of the first film, The Fellowship of the Rings has broken, Boromir (Sean Bean) has been killed by Orcs, Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) has been killed by a Balrog, Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have taken the Ring eastwards, Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) had been captured by Saruman's (Christopher Lee) Orcs, and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) are on the chase. Things look bad for the free people of Middle-Earth, Saruman and Sauron have formed a powerful alliance, and the King of Rohan, Theoden (Bernard Hill) has fallen under Saruman's spell. The three groups take their own paths in the quest. Frodo and Sam capture Gollum (Andy Serkis), the other creature who craves the ring. He is only creature that could lead Frodo into Mordor, but Sam has an obvious distrust for him. Merry and Pippen end up escaping from the Orcs and hide in the forest of Fangorn. They end up meeting Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davies), an Ent, a peaceful treelike creature. It is up to the hobbits to help inspire the powerful Ents into conflict against Saruman. Aragon and co. end up finding out that Gandalf has been resurrected as an even more powerful wizard. Gandalf leads this part of the Fellowship to save Theoden and to go to war with Saruman's forces.<br/><br/>The Lord of the Rings books are one of the best fantasy books around, with a complex story and a long history. It would have been difficult for another to convert them into films, and many people were attached, from the Beatles in the sixties, to even the great Stanley Kubrick. But Peter Jackson manages it by making 3 long epic films (even better with the extended cuts), with top of the range special effects. He ensures that the films is as loyal as possible, whilst ensure that a wider film audience would enjoy them. The Two Towers follows the premise of book, and there are only a few scenes that are changed. Jackson follows many of the key themes, like Treebeard's resistance to fight, with Treebeard represent nature against the tide of industrialisation of Saruman. They is also Gollum's longing for the ring and how it takes it's toll on Frodo. There is also Gollum's schizophrenia, a brilliant element in both the film and the book. Jackson's direction is excellent, creating a serious tone for the most part, about the darkness that the ring brings, the tough conditions of war and travelling a medieval style world, and the excitement and dangers of adventure. This is a world where people die, a dangerous, dirty world. But Jackson does know when to lighten the mood, with some moments of comment, mainly from Gimli, and have brilliant actions scenes. The Battle of Helms Deep is one of the best battles put to screen. Jackson shows he is one of the best director's around, mixing, action, drama, comedy, and excellent special effects. The costumes are brilliant, and the design of Gollum is fantastic. Despite all this, the film does deviate from the book unnecessarily, like an action sequence when the men of Rohan fight Wang (wolf) riding Orcs, and Aragon disappears because of it. But the main problem is with the characterisation of Faramir (David Wenham). In the book Faramir is depicted as a kind lord, a good leader and a fine warrior: he knows of the corrupting influence of the ring, so doesn't want to know anything about it. In the film he is depicted a much darker light, showing him to be a harsh person, willing to use brutal methods, and tries to claim the ring for himself. This was not needed, and the only real dark spot for the film.<br/><br/>The cast is terrific. Viggo Mortensen is of course a great actor, who plays Aragorn was brilliant, so was Andy Serkis as Gollum. There are obviously talented actors like Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan, Christopher Lee, Sir Ian McKellen, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler, who all do well in their roles. Sean Astin grows, turning Sam turns from a slightly stupid character to someone who becomes more worldly wise. The film also helped kicked-start the careers of Karl Urban and David Wenham.<br/><br/>A brilliant film, the extended cut is a must see."

","1st watched 11/22/2009 – 7 out of 10 (Dir-Peter Jackson): Well made 2nd edition in the Lord of the Rings trilogy is perfect in it's technical rendering of the middle Earth world. The characters also have plenty for the viewer to hold onto in this epic battle of good against evil. In this episode, Frodo and Sam are still seeking Moldor to destroy the ring and are following Gollum, played by Andy Serkis with some digital help. There are a couple of side stories as we follow a couple of Hobbits with their tree friends, a couple other members of the fellowship as they try to help Gondor fight off their enemies, and the rising of the wizard of Gondorf. All of the stories follow the same theme of good versus evil and they flow together well despite their complexity. Another amazing technical achievement by director Peter Jackson with an excellent story that doesn't fade throughout the movie. I'm looking forward to watching the final film and will probably weep when it's over because the characters stuck with me so much. This trilogy is up there with the Star Wars films in it's majesty and spectacle and possibly surpasses them."
"Blueghost","Null","0","3","27 November 2009"," My two bits.
","I think I pretty much said all the positives I had to say in my ROTK review. So now I'm going to vent my spleen.<br/><br/>I like the fantasy genre for what it is, but these days when I see the overblown and overwrought tweaks to what is supposed to be a mythological genre--I don't know--it just really boggles the mind as to how things could get so out of hand.<br/><br/>The fantasy genre is supposed to be taken from historical folklore of a thousand years past. But when one looks at the various iterations of ""elves"", ""paladins"", ""wizards"" and other personae that are said to populate these imaginary worlds, one wonders what went wrong. Final Fantasy has their short spikey-haired over-sized-sword dude, Warhammer has their ""Fae in Space"" thing going on, and, well, how does anyone buy into this crap in the first place?<br/><br/>So what does this have to do with Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series? Not much, other than the fact that Tolkien's work was built upon other works, and today's marketers have built upon Tolkien's work, and so forth, and so forth, and so forth. Until we now have huge swords, armor and weapons that could never be made, worn, and much less used. ""The Two Towers"" somewhat smacks of this, but much of that is Pete Jackson's artistic license.<br/><br/>And we need artistic license. It's what makes for good drama. But do trolls have to be twenty-five feet tall, AND wear armor? This film, like the previous film and the subsequent one, to me, suffer from a severe case of taking itself too seriously. Lots of slow motion shots, twirling camera stuff, and a sense of impending doom. Then again the Two Towers was meant to be the angst-ridden middle second act of the series.<br/><br/>Truth is I like this film for what it is. I don't have too many gripes with it. But I do take issue with Tolkien fans who really take these films as religious dogma of sorts. I've read pretty much all of Tolkien's works regarding Middle Earth, and his lesser known publications as well. They're entertaining, but I think one would be hard pressed to find any redemption in terms of spiritual enlightenment within the text of Tolkien's thoughts.<br/><br/>So, what are my real gripes? The whole current ""fantasy"" genre as a whole. Not just Pete Jackson's corner of it, but the whole ""chainsaw swords"" and magical powers with absolutely no basis in anything, deities that are physical manifestations and such... one wonders how anyone in their right mind could be a fan of this junk.<br/><br/>The Two Towers has the benefit of being A) popular, and B) well rendered by Pete Jackson's hand. Even so the film seems a bit heavy. Darkly lit, dark mood music with few light moments, impending thesping/circumstances. Do these ""folk"" (hobbits, elves, dwarfs, men, widgets, and whatever else) ever crack a smile or joke? We got a few moments of levity from the first film, but the second one, this film, seemed rather weighted with its own drama.<br/><br/>So what's the point of all this rambling? In the days when legends about elven folk and dwarfs were first conceived and told, they were considered real entities for parables of what and how to avoid the dangers of venturing off from the village by oneself. They were meant to explain away the unexplainable. Now they're a commercial product meant to be exploited by sociopathic marketers. The Two Towers teeter in that direction, but are saved by the creative teams vision for the films.<br/><br/>Even so, I think these films were made probably a few years before they should've been made, and I speak of none other than the CGI, which, to my eyes, looks like CGI.<br/><br/>So, in the final analysis, what do I have to say about Jackson's version of Tolkien's Two towers? Truth is I'm not too sure. It's an okay film. It entertains. And, really, what more can you ask for?"

","Set straight after the 'Fellowship', we witness the dark power of 'Sauron' begin to reach out from 'Mordor'. Merry and Pippin have been taken by the Uruk-Hai, while Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are hot on their trail. Frodo and Sam with the help of Golum continue their journey towards the volcano of Mordor. And an old friend returns.<br/><br/>More importantly, Sauron has waged war on the people of Rohan and now the fight begins at 'Helms deep'.<br/><br/>I personally think that this is the greatest of the trilogy, as we the audience now know each character and are thrown deep into the war for 'Middle-Earth'.<br/><br/>The actors all provide great performances, each captivates the audience and more importantly allows other new actors to take centre stage, Eowyn, Faramir.<br/><br/>But I strongly feel that it is the work of 'Peter Jackson' that prevails above all else, you see his love for the books as it explodes from the screen. The tension that slowly begins to build up as we hear of the impending doom that the Uruk-Hai bring with them from the main characters. <br/><br/>I felt that the battle at 'Helms-Deep' was executed magnificently, you felt each rain droplet, each roar, each swipe of a blade as it decapitated the monsters.Throughout the film there is also an amazing soundtrack that runs through it; giving the film a wonderful quality.<br/><br/>Truly magnificent."
"grenmonkey","7","0","1","23 August 2009"," Epic proportions
","(I watched the extended cut) The middle part of the Lord of the Rings -trilogy, The Two Towers (2002) managed to balance nicely between the intimate character driven moments of the first film and the massive (and long) battle sequences and ""epic"" atmosphere of the third film. The film also added a well crafted CGI-character to that mix, along with a wonderfully bleak story and a great soundtrack. The result was that Two Towers is somewhat the highlight of the trilogy; not bouncing so much around from scene to scene as the first or the third film and rid of the boring story moments of the The Return of the King (2003).<br/><br/>The fellowship has broken and the film follows the three somewhat separate story lines of the remaining characters of the Fellowship of the Ring (2001), while adding new ones from left and right. Elijah Wood (Frodo) and Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) are again the strong points of the cast, Bernard Hill (Theoden) also a positive surprise. Andy Serkis does great work along with the effects team at bringing ""real"" life and emotion to the CGI -character of Gollum.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fun to sit through, the drama keeps you interested and the definite battle scene is well build-up from the first words of warning to the last swings of swords and whatnots – the film's good fantasy entertainment. Like the other films of the trilogy, it lacks the deeper and more""humane"" approach of the books the films are based on, concentrating more on the ""heavy on drama and action"" -scenes but I understand the thought process behind that decision. I'm not so much of a fan of the books, myself so that's not a ""big question"" for me.<br/><br/>Peter Jackson (the director) managed to keep the multiple and branching story lines well in place, the film also looks great and contains a great otherworldly atmosphere throughout. It has some issues (I didn't find all the story lines interesting enough, the CGI in places is pretty awful in comparison to the best the film can offer, runs for a tad too long) but is a great movie experience to sit through. 3/4"

","Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) continue their quest for Mordor with the creature Gollum (Serkis) for company whilst the rest of the Fellowship fight Sauron's army.<br/><br/>The sequel to the worldwide phenomenon The Fellowship of the Ring brought a record topping audience into theatres to see the continuation of J.R.R Tolkien's trilogy, and this second instalment is equally terrific as its predecessor with Peter Jackson maintaining a sweeping styled directional approach and a stunning conceptual plot.<br/><br/>Jackson astounded many with his first release, being appreciative of the story whilst containing some of the fiercest fantasy sequences to grace our screens since George Lucas' Star Wars, and here he arguably beats his previous release.<br/><br/>The Two Towers brings out the first major battle of the series with the Battle of Helm's Deep that reinvents the concept of war and the power the New Zealander has. Zack Snyder's strongly choreographed battle sequences in 300 brought an altogether new concept to CGI battle sequences which, brilliant as they were, didn't have that vigour of Jackson's conceptual approach. For example, these battles encoded are strongly realistic, for seeing everything as it should be. Though there is heavy amount of computer input, there are by far greater approaches and efforts to make this appear as if we are right there in battle.<br/><br/>There is so much happening from heavy marching and formations to strong battering boulders, entwined with heavy character drama and political concepts that balance this 2002 smash into consistent realism.<br/><br/>The beginning is wildly a strong part of Jackson's game. The Fellowship opened us up sweetly with explaining a sombre and mystical legend with the third film opening with Gollum's arrival. Here we have a stunning twist that reawakens the biggest dramatic event of its predecessor that instantly grabs our attention and puts us in high anticipation as familiar faces once more grace our screens.<br/><br/>We see Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Mordor and the initial interplay between the pair is repetitive conceptual dialogue from the previous release but once the pair admit to being stalked does the temperature change, and what a change.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis was knocked back for an Oscar nomination as his character Gollum is a CGI creation despite Serkis' heavy input but there is no denying the presence of the Englishman in this picture, winning fans with his two faced character ranking up the tension and interest. The manipulation and dark desire are beautifully intriguing.<br/><br/>The plot is consistent, if not quite as springy as the Fellowship. There is a heavy amount of politics encoded as we dive deeper into the story which gives great appreciation for the novels as Jackson once more proves he was the man for the job."

I recommend this to those who are fans of LOTR and I think it definitely shapes the gap between the start of Frodo's quest and the epic ending of the third movie. This is a story with emotion, action and adventure, one that grips the viewer in the world of JRR Tolkien and engages them in the story. I was blown away, and I think many others will too. It's kind of like the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy in a way. In Star Wars: Episode 2, the finale was the Battle of Geonosis and that started the clone wars.

Viggo Mortenson gets a larger share of the action this time as the heroic Aragorn.

","""The Two Towers"", the second film in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, picks up with Frodo & Sam trekking towards Mordor while Aragorn, Gimli & Legolas set off to rescue Merry & Pippin. It is in this film that we meet Gollum and Treebeard, among other characters.<br/><br/>As in the case of the first film, the acting here is pretty solid but not really worth remarking upon. Almost everyone from the first film is back, along with a few new faces like Brad Dourif & Miranda Otto.<br/><br/>Director Peter Jackson is still at the helm, though he didn't manage to nab a Best Director Oscar nomination as he did for the other two films. However, the film did win for Visual Effects once again, no doubt on the strength of the climactic confrontation at Helm's Deep. Overall, I thought that the film was well put together though not quite up to the level of the previous film.<br/><br/>To me, the film's major drawback is in the changes to the source material. When I recently re-watched the film my memory was a little fuzzy regarding the events of the book. I didn't see any blatant problems with the film's story but, later, when reviewing the screenwriters' 'improvements' to Tolkien's novel, I recalled why I initially had reservations. I felt that the character changes made to accentuate the ring's power made the characters affected less interesting while the couple of situations added to create tension were unimaginative and, in one case, nonsensical. Nevertheless, this kind of nitpicking will probably only be done by those who are familiar with the details of the novel.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Two Towers"" is a worthy follow-up to the ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". It's a bit of a step down in terms of quality but Peter Jackson still did a decent job of keeping the story interesting for three hours, especially considering the fact that most of the film is just a build-up to the climactic confrontation, not to mention the concluding film itself."

","I truly believe that 'the Lord of the Rings' is one of the greatest stories ever told. The tale of Frodo Baggins and the ring of power continues in the second part of the trilogy, where Frodo and Sam are continuing their relentless quest to Mordor to destroy the ring, only to be joined by the sinister yet pitiable creature known as Gollum. Meanwhile, Merry & Pip try their hardest to escape from the evil orcs who captured them at the end of 'The Fellowship of the Ring', whilst Gimley, Legolas and Aragorn meet a king and immediately sense something is not right. Old characters return and new ones are introduced as the tale of the Ring grows closer to it's end.<br/><br/>The extended edition is far superior to the original, though the amount of time it takes to watch borderlines on ridiculous. there are many (necessary) explanations and more focus on various story arcs. I was especially pleased at the extra focus on Arwen and Aragorn, one of the main stories to hold my interest.<br/><br/>As with the 1st of the films, each shot, every scene is spectacular to watch, and as the viewer you never question the integrity of this fantasy world - for a few hours you truly are transported into this world, the characters do exist, the elves, dwarfs, orcs, ents and hobbits are all real. The soundtrack is breathtaking and the acting is superb - the characters all look and sound the part and the script is infallible. I don't really have any complaints, except (as I mentioned earlier) for the length of the film, but as this is the extended edition, and that no matter how long this film is it never once feels boring, all is forgiven on my part and I sincerely look forward to watching 'the Two Towers' again. This is how film adaptations from books are meant to be done. Those responsible for the Harry Potter and Narnia films would do to take heed and learn from the master."

","This film starts at a running speed and never stops. From watching Gandalf battle the demonic balrog to the collapse of Isengarde and everything else in between, there is hardly room to catch your breath - and it is wonderful. Add to the surviving fellowship a new and wonderful group of people, the Riders of Rohan, who I have always been fond of - and of course the gnarly old Ents: tree people who are shepherds of the trees, keeping them in order, in their places in the forest. The climax of the film is the huge double battle of Helm's Deep and the battle of Isengarde. I have found it most interesting that in sopite of talk of wizards and Elves, Tolkien's world is not one of magic. Elves seem to possess great longevity, but also an advanced technology implied rather than discussed. And while there is a certain power among wizards, an example of Saurman's ""magic"" is no more mysterious than the ability to utilize gunpowder, no doubt high tech to Middle Earthers, and mysterious enough to seem magical. (In the books, the Elves explained to Sam that some of their skills could have been learned by even a humble hobbit had they the time to study them) For me, the battle of helm's Deep was always one of the slower moving parts oif the original books; but here, it is fast-moving and chock full of nail-biting action. As usual, certain compromises between text and film are made, and the one part that does not sit well with me is the character of Faramir. This was not the Faramir of Tolkien, and the character is never quite well realized. But also as usual, the settings are wonderfulthe acting superb, and the music breathtaking. The principle characters who are new, or may as well be new, include the sad princess Eowyn, her Uncle King Theoden, her brother Eomer, and the slithery traitor, ""Wormtongue"". And, of course, the ruined Hobbit known by all as ""Gollum"". Gollum threatens to steal the show, all the more so because he is a CGI character, brilliantly ""portrayed"" by Andy Serkis. Once you've watched the extended version, you will never watch the theatrical release again. This extended version is much more Tolkienseque, more complete, and more fun."

","Generally I'm not a fan of fantasy films, and while this series is an exception, I cannot understand why people love to sit down and watch all three of these films at once. I find each film in this series too long and drawn out. Despite that, however, all three of these films are superbly done, and ""The Two Towers"" proves to be the best ""Lord of the Rings"" film, in my opinion. From the opening scene, showing the details of Gandalf falling during the middle of the first film, this is a masterpiece. Everything else, from Gollum's ""My precious"" to the talking and walking trees in the forest is very entertaining. The epic battle scenes toward the end, though overly lengthy, are well done, with tons of little bits of excitement and humor. This movie is filled with great film-making and story-telling from beginning to end, and it also features bits of spiritual allegories, likely inserted into the writing by author J.R.R. Tolkein. A great film, however way too long, as all the films in this trilogy are. I simply can't watch this over and over as some people can without getting bored at many of the long parts.

","Well, another day, another part of the LotR saga.<br/><br/>Those who saw The Two Towers' trailer over and over again, as it was shown a million times everywhere, already learned that the Gollum creature, who appeared very briefly in ""Fellowship"", would be an important character in this next installment and also knew the big spoiler that Gandalf was returning from the dead. Thanks a lot, trailers, you ruined what would have been a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>So, now, the remnants of the Fellowship part ways, Frodo and Sam in their quest to Mordor and, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli on the search of the missing hobbits.<br/><br/>The emotional center of this story is no longer the ring or the Fellowship, but two different introductions. On one hand, Gollum, the first CGI character to have big psychological issues, marvelous portrayal by Andy Serkis, and also Rohan, the country that becomes the first victim of Saruman's improved Uruk-Hai and their invasion.<br/><br/>For the Rohan side, it's a beautiful portrayal of the vast land and it's inhabitants, mainly King Theoden, and his nephews, Eowyn and Eomer. With this setting, the story turns into more of a war epic than an adventure quest, like in the first movie. The big battle scene is longer than the one in the prologue and it's much more detailed. You get to see Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli in full action, even though this is technically not their battle.<br/><br/>However, even though Frodo's story is the most important one, with all the build up and excitement for the battle at Helm's Deep, whenever you see Frodo, Sam and Gollum on their journey, you want to see what happens on the other side, and you don't really care for them.<br/><br/>There's a scene in which Galadriel tells a summary of what has happened, and that makes it sort of an intermission, not only for the movie, but for the whole saga. It drags too, but it's good information for those who just walked in.<br/><br/>The scenes with Merry, Pippin and the Ents were also killing the thrill for the battle going on, but later on, you see them in full action.<br/><br/>The scenes with the Uruk-Hai in the forest at night had me cracking up. ""We ain't got nothing but maggoty for three stinking days!"".<br/><br/>Still, the sequence with the forbidden pool was my least favorite. It didn't say anything and slowed down the plot, at least to me. Not only that, it made the previous scene with Frodo confronting Gollum rather useless. Why show him remembering Smeagol if he eventually goes back to Gollum. Still, it add a little more in the tragedy concerning the once hobbit. In the end, you are left with a small cliffhanger, Gollum wishing to take the ring from Frodo after ""she"" kills them.<br/><br/>The score here presents themes for both narrative cores: Rohan, a beautiful Norse country melody, and Gollum, a sneaky theme for his plotting and a more gentle theme for his Smeagol persona, and also a Björk sounding song (performed by Emiliana Torrini) for the end credits, that inspires awe when you listen. Still, the famed ""Shire"" and ""Fellowship"" themes are back with different arrangements, making them always a good listen, and, one of my favorites, Sam's theme, comes back as a reprise in the CD. Also, you can hear the Uruk-Hai pounding theme (which I first mistook as the orc's theme) a little longer.<br/><br/>As for the cinematography, special effects, visual effects, set design and costumes, are all flawless. What else can I say? It's funny. When ""Towers"" ends, nothing left unresolved in ""Fellowship"" was resolved here. Again, the ring hasn't been destroyed and Merry and Pippin haven't met Aragorn and the rest (although they did meet Gandalf). But, the Rohan situation is resolved, and Saruman with his Uruk-Hai is defeated. Not only that, Gandalf returns and Rohan is saved. That's very relieving, and doesn't make you feel frustrated. That's why it's far more enjoyable from beginning to end. This is a noble successor to ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and my second favorite."

My advice 1st of all is to you see the extended versions, have some more and cool details that make the trilogy better :) The scenarios are amazing the mountains and all this, the backgrounds are amazing I think it was a great production :)<br/><br/>So my congratulations to the all people that act indirect or direct in the movie and all the fans of Tolkien that make possible all this huge success...<br/><br/>Now wait for the Hobbit :)<br/><br/>In short words:<br/><br/>LOTR -> Epic! :)<br/><br/>(Sy for my English, Portuguese here)<br/><br/>Regards<br/><br/>Rodolfo Fernandes Costa"

","Trilogies have one major flaw -- it's not so much a fault, just an inherent difficulty. In the case of the middle film of the original Star Wars trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back, it was overcome; here, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, it was not.<br/><br/>The flaw is the meandering middle, and the first hour of this otherwise fine movie suffers from it. The story begins where the first film ended, and we the audience now have three different paths to follow: Sam and Frodo; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli; and Merry and Pippin. The latter proves the most entertaining, and unfortunately the duo of Frodo and Sam -- and later the addition of Gollum -- is all but glossed over, given enough attention to inform but only as an end to set up Return of the King.<br/><br/>These are not necessarily complaints -- this is an epic, not a character tale, and in epics priority is given to battles and large set pieces. The Two Towers spares nothing in this regard, as the Battle for Helm's Deep is eloquently captured, a delight to watch.<br/><br/>Finally, though, in the last hour of the movie, we are given a break from the carnage and are offered a little reprieve with the addition of David Wenham as Faramir. He, as well as Elijah Wood, solidify this film as more than entertaining filler and deepen our understanding of the characters and their hardships.<br/><br/>Once again, the special effects are astoundingly good -- and, unlike in the first movie, here they don't draw too much attention to themselves. The set, wardrobe, and production designs serve to illustrate the cultures they represent, to add a history and sadness to the peoples they envelop, shelter, and clothe.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York was the best film of 2002, but right behind it was The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."

","The Two Towers is Peter Jackson's next Lord of The Rings movies to be released and it is a masterpiece. From start to finish you feel yourself immersed in an epic tale of friendship, evil, and hope. The Two Towers gives more time for characterization then the first did. We really get to know Pippin, Merry, Legolas, and Gimli better and more importantly we truly care about these characters. The acting is phenomenal and the special effects are gorgeous. The battle of Helm's deep is the best battle scene of all time. Andy Serkis is wonderful and disturbing as playing the tormented, unstable Gollum.

"dfle3","10","0","2","4 July 2008"," My pick as the superior episode of this trilogy
","Of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, adapted from the famous book(s) by J.R.R. Tolkien (which I haven't read), this second installment is my favourite. It should have been the one to sweep the Academy Awards, as the last chapter in the trilogy did. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I get the feeling that the Academy jumped on the juggernaut/band-wagon for the final episode.<br/><br/>The main reason I liked this movie so much was for the engrossing war scenes. It's one of the few films where there are countless thousands of soldiers fighting yet is nevertheless fascinating. Notable failures in this respect include one of the early Star Wars prequels (hey, apart from the third installment of that prequel trilogy, they're all pretty forgettable). In that movie, countless thousands of computer generated soldiers fighting each other was just mind-numbingly boring. As was the giant brawl between hundreds of apes in one of the sequels to the ""Planet of the Apes"" series.<br/><br/>In ""Two Towers"" you get one things those failures didn't have...military strategy. Tension is built up by seeing military tactics and equipment deployed. It's just not one humongous but mindless fight scene. The best example of that is when one of the castles is besieged and attacked.<br/><br/>In any case, this if a fine trilogy. Watch it from start to finish. It's just the second chapter that I'd give 5 stars too, though."

Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo, Ian McKellen as Gandalf, best casting choice ever, Viggo Mortensen, who would have though, everyone else is also great even Christopher Lee who I don't think has ever not played a villain but that is just because he is so good at it!

"vip_ebriega","10","0","2","26 May 2008"," A breathtaking 3-hour long climax of a terrific motion picture.
","My Take: Even better than the first. Bigger and definitely better. <br/><br/>No matter how excellent, breathtaking or expensive the original adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING was, it would seem like a dress rehearsal compared to its follow-up, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS. Recalling the second of the original STAR WARS trilogy THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, THE TWO TOWERS is but a bridge connecting the original to the finale of Tolkien's ""Rings"" trilogy, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING which was released the following year. Although not everything is concluded here in TWO TOWERS, it does have its beginning and end (and the flavorful inside at the middle). Think of it as one breathtaking climax of an entire movie, and have yourself a great time.<br/><br/>This follow-up continues, but not necessarily concludes, the events portrayed in the first film. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) continue their quest to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mordor, while two Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) find allies with the Ents (tree-like giants) in the dark forests. While looking for Merry and Pippin, much of the real story unfolds with Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) join forces with the Rohan people to fight against an out-numbering army created by the evil Saruman (Christopher Lee) bent to destroy Middle-Earth. The unforgettable battle climax (of a climax) is breathtakingly wonderful, made even more impressive by the fact that it's been made with combinations of miniatures, digital rendering, real people and other technology possibly available.<br/><br/>But like the first film, this isn't all just technical advancements and special effects. THE TWO TOWERS doesn't water down Tolkien's story into a big-budget blunder. The film also isn't just made for a limited audience. Whether you know what's what or not about Tolkien's trilogy, this movie will still be enjoyable and entertaining. Once again, director Peter Jackson has made a movie for the audiences, not simply for a limited audience. The big-budget shows throughout the film, but it also shows that it's a great film with its storyline, characters and screen-writing. Few of today's Hollywood minds usually forget it, but Jackson couldn't afford to commit those sidesteps.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","1","6 April 2008"," The film has its problems and its issues that need straightening out but when it's not trying to offend, it is definitely entertaining.
","I think the second Lord of the Rings film is more manipulating than it is entertaining or epic. It's true to say that I had only seen this for the first time very recently and did not have the previous viewing that I had going into the first Lord of the Rings film, (which I liked then and liked now) so to say I enjoyed this to a lesser extent may be down to those reasons; maybe it's a film that grows on you with repeated viewings.<br/><br/>But The Two Towers is a somewhat bloated and manipulating film that has its moments of greatness and sheer adventure packed in amongst some shocking issues of representation and general repetition, but the film is an all round success overall. Harking back to the Classical Hollywood days in which if someone was shot or killed, a sudden, stirring and jarring piece of music may start up to officially 'announce' the kill since you could not show the murder itself because of censorship. Here, the music is playing that sort of role again but it is to the opposite sort of effect; every long shot we cut to, every establishing shot of vast mountains and hills (some of which are in CGI format) we see are accompanied by over the top, melodramatic music that brings an odd smile to my face while watching. It's the sort of cue for all of us to hold our hands to our cheeks and gasp in amazement. The film tells us when to be scared, happy, wary, who to like and dislike and when to laugh; which is a shame.<br/><br/>Sticking with the melodramatic theme, some of the situations the characters find themselves in are made all the more so when they need not be. There are numerous insert shots and several lines of dialogue surrounding Aragorn (Mortensen) and another female whose name escapes me as they exchange glances and lines. ""I see you're good with the sword"" he says after she gives a little teaser as to her skills before the impending doom. Then there are the exchanged looks as he lies down, injured, much later on. But it is to no avail as Aragorn has an off-screen love, but don't worry; she pops up to remind us (and Elrond (Weaving)) of the situation. But the representation and underwhelming attention to detail are the two most frustrating things of this film. I do not know how faithful to Tolkien's book the film is, but from the film I can only gather that either Jackson or Tolkien had a massive problem with short, elderly men who have beards. I'm talking about the dwarfs here and how they are consistently the butt of every joke.<br/><br/>The peak of this embarrassing representation occurs during the castle siege scene. Rows of allies are on the upper levels, looking out at the enemy. Gimli (Rhys-Davies) cannot see but everyone else can. ""Would you like me to find you a tool?"" asks Legolas (Bloom). Gimli's height is mocked here but it goes deeper than that. All the humour in the film is directly a result of Gimli's antics, thus relegating him to the comic relief character. Aragorn and Legolas are in serious conversation with the king but as these two normal sized, athletic and handsome men talk; Gimli is sitting at a table tucking into a drumstick, alienated from the conversation with the camera cutting to him just once; so he can belch and maybe cue some laughs. After this belch, the camera cuts back to the conversation and everything continues after the 'funny' pitstop.<br/><br/>But it's not the weight, looks and height that is merely targeted; the pratfalls continue when Gimli embarrasses himself after not correctly fixing his armour  it slips off him and he is left to rue an awkward moment when Aragorn and Legolas stare and smirk below Gimli's waist. Furthermore, Gimli is describing what female dwarfs look like (which is a lot like male ones) before his horse bucks and charges off; Gimli is inferior enough not to be able to control the horse and he falls, while everyone laughs at him. Half way through the film, there is a fight on a plain in which Legolas kills many enemies and Aragorn actually comes close to death to defeat the odds but Gimli is relegated, once again, to the butt of the jokes. He has numerous enemies fall on top of him, rendering him incapacitated as he groans and hopes the others do the work for him.<br/><br/>Of course the film is not one long exposure; but an interesting and well un-folded tail about the tiniest of things that can do the largest of damage. The manipulation of time early on is impressive as we discover what happens after other timelines catch up and leave off. Whereas I noted a whole load of bad things about the film, that does not mean I didn't like it. Legolas and Gimli's colloquial approach to the final siege as chaos and murder occurs around them to those of an inferior skill is in bad taste, as is making the enemy men whom ride large elephant creatures look like Arabs; with their clothing and veils. Gollum's schizophrenia and delusion seems a little unnecessary and do drag on but they will suffice, that is all. I do not buy into the mountains of praise the film gets; pretty to look at and reasonably fun to watch, yes, but will it hold up over time? Probably not."
"ja_kitty_71","10","0","2","5 April 2008"," The Quest Continues
","Tolkien's works were adapted into TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi had animated the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level in a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart,a bit of humour, heart-thumpin' action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you, that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars - Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler.<br/><br/>In ""The Two Towers"" (where we left off), The Fellowship is broken. But the quest to destroy the One Ring continues as Frodo & Sam make their way to Mordor. But the creature Gollum had followed them. The two hobbits captured him, but the pitiful creature peals, and in return he will show the way through Mordor. Now Frodo & Sam must entrust their lives to him. As Sauron's (and his puppet-slave Saruman's) army approaches, the surviving members of The Fellowship, along with people (and creatures) from Middle Earth, prepares for battle. For the War of the Ring has begun. I kind of like how the Princess Eowyn develops a crush for Aragorn. I know she's a princess and her brother Eomer is a prince because the king of Rohan is their uncle. But he has someone else - Arwen, and during the scene when they're heading for Helm's Deep, it kind of shows Aragorn's feelings or Arwen between a dream and a flashback. And you know, I never like Wormtongue anyhow,and how he gawks at our Princess Eowyn...Ewww! he ""likes"" likes her.<br/><br/>I have a few favorite scenes: like when Gandalf returns as ""Gandalf The White"" and with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli rode off to Rohan. But the guard greets them and orders them to put down their weapons (except for Gandalf and his staff). On his throne, Theodan was under the control of Saruman (and his slave Grima Wormtongue). But Gandalf drew out Saruman ""like poison to a wound;"" he did and the spell broken. And I also like it, when on the road to Helms Deep, Gimli was explaining to Eowyn about his kind (dwarves), but then the horse he was on bolted away and he fell off; that was funny. And, I love how Arwen convinced by her father Elrond that the age of Elves is ending, and she leaves for the West, truly a heart-tugging father/daughter moment; I have a thing for father/daughter relationships. But Elrond ponders whether the Elves should still help Men. You know, when I first seen it in the theatre,I was sure she (Arwen) was going to leave until...OOPS! That is all I am telling you, you will have to see the third film for yourself how it all ends."

","One of the most annoying complaints people had for the first film was about the ending. Well, if any of them was a little more interested in it then they would have learned that it was, in fact, a trilogy. Well, duh!<br/><br/>The film picks up exactly where the film left off, with Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli racing off to try and save their hobbit friends, Merry and Pippin from the fearsome Uruk-Hai who have them in their grasp, and are racing back to Isengard with them for their master, the wizard Saruman, who believes that the two hobbits have the One Ring, which he hopes to get for himself. Saruman betrayed everything he once fought for to join Sauron, but even so, he is subtly trying to make Sauron fall. <br/><br/>Our other hobbits, Frodo and Sam, are journeying ever closer to Mordor with each new day, where their journey will end only once Frodo has destroyed the One Ring. But, quickly into the film, the pair capture the creature Gollum, whom they take as their guide to get to Mordor. Is Gollum trustworthy? Who knows. In years gone past, he had possession of the One Ring, and that indeed was the reason he was caught: he was trying to reclaim the Ring for himself. Will his evil alter-ego finally take control of his consciousness? Or will he revert to his former self, Smeagol?<br/><br/>With so many people searching for the One Ring, the chances aren't good for Frodo ever making it to Mordor. But if he doesn't, and the Ring goes back to it's master, Sauron, then all of Middle-earth is doomed. This is part of the defining trilogy, The Lord of the Rings, and while all films in the trilogy were critically acclaimed, this received the most acclaim. Personally, I think that the director, Peter Jackson, has saved the best till last, with the Return of the King.<br/><br/>But, all of the three films are as good as it gets, and this one is certainly no exception. The stunning special effects thanks to WETA workshops render every orc, troll and other beast that appears in this movie utterly believable. <br/><br/>The beautiful landscapes that are the backdrop of this film also give it its credibility. Without doubt, if it had been shot in a studio, there would be no comparison between the two. New Zealand will forever now be considered as Middle-Earth. <br/><br/>In shortgroundbreaking cinematic history. It'll be awhile before something quite like this ever pops up again."

"Robert_duder","7","0","2","16 September 2007"," Suffers from the middle child syndrome of the trilogy but still a must see!!
","I feel almost bad giving this film any sort of flack after reading other people's reviews because people truly are very passionate about this film. After re-watching Fellowship of The Ring and truly being enchanted by it I anxiously watched The Two Towers and it just didn't quite captivate me the way that Fellowship did. Many trilogies stumble during their second installment because it's almost a necessary drawl between the first and the third...beginning and end and you have to fill in all the important information to join the two. Certainly the climax of The Two Towers is very important and that's the battle of Helm's Deep and that is really what The Two Towers is all about and it just continually builds up to that and it drags while it's getting there. The characters don't give near the same effort to the expanding story and the action is minimal compared to the original. Yes it has the epic Helm's Deep Battle but it's just a different all around feel to it. Much has changed and there is a lot going on but it's almost too much. I mean The Two Towers spans a lot of information from the book (no I have never read them) so it does have big shoes to fill and I respect that but I just didn't get the same epic feel from it.<br/><br/>The entire cast returns for the second and adds some new faces as well, including one of the most infamous movie characters of all time. I won't spend too much time on the original cast because I did that for Fellowship but they all do a good job. However it feels like they've lost a little something with this second installment. Part of this may be because some of the characters change so dramatically. Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins goes through an intense change as the ring begins to catch hold of him and almost turns him. Wood's performance is a little more subtle than Fellowship but still very good. Also Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf having fallen through the earth and returned as Gandalf the White. This new version is less emotional and a little more rough around the edges and I miss the old Gandalf and it really took something away from the character for me because McKellen was amazing in the original. The addition of one of the most famous movie characters is that of computer generated Gollum based on the expressions of movements of Andy Serkis, a very talented character actor (also contributed his movements to King Kong.) I personally found Gollum annoying and overused to the likes of Jar Jar Binks and felt more the same way about him that Sam did in the film. Bernard Hill is good as the determined and concerned King Theoden, and Miranda Otto is alright as Eowyn, the niece of the King but I have my issues with her storyline. The addition of Treebeard and the Trees of the forest was also a very cool addition and I love their part in the story.<br/><br/>One of the most annoying and frustrating aspects for me in The Two Towers is this strange and completely unnecessary pseudo-romance that is established between Aragorn and Eowyn. They spent so much time making us feel the incredible, life altering love between Aragorn and Arwen in The Fellowship and it only infuriates the movie watcher to see him contemplating love with someone else although he never acts on it. It seems to diminish the power of their romance. For the SMALL minority that do find The Lord Of The Rings films 'boring,' it's almost understandable with The Two Towers. I mean don't get me wrong, it still has it's breath taking moments and the special effects and the direction and cinematography is brilliant but it moves at a much slower pace and takes much longer to fill in all these gaps that are required to get The Fellowship to The Return of The King. So you can't not watch The Two Towers and it is a must see for it's value but it isn't the best in the series by a long shot. 7/10"
"mecandes","9","0","1","13 June 2007"," The lesser film of the trilogy
","I loved FOTR and have seen the SE DVD about 8 times already. And yet, I left The Two Towers a little disappointed, and a little bewildered by all those reviews that claim it is ""better"" than FOTR. Now, don't get me wrong -- The Two Towers is a fantastic movie. In fact, it's hard for me to put into words what I think is ""wrong"" with it -- if that's even the right way to say it -- it just didn't have the... sparkle?... of FOTR to me.<br/><br/>Here's a few specific nitpicks: - We just don't see enough of the characters, and they don't interact with each other as poignantly as in FOTR. Sure, there's more action, more battle -- but less... life... somehow. - Does Grima have to look so obviously evil? Did Jackson say, ""The audience is too stupid to realize he is a bad guy, so we need to make him look like a walking corpse so that the idiots watching this movie will understand."" - What's the deal with the way Theoden looks when we first see him? I guess they wanted to show his corruption ""visually""... but they went too far, and the difference is drastic enough to prevent the suspension of disbelief. He should have looked sick, or dark, or something, sure... but not 200 years old. - Not sure what all the hype about Gollum is... he was well done, but the performance didn't blow me away. It was a bit hard to swallow the constant shifting between him being 100% murderous to 100% childlike... I felt like I was constantly ""filling in the gaps"" with my knowledge of him from the book -- not sure how a non-book reader would take Gollum... he's kinda stuffed down your throat in the movie. - The dream sequences with Arwen were pretty dull. I think they would have been better to stick more closely to the Appendix -- show how they met, etc. Shoulda played up the conflict between Aragorn and Elrond more, or something. - The changes to Faramir didn't thrill me. I think it was the point where he puts his sword to Frodo's throat that it just goes to far. I just don't see why this darker Faramir was better for the movie than the gentler book version (though I said the same about the darker Prancing Pony in FOTR... ). And in what way was the Osgiliath trip an improvement? It didn't seem to do anything besides introduce a new set. - Eowyn seems under-used, alas. During the battle of Helm's Deep, my wife leaned over and said to me, ""What ever happened to Eowyn?"" -- she needed some sort of role there -- not battling, but at least doing something. - I didn't mind them bringing the elves to Helm's Deep... but there is a cynical side of me that thinks they only did it because they wanted to bring in Haldir... someone known and yet expendable. I can't think of anyone else who would have been better suited -- and so it makes me think that they said, ""Okay, who can we kill off that will bring at least a little emotional impact. Sure, Haldir. Okay, now how do we get him to Helm's Deep?""... ;) - I really wish they hadn't used John Rhys Davies as the voice of Treebeard. It's not that there was anything wrong with it -- it's just that I could only hear Gimli whenever Treebeard would speak, and so it ruined the suspension of disbelief for me... (what reminds you that you're only watching a movie more than the same actor in two different roles?) I mean really, couldn't they find someone else? ...so, all of these nitpicks probably make it seem like I didn't like The Two Towers, and yet that's not the case at all. It's a better movie than most, that's for sure! But FOTR was sooo good, it had my hopes up a bit too high for TTT, I guess. (I don't think TTT is going to be nominated for 13 Academy Awards the way FOTR was... I'd say they'll get a Special Effects award, but that'd be about it, I think.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm happy to report that the Special Extended Edition DVD of The Two Towers goes a long way towards addressing my original reservations.<br/><br/>In the Extended Edition of Fellowship of the Ring, the ""Most Improved Character"" award goes to Galadriel -- but here, in The Two Towers, that award definitely goes to Faramir. You get much better insight into his motivations during the flashback with Boromir (always great to see more of Sean Bean!) and his father, Denethor. In the book, of course, he is never even slightly tempted by the One Ring -- wouldn't even pick it up if he found it lying by the side of the road -- and so it is nice to learn in the Extended Edition of Two Towers that he's not tempted by the Ring in and of itself: he is only thinking about pleasing his father.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy addition comes when Faramir first captures the hobbits -- in the Extended Edition, there's a glimmer of Faramir's character from the book when he walks over to the body of the fallen enemy and delivers some poignant lines (which I think were originally Sam's in the book):<br/><br/>Frodo: ""Those who claim to oppose the enemy would do well not to hinder us.""<br/><br/>Faramir: ""The enemy? His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is... where he came from. And if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there... in peace. War will make corpses of us all."""

Before the second time I saw the first Lord of the Rings film, I said that fantasy and sci-fi hardly ever slay me, much less those grand epic battle films, but I liked very much The Fellowship of the Ring, and have cleaned my palette since then with Roman epics, fantasy films, and others in that vein, especially the ones with extensive running times, because those feel bigger and more grandiose. So I decided to, extremely late in the game, complete the already classic trilogy, and upon watching this second one, with my newfound optimism with its placements in genres and subject matter, I somehow felt a mixture of my feelings upon watching the first film the first time, with great cynicism and obligation, and the way I felt the second time.<br/><br/>I wrote in my review way back when I re-watched this film's predecessor, ""Despite having never read a syllable of any of J.R.R. Tolkien's work and knowing jack about elves, halflings, hobbits, and orcs, I was perfectly able to appreciate Jackson's passionate adaptation. It is an epic with effective moments of suspense, atmosphere and action. No, I am not a fan of the dialogue that, to me, plagues the majority of fantasy and sci-fi films. You know, the pseudo- medieval, artificially dramatic semantics that can very easily tune me out of a film because of how wooden even the finest actor can't help but be when speaking that way. And no, the wardrobe of these films don't do much for me, either. However, these components come with the territory, and I can tell that recollection of the movie will carry on and taper off in a span of days, which is a good sign."" I should've felt that way about its sequel, but unfortunately I did not. The same old cynicism and anticipation for the final credits returned from all that time ago when I first saw the first film.<br/><br/>The dialects and rhetoric did aggravate me this time. I could not get past them this time around. I simply couldn't reach a logical conclusion as to why people in these films speak in such ridiculous ways that I've never heard of anyone from any culture speaking before. For instance, no one uses contractions, never once saying ""didn't"" or ""can't."" This is a small example. When things like this come to mind when listening to these characters, I only begin to wonder why they speak this way. Why do some characters speak in variations of English accents and others speak in American ones? Is this a question answered in the books? Perhaps I should've read them before seeing these films, but many fans have yet to read them, so I figured I would be fine. Does one have to go through such an effort to enjoy a film? An adaptation is not meant to be delivered in a way where the audience is expected to reference the book. But, for the sake of the film's logic, I hope that there is reason given in the books for Middle Earth being so ambiguous in its dialect and rhetoric uses. The biggest, and perhaps most legitimate, complaint of mine is the completely unrealistic way I've spoken of but haven't yet explained. You know what they do: They begin speaking very loudly, then come very close to the listener's face and begins speaking in a whisper, then walks away as if it's not natural to expect a response from them. And the listener simply stands, studious and greatly effected by their words. I could go on and on, but in the interest of time, I'll move on.<br/><br/>The battle sequences were surprisingly unimpressive to me. There was no intensity. The camera-work had a very point-and-shoot style. The dwarf's moments during the climactic battle, his heroic comic relief, is very corny and unneeded. As I watch, I see how everything is a soundstage mechanism. I felt that the violence in the first film was much better portrayed.<br/><br/>What I liked about this film was the plot strand involving Gollum, Frodo, and Sam. I felt compassion for Gollum, an uneasy, not entirely entrusted compassion, and enjoyed his development as a point of mystery between sympathetic character and antagonist. I also liked the cinematography outside of the battle sequences. Just as I did in the first movie, I love the atmosphere depicted in the fictitious villages and locales, and I love the Gothic and extravagant use of lighting. During the climax, even though I was disappointed in how unriveted I was in the battle, I enjoyed the concept of all the culminations of all joined characters from all plot strands progressed over the course of three hours finally clashing together.<br/><br/>I gave this movie every chance when my natural proclivities were against it. I was assuredly paying attention, which didn't help me: Once Faramir's party reaches Anduin, one of Gondor's people says Mordor's seized the eastern side. So how do they get to the western side? If they use the sewer that Faramir later sends Frodo and Sam into, why did he explain to them what those sewers were? They'd have seen them already, just like me, who doesn't have to see this movie anymore. And for that I'm thankful. I didn't dislike this film, but I would add The Fellowship of the Ring to my collection and refuse to allow this sequel. I simply don't think I could watch it again. I hope the third one is the astonishing achievement it's cracked up to be."

","I have been debating on whether to review the original theatrical releases or the Special Extended DVD Editions director Peter Jackson ""originally intended audiences to see,"" but since I have about the same opinions for both with each movie, I've decided it doesn't really matter. If you think it does, I've chosen the original theatrical releases because I don't review the deleted scenes for other movies and do think favoritism is wrong. That being said, all three LOTR films, whether you find them fascinating or slow, are cinematic masterpieces. Pre-emptive warning: If you haven't seen The Fellowship of the Rings, most of this review might as well be in Braille for you.<br/><br/>Two Towers marks the beginning of the split-up of the Fellowship. The human-elf-dwarf combo of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli (Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and John Rhys-Davies) go in search of their trailing hobbit friends Pippin and Merry, who were captured by the Orcs. Fortunately, the two prisoner hobbits manage to escape the Orcs themselves into the forest of Fangorn where they are acquainted with the tree-creatures known as the Ents. When their search party enters the forest, they come across an old friend, but I won't spoil how the mystery friend got there. Meanwhile, throughout the film, the carrier of the ring Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his loyal associate Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin) are continuing their quest to dispose of the ring once and for all. The ring is still taking a toll on Frodo, but not so much as it is with Gollum, a creature formally known as Smeagol who once possessed the ring and has been following Frodo and Sam, waiting for his chance to strike. Without a doubt, my favorite scene is the Gollum/Smeagol split-personality debate, not only because it is a witnessing of some of the best visual CGI in recent memory but also for Andy Serkis' debatably Academy-overlooked performance (I can understand the snub, but I don't agree with it). The Two Towers is a vital piece of the trilogy and fits it as well as the others do, however, of the three, it gets the bronze. My main beef with the film was the Ents and their incredibly slow ways; sure, they add variety and character to the series and do their part in providing an awesome action-packed ending for The Two Towers, but long and literally drawn-out dialogue is about the last thing a 179-minute film needs. Still, this is a small bicker, and the trilogy is still a must-watch."
"WaMoZ","10","0","1","23 October 2006"," Peter Jackson's splendidly unadorned vision of a Tolkien masterpiece.
","I may as well start off by declaring that this is my favourite movie of all time. Not that I think it's perfect. It has flaws not apparent in The Fellowship of the Ring, a near-perfect gem of a film. But more about TTT's imperfections later. I didn't ""choose"" it as a favourite film because it is the best, rather it ""chose"" me, by speaking to my heart and mind in a way no other movie has before or since has. Within Peter Jackson's inspired vision of The Lord of the Rings, TTT just grabbed me with its uncompromisingly gritty intensity. It is the very centre of a monumental life or death struggle between good and evil. The beginning is long gone and the ending is still far off. I just love that the each of the three groups separated from each other by FotR's Uruk-hai attack never find their friends. They are all driven by simple hope no matter how desperate their situations may get, and this theme is brilliantly summed up by Sam's speech in Osgiliath at the end.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of Gandalf fighting the Balrog while they fall is a splendid mix of state-of-the-art special effects and character exposition. The ferocity of Ian McKellen's performance more than matches the spectacular sight of the plunging, flaming Balrog on the big screen. But better is to follow. Andy Serkis and a brilliant CGI team brings the repulsive and pathetic yet compelling creature Gollum to life in a way inconceivable before the release of this movie. The other new characters add to the intrigue as the Rohan's struggle for survival unfolds. The actors playing Eomer, Wormtongue, Eowyn and Theoden are perfectly cast, as the story flows seamlessly from the ending of FotR.<br/><br/>As for the controversial changes to the book of TTT, I feel they are justified. Aragorn's urging of Arwen to leave Middle Earth is a noble act of self-sacrifice. The further exposition of Arwen's character and her relationship with Aragorn adds so much to our understanding of him. He is a more rounded and vulnerable character as a result. To not bring Arwen and Aragorn's tale out of the RotK appendices would have been a grave injustice, because within the narrative of the book her character is badly underwritten. I also liked seeing the Elves at Helm's Deep, because viewers who haven't read the Silmarillion would not realise the extent of their losses in previous wars with Melkor and Sauron. The addition of Faramir's bad decision-making is even more controversial, but I say, why not make him more suitable for the unforgiving medium of film? On the page he is a wonderfully written character, but after just a cosy chat with Frodo he lets him go on into the heart of Mordor with the Ring! The film audience would start to doubt the power of the Ring with Faramir being so immune to it, and also would end up wondering in RotK if it was actually necessary for Aragorn to take over the rule of Gondor from such a perfect heir to the now-dead Denethor. In the film Faramir's development as a character is extremely moving, culminating in his final quiet decision to release Frodo.<br/><br/>In this film Faramir, Aragorn and Theoden are real characters I can better identify with, rather than the idealised figures of Tolkien's original book. I am not putting down Tolkien, because I love his writings and will defend them against his critics, but am merely pointing the difference between contemporary films and traditional literature. His characters are problematic on the big screen if left unadapted, and I believe Jackson has done this and kept the essence of the story. However, to avoid the impression that I am totally uncritical of this film, I will say that Jackson has not done justice to the power of Treebeard's character as written by Tolkien. He seems to be senile at times! <br/><br/>TTT's epic battles are just brilliant. The Warg fight is a nice entrée, but Helm's Deep is a stunning main course. The beautifully developing friendship of Legolas and Gimli is a real high point. Of course hardened solders make jokes in the middle of battles! Then we have possibly the most spine-tingling moment of the whole trilogy, as the Rohirrim charge out of the rising sun into the massed ranks of Uruk-hai, led by Eomer and Gandalf the white rider on Shadowfax. This is the sequence in my LotR EE DVDs that gets the most replays! <br/><br/>Another reason this is my favourite is that it has less things to distract from plot and character development than do FotR and RotK. The homely Shire, glittering Lothlorien, the ghostly Army of the Dead, the great spider Shelob, the awful Mountain of Fire, the pageantry of the Minas Tirith coronation, and the glow of the Grey Havens do not appear. The only idyllic place, Rivendell, is a troubled memory in Aragorn's tortured thoughts. Helm's Deep at night is not the majestic site for a battle that is Minas Tirith in daylight. Don't get me wrong, I love LotR's spectacle, but in TTT the life and death scenarios seem even more fraught and desperate without the unforgettable backgrounds.<br/><br/>I must add a comment about the Extended Edition, to illustrate a further flaw. Unlike FotR, TTT relies on its EE to add details which make the story more understandable. Jackson unfortunately left out of the theatrical version the flashback scene in Osgiliath between Boromir, Faramir and Denethor. While this decision aided the pacing of the movie, it left Jackson open to criticism that he had thoughtlessly marred Faramir's character. This scene provides back-story explaining why he first decides to take Frodo and the Ring to Minas Tirith. The EE is needlessly essential viewing as a result, but I would still recommend it regardless, because as with FotR it does add cream to the cake of a classic movie!"
"MrSharma","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," An excellent film, but a little sloppy...
","Whilst Peter Jackson's directorial talent and the wonderful imagination of Tolkien himself are the fundamental backdrop of the second installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise, I increasingly get the feeling that this film was an excellent one, but one that was a little patchy at times. Overall, a visual and emotional extravaganza, but the film slows slightly and stands as a notch below both its predecessor and its successor.<br/><br/>The CGI is absolutely brilliant, and the ability that Jackson and his team at Weta were able to use state of the art technology to create the character of Gollum is remarkable -- his performance is as strong as Frodo and Sam's, and this wonderful and realistic chemistry highlights much of the film's merit. The expansive battle at Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, as is the March of the Ents on an unsuspecting Isengard. It is not in the visual effects that the film falls a little flat.<br/><br/>Viggo Mortensen, whilst looking the part of Aragorn, seems to be patchy in his portrayal, representing his fair inexperience within the world of Hollywood. His delivery of lines is, at many times, stale and thus puts a substantial patch on the credibility of what is one of the more important characters within the story. That being said, he does possess a steadfastness and visual courage that is practically unmatched by all of the other cast -- it's when Mortensen is really challenged that he seems to struggle slightly. Orlando Bloom is terrible and remedial as always, once more looking the part brilliantly but not even possessing the basic ability to recite a line without showing conflicting facial expressions, and a real inability to understand both his character and the direction of the story. The other members of the supporting cast are excellent - Elijah Wood is fantastic as Frodo, a hobbit perpetually under the emotional and mental attack from the One Ring. Sean Astin is unwavering as Sam, and Christopher Lee plays an increasingly evil Saruman to a tee. Sir Ian Mackellan is positive and competent as Gandalf.<br/><br/>The score, whilst being quite good, falls flat slightly. The cinematography, especially the wide expansive shots amongst a beautiful and untouched New Zealand countryside, is nothing short of breathtaking. The introduction of new characters, such as those that dwell in Rohan, is excellent. Even the addition of the ENTS is a worthy one, and one posing many thrills and laughs along the way.<br/><br/>All in all, this film aimed for perfection but didn't quite get there. It was not as raw or majestic as the first film, and wasn't as emotionally expansive as the final chapter. Standing alone, the film is endearing and entertaining. However, some patchy acting from main cast members and the patchiness of both the script and the score taint this film from what it could potentially be.<br/><br/>An 8 out of 10 -- a remarkable achievement, standing alone, but quite easily the patchiest and most inconsistent of the film franchise."

"paul2001sw-1","5","0","1","19 November 2005"," Bored of the rings again
","'The Lord of the Rings' is a much liked, but also widely derided book (aactually three books, just as it is now three films). It's not hard to see why both opinions are held. The narrative has epic sweep, but the moral motivations of the characters are simplistic in the extreme. They may be torn between good and evil, but these are presented as primeval, opposing forces: the concept of mixed motive scarcely exists. The much noted absence of sex from the book typifies this: it's not that the book would benefit from sexual content per se, rather that the heroic model of its universe cannot accommodate anything as challenging as the fusion of love and lust.<br/><br/>Yet I actually like the book, with its rich descriptive language. In fact, the monsters and landscape so described were long considered unfilmable; but with the aid of modern computer graphics, Peter Jackson has achieved a visually perfect reconstruction of Middle Earth, with almost everything looking exactly as you imagined it from the text (though the orcs seem to be a little influenced by the 'Alien' with their ferocious, flashing teeth). The virtual Gollum is perhaps the most skillfully animated character of any yet rendered on screen. Yet there was another reason why the book should have been tricky to film, and this is the relationship of its the characters to history and time. The novel's best point, in my opinion, is the way that it conveys a sense of a vast, slow journey, one that criss-crosses the routes of a thousand past journeys that collectively have brought the present to pass. Stories are told, often in fragmentary form; and the end of the quest represents not just the end of the foregrounded tale, but the end of an fictional era, and the end of the reader's quest to understand that era as well. This is all essentially wordy stuff, narrative and dialogue, that does not just fill the spaces between the action points, but provides them with their context. And in spite of making his movie over nine full hours, Jackson seems to have been unable to find time for this, and the first film, as well as the first part of this instalment, precede as an unbroken series of fairly meaningless happenings, all spectacular but pointless. For example, when Frodo (the hero) visits the dead marshes, he needs to know how they came to be; otherwise, the fact he sees corpses lying below the water is just empty decoration. In Osgilliath, we see just a random ruined city, not understanding it was once the capital of Gondor. And so on. Jackson has been generally very faithful to Tolkein's plotting (though he takes a few liberties in the second half of this film), but this faithfulness takes the form of completism: almost every image from the book needs to be rendered, but if you don't already know the story, you might struggle to work out why.<br/><br/>So although the description of travel was one of the very best things in the novel, this film actually improves in its second half, when the travelling slows or stops, and the story starts to feel less sequential. The changes to the plot, however, are not so successful, because where Jackson should have cut selectively, he has instead largely embellished the action, usually adding more melodrama than was present in the original. So all the heroes need to nearly die in battle; Farmair must be tempted by the ring, just as his brother Boromir was, and the heroes must join him when he fights his rearguard action in Osgilliath; Pippin and Merry must trick the ents into helping out, and so on. Quite why Jackson considered the story needed more incident is hard to fathom, especially as there's a shallow obviousness to this extra material. The emotional impact is further deadened by the decision to play every scene with music. The music is not awful or ill-chosen, but there's no contrast, and one cannot stay in state of heightened arousal for three hours at a stretch. This is a film for which you could make a terrific trailer; but when every scene is played as a climax, the cumulative effect is lessened, not increased. Indeed, the battle with Saruman is given an apocalyptic tone that seems to pre-empt the final part of the story; but this second movie two ends short of the second book, ignoring the potential of tremendous, pessimistic cliff-hanger with which Tolkein concluded his second part.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the visuals are great. But the film misses what allows the book to transcend its peculiarities. If you like 'The Silmarillion' (Tolkein's more literary, sophisticated prequel), then this probably isn't for you."

","The fellowship has been broken and friendship torn. But new alliances must be made. Frodo and Sam stuck in a maze of rocky landscape must ask for help in the enemy; Gollum. Gollum despises Frodo, as he holds the ring; or the precious to Gollum. Gollum leads them to ht black gates of Mordor, but he knows another way. Aragon, Gimli and Legolas are hunting down Merry and Pippin; meeting an old friend. Saruman has built his army and has sent his forces out to destroy the people of Rohan, leading to one of the best battle sequences in the trilogy; the battle of Helms Deep.<br/><br/>Unlike many sequels, this actually moves forward and surpasses the first chapter. While the Fellowship of the Ring built the foundation, The Two Towers continues to build upon it. From the mind blowing sequence of Gandalf fighting the Belroc demon to the explosive Helms Deep battle, it never faulters. While keeping all the characters, giving them equal share on screen, it introduces new people, adding more depth and dimension. The Ents have to be the best new characters, they are just astounding and visually amazing.<br/><br/>The fight sequences are wonderfully directed. The battle of helms deep is worth the weight. The inter time i was just amazed and clutching my seat at the intensity of the battle. Though its a minor battle, but the Ents storming Saruman's tower was equally great, those Ents can fight.<br/><br/>While Fellowship of the Ring is still a classic, this moves even further and breaks the boundaries, setting up for the biggest ending in this masterful trilogy."

","In my review of The Fellowship of the Ring, I docked half a mark simply because I had to wait for the next instalment. I must, regrettably, do the same with The Two Towers. Like its predecessor, The Two Towers is long, but also like its predecessor, it doesn't matter. Usually long films fail to hold my interest, but if The Two Towers was any shorter it simply wouldn't cover what it needs to cover. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) have broken away from the others and are selflessly carrying on alone in their quest to destroy Sauron's ring. Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Orlando Bloom) search for the other two hobbits, Merry and Pippin, stumble across a reborn Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and make their way to Rohan, where the king has been taken over by Saruman (Christopher Lee). The whole thing culminates in an absolutely spectacular battle sequence at Helms Deep, where our three heroes and their mighty army battle against the orcs for close to half an hour. The Two Towers was shot simultaneously with the other two, and is therefore just as visually spectacular as the first part, and presumably, the third part. New Zealand is a beautiful country, and Middle Earth is a beautiful place. Even the dark clouds and volcanic activity of Mordor has a certain ambiance to it. But it is the CGI effects that dominate and shine in this film. In particular, computer graphics have been used to create Gollum (Andy Serkis), brought to life from the real actor's movements. As in the book, Gollum is a tortured soul, who's split personality and desire to possess the One Ring (his 'precious') creates a powerful, yet pitiable, character. Also, there is Treebeard, a walking, talking tree (voiced by Rhys-Davies again) whose lethargic nature comes across in his ambling gait and droning, slow tones. As The Lord of the Rings is really one big movie cut into three parts, it is difficult to rate each part as a separate movie. However, the action sequences in The Two Towers are bigger, better and more frequent than in The Fellowship of the Ring, and the character development continues nicely. It's probably better than the first one, but I won't be able to judge accurately until I see Part 3, due out at the end of 2003. Until then, I give it the same mark I gave the first one. Good-o-meter rating: 9/10"

","I was one of the people who waited to reserve judgment on these movies until I had seen them all. I was inclined to rave about them as each one came out but with major disappointments like the the Star Wars prequels and Matrix sequels, I realized that you couldn't just take one installments quality for granted. Well suffice it to say that now that I have seen all three the sit on the number two spot on my top ten only beat by ""The Shawshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>Peter Jackson deserves a thunderclap of applause for pulling these movies off so effortlessly. It's hard to imagine a time when I was actually skeptical on whether or not these films would be good. It seemed like a project doomed to failure from the start, especially when you look at Jackson's past resume. Making your name in cheap splatter films doesn't exact sell a person on you ability to handle one of the most epic undertakings in Hollywood history. I was utterly shocked when against all odds he pulled it off.<br/><br/>Of course you can't give Pete all the praise. He was added immensely by a extremely talented cast. They all delivered memorable performances and made the most out of a story that doesn't really have much for character development. When I walked away from these movies I felt like I knew all of these characters well and was extremely sad to see their story end. That is this trilogy's greatest accomplishment. It rejuvenated my faith that Hollywood could pull off a great movie such as this and no matter how crappy everything else was throughout the year we always had the new Rings film to look forward to.<br/><br/>I'm sad I can't feel that way anymore. 2005 has many films coming out with great potential but I have a hard time getting my hopes up as I have been let down so many times before. ""Rings"" eliminate those fears as I always had that one ray of sunshine waiting for me at the end of each year. These movies made me feel like a kid again as I gazed in awe at the cinema screen like I hadn't done since I first saw dinosaurs walk the Earth in ""Jurrasic Park"".<br/><br/>I will cherish these movies for years to come and I look forward to being able to introduce my children to them when they get old enough.

","Wow you know the feeling when you come out of the cinema having just seen a really great film and it actually changing your mood and everything. You know the Feeling in the months leading up to see a movie that has been hyped up so much and you think as usual that it will not live up to the hype well in my time only two movies have ever lived up to their hype Lord Of The Rings The Two Towers is one of them and a certain George Lucas Film is the other. <br/><br/>I remember sitting in the cinema thinking i really don't want this to end and when it did i was just blown away a lot well most big movies these days they put all the bang at the start and in first half of the movie to draw in the Cinegoer. Too often by the end they have spent all there money and effort to get you in to the movie then to not really worry how the movie ends well all the greats in movie history have been the Opposite have had amazing spellbinding endings that stay with you for years Shawshank Redemption Good Bad and the Ugly Sixth Sense Saving Private Ryan Need i Say More.<br/><br/>LORD OF THE RINGS TWO TOWERS to me is what empire must have been like to the generation before me because it totally lived up and bettered what i had expected which rarely rarely happens. It took me awhile Like the fellowship but by the time the second film came out i was one of the legions.<br/><br/>First of all the movie starts off just nice and slow just reestablishing characters setting the stage for what is to come okay so there may not be Two Hundred Thousand Orks and a grand white city but what the movie does have is the element of surprise and suspense while the 3rd film was the best received of the three we all kinda new what was going to happen and to me it just felt like two towers on steroids i like rotk heaps but i just wasn't as sweept away as in the second film the battle of helms deep is built up so well gandalf coming back to kick some evil ass frodo and sam meeting the twisted yet intriguing Gollum and then the movie takes sauramon from being the agressor to the one who is bieng attacked and you get to go along for the ride the bit that just really brought this movie home for me was when the ents have deceided not to go to war and treebeard is going to drop the hobbits off when all of a sudden he walks out into a brutilized cut down part of the forest while he is talking away when all of a sudden he and everything go quiet score and all then the music starts up and the ents go to war and the movie goes up another level another good sort of surprise was when gandalf reappeared even tho he dropped big hints at a return with help you get so caught up in the movie that when he does come you are o i forgot and phew . which says a lot for the movie.<br/><br/>What more could you want from a movie i recommend this to everyone its great on Big Screen with all the bells and whistles it just gives it that oompth and impact you will feel like the volume is getting turned up as the movie goes but thats just the pace. <br/><br/>I have to say that this is as close to perfection as a fantasy film can get i along with the rest of us humans well most of us loved it and will surely watch it many more times in the future. <br/><br/>Thank Peter and Mr tolkien and everyone else for all the fun.

","`Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' is the second of the Lord of the Rings trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.  The DVD is the wide screen theatrical release edition featuring the theatrical release of the film and an additional disk with some special features.<br/><br/>It covers two discs with a running time of almost three hours; `Two Towers' is an incredible sequel to `Fellowship of the Ring.'  For the first time, viewers get to see Gollum in the flesh so to speak.  The animated character acted by Andy Serkis definitely steals the show with the awesome visual affects, dialogue, and contrary emotions this complicated character has. The film continues where `Fellowship' left off but propels the story forward at an amazing pace.<br/><br/>We are indulged in the scenery of Rohan and the immense Battle of Helm's Deep but also are exposed to the first appearance of the Ents who are living, sentient tree people.  `Two Towers' also brings the characters of Merry and Pippin to the forefront allowing actors Billy Boyd and Dominic Monahan to shine.  Of course, the story of Frodo and Sam's friendship entwined with the journey to destroy the Ring of Power plays a major role and continues to develop.<br/><br/>True fans of the novels and first film will especially enjoy this DVD. Retailing at $17.99 the DVD is a good buy but unfortunately falls short in the special features department.  The special features gems include Sean Astin's short film, `The Long and Short of It' and the trailer for `Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.'<br/><br/>Although the film is a joy and the special features entertaining people may wish to wait and purchase the extended version of the film instead.  If the extended version of `Fellowship' is any indicator, `Two Towers: Extended Version' will be a DVD everyone must add to their collection.  Having scenes expanded and cut scenes integrated with the film and a plethora of special features will make the extended version more in demand than the theatrical release.<br/><br/>While we wait, `Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' theatrical release is a good buy with its fun special features, and DVD-ROM content.  It includes English and Spanish subtitles but no available dubbing."
"HobbitHole","Null","0","1","3 August 2004"," Excellent sequel!
","Jackson continues the epic series with amazing battle sequences and wonderful new characters.  Who will forget Treebeard, Grima Wormtongue or Theoden, King of Rohan and of course Gollum!?!<br/><br/>Added is the humor and rivalry between Gimli the dwarf and Legolas the elf.<br/><br/>
Only drawback is that the ending of the first film contains a part of the second book and part of the Two Towers gets left for the third movie.  Other than that, this is a real great sequel that is somewhat overlooked in the trilogy.<br/><br/>The character development is great as the fellowship breaks into three groups.  I think we can all identify with one of these characters and imagine what we would do given these circumstances.  <br/><br/>Imagination.  That's the name of the game.  If you think it's not a valuable asset, ask Peter Jackson, who allowed himself to use imagination to make into a movie his favorite series of books from his youth."
"ccm043","7","0","5","9 June 2004"," A worthy film, though not the best of the three
","""The Two Towers"" is certainly a good film, though, for me, it was not the best of ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy.  I preferred ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and ""The Return of the King"" blew them both out of the water.  But TTT is still a good film, and I would recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Being as there are fewer characters introduced, and less exposition for the story, the characters are not bogged down by starting a new story.  My favorite plot line is the one that involves Frodo, Sam, and Gollum.  Gollum is amazingly animated.  He is so realistic, and far outdoes Dobby from ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  I also enjoy the relationship between Sam and Frodo.  Jackson greatly portrays Frodo's descent as he begins to become consumed by the ring.  <br/><br/>The other plotline, involving Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas, Theoden, Eowyn, and Eomer is still well done, though at times, I feel that some of it could have been left out.  The flashbacks to Arwen seemed like they were only included to keep her in the memory of the audience.<br/><br/>I appreciate Jackson's willingness to make this a good film, even if it means making sacrifices to the book.  Tolkien purists will be even more disappointed with this film than the previous one (though you all probably know that already).<br/><br/>A worthy film, one that I would recommend.  7 Stars."
"CitizenCaine","9","0","1","23 May 2004"," The Rings Saga Continues Successfully In The Two Towers
","Peter Jackson's The Two Towers successfully continues the epic saga that is The Lord Of The Rings. The film introduces several new characters that play key roles in this film as well as the third film. Theoden, Eowyn, and Faramir are the main ones. Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, and David Wenham are all effective in their roles, especially Otto as the daughter trying to show her worth to her father and Aragorn. The film also treats us to the two wonderful computer generated characters of Gollum and Treebeard. The film opens with a brief bit recapping the end of the first film. Then in this film, the fellowship is split into three groups of characters. Frodo and Samwise continue their journey alone with Gollum; Pippin and Merry are captured by the Uruk-Hai warriors before meeting up with Treebeard; and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli travel in search of Pippin and Merry, but end up being drawn into other adventures. The film blends these story lines for the duration of the film. As in the first film, the action, cinematography, costumes, crafts, score, sets, special effects, technical wizardry, and weaponry are all tremendous. The film culminates in the dramatization of Helms Deep, a tremendously exciting battle sequence. It ends with the realization that all of Middle Earth is now in great danger and faces perilous times, setting the stage for the third film. The film is not without its weaknesses. Gandalf disappears for several stretches during the film and he was one of the main characters of the first film. The hobbits become more like instruments that serve the plot instead of characters that create it. Frodo's and Samwise's scenes with Gollum are a little tedious at times. Pippin and Merry have little to do once they meet Treebeard. Aragorn is more of the main protagonist in this film, while Legolas is just a skillful fighter and Gimli more and more like comic relief. The great battle itself (it's progression, complications, and conclusion) is somewhat formulaic in retrospect. However, none of these things detracts from the enjoyment of The Two Towers and the spectacle that the Lord Of The Rings has become at this point. It is still an outstanding film in every respect. There are also numerous scenes that one can perceive as modern political parallels in the film, including Treebeard's decision to involve his friends. Once again, as in Fellowship Of The Ring, the film's pacing makes the long running time seem shorter than it is. The film won Oscars for Sound Editing and Visual Effects. ***1/2 of 4 stars."
"spikethebloody","4","0","1","4 April 2004"," A unsatisfying mess.(minor spoilers)
","My problems with this movie are many. The love for the first one really made me antsy to see the next installment. What i saw was a complete disregard for the characters and themes of the first film. The Two Towers introduced waaaaaaay too many characters while leaving established characters from the first film by the wayside. The procession of new characters became tiresome especially in the wake of Gandalf's near total disappearance from the film. The visuals continued to be astounding but i knew that from the first film. The action was larger on scale but lost all of the personal feeling from the fellowship. Helm's Deep quickly fell into the trap of repetition and sky shots of stuntmen and CGI. The rest of the story is supposed to be carried by Frodo and Sam and their journey towards Mt. Doom. I was wholly disappointed with Gollum who was well done technically but not as a character. The longwinded scenes of him talking to himself were tiresome and soon also became repetitious. I think Two Towers disproves the logic that bigger is always better. As Two Towers expanded a great story of a group with a goal into a giant world war epic that lost its characters in a sea of war."

"John_Mclaren","10","0","1","9 February 2004"," The Best Film of the Trilogy
","Yes, it's true. Return of the King may win more of the Oscars as the culmination of Peter Jackson's magnificent cinematic achievement, but history will in fact adjudge ""The Two Towers"" as the greatest of the three Rings. If Fellowship was a road movie and ROTK was a friendship film, then Two Towers is an unadulterated war movie of heroic proportions. Peter Jackson said he based it on ""Zulu""- and we can see why. It has a dramatic intensity and flow which none of the other films quite share. Good against evil are so sharply contrasted that you could cut your fingers on them. TTT also has the best score Howard Shore has produced. And it has the best dialogue.<br/><br/>The screenplay explains (with barely disguised contemporary resonance) what we are protecting in Western civilisation when we defend ourselves against those who would wish to destroy it. When Sam tells Frodo that there are ""some things worth fighting for"", when Merry tells Pippin that there ""won't be a Shire"" unless they do something about it, when King Theoden laments that ""the sun has gone down in the West"" this film could be entitled not the ""Two Towers"" but ""the Twin Towers"". It is Miltonic in its scope. It is cinema as art.<br/><br/>Yes, one may quibble about certain Entish details, and I know that the Elves weren't supposed to be at Helm's Deem, and that Faramir is a little undeveloped, but does this matter? Not at all. The Extended version is better than the original, but does not need to make such a quantum leap as Fellowship managed with its EE. However it will be a film that is seen as a landmark in cinema. A trilogy which may never be bettered. And a reminder of what we are all here for"

Liv Tyler is the only good thing, except for Sean Astin and Elijah Wood. Orlando Bloom fails to live up to hype. He was better in POTC (Pirates of the Caribbean).<br/><br/>One way I can summarize my hatred: if I was offered $50 million, and all I had to do was watch it, I'd forego the millions.<br/><br/>And, no, I'm not crazy.<br/><br/>Return of the King shouldn't win Best Picture....or any other Oscars, actually. GO MYSTIC RIVER!!!! (This is the only other thing I had to root for, since Cold Mountain didn't get nominated for Best Picture or Director, which it should have.) TIM ROBBINS RULES!!! This is an all-time low for Ian McKellen, and I'd rather see him in X-Men.<br/><br/>Oh, and it gets much worse.<br/><br/>Dominic Monaghan (Spelling- I don't care)is perfectly cast....as a hopeless elf. And Cate Blanchett? Come on! She hasn't done anything good since ""Elizabeth""! Peter Jackson wasted his budget on this film. It may take home Best Picture and Best Director for Jackson, but it doesn't deserve it. You know the guy who was frozen or something in ""A Clockwork Orange""?

It shouldn't have been spent on a flea-bag flick like this. They should have spent it on something like ""The Last Emperor"" which is totally fabulous. But LOTR has no chance 35 years from now. Sure, I'm no psychic but there's a good chance. I mean, how many people actually admit that they still enjoy ""Titanic""? That was also crap, BTW. I mean, COME ON!!! Gandhi was totally a better movie (sure, its from 1982, but it's a classic).<br/><br/>I WILL NOT BE SILENCED! I WILL HEAR INCENUATIONS! EVERYTHING WENT WRONG!

Like ""The Golden Hall"" of Theoden, which is nothing more than a woodcutter's cottage (and all the Rohan people presented as silly rustics!)

Like most movies that run more than two hours (in this case, a LOT more than two hours), it would have been vastly improved by aggressive editing. Once again, we have wooden characters (although they are starting to show some signs of life), settings that suffer from a deplorable excess of styling, and a story that really isn't all that interesting or coherent. <br/><br/>In it's favor, we again have nice effects, but it still feels too much like Xena, Warrior Princess with a better budget, and probably less interesting characters.

","APPARENTLY Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring' wasn't a historical film, it was a fantasy film. Thanks to the people who messaged me and told me that, mostly rather rudely, but if it's meant to be a fantasy why base it in middle England, or rather (as Jackson decided when he wrote it) Middle Earth? Duh? If I was going to write a fantasy film I wouldn't put Jesus in it, or an evil Jesus doppelganger, but then nobody reads my scripts do they? Well I say nobody, but that guy from the CIA was interested in my hilarious Whoopee Goldberg vehicle Jihad Act', although I'm not sure that his review of it as `Incitement to Terrorist Activity' was altogether fair.<br/><br/>Anyway, because Hollywood won't finance my films I have to go and watch fantasy' movies by that bearded lunatic Peter Jackson. So what does he do in the sequel to Lord of the Rings'? Well, firstly the good Jesus doesn't die (technically correct) when he's pulled into a fiery chasm by a winged giant (there are too many inaccuracies to even start discussing here).<br/><br/>But after some cockneys kidnapped some of the stunted thieves from the first film, the Welsh Bloke, the lady with the bow and that guy in the tight shorts from GI Jane (who doesn't wash in this film) chase them on foot for about 300 miles! I can't run 300 yards let alone 300 miles and I've seen what Jackson looks like. I bet he couldn't even run 30 yards! Luckily for them a tree (I'm not making this up) rescues the guys from Bucks and then wanders around aimlessly talking rubbish. Jackson, trees don't walk, talk or have meetings with (wait for it) other trees. Wasn't somebody there when Jackson was writing this stuff to stop this sort of nonsense from happening?<br/><br/>Peter Jackson: `and then some trees come to life and save them.'<br/><br/>Overseer: `Jackson you bearded spaz! That makes no sense! Write a better story!'<br/><br/>If I'd written it, it wouldn't be a tree (which the more I say it the more it makes no sense) that saved them; it'd be Whoopee Goldberg. She'd show them that by thinking outside the box and breaking a few rules that war in Middle Earth could be fun! `C'mon! We can really rock this place!' She'd say as she brandished a battleaxe at a Cave Troll.<br/><br/>But Jackson decided (against popular opinion I'm sure) not to put the talented Ms Goldberg in this film, which is its primary reason for its failure. Regardless of his poor casting abilities the thieves from Bucks continue their journey towards a burning hellhole (that I presume is meant to be Slough). This skinny guy with huge eyes turns up because he wants the ring, and quite rightly gets put on a leash. Meanwhile Cockneys attack loads of villages and some other things happen that culminate in a huge battle. To be honest the massive hell-storm of historical inaccuracies that Jackson decided to insist were real just got too much for me at this point, so I will say no more on the subject. <br/><br/>You've pushed me too far now Jackson, you and that blatant liar Ang my film has a dragon in it' Lee. And it's not because I'm emotionally unstable' (hear that Derek Palmers?) but because of your ludicrously inaccurate historical' pap and Ang's horrendous false advertising. Why don't you both make a film together called Gandhi' about the life of the leader of the famous Indian revolts? That way you could make sure there'd be no one called Gandhi in it and the British could be replaced by massive blue robots with laser eyes and hands that fired atomic rockets! Then of course JESUS would turn up on a horse (it was an ASS Jackson) being chased by something stupid, like a burning fish with legs and you'd BOTH get Oscars for it! Awwww man I'm getting really angry now.<br/><br/>It's no good. I'm too furious to even rate this film! Actually, I'm not rating this film and I'm even going to take a point off my Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' review from the 4th October 2002! That puts it at a humiliating 8 points!

","Hi all,<br/><br/>I would like to comment on the changes to the script of these movies. Having just seen the extended version, I felt a lot happier about the two towers.  But we have to remember that Jackson & crew cannot include everything in here, or we would have 6 movies, not 3.<br/><br/>For example, is there anyone else who found Tom Bombadil annoying?  Read ""Bored of the Rings"" (a spoof) if you'd like to see my opinion.<br/><br/>We have several areas in the book that are about Gollum, but are not really appropriate.  If you know Tolkien at all, you'll understand that he wrote the languages first, and then the book to fit around his invention.  He himself would not have a problem with the very minor problems the film crew had with parts of the plot!<br/><br/>Another good example is also the Elves at Helm's deep.  Clearly, 300 people would be massacared far too quickly for this to be realistic or transposable to film.  The elves showing up, for me at least, is a very touching and loving moment - I still get a lump in my throat when I first hear the Elven horns whilst Aragorn and Legolas discuss their fate.<br/><br/>For the doubters, I recommend you sit back and enjoy this story that is being told in a way slightly differently from the original story teller (like most great stories are).  Frankly, if Tolkien were to release the books today, they probably would not get published due to major plot problems, so if you think Tolkien is some kind of God, think again;  He was a dreamer (and I'm glad about that).<br/><br/>It won't happen, but I pray to God that Jackson can somehow arrange a film of the Hobbit.

I wasn't sure what was really going on. Having not read the books, I couldn't fill in the gaps that it left in the story. That has pretty much been cleared up for me now. I understand the motivations of the character of Faramir, and his brother Boromir, much better now that they were given a decent backstory in one scene which was only a few minutes. (Why these scenes can't be left in the theatrical release of an already long movie is beyond me.) Merry and Pippin have some fabulous scenes as well that add so much charm to what had been an action movie. Now it's a whole movie. Almost every character benefitted from little extra tidbits that really make a difference. Things that seemed to be overdone like the refugees, Arwen, the wargs, all the stuff that seemed to drag on just kinda goes by unnoticed now because there is so much more in the movie that frames them so it's not really a problem anymore.<br/><br/>I didn't ""like"" the theatrical version of this movie.

","This movie has desecrated the Lord of the Rings of Tolkien. The first part, being The Fellowship Of The Ring only had fault in that it missed out much of the story, and although it is understandable that a movie does not have to to build on characters, some important events had also been left out. I for one, would have loved to see Lothlorien's beauty.<br/><br/>The Two Towers, however, has gone a step further. Not only has much been left out, but even more has been changed significantly. Too many changes have been made so that the end result has drifted far from the true story of the LOTR. Aragorn never fell down a cliff...The Ents never refused to fight after the gathering...the King of Rohan was not 'possessed' by Saruman, but was blinded by Wormtongue. Too far has this movie's story strayed from the original. The ring NEVER went to Gondor. Faramir was a honorable man from the start. Whatever happened to the Path of the Dead? Not providing background for a character is understandable, not only due to the fact that the movie has time constrained, but also, it would become too long-winded and boring. But to change the theme and style of an epic story of this history is simple sacrilege in its basest form.<br/><br/>I may be overly hard and unfair, but I can see absolutely no reason that the makers could have had to change these details. If you don't agree with me, it is likely you haven't read the book. My advice...go and read it. It is worthy of more honor and respect than these movies accord it."
"kapali","Null","0","1","18 December 2003"," A sweeping, epic failure --- POSSIBLE SPOILERS
","There is no denying that ""The Two Towers"" is an impressive film, or that it is generally entertaining, but it is deeply flawed as well.  I truly believe this could have been a great film, but because it is burdened with numerous problems it is ultimately a failure.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Tolkien's writings as a child, and reread them with pleasure as an adult, so when the first film came out I excitedly rushed out to see it. On the whole I enjoyed it, although it had some elements that bothered me.  I was especially annoyed by Merry and Pippin's antics.  At the time I was not too worried about the quality of the following movies on account of what I had seen since I knew Merry and Pippin would have to carry a large part of the second movie, and I assumed their characters would have to be made less ""comedic"" for them to do so.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not only are they still annoying, but the character Gimli has also been made to provide comedic relief.  I have no issue with comedy in the context of a serious movie, but the comedy here just was not funny. At one point, for example, unable to see over the battlements behind which he stands, Gimli requests a box to stand on.<br/><br/>Movies and books are different media, and a movie based on a book (or the reverse) can be judged without reference to its source material, and certainly is by those not familiar with the source.  That said, those who are familiar with the book will come to the movie with some expectations of fidelity.  When the director presents material different from that in the book, he should do so because such changes enhance the movie.  When changes would negatively affect the movie, they should not be made.  Many of the changes Jackson does make are of the latter category.  Even without reference to the books, the flaws of the film are glaring.<br/><br/>There is a deliberately archaic feel to much of Tolkien's writing, and Jackson's screenplay largely obliterates this.  He introduces contemporary touches which take away from the mythic qualities of the work, although these touches, no doubt, do render his project more commercially viable. Worse than this, some of the dialogue is just bad, and changes to the screenplay would have made ""The Two Towers"" a better film.<br/><br/>
The introduction of the elves into the Battle of Helm's Deep appears to be motivated largely by a desire to have more elves in the film.  It serves absolutely no other purpose that I can see, and is absolutely contrived. What is more, their marching in order, and turning their heads in unison towards the camera is ludicrous.  I was torn again from a mythic world to a vision of a parade of US Marines with pointed ears.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from poor pacing.  The middle of the movie, revolving around the character of Aragorn, is a mess.  The dream sequences create a tedious morass that should have been edited out.  Even the events leading up to these scenes should have been removed.  They are deliberately manipulative, attempting to create tension about Aragorn's survival, but completely failing to do so.<br/><br/>Even the concluding battle, which has been much praised in the press, left me unstirred.  Ralph Bakshi did a better job at depicting the battle in his 1978 film.  The action is not particularly dramatic, and the repeated attempts at comedy ensure that whatever tension is built up is quickly dissipated.<br/><br/>The end of the film is meandering and pointless.  Although ""The Two Towers"" does not complete the story being told, the dramatic impact of the film's conclusion could have been strengthened.  Instead, the movie just peters out.  Bakshi's film, by contrast, does build up to an impressive denouement. Tighter editing could easily have helped to build a sense of tension which would have made the victory over Saruman more satisfying.<br/><br/>For most viewers, both those familiar with the books and those who are not, ""The Two Towers"" will be a rousing adventure.  The special effects are stunning.  The acting is generally good.  Jackson was perhaps a little too in love with his project, however.  Had the middle of the movie been excised, the end re-edited into a more dramatically compact entity, and some of the dialogue rewritten, he could have produced a great film.  He did not, and we are left with a sweeping, but ultimately unsatisfying epic."
"0rganism","7","0","1","13 November 2003"," Like Gollum/Smeagol, the film has a double nature
","As a fan of Tolkien's books, I had high hopes for this movie, which were partially realized and partially dashed to pieces.  My reaction was torn, I wanted to thank Peter Jackson for his dedication and wack him with a frozen tuna, at the same time.  The film contains its own internal metaphor in the split character of Gollum.<br/><br/>In fact, I'll start by praising Andy Serkis and the CGI team's rendition of Gollum.  That in itself was worth the price of admission.  The supporting actor awards from Saturn, OFCS, and VES were well deserved.  Easy as it might be to find flaws with Jackson's renditions of certain characters or plot elements, Gollum is above reproach and interacts with the Hobbits amazingly well.<br/><br/>Also well done are the short battle scenes twixt Gandalf and the balrog. Gandalf's character is generally well played, and most of the scenes with Gandalf are satisfying.<br/><br/>As a sensory spectacle, everything about this movie is breathtaking.  The cinematographers, costumers, and set designers should be lauded for impeccable work.  The CGI is overdone at points, but perfect in others. I cannot fault the effects.  The sound is solid, and unlike the first film in the series, everything that needs to be heard can be heard.<br/><br/>So where is the split?  Where does it go wrong?  Well, I can't help but feel that Jackson has done a great disservice to Tolkien's original vision, at the same time he does it homage.  Where characters were simply omitted from the Fellowship of the Ring (Bombadil, Goldberry, Old Man Willow, Barrow Wights, etc.), in The Two Towers they are mutilated beyond recognition.<br/><br/>
The worst damage is done to the Ents and Faramir.  The Ents are among the oldest creatures in Middle Earth, valuing cautious deliberation and patience above all else.  In this movie, they are depicted as hasty.  Never would I have thought to see a hasty ent! Not only that, whereas in the books they decide to assist the Rohirrim and depose Saruman through patient deliberation, in this film they are duped into it.  Simply unforgivable.<br/><br/>Faramir, likewise, makes a transition to the screen which transforms his formerly wise and cautious character into one of paranoia and bungling. Rather than the stark contrast with sibling Boromir, we get more of the same.<br/><br/>It would have been easy enough to conceive a script in which these characters stay true to Tolkien's inspired vision without extending it unnecessarily -- indeed, the entire scene at Osgiliath is tacked on via Faramir's distorted character.  These are the real crimes against J.R.R. Tolkien, as I see it.<br/><br/>The matters of the exodus from Edoras, the elven contingent at Helm's Deep, Arwen's interactions with Elrond and Aragorn, these are all reasonable liberties IMHO.  They further character development more-or-less in keeping with the spirit of the original, and may serve in resolving portions of the final film that omissions in the first film complicate (e.g., where will Meriadoc get a blade from the Gondolin Wars, if not from the barrow wight?). It is those added scenes and dialogs which outright destroy perfectly filmable characters that remind me of Melkor's orcish perversion of Iluvatar's elves.<br/><br/>The movie is still enjoyable, and for those who have not read the books or who care little for source integrity, it will likely be excellent.  I give it a 7, overall."

","The special effects are great; the scenery, camera work, sets and costumes are magnificent; & I find no fault with the acting.  <br/><br/>I can't say that I enjoyed it though.  It would be hard to imagine  more violence.  The battle scene just goes on forever and ever.  I just dread the battle scene in the next one, which is supposed to be even bigger and longer.<br/><br/>In his original works, Tokien manages to create some wonderful lyrical interludes.  The scenes in the forest with the Ents were just delightful in the book, but they are cut short here, much to the movie's detriment, while the battle for Helm's Deep is stretched out.  This was the wrong choice.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some other bizarre changes in the plot, as noted by some of the other reviewers.<br/><br/>The orcs are just hideous, which they should be, of course.  You do see the courage it takes to fight them.  It does make me a bit sad, though, that they look so much like burn victims.  I think burn victims are stigmatized enough, without being seen as looking like orcs.<br/><br/>I saw this one on DVD.  There was a whole extra disc with documentaries about the movie, trailers, and even a short directed by Sean Astin (Samwise), showing some of the people whose faces you don't get to see in the main movie, particularly the woman who doubles for the short scenes and the man who doubles for the tall scenes.  It was cool that Sean had the idea of letting us see their faces, while mostly we see their backs. <br/><br/>
In the features, somehow Dominic Monaghan (Merry) and Billy Boyd (Pippin) seem more like Hobbits off screen than on.  This is due to the directorial decisions to focus on the violent parts, rather than the interludes.  It's a pity.  These two are absolutely fabulous, natural Hobbits who could have given this film some very welcome comic relief.<br/><br/>Still, I guess I'll see the third one.  I suppose it's too late to plead with the director to shorten up that final battle.  Shiver.  It's bound to be horrible."

"Roy72","Null","0","1","23 September 2003"," It is possible to love both book and film.
","Having read many of the comments people have of the film both here and on theonering.net it seems that a sizable minority of people have problems with Peter Jackson's (PJ) version of the story, and in particular how it changes some of the plot details and character motivations from Tolkien's novel. All of these negative comments seem very sincere particularly the anguish over changes to beloved characters like Faramir, Aragorn and Theoden. I have loved the book since I was twelve years old and have re-read it many times, I followed up by reading the other ""canonical"" Tolkien works of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. The Silmarillion in my opinion is Tolkien's masterpiece and is the most beautiful work of literature I have ever read and affects me very deeply. As such I think I can count myself as a Tolkien devotee and have spent many hours discussing points of the story with others. From other posts you would assume that I loathe and detest these films for their ""heretical and unnecessary"" changes to the story.<br/><br/>WRONG.<br/><br/>Every change PJ has made has been done for a very good reason, taking two of the most contentious changes as an example:- The elves at Helm's deep and the Arwen/Aragorn scenes (inc. her substitution for Glorfindel in film 1). PJ chose to highlight the second relationship as in the main text of the book Arwen was an incredibly peripheral character and her love and motivating force on Aragorn's quest for his Kingdom was relegated to an appendix. I loved the way PJ managed to bring this into the main story and the depiction of Arwen's ultimate fate (as described by her father) was very moving, this depicted one of Tolkien's main themes that all struggle and triumph is tinged with sadness but is never in vain.<br/><br/>The Elves at Helm's Deep was another massive change to the book but again was done for the soundest of reasons, in the book (and again we only find out for certain in the appendices) we know that the Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlorien along with the Dwarves of Erebor fought their own battles with Sauron's armies and thus tied up a good proportion of Sauron's power and indirectly saved Gondor. How exactly was PJ supposed to show this in FotR, TTT or the third film? He was already juggling three plot strands with the broken fellowship and to cut back to Lothlorien or the Lonely Mountain would further confuse the audience not all of whom had read the book. His solution to show the solidarity of the different races was for Haldir to turn up at Helm's Deep and die heroically defending the womenfolk and children of an alien race. Again this was the spirit if not the story of Tolkien.<br/><br/>I was amongst the most petrified of fans to hear that Lord of the Rings was going to get ""the full hollywood treatment"" Peter Jackson deserves all of the plaudits being thrown his way by tackling one of the great unfilmable literary works and doing so with awesome visual style and perhaps one of the best sets of casting ever for an epic film.<br/><br/>I cannot wait for the EE, (I found the FotR EE better than the theatrical release) and the days cannot go fast enough until RotK is released.<br/><br/>For those really puritanical fans of the book I would suggest getting hold of whatever spoilers you can as it makes the films more enjoyable as you are not looking for what is not there but rather at the awesome spectacle in front of you."

","The second film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy literally starts where the last film ended, but provides a slight amount of subtle exposition so that the viewer can remember who the characters are and their mission, but not so much that insults the intelligence of the serious fan. <br/><br/>
Not being a fantasy film fan or a Lord of the Rings fan per se, I felt the same after this film that I did after the first installment.  While the story may not be in my chosen genre, the production of the film is absolutely amazing.  I kept thinking to myself, `Where did this guy come from?'  The other Peter Jackson films I have seen other than the Lord of the Rings were The Frighteners and Heavenly Creatures  both good films, but not remotely in the same category or class as LOTR.  The special effects were jaw dropping, particularly the presentation of Gollum.  I am critical of CGI because it is often done so poorly, but it was hard to believe that his character was not real due to its seamlessness.  Additionally, the spectacular fight scenes and images of thousands of men and beasts alike were astounding.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately I can only really speak of the technical merits because there are so many characters involved in so many different plot lines that I found myself asking the friend I was with, `Now is that the guy who.' And `Oh wait, they were going to.' Constantly.  However, this should in no way be construed as a negative to the film, as it is simply a matter of my general disinterest in the actual plot in favor of the spectacle itself. <br/><br/>
Having said that, I definitely look forward to the final installment, after which I will make a day of it, sit down with all three and have a LOTR marathon:  Best case scenario, I will actually get into the plot.  Worst case scenario, I will experience excellent filmmaking.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","I was somewhat disappointed in The Two Towers.  I felt that the editing was a little choppy resulting in a lack of transition between some scenes.  I hope the extended edition of the DVD will correct this.<br/><br/>And while I can allow for the introduction of certain scenes not found in the Trilogy to maintain the love interest angle, I can see no need to introduce a story line that simply doesn't exist in Tolkien's work. <br/><br/>
The principal example is this: in Tolkien, the elves never showed up at Helm's Deep, and the captain of the elves, Haldir, while he did an exceptional job of dying in the movie, did not die in the battle at Helm's Deep.  The introduction of that into the movie served no useful purpose that I can see.  I could have lived without it, and Peter Jackson should have lived without it.<br/><br/>Another example is when Aragorn went off the cliff during the battle with the Wolf Riders. It can be inferred from Tolkien that a fight with the Wolf Riders could have occurred, because the text is clear about the fact that some skirmishes did occur on the way to Helm's Deep.  But Tolkien goes out of his way to indicate that the encounters were minor. They were of the ""hit-n-run"" variety.  Still, I can live with the movie presentation.  But Aragorn did not go off that cliff; he did not float down stream; and he did not reappear.  That part of the movie can only serve as a possible introduction to a second love interest, and a conflict in Aragorn's mind over his future.  If that was the intent, it was poorly done.<br/><br/>But my major complaint with this movie is the shabby treatment given to Faramir.  He was an honorable man in Tolkien.  He was able to do what his brother was not able to do.  He knew the Ring of Power was within his grasp, but he never saw it.  Indeed, he did not want to see it.  And he let Frodo go.  He did not drag him off to present him as a gift, and Frodo never stood on that wall and faced the Ringwraith.  Putting this into the movie was an unjustified modification of Tolkien's work.  It served no purpose other than to add perhaps 5 minutes to the running time of the flick.  That is a poor excuse for doing such a hatchet job on a man's work.  Unforgivable!<br/><br/>All of this leaves me with some doubt about how Jackson will handle Part III of the Trilogy.  Does he have the nerve to do it right and do it completely? We shall see.<br/><br/>Mr. Jackson, you have an unprecedented opportunity here.  Please don't waste it.  This could be YOUR magnum opus."

That was precisely the result. Things such as plot and character basis were set aside for the endless tirade of effects and action sequences. In spite of everyone's devotion to staying ""true to Tolkien"" these movies have become a foreign entity. I am aware of the necessities of change when adapting a work of literature to film. However, any tale told by a competent story-teller is worth the hearing. Even one that little resembles the quest so many remember. Peter Jackson is not that competent story-teller. I found the film to be boring and gaudy. It was inundated with shallow moments of ""heroism"" like so many mismatched beads on a string. It was so completely banal and dull, so completely ill-paced, so completely determined to be a slide show of computer shots set to music, that I am completely discouraged from wasting my time or money to see Return of the King.

I came to this sight to get a decent review on this film (which i found) and i was horrified by the biased and single-minded comments made by some users. Now..first of all this IS a Film..Movie etc...NOT A BOOK!!! Yes it was based on a very well written and well loved trilogy but the book is the book and the film is the film...they r not intertwineable or in any way to be confused. Fans of the book complained over and over about the lack of people or situations from the book in the movie. For one...you only have so much screen time u can use...how many book fans want to sit through a 4 or 5 hour part of a trilogy?? when u read a book...what takes a few words to describe can take a huge amount of screen time to portray...So of course not all will be included in the film. I mean really..look at titanic...it was based on the actual even but was there a huge love story playing out on board while the boat sank?? No. But without that part...the movie would have never been as well loved and accepted and never become the great piece of filmaking it has. As far as the cgi graphics used in them movie..well some of the comments used on that subject were just stupid (no offense). I remember reading one person say that they would have rather have seen a puppet or an actor in a suit play golem...that it would have been more realistic. For one...how many golems do u know?? None same here..lol.. So why complain about realism to something that doesnt exist? Its suppose to be unreal...bigger and more fantastic than life...not a part of it. As far as the puppet comment...how ""real"" did the fraggles look...or the muppets?? Come on now.lol. Personally as one who knows how much of a pain computer programming can be..the job they did was outstanding(i have seen all behind the scenes shows :-) )The amount of work it must have taken to come up with the technology to take 100,000 seperate creatures and give each of them a mind of there own and have them act as seperate entities..must have been mind-boggling..they could have easily gave us another mass of mindless drones acting and moving in a military like fashion of follow the leader.

"Cadriel","4","0","1","14 August 2003"," Is it really The Two Towers?
","Peter Jackson's film The Two Towers encapsulates a heavily edited and modified version of parts of Book III and Book IV of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, which are normally published as The Two Towers (following the original printings).  Indeed, there are many places in the second entry where it only bears a superficial resemblance to the source material.  But that, in and of itself, does not automatically condemn a film.<br/><br/>The problems with Peter Jackson's The Two Towers are many.  Aside from the lackluster direction that action fans are depressingly willing to look away from, and the eminently forgettable score, most of them lie in the telling of the story.<br/><br/>Jackson cross-cuts between three different stories in his course; at most, Tolkien only ever did with two.  Unfortunately, these stories are not at all similar in tone, and there are points in the major battle sequence where we cut away to rather tranquil scenes.  He already had enough difficulty creating anything of a pace or a mood in his subpar Fellowship of the Ring; with The Two Towers he simply falls flat on his face.  It is understandable that Tolkien's generally more leisurely step was not well suited for transition to the screen; unfortunately, I don't think the problem was solved even quasi-adequately.  Jackson's storytelling skills are highly overrated by fans who have read the books, and I think that on their own the films don't tell the story well enough for any subtleties to be grasped.<br/><br/>Worse than this are Jackson's rewrites to the story.  I'm not approaching this from a ""How dare he rewrite a classic!"" aspect, mind you.  What upsets me are the way that he alters plot elements and turns them into banal cliches.  Theoden's possession, Aragorn's near-death experience, Faramir's temptation, the Elves at Helm's Deep (it was clear that, until the battles in Book V, it was all Men making their stand and not the other peoples of Middle-Earth), the insultingly insipid ""Gandalf arrives with cavalry"" (why not just have him descend from the Heavens and wipe out the Orcs with a mighty blast of magic?)...not just alterations, but blatant and frankly boring elements that have been done a hundred times before.  I could have accepted plot changes if they had made the story better, or even if they had been adequate replacements that worked for a superior filmic pacing, but these are just plain awful and make the resulting film worse.  And there were large swaths of material lost in favor of this waffle, which only adds insult to injury.<br/><br/>Characters are changed without needing to be; again, the result is always worse.  The Faramir depicted in the film, for instance, doesn't serve any real purpose as he did in the book.  Most actually seem less three-dimensional here than either in the novel or in the first film, which is quite an accomplishment.  To put in something of a positive word, Gollum was a technical achievement (though when I saw it in the theatres twice, audiences laughed - not an effect that seems intended by the source material).<br/><br/>Nothing in this mess improved on the source material or even came close to matching it.  As a film, it's a passable entertainment if you can overlook the severe pacing issues; as an adaptation it's a miserable failure."
"Patchwork_Giant","5","0","5","4 July 2003"," Not as compelling as 'Fellowship'
","Being a fan of the novels since I read them in 1998, I was doubtful when it was announced they were being made into a trilogy of movies.  I didn't know if the books could be done justice on the big screen. When The Fellowship of the Ring first came out, I was awestruck.  It was a breathtaking blend of fantasy, drama and action.  I actually felt for these characters as they played out the history of Middle-Earth, and it's been a long time since any film moved me emotionally.  I saw it eight times in theaters, each time noticing new details and nuances.  Changes from the book were irrelevant; alterations were inevitable and the changes that were wrought did not detract from the experience, and added to the overall aesthetic of the film. I couldn't have been happier.<br/><br/>When The Two Towers came out a year later, I could hardly be restrained from seeing it as soon as possible.  Any thought that the movie wouldn't be as good as Fellowship didn't cross my mind; I had been spoiled, so to speak, by the first film.  I came out of the theater that night disappointed at what I had seen.  I was sure it was Lord of the Rings, but it had lost something. I watched Fellowship again, and contrasted the two films; there was something different.  The characters were superficially the same, the action and cinematography similar, but there was something the first film had that the second did not; a spark, a feeling, a certain virility, that seemed to bring it to life, as if what was happening on the screen became somehow possible in real life.  When I looked back to the second film, I was emotionally unengaged, intellectually cynical.  I could not gain the suspension of disbelief that was so easy sitting through the first film. Their plight was too artificially produced and dealt with, their motivations unsatisfactory.  The way the characters acted and interacted was melodramatic and unbelievable.  I just didn't care about any of it anymore.<br/><br/>This movie is comparable to films like Return of the Jedi or The Matrix: Reloaded.  Sort of the same as the others, but not nearly as good, in a big way.  I can only hope a better job is done with Return of the King."

And this movie? Even my two year old had a problem digesting it...and she couldn't even understand the plot! Culminate this with some scary ents, and well, you have the idea. This is definitely not Bedknobs and Broomsticks. Shortly after its theatrical release I noticed a good number of children in my apartment building going to school with rings around their necks and imitating Gollum. Innocent enough, sure, but WHAT ELSE ARE THEY COPYING AT RECESS, huh? You can't tell me they aren't viciously beating the bejesus out of one another!

"Skeptic459","7","0","1","3 June 2003"," The all male 'Mardi Gra' of the Ring!
","Ya know when I was 11, I was beaten senseless on a regular basis. Bullied beyond belief! Granted there were mitigating circumstances that lead to my brutalization at the hands of young sadists. I had 'uncool' clothes with patches so big and colorful that I looked like a circus performer. I also only showered if I was forced to and spent most of my days covered in mud. My tastes also haunted me. I loved jet fighters, fantasy novels and dungeons and dragons. People like me know that only one thing can come from LOTR, social exclusion. So its funny, have you noticed how geek-dum is coming to Hollywood?  Quite possibly you have. In fact they have taken William Randolph Hearst's place as the chief inhalers of cocaine and the grand administrators of all Hollywood orgies. Remember 'Eyes Wide Shut?' Those were all comic book and fantasy freaks! Did you notice the masks and the role playing? Kubrick was actually exposing these people! Whats even freakier is that the marketing exec's are right there with them, chanting. This is because these films have so many marketable goods.<br/><br/>I could have easily hated this film. Anything with Elves and trees that walk and talk is deserving of contempt. Tolkiens novel is also known for its asexuality and repressed homosexuality. How very English! Yet somehow this film works, like Fellowship did. Yes the characters are very cheesy. The viewer does wonder what Sam and Frodo are doing in the bushes when the camera is not on them, perhaps a secret wedding? There was one in Attack of the Clones! Also Aragorn is such a cardboard cut out of a 'hero' that he belongs in the same Parthenon of hero's as Mr T and Shatners infamous Captain Kirk. Aragorn and Legolas, Sam and Frodo. So many cute couples. Lords of each others rings. Thats why I think they threw in some love interests because otherwise...this isn't a fellowship of the ring but a Mardi Gra of the ring. Many people I talk to complain about the issues of lack of depth in the characters. However as I have said, I don't think it is Jacksons fault. I think these flaws go back to the original text. But hey, 'cocktails anybody?'<br/><br/>The feminine angle of the film further bugs me when none of the women engage in physical combat! They are forced to look after the kids! Isn't this the 21st century!?! Where the hell was Xena!?! She would have kicked ass! I mean I can't remember the book very well, but didn't women fight? Listen, if you are heavily outnumbered against a bunch of very hungry looking Urak Hai, you would have your wife, daughters and grandmother fighting with pitchforks! The character Eowyn should have had more to kick. She was straight jacketed by the limited role and wasn't let out to kick ass and chew bubble gum! Everyone wants to see sexy chicks kicking ass or mud wrestling.<br/><br/>Basically what Jackson has done is take the best elements of the book and made them cool. Observe Legolas using a shield as a skateboard at the battle of Helms Deep. Jackson has 'Matrixed' LOTR. I am sure if Tolkien saw this, he would roll in his grave, either that or spark up a big fat one. The battle scenes are impressive and they made me think that they must have been extraordinarily difficult to film. Tension is actually built up all through the film and by the time Helms Deep rolls around the viewer is at the edge of their seat. Well at least I was! So many aspects of this film could have been so very cheesy. The Ents could have destroyed the whole film. The Golem could have been the worst thing to hit cinemas since Jar Jar Binks or that guy who played Anakin in Clones...The villains are also well done. They look like the evil dead and speak like Sid Vicious. Orcs and Goblins as punks is a cool idea and harks back to Jacksons classic 'Meet the Feebles.' Also an added bonus is that many stars of a local kiwi soap die in this film. To see 'Lionel' and that other guy die is worth the price of admission alone!<br/><br/>The set designs, costumes and special effects are all excellent. The filmakers deserve an oscar for those aspects. Golem becomes the first computer generated psycho, who is actually well acted and could give Anthony Perkins a run for his money. WETA obviously went nuts on this movie. The effects literally transport you to another world. I was amazed as Jackson has taken the images of the book and what I imagined and transposed them onto the screen. This is how Tolkiens invented world looks and is! For achieving this feat alone the Jackson team deserve much credit. This film is also a great tourist brochure for New Zealand and hopefully many d&d freaks will come here and pretend to be little goblins in the Mines of Moria.<br/><br/>Overall this is a simple film. But it is still a very enjoyable one. The last two points I would like to mention are,<br/><br/>1. Why do Christians watch LOTR and boycott Harry Potter? Two Towers has brutal violence and homicidal maniacs that make Josef Stalin look like Timothy Leary! Potter gets picketed and banned in school libraries! Just because Tolkien is Christian and Potter is not devout, that does not mean Potter is an evil little boy who deflowers virgins. That's not Potter, that's Bill Gates. 2. Why did anyone think any of these films would get Oscars? Other than for special effects. It has Hobbits in it! Did anyone notice that? How can anyone take this film seriously? Although Chicago won oscars and it possessed a singing Richard Gere. Jesus, there is hope for ROTK then.<br/><br/>I give this film 7 extremely horny and angry Urak Hais out of 10. Thats a B."

I am not a fan of role plays, I have not read the books but I have seen Part 1, The Fellowship of the Ring, and I thought it was a good movie. The tricks and the atmosphere were great, but there the plot was also confusing. Perhaps you can't always make a perfect movie out of a book. In this case you need to make sense of so many things at once that it can be quite demanding. I simply don't care enough to learn about the seemingly limitless worlds in which the manifold characters live. Elves, gnomes, fairies, who can keep up with them? I like complexity but not in a fantasy world, but I don't remember when I have seen that on a screen.

As if they were following a script and said ho hum.  When Gandalf fell, there was no emotion.  When another dude died after that I felt nothing.<br/><br/>They failed to correct this in The Two Towers.  And whats worse is that it's all battle scenes.  Only a few characters in this movie.

It doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>Another problem.  Special Effects.  What special effects?  The trees look like they came out of the Neverending Story.

","Let me start off by saying that 'The Two Towers' was definitely worth the Oscar for visual effects. The Golum character is a marvel of the arts and technology. All the visual effects in this movie are better than the first one (where you could even see the wires in the Gandalf-Saruman battle).<br/><br/>Now, I believe that they should make only one LOTR, not a trilogy. Take for instance the complete 'Two Towers'. It could be easily omitted in its entirety, as it doesn't really advance the story any further and frankly I believe that the only thing it offers is the great Golum graphics.<br/><br/>Just because there are three books, doesn't mean that there must be three movies.

It is just a continuation of the first film, although more action makes it less boring -- and harder to follow. And it's surprisingly much more morbid and depressing than the first (although someone pointed out this was par for the second part of a trilogy).<br/><br/>Why people are seeing this over and over again is completely beyond me. The characters are shallow, typical fantasy characters, the plot is inane, and the dialogue is only a bit more intelligent than that in ""Star Wars Episode II."" And, aside from a few of the elves and humans, the characters aren't even that physically attractive.<br/><br/>I think it must be necessary to read the books first in order to care about these movies, and unfortunately, seeing the movies doesn't even make me want to read the books.<br/><br/>Congrats to the ""Lord of the Rings"" team on making a popular blockbuster and apparently a great adaptation of a classic fantasy story, but people should be aware that this is not a great film. It does not belong in the IMDB top 250, and if you didn't like the first one, you are unlikely to like this one either."
"boxman-3","Null","0","1","18 April 2003"," Just as Boring as it is Rewarding
","My countrymen and fellow Americans, I come here not to praise 'Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' but to bury it. I don't know if it's a result of being the bridge between the beginning and end of this saga (taking the role of neglected middle child), or a result of unmet sky-high expectations, but I may be alone here in saying, 'Two Towers' was a huge letdown. I'll try and frame my reasoning as to not be attacked by hairy hobbits and men with point hats and long flowing beards.<br/><br/>1) Story structure. Unlike 'Fellowship of the Ring', where we're introduced to a rich world and have suitable character set-up, the second LOTR film puts almost all our characters on the backburner and gives us an insufferably long subplot involving a king and his brood. The movie peters out an ending and seems to throw its hands in the air saying, ""See ya' a year from now.""<br/><br/>2) Length. This wasn't a problem with the previous film, but man did 'Two Towers' become unbearable as it went. Some described the first film as three hours of walking; well the second could be described as two plus hours of folks hyping a battle and then -- a battle. Seriously, there's a lot of talk about a significant battle . and that's it. An hour could have easily been cut from this. It got to the point where my girlfriend was sprawled across my lap pleading for me to somehow make the movie end.<br/><br/>3) Characterization. So much time is spent doing nothing you think the film would further round the characters? Oh how stupid you would be. Nothing new seems to be drawn from any character, with the exception of the treacherous yet likable Gollum. Several people from 'Fellowship' (Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchette, Hugo Weaving, Ian McKellen) have screen time that amounts to no more than a cameo, so why in the world aren't we getting anything more from our already established heroes? Everyone just looks friggin' bored. As was I.<br/><br/>4) Excessive dwarf jokes.<br/><br/>I re-watched 'Fellowship' and all of the reasons 'Two Towers' suffered were not evident. So what does this tell me? Nothing particularly, except not to see the movie in the theater again. 'Two Towers' is by no means a bad film. The cinematography, production and special effects are all breath-taking and sweeping. I'll still look forward to seeing the next, and last, installment in Peter Jackson's 'Rings' epic, but 'Two Towers' has left a bitter taste of disappointment to linger upon.<br/><br/>B-"

","This movie was a disappointment for me, I am a huge Tolkien fan and I loved the Fellowship movie, but Two Towers has some big flaws that prevented it from being as good as the first in the trilogy...<br/><br/>1. Very americanized, they put alot of cheesy hollywood gimmicks into it, they also obviously added more of Viggo and Orlando, because of the sucess of the previous film.  I found these thing disturbing, and it shamed Tolkien's perfect tale.<br/><br/>2. Bad editing/pacing.  They felt they had to juggle all of the characters more and more throughout the movie, it is very distracting because in the book, Tolkien perfectly went from one group to the next, right when you're getting really excited, so it kept the interest of the reader high.  This was not done in the movie however.<br/><br/>3. MORE changes in the story.  The film's biggest flaw, they changed more of the story, added some lousy scenes into the movie that weren't in the book, and had some bad add-ons also.  This disappointed me because they were pretty good about keeping the movie close to the book in the first movie, what I felt this movie was is a gift to the stupid audiences to make more money.<br/><br/>I just wanted to stress these major flaws because all the reviews I have seen say this movie was great, even better than the Fellowship.<br/><br/>But there are a couple good features in this film, like Gollum is spectacular, I have to take my hat off for the special effects people, because that character was extremely well done.<br/><br/>And I was impresses with Elijah Wood's acting in this movie, he was outshined in the first one, but he really showed his talent in a couple scenes in this one.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say this movie was 7.5/10, but perhaps people would like it if they haven't read the books, and had nothing to compare it to."
"faith_meredith","4","0","3","30 March 2003"," My hopes were probably too high... :(
","I am an immense Tolkien fan, but rather enjoyed Mr. Jackson's last installment of the trilogy despite of this, and so was looking forward tremendously to this movie.  I knew that I would come out of the theater upset, but didn't foresee how just how upset I would be!  It's not just that they didn't stick close to the book.  Making art from someone else's art is a tricky feat, and I completely understand that to make it a true work of art, the director has to make the piece his, and making the piece his includes injecting his own experiences and interpretations to the piece.<br/><br/>It's just that Mr. Jackson had some pretty whacked out interpretations!<br/><br/>For example, Faramir.  In the books, Faramir is supposed to be Boromir's redemption - here he is just a jerk.  This really ticked me off.  And WHAT was up with taking Frodo to Gondor?  (Don't even get me started on Arwen!)<br/><br/>And, as someone has already said, the switches between scenes were sort of distracting.  They lent to a heavily sort of ""soap opera"" feel rather than the epic feel that the books had - and when it comes down to it, that's the major problem of this movie.  It just didn't have the right feel.  I would have enjoyed it enough as a simple fantasy movie if I hadn't already have read the books and reveled in the brilliance of them.  I mean, like I said, it's not that Mr. Jackson made changes.  But I just didn't get the feeling that Mr. Jackson understood in the slightest sense what the actual point of the books IS.  He messed around with the ESSENCE of the story, and that was what really annoyed me.<br/><br/>That Mr. Jackson just doesn't GET the books is evident in two different ways.  One is the subtle shifting of the focus of the books from the melancholy of a dying way of life - the Elves having to leave Middle Earth, the passing of the age - to a sort of celebration of the forging of the way of man.  The second, and most grieving, is that I can't see, as evidenced from this movie, that he really GETS the core of the good/evil conflict.<br/><br/>
I'm not doing a very good job of expressing myself.  Simply put, I guess I'm saying that I thought that the movie could have done with a little more focus on Frodo and his inner battle than on Aragorn and his love troubles. :)<br/><br/>That said, I thought that the scenery was GORGEOUS and there were several moments that I did enjoy - for some strange reason, the moments I found myself liking most were those in which Aragorn and Legolas would start speaking Elvish to each other.  I'm not exactly sure why, but I thought that was extremely cool.  Gollum was at the same time freaky and cool and one of the things that I thought the movie did an excellent job in portraying.<br/><br/>When I left the theater, I was convinced that I never wanted to even hear the third movie mentioned, much less ever darken the door of a theater to see it play.  I'm not sure how I feel now - I'll probably still go, but I'll just go to see a fantasy movie that has some relation to the Lord of the Rings.  I won't go to see Tolkien, because this movie proved that that was an idealistic expectation."

In other words, if you're not into cars (or battle scenes, as is the case of The Two Towers) then this film is kind of pointless.  It supposedly follows Frodo on his trail of adventures, but every single hindrance is a battle of some type.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, films are supposed to be the director and producer's interpretation of a script.  They've made no attempt to interpret anything here.  It's just battle scene after battle scene.<br/><br/>Even the humour attempted is very poor.  There is the play on the dwarf's height, which is over-done, it's stale.  I must say that, for a film that's serious, the humorous moments should have been a lot funnier.  I'm not expecting belly laughs all the way, but something to at least make me laugh a bit would have been nice.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm sure the whole world and his dog will go and see this film.  For those of you want to be adventurous, try a different film instead.  Try ""Ring"" (or ""Ringu"" as it's transliterated from the Japanese) which has far more suspense than this pile of cr*p.<br/><br/>All in all, a waste of time of a film, except for Lord of the Rings fanatics and those who really don't know what the genre of film is supposed to be about."

At least to me it was as if Peter Jackson had copied the fantasies I had about the surroundings, the characters etc. Sure, I missed Tom Bombadill, and I missed out on some of the things that wasnt there, but atleast there wasnt really anything added (except the fact that Arwen rescues Frodo instead of Glorfindel, but that was something I could live with.) So ofcourse my expectations were high when I went to see TTT, and yes, the MOVIE was as good as the first one, but the story according to the book was lousy. I can live with the fact that they had to exclude some parts of the book that were too hard to use in amovie, but what I dont like is that they've added alot of scenes that was totally inadequate, such as, why did the elves go to Helms Hold? Why did Faramir bring Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath? Why didnt we get to meet the female spider-monster in the end? Why? Why? Why? There are also some general flaws, such as the fact that Legolas refuses to use a saddle...<br/><br/>Altogether its a great movie, but lousy compared to the first one, it doesnt give me the same feeling of well-being as FOTR did.

Saruman and Wormtongue's role made much less visable.  No Huorns. No Grisnak.  No thrown palintir. What's going on here?<br/><br/>Yes, it is Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, no longer Tolkien's.  That fact has made me very sad.  And where I saw the first film numerous times, this I've seen twice - can not recommend it to anyone - and can see it no more.  It is a shame that a project so well started, could not be continued.<br/><br/>Perhaps Peter Jackson could not find enough in the 2nd book to hold his interest, so he made up his own story.  It's not enough that the story truly belongs to Aragorn - but we have to be hit over the head, repeatedly, to let us know Aragorn is the hero.  It's not enough for Frodo to struggle admirably.  He has to be turned to ""the dark side"".  It's not enough for Gollum to be villaneous.

","Peter Jackson's films worked best when they didn't take themselves seriously at all (as in the case of BRAINDEAD or MEET THE FEEBLES).  His trilogy so far is indeed very well shot and edited (though each film so far could easily afford to cut at least an hour away), but the big mistake here is that the films keep wavering back and forth from silly stuff to graveyard stoicism.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are overinflated CGI extravaganzas with lots to look at but nothing really interesting.  I kept thinking of the film WATERLOO (the 1970 Sergei Bondarchuk version) and realized that the battle scenes in that 33-year-old film were actually better-filmed, more believable, and more enjoyable than here, where everything is fake - and definitely looks it. The music is unmemorable, as are the bland actors (except for the underused Brad Dourif and Christopher Lee of course, but these days the real talent is slowly getting replaced by the likes of ""Viggo Mortensen"" and ""Liv Tyler"") - but I digress.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna stand on a soap box all night and rant about how silly this movie is and how the Tolkien and AD&D fans (and I used to be one myself) will eat up every minute of this.  However, I have to point out that it runs far too long, and the action sequences seem to just come and go without adding to the story in the least, just filler.  Basically, all the characters are in the same situation at the end that they were at the beginning of the film... the whole movie is filler.<br/><br/>I actually preferred the animated 1978 Bakshi version, in that it was much better paced and felt more stylized and less like a big cash cow.  It's too bad that Bakshi never was able to finish his film, but then again he had about the same budget to make his film that the LOTR trilogy spent on wigs. That film actually had heart.<br/><br/>In spite of the fact it was merely made to cash in on all the nerd-money not yet spent on computer games and ""Warhammer 40k"" pewter models, this film will probably sweep the Oscars... which in my opinion is truly sad, considering there were probably thousands of better movies made this year - but so few were widely seen."

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>Luckily,for all you discerning movie-goers out there,Davideo (as you know) sees every piece of cinematic work for what it is.And so let me summarise my thoughts on The Two Towers (an astounding title for a film to get away with for a film released after two planes crashed into two certain towers in New York),the inevitable follow-up to the mega-successful (again,hype) Fellowship of the Ring.Well,what can I possibly say?I thought it was overlong,overblown,pretentious and took itself far too seriously.It was even less enjoyable than the first,which I found to be a major disappointment after all the rave reviews and mass publicity.I mean,I think it says it all when the greatest enjoyment I can honestly say I really derived from it was when,in the over-crowded cinema auditorium I was sitting in,two berks sitting next to me who sounded like they'd just inhaled a mass-amount of the whacky-backy,kept shouting out funny remarks whenever a serious or tense moment was coming up.At one particular moment,I really had to bite my lower lip to keep from really exploding with laughter.Normally,I would almost definitely have beared some inner-grudge against them for being inconsiderate of other movie patrons who'd payed good,hard-earned money to watch the film without any interruptions,but I considered this film to be stuck so far up it's own ass,to be honest,and I'm a little ashamed to admit this....I felt more like cheering them on.I mean,COME ON PEOPLE!!!This is a film in which some of the main characters are a bunch of walking ,talking trees (I guess you could call them really 'wooden' actors) and yet we're all going on as if it were Citizen Kane or something!?!I know there are many fans of the books out there who'd eagerly anticipated the release of the movies for a long time,but please!This type of film is this type of film,and it shouldn't get delusions of grandeur and try to be some sort of Lawrence of Arabia style epic.The frankly unbearable length is made even more patronising by all the actors turning in Shakespeare aspiring performances,especially with such atrocious,unmemorable dialogue.Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Great/White? (whatever) is one such actor,but considering how much his appearance in the film was promoted,it's really amazing how little screen time he occupies.Elijah Wood,Viggo Mortensen and Liv Tyler all turn in standard performances in what I considered standard roles.People go on about how funny some of the Klingon-like,rubber-faced characters in Star Trek look,but check out some of the ugly critters in this movie.They're a hoot.On the plus front,I suppose the end battle scene is relatively impressive,but overall,I at least for one can see how these meandering,self-important tales were concocted by some bored working bloke in Moseley in the late 19th century who couldn't seem to find anything better to do with his spare time other than stare down a well.**"
"galensaysyes","8","0","1","24 January 2003"," Bad director, good movie
","Peter Jackson hasn't the first idea--or perhaps has only the first idea--of how to tell a story in a movie. A character points to a ringwraith and says, 'Look, a ringwraith!'; cut to the ringwraith. In general, that's the extent of Jackson's skill in visual narrative. Also, lacking a sense of story, he lacks a sense of myth, which is one of the two things that Lord of the Rings is. (The other is invented history, which he does get.) <br/><br/>Jackson is an enthusiastic but unbridled filmmaker. Sometimes his shots cut together, sometimes not, and have to be glued together with loud music; sometimes his scenes are modulated in proportion to the whole, sometimes not, but you don't notice for all the noise. <br/><br/>However, out of an obvious affection for the books, a sense of drama and epic, a goodish script, a mostly good cast, a good crew, a bunch of computer equipment, and all the money in the world, he has managed to cobble together a pair (so far) of classic fantasies, according to movie standards. They would be better viewed in half-hour installments, and, their huge lush landscapes notwithstanding, could do with a lot more fresh air. But they're as good as--and better than--one could sensibly expect.<br/><br/>The second film improves on the first--slows up a bit, steers away from the faux 3-D effects, and allows space for some finer and subtler things to emerge: splendid performances in the roles of Eowyn and Faramir, a depth of feeling in the characterization of Gollum, and moments of real visual poetry. But strangely, it's much less like the book, despite its fidelity to details of name and incident and setting. <br/><br/>However, the most obvious ways in which Two Towers departs from the book were apparent in Fellowship, too. The books are all story and no drama; the films are just the opposite. The books leave an impression of clearness: clear air, clear water, clear thought; the films are filled with drive, grit, and ceaseless motion--rather like the factory of Isengard, and most unlike the cloister of Lorien. <br/><br/>But I'll probably go to see this one a third time, anyway."
"georgereaganbush","5","0","1","16 January 2003"," Very Gross at times
","This movie was surprisingly gross at times.  The scene when they are breaking 2 little rabbits backs is nasty.  Another one the disgusting Golum slaps fish on rocks.  The scene with a stack of burning bodies is disgusting and the director keeps showing the scene over and over.  Most directors show something uncomfortable and move on.  This one keeps pounding uncomfortable shots over and over again.<br/><br/>This film is not for young kids though Lord toys are surely marketed to them.  Golum is terrible to look at and creepy to hear talk over and over again.  He is an almost Holocaust type image that hurts the film.   The film is far more brutal and dark than the first.  Nothing really draws the audience in and it can be confusing and revulsion is too common here.<br/><br/>In conclusion, though, the final hour is good with a lot of intensity in the battle scenes.  The last hour makes the film worth seeing.  I liked the first film better over all but these battle scenes were excellent in the final hour but it did cut away from them too often."

","I loved most of this film. The problem is, for every 3 minutes I loved, there was a minute I hated. One of the strengths of ""Fellowship"" was that it while it stayed true to the spirit of the book, it made some very smart choices about which scenes to delete or change, which translated into a better movie.  ""Two Towers"" fails to live up to its predecessor in this respect. Many of its changes didn't add anything to the story and, worse yet, took something away from it."
"cinematographe","6","0","1","9 January 2003"," So I finally go to see it...
","MILD SPOILERS<br/><br/>It was good for what most people expect, which would be a visual representation of what the book had. Good job Hollywood, but...<br/><br/>It was horrible as a film, because it didn't build on any idea or theme, it just dictated. There were a good three or four scenes where all it consisted of was Sam, Aragorn, or whoever talking about how not to give up hope, how hope was something good in the world. One scene would've been enough, but we since Sam said it to Frodo, we needed Aragorn to say it to some little kid, and then we needed Arwen to tell her father the message of hope because the Elves weren't anywhere near Sam or Aragon to have gottent he message. The audience, regretfully, is present at all three. Plus the scene where Aragorn instills his hope speech to Theoden.<br/><br/>I think what the movie shows is that Hollywood is still willing to spend a lot of money to get something right, which is something a vile place like Hollywood should be applauded for, but what the movie also shows is that Peter Jackson has a great imagination, but he's a poor director.<br/><br/>Every other one of his movies have been directorial/screenwriting failures, but have had wonderful conceptual ideas with them. But while I was watching the movie I could care less about what happens to any of the men, and half an hour in I could care less what happens to Frodo.<br/><br/>And when I thought about it, it just came down to the acting. The acting seems as if the actors were still discovering who the characters were because they had no force given to them by the director. It seems that's how all his movies are, very flat characters. The characters are great in Tolkien's books. And indeed, the actors provide those actions and mannerisms in the movie, but there's nothing else. Elijah Wood curling his eyebrows, and Viggo Mortensen making his pouty faces isn't giving them any depth. Maybe Wood can get away with it as a Hobbit, but not a single human in that picture can. Ian McKellan and Christopher Lee give the best performances, from their mannerisms to subtle changes in their face, and it is only because they have been acting so long, they can compensate for a poor director, all great actors can.<br/><br/>The poor acting direction is compounded by the moments Jackson chooses to include in the picture. There were atleast ten times that Jackson cut to scenes of women crying and whining, as if that is the only reaction human women can muster up. One was enough, and about the only one that didn't look like complete whining was the one where the mother was trying to hold on to her soon as he was recruited for the battle at Helmsdeep. He also dramatizes events that people who have never read LOTR would know are just plot points. My mother who could care less about Tolkien knew that Aragon didn't die because he COULDN'T die, he's the one of the main characters for christ's sake. And yet Jackson spends about five minutes showing the sad reaction of the characters. Legolas is sad, Grimli is sad, Theoden is sad, then the very next scene is them arriving at Helmsdeep where we see: Grimli is sad, Eowyn is sad, Legolas is sad, Theoden is sad. If not annoying, at the least it's poor scene construction. And the fact is it's poor scene construction from a director/editor point of view because if you looked at the screenplay it works fine.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing is how I could care less how many elves, humans, or orcs died in the Helmsdeep, but welled up with tears when Treebeard saw the forest of Isengard destroyed. When he said ""They were my friends"" it was devastating. And Peter Jackson did a marvelous job with that. But if a CGI creature from his imagination gets more emotion out of the audience than the humans and hobbits, there's something wrong there with how the director is building up the scenes.<br/><br/>
I liked the movie like I said, and a lot of the things said about character development and such is true, Gollum and Treebeard are the only interesting characters in the whole thing. I think it took a lot of balls for Peter Jackson to shoot all three movies at once with seven units, and even more balls to think that he could bring Tolkien's vision to the screen. He succeeded wonderfully at it, but failed in heft and emotion of the film as a film itself.<br/><br/>They should have Jackson be the ""Master Director"" and then had another director to just work with the actors, rehearsing them and finding the pieces for a great performance. Even directors like Jeunet know their weaknesses (his lack of mise en scene) and so he got Marc Caro to do the mise en scene for him while he worked with the actors.<br/><br/>
Oh well. It's only a movie, and they'll probably be more LOTR movies made, just as there have been made in the past."

Joe Dirt was a rare spectacle to behold, a movie which could actually decrease ones intelligence and had the overall humor value of a public abortion. The Two Towers although lacking in Joe Dirt's humor extraculations, disgraced the image of American cinema with a 3 hour bombardment of homosexual midgets, talking trees with beards and a 40 minute feud between a group of dirty hippies and Rosie O'Donnell look-a-likes whose battle plans were written by Barnie the Purple Dinosaur."

","I have never seen a movie this disappointing since The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I have defended the first Lord of the Rings against Harry Potter's fan, against people who don't believe in To Be Continued in movies, or people who just hate the fact that the first movie starts out with blank black screen for almost one full minute. I love the first movie to death.<br/><br/>Don't think that I expected too much out of the Two Towers. I expected so little and they gave me even less. The fact that the movie is long is never a problem with me. However, why is the Two Towers long? Can it be that the director keep focusing on mountain range, and sky? Why? We know that mountain and sky existed, we saw them before. If it's a little, may be I can understand. But it's sad when I feel that I can show all the story element in one hour when the movie took three without a reason to.<br/><br/>One of the thing I hate the most about the movie contain a tiny little spoiler that won't ruin any big surprise. The King lost his son and said that a parent should never have to bury his child. How cute. Yet at the battle, they have children fighting the war against Saruman's army. How does that make sense? Little boys (as young as 10 from the look of it) can fight war better than Grown Woman who hid cowardly in the cave? That's  insulting to both the male and female gender. It's a very sensitive subject, so why tackle it when the book didn't have anything about that on it.<br/><br/>
The movie turn from something that is deep and look like a classic in the making (the Fellow Ship of the Rings) to something that is boring, long, and senseless. Oh, and the Gollum. The so-called most realistic CG animated character ever. I think he was pretty cool at first. But there is one scene where he was talking to his other self. Instead of showing the two version of him, they keep switching the camera and only have one Gollum on screen at the time. What was that about? I thought this thing was make by computers, why not just make two of them or have it talk to its reflection or something? I feel that I am very fair for giving this movie a low score."

"Mandrew-2","10","0","1","3 January 2003"," Peter Jackson may be the gutsiest director of all time...
","I've been reading a book entitled ""The Making of The Lord of the Rings"" which details the processes involved in completing the three movies of such epic scale.  Seriously, just one of these films would be the pinnacle for many directors, but Peter Jackson has done the ""impossible"" and created at least two movies that will go down in history as a couple of the most ambitious and titanic fantasy adaptions ever made.  I only know a little of what to expect in December 2003, but if the previous two films are any indication it will be a grand spectacle.<br/><br/>I've seen the Two Towers in theaters three times so far, giving it the most in-theater replay value of any movie in my history.  The reasons I keep coming back are several...epic battle scenes, whether they take place in ancient Rome, on the battlefields of Vietnam or France or in medievel England are something that have taken over movies of the last few years - The Two Towers creates the longest and greatest battle I've ever seen on film, an hour passes like minutes as we watch Helm's Deep almost fall then rise and conquer.  Strong characters like Viggio Mortensen's Aragorn and the amazing CGI Gollum made me want to see their performances again and again.<br/><br/>
There were a few Hollywood moments that I didn't remember seeing in FOTR and that I could've done without - Legolas riding the shield down the staircase at Helm's Deep and the comic ""relief"" of Gimili.  These small moments taint an otherwise seemless movie, but not enough to lessen its 10 star rating in my eyes.<br/><br/>It was such an amazing undertaking, such a dedicated work and such a risky endevour - these movies could have failed miserably had Mr. Jackson not been 100% dedicated to perfection and details within these films.  Reading the ""Making Of..."" book, I realized even more that we are watching history unfolding and massive standards being set for future films of this and all other genres."

"dust-7","Null","0","6","30 December 2002"," Clumsy direction - but worth the ticket price
","A popular film. Almost 1000 imdb.com comments within the first two weeks. Sellout crowds at the theaters. However, as with the first part of the trilogy, Jackson is clumsy in his direction. The movie drags at times, and comes together in strange, disconnected ways - so unlike Tolkien's novel. It's been said that the film is boring. It's been said this is because Tolkien was boring. No one who has ever tried to read just one page of Lord of The Rings could believe that. Tolkien's casual style insists on telling a story, drawing one instantly into that world, and not calling attention to the novelist writing his novel (or the filmmaker calling attention to the beauty that is New Zealand, rather than the story of Middle Earth). Tolkien isn't to blame. Jackson is. This movie required a great director, with craft and a vision to work with. Had Jackson really paid his dues to direct Lord of the Rings?<br/><br/>Editing could help Twin Towers and a few flybys could be scrapped entirely. The film would move faster and flow better. The much maligned Bakshi cartoon of the 1970s, while weak on effects and hired extras, certainly makes the Jackson films seem plodding and leaden, by comparison. Bakshi was on pace to tell the entire Lord of The Rings in under four hours, not nine, had his money held out. The ideal Lord of The Rings movie, in other words, would take the pacing of Bakshi's telling, or more to the point, Tolkien's, the effects of the 21st century and Jackson, etc., and stick more faithfully to the plotlines and story Tolkien developed, as well. Those were well thought out.<br/><br/>The flybys suggest something else, as well. A disconnect. The audience isn't shoulder to shoulder with the characters, as in Bakshi's version. We are not running along, or fighting the fights. The audience is watching. The shots are wide shots. It's not an adventure - but an arena. There aren't story arcs, and subplots. There aren't characters, consistent in some ways, and changing in others. There are simply contests, and comic relief between the next show or bout. It's not that much of an exaggeration to compare Jackson's version of Tolkien's classic to Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Entertainment.<br/><br/>Given the rewrite, then, of Tolkien's novel, by Jackson, and the emphasis in a George Lucas world much more on special effects than anything else, how did Jackson do? In my opinion, the Gollum was well done, but somehow cold, and mechanical. I know this has gotten rave reviews. But something was missing that you had in the snippets of Bakshi, by comparison. His Gollum, as a film version, even if a rotoscope, was more engaging. Jackson's approach of Saruman's army was impressive, as was the Battle at Helm's Deep (something Bakshi couldn't hope to rival with what he had). I did miss those magical mortars of Saruman, though. I thought that was what breached the wall in the book. The conclusion of Eomer's ride with Gandolph the White was cut short, I think, considering how much time was spent on the points of the battle beforehand. All of a sudden, it just ended, and Saruman had been defeated. But the charge down the hill was very impressive, as well, even if a whole bunch of the original '10,000' had disappeared (shades of Bakshi).<br/><br/>One could argue about Fanghorn, as well. I believe it was called bright, and interesting, in the book. In Jackson's view, it was forever forboding and decrepit. One of the ents seemed geared for the funny papers. But generally I thought the Ents were well done. On the other hand, the inclusion of the elves at Helm's Deep seemed gratuitous. They didn't change the outcome. The Rohanim still rode to the rescue. There were just a bunch of dead of elves to show in the gloom. I didn't understand the point of any of that. And Tolkien wouldn't have, either. Show the 'fires of Isengard', instead. Spend the scripting, and the money, on that. Jackson is not Tolkien. Jackson didn't write Lord of the Rings. Maybe as something of a hack, by comparison, the man is jealous of Tolkien. But that doesn't change anything.<br/><br/>Again, the question is whether Jackson is fit or qualified to direct an epic like Lord of the Rings. I think Bakshi did far better, with a paltry few resources by comparison. Speilberg, perhaps. Others. You don't know. But sticking to the book is probably something new for Hollywood. This is a case where they should have done so, and tried to understand Tolkien rather than impart their own dim sense of things onto a work adapted, at best.<br/><br/>Still, for being boring, and a misstep, and an exercise in the pride of someone who thought he was Tolkien, but wasn't, there's still a lot to appreciate in the film. It is certainly worth a matinee price, even at six dollars, or so. It's worth that. On the other hand, the huge Christmas/New Year's sellout crowds, which doubled the gross compared to FotR, might only encourage more of this sort of treatment of the classics, rather than something with today's f/x, but perhaps yesterday's more profoundly human and interesting filmmaking. If only someone could be found to put those two together, and then attempt something like - The Lord of the Rings."

","The Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) was a great film. Far superior to those dull films about a galaxy far away. Expectations were high for the second film in the trilogy and The Two Towers (TTT) almost made it. Perhaps the battle at Helm's Deep went on a touch too long and uncanonical scenes like Aragorn being lost were unneccessary but these are only minor flaws in an engrossing three hours. There was much to praise. <br/><br/>Part of the success of TTT depends upon the Gollum as he is now a key character in the story and as other people have said, you forget that the character is a CGI. It is extraordinary. The interplay between Gollum and Frodo and Sam is brilliant, not just physically but emotionally. If Gollum had been another JarJar Binks it would have been disastrous but he is a real character, at war with himself. <br/><br/>The acting varies from mock-epic to perfect. Elijah Wood makes Frodo's pain so tangible that you feel every difficult step in his journey. Sean Astin's speech near the end about finding good in the world made my eyes moist. Viggo Mortensen is better in TTT than FOTR. Liv Tyler looks the part. Bernard Hill is Theoden come to life. And Miranda Otto is my kind of shield maiden.<br/><br/>The production values are wonderful as ever and if it is eye candy it is of the superior kind. Well done Peter Jackson and team. My only real complaint is that we have to wait another dratted year for the third part."
"marshall89","10","0","1","4 January 2003"," Best movie ever?
","I was in a bit of an unhappy mood when my father and his brothers took my sister and I to go see this. By the time I left the theater my mind was completely devoid of any unhappy thoughts. This was more than just a good movie: It could be the greatest film ever. Now a lot of people are going to disagree with that, but I don't care. This is even better than the first, and considering the fact that the first one is one of the greatest movies of all time, you know that you have a classic right here.<br/><br/>Rather than starting with flashback scenes like in the first, The Two Towers starts with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) having a dream about Gandalf's death during the Fellowship journey. Gandalf's battle with the fire monster while plummeting down into a deep cavern is the perfect climax to start the movie, and it's definitely the right way to pick up where Fellowship left off. But overall, TTT didn't start too well for me. It's great all the way through, but I thought it was overly violent and scary at first, two factors that made me think, ""There's no way this is going to be better than the first one."" The film does, however, get better and better from there on. There are many exciting twists and scenes that will surprise and excite you. The battle in Rohan (Or wherever it was: The place where everyone fled to and hid in the caves) was one of the most riveting cinematic moments I have ever experienced in my entire life. Like the brilliant Star Wars Episode 1, the ending switches between sequences like the tree invasion of Saruman's kingdom, and they're so good that even if you're on the brink of wetting your pants after that huge drink you had, you'll still remain planted in your seat just to see what happens. The scenes in this movie were so tense that I could feel my pulse racing, and when Gimli (John Rhys-Davis), my favorite character, jumped into the storm of invaders, I think I could have passed out. <br/><br/>If what I just said isn't enough to convince you that this is one of the greatest films of all time, then I don't know what to say. This movie has everything and beyond. And if you thought Ian Mckellen was great in the first, wait until he drops your jaw this time. All in all this film is perfect except for Smeagle, who, although proves to be an interesting character, gets pretty annoying and says the word precious too many times. But I'd much rather listen to him all day instead of Moaning Myrtle, the top candidate for most annoying movie character ever. <br/><br/>My rating: 5 out of 5"

","I am a great lover of all things Tolkien.  I have also long been a fan of Peter Jackson.  And this movie is truly spectacular - a genuine epic.  I am 34 years old and I still felt like a wide-eyed kid while watching TTT. The feeling reminded me of the first time I saw Star Wars when I was about 10. In fact, I would say TTT was better.<br/><br/>I have read a number of reviews that have criticised this movie (and FOTR) for not sticking precisely to the books.  Big deal!  Had the movies simply been a page-by-page, visual version of the books, each movie would be a rambling 7-hour mess.  As any good film-maker will tell you, any book that is brought to film needs to be reworked to accommodate the different medium. This is especially true of a work as involved as LOTR.  It is this problem of translation from book to film that has been the undoing of other fantasy movies (eg: Dune).  Bear in mind also that Peter Jackson has made a film for millions of people who have never read any of the books - not just for those lucky enough to have read LOTR (or even The Hobbit).  So yes, TTT the movie is slightly different from TTT the book.  Does that disqualify it as a valid interpretation of Tolkien's work?  Hell NO!!  Be grateful that it was made by a genuine Tolkien fan, and not by some third-rate Hollywood hack.  If you want to get an appreciation of how much time and effort Jackson and his team put into making the film(s), watch the special features on the extended DVD edition.  I doubt there is another director alive who would have invested so much of himself in the project.<br/><br/>Having said all that, what was the movie like?  Amazing!  Better than the first installment, and that is saying something.  Cinematography, sound, music, characterisation, plot development, continuity, special effects (especially Gollum and the battle at Helm's Deep) are all first rate. But similar comments could perhaps be made about Episode II - Attack of the Clones.  Yet TTT is (in my humble opinion) far superior.  So what separates the two?  Soul.  Spirit.  Passion.  I enjoyed Episode II, but I got the feeling Lucas was just going through the motions, pumping out yet another installment.  But TTT has an energy that is palpable, and I believe this is due in part to the dedication of both cast and crew (especially Jackson himself).<br/><br/>More experienced and technical eyes than mine will no doubt find fault with the film for a variety of reasons.  But I give it a strong 10/10!"

But if you click on it, you will see it has a pathetic 3 reviews (it was probably shown on IMAX or something) Anyways, is Lion King anywhere near the best movies of this or any year? Of course not. Hey, I like animated movies too, but Lion King? Come on, gimme a break.<br/><br/>It is quite surprising that no other movie even scored in the eighties. In fact, the next highest rated movies were 8 Mile with Eminem and Punch Drunk Love (have no clue who's in the movie), both with 78. Catch Me If You Can scored 75. Lilo and Stitch scored 76. Solaris and the much ballyhooed Gangs of New York both only scored 70. Those are the ONLY movies in the 70s.<br/><br/>TTT is not just the best movie of the year. It was the best movie BY FAR. I think the stupidity of those who have a low opinion of this epic masterpiece is made even more evident now.  Face it losers.  You're wrong.

"sweezely","4","0","1","27 December 2002"," Despite popular opinion, this is fairly appalling
","I am fairly disgusted at the level of near-godly praise this film has had. While The Fellowship of The Ring was a fairly decent (even better on the extended DVD), this film is actually mostly awful. After the opening explaining more-or-less what happened to Gandalf in his battle with the Balrog, Peter Jackson treats us to 90 minutes of incomprehensible drivel.  The camera swings in his trademark ""sweeping"" shots so much it feels like a spoof of the first film, and then randomly lurches between the three groups of protagonists.  There is little congruence, and the story is not even attempted to be told in any clear fashion.<br/><br/>Then there is the acting, which fails to live up to the standards of the first film.  And the Ents.  Ah, those tree-creatures that I could not visualise when I read the book, their appearance remains a mystery still. They look terrible.  Like the worst kind of stop-motion they do not look natural or tree-like, and they are not even produced very well on screen. They look appalling.  As if to make matters worse, Mr Jackson has insisted on expanding the parts of the elves to give them roles in this film when they were barely even mentioned in the book.  Why, I do not know.<br/><br/>Fortunately the film gets better as we get to the centrepiece: the battle at Helm's Deep.  Yes, this does live up to what you have heard, and will undoubtedly go down as one of the finest cinematic battles to date. Shame that it is intercut with scenes of the ents.<br/><br/>Then, the worst thing about the film: no ending.  The film just seems to stop, and it does so a full SIX chapters before the book.  This is unbelievable.  The Return of The King isn't THAT short a book to warrant getting a third of The Two Towers tacked on the beginning of it.  I really cannot understand the reasoning behind why Peter Jackson expands some parts, but then misses out nearly a third of the book.  And why were Frodo and Sam taken to Gondor?  That never happened in the book either.<br/><br/>I really think Peter Jackson should actually read the books to the end. What's next?  FOUR LOTR films?"

","I'll be brief.  I have not read any of the books, nor have a seen any of the television previews for this movie, so this was the first time I quite literally was at the edge of my seat!  This movie rocked!  My favourite part was when the ents finally assaulted Eisenguard, broke the dam, and watching all of Saruman's minions, and thus his dream of conquest, flush down the drain.  The look of his face made me smile.  I had no idea about the outcome of the battle of Helms Deep.  In fact, I thought they were going to loose! After all, the track record about winning and losing in this series is fairly balanced.  This was a true feel good movie, with a moral that even if there is few good in this world, it is worth fighting for.<br/><br/>Also, with all the readers complaining how Peter Jackson hasn't kept to the book, remember that he is there to film a movie, not film a book.  Why can't you critique the movie on its own?"

The ""Go Against the Grain"" nerds.  This group is a little bit different. It's more of a ""Pfffft, this is the most popular movie right now, and I need to be different"".  The average amount of dvds owned by the average individual in this group of people is probably around 300+.<br/><br/>Basically, what I'm trying to get to is: this is a great movie.  Maybe it's not the best movie ever, but for gods sake, it's not the worst.  So anyone who has not seen this movie, please keep this in mind, and go into it with an open mind.  But, if you do get the urge to become one of the ""OH MY GOD THEY CHANGED 2% OF THE STORY, I HAVE TO RUN TO THE INTERNET AND RANT ABOUT IT NOW!!!!!"" people, please spare all of us, and just settle down."
"epyon-2","4","0","1","31 December 2002"," Too many changes for me to enjoy.
","Being a fan of LotR for a long time now, and after reading it through several times as well, I was disappointed with the changes that were made in this installment of the movie trilogy.<br/><br/>I feel that the changes made in this movie didn't help in any way to advance the plot, nor make it easier to understand for people that have never read the books.  Certain changes are unforgivable in my mind as well (Changing the noble character of Faramir in the books, to something along the lines of Boromir = totally unnecessary).  <br/><br/>Once again PJ has expanded the role of Arwen, to my chagrin.  However, including her part didn't change any plot points in the story, which I guess I can accept.<br/><br/>The numerous changes to the Helms Deep side of the story (Saruman controlling Theoden,and Eomer's exile; just to name a few) while being minor in some cases, are still totally unneeded. Why on earth did they create an elf army to help out?!?!?!?!?<br/><br/>I will admit that PJ was able to handle the duality of Gollum/Smeagol quite well.  He was one of the few parts of the movie I truly enjoyed (Sean Astin's portrayal of Samwise being the other).<br/><br/>While the battle sequence was neat in parts, the unfortunate comic relief that they included irritated me greatly.  There are only so many times you can throw in a dwarf tossing joke into a movie (and so far they've had 2 too many, including the one in Fellowship).<br/><br/>I can see how this movie would be enjoyable to people that have never read the books, but I believe that Tolkein fans worldwide let out a universal grumble at many of these changes."

","The movie is really interesting for the restitution of the landscape...only if you haven't seen the first opus. The characters are incredibly boring or predictible: there is no hero, no frightened but courageous people, no desparated quest, no impossible mission because everything is so obvious. The evolution of Gandalf is explained with five words and it's over. The battle is such boring than you laugh when Gimli says few bad jokes and just after you feel ashamed about it. The Ents are the most efficient way to sleep I've never seen; the scene in front of the Mordor's Gate (when they hide themselves with their coats) is unbelievable (even if the explanation will be found with the third movie); Faramir's behaviors have no sense, and Legolas isn't a fighter, he's a surfer!<br/><br/>Fast food, fast movie."

","One of the more boring and pointless films of all that I have seen.  The viewing experience consists mostly of cheering for the cuter creatures and hoping the worst for the ugly noisy ones, otherwise there's not much to think or care about. Both sides rely on magic and violence to achieve their goals but apparently we are to care more for the cuter quiter ones and apparently for that reason the story is told from their perspective. Fortunately, much of the scenery is attractive and provides a welcome distraction from the otherwise pointless marching about.  Unfortunately, the film drags on forever.

"Pierrot-10","5","0","1","26 December 2002"," One more to the Dark Side...
","... the dark side of computer graphics, that is. By this I mean that this movie has in common with the latest installments of Star Wars (and, undoubtedly, with an increasing number of Hollywood blockbusters) that the only character worth<br/><br/>caring about and, yes, the only ""acting"" worth noticing, is computer generated: there Yoda (and the two robots), here Gollum.<br/><br/>As evidenced by the previews preceding the movie - all, with one exception,<br/><br/>sequels or prequels of some kind, with a special mention to ""Dumb and<br/><br/>Dumberer"" (!) - this is also one more movie that people will watch for what it promises, not for what it delivers - it pretty much doesn't matter what you see, if you liked the first one (as you probably did unlike you get dragged into the<br/><br/>second, as I was, against your own will) and/or liked the book, you'll like this too.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a perfect no-brainer as (some people claim) only Hollywood can make, where plot and characters are replaced with grandiose scenery, special<br/><br/>effects, fights, noise and furor.<br/><br/>What I found most disturbing is, in addition to the racist undertones common to all of Tolkien's work (a simplistic world where one's character and almost every action is dictated by their ""race""), the obvious pro-war propaganda<br/><br/>(miscellaneous and coincidental maybe, but still remarkable) conveyed by a<br/><br/>plot whose center theme is the necessity - no, the beauty and holiness - of<br/><br/>(some) wars. Although understandable from someone who wrote (maybe with a clear vision<br/><br/>of what the near future would bring) in the late 30's, the clear message that ""sometimes"", delaying war is a fatal mistake appears here, with Evil itself as the enemy, in the simplistic form which has been used so many times - and still is - as an excuse for random, unwarranted acts of  aggression. In a story where any kind of deep meaning is hard to find, stumbling upon this one is particularly disturbing in the current political context."
"jlm-6","3","0","4","24 December 2002"," Where were the towers?
","Seems to me that over a century of film-making and thousands of films later, most have still not understood that books and literature are one thing and that movies are quite another.<br/><br/>Just because Mr. Tolkien wrote three books, does not mean there have to be three films. It could have been two and it could have been five! We're watching and listening to the story, not reading it! The intensity of the senses applied in film-viewing is completely different to that which we apply in reading books, just as reading a novel has us differently poised to when we read poetry, or when we look at a painting as compared to admiring a sculpture.<br/><br/>For a start, Mr. Tolkien may, rightly, have entitled the second part of his trilogy ""The Two Towers"" and may even have made some reference to two such towers; but, what reference, if any, does the film make to one tower, let alone two??? A good title for a book does not, necessarily, make for a good title for a movie. I would have called this something like ""Preparing For The Great Battle"". After all, we all know the movie isn't really a movie; that it's only an episode, so why not give it a title more befitting an episode.<br/><br/>If you're going to take concepts described in literature and adapt them to film, then, consider the mind... Consider the intelligence of the viewer. If Tolkien conjures up images of an enchanted forest, make them just that: images of an enchanted forest. Trust the viewers' imagination and intelligence. Trees that walk and talk come off far better in Ralph Bakshi's animated version - if only because, as it is all cartoon, there is no stark sudden contrast between the realistic and the unrealistic. There is nothing magically genial (certainly nothing realistic) about Mr. Jackson's version of Beardtree and his Ent mates who, instead, suddenly turn a slow-moving overlong believable production into a slow-moving overlong UNbelievable cheap-looking film.<br/><br/>Long epic battles read well, but they translate poorly onto screen. One of the reasons why Gladiator was such a delight to watch is that the opening battle was turned into short sharp memorably effective punch. What could anyone describe as memorable about the battle in this movie?? I'm sure it'll give those who believe that films are intended as a prequel to video game spinoffs great satisfaction to know they'll be swinging swords and killing Orks for hours and hours, JUST LIKE IN THE MOVIE!<br/><br/>Watch Mr. Bakshi's animation (6 out of 10). In two hours, he'll give you the full sense of the first two books in Tolkien's trilogy, directly and unpretentiously. If you want anything more than that, or you just want to know how it all ends, you'll simply have to read every last word of that thousand-page Trilogy.<br/><br/>This film is worth 4 out of 10."

"kg22384","6","0","1","21 December 2002"," You guys are unbelievable.
","I just finished reading about 20 reviews that praised this film to no end. I am astonished.  Please, take it back one and all.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong, I'm not saying this was a terrible film, or even mediocre.  It was a good film.  Stronger than most films.  But it was so pale in comparison to the first one.  Fellowship cleverly blended action, epic grandeur, and down to earth emmotion.  I felt like I knew the characters of the fellowship.  So Pete changed a few elements, it bettered the story.  It flowed well.  It was paced well.  It gave us a chance to care for the characters and at the same time understand the intricacies of the plot of the film.  This I was expecting from the Two Towers, and it seems like it was all thrown out the window, which baffles me since this film was shot interspersed with Fellowship.<br/><br/>Towers suffers, in my opinion, from overkill in the postproduction sessions. Whoever was helming this portion lost sight of how to treat an audience. I have not read the book, so I don't care about changes, I care about story structure.  Do I understand what is happening, do I get to know the people, do I care for them when they are in peril?  This is all a product of pacing which I feel was sorely lopsided in this film.  Characters fundamentally changed.  Gimli was not comic relief in Fellowship, why now?  I wanted to breath more with Eowyn.  She seemed like such an amazingly strong character, but we're with her less than two minutes and she's crying and she's a mess and we're suppose to feel sorry for her, and I don't even know who she is. Peter's strength of sticking with people in Fellowship, of just giving them some conversation to let us trust the characters, to let us want to pull for them is lost in Towers.  It's cutticy cut all over the place.  We never stay with a single shot for more than a few seconds.  The scenes with Frodo, Sam and Smeagol are the only ones I felt connected to the characters.  I know this was a three hour film, but I think there was entirely to much time spent on setting up fight scenes and special effects.  We understand there is a war coming.  We can conclude that Helm's Deep is going to get it's booty kicked.  We could have had half as much fighting building up to Helm's deep and twice as much character development so that when the fighting happened, we really did care about the outcome and not whether this scene looks as real as the last one.<br/><br/>Another thing.  This film had no structure.  No beginning, no end.  It was just three hours of middle.  Now I understand that it's the middle book, but it's still a movie unto itself.  Again, I just think whoever was in charge of post work was staring at it for so long, he was unable to objectively see whether or not the film was paced right, whether or not the characters were developing, whether or not character's introductions were faithful to the character's initial performance.  I mean, thanks to poor editing, Faramir was a joke.<br/><br/>On a plus note, most of the acting was well done(although I do think editing is responsible for choosing some innappropriate moments of humor in the middle of an intensely dramatic scenes, which undermined any power the scenes may have had).  Of course, the 2 hours and 45 minutes of special effects are amazing(but we could have used less), and the music is spectacular-- Kudos to Howard shore for an amazing score,  the theme for the people of Rohan is breathtaking with it's keltic fiddles.<br/><br/>So, people, don't empower Pete.  Don't let him make the third film with even more special effects and less dialogue.  We gotta make sure he's gonna give a spectacular closing chapter.  Let the characters become the center piece of the story once more.  And it's up to us to tell him that.  No more thoughtless praise of all the special effects.  Lets crack down.  We want a good movie with people we care for.  All of us together now."
"Big G-2","4","0","1","21 December 2002"," OK feature, though not without it's problems.
","First off, let me say that I'm not a die-hard LOTR person. I've never read Tolkein's books and basically thought that the first feature was at best OK. So this review will be from a movie fan's point of view rather than a hard-core Tolkein fan.<br/><br/>Frankly, I did find this to be a little more involving than `Fellowship'. It had some truly wonderful visuals, (it should win the Oscars for those) and though I'm not a fan of CGI, Gollum is one of the better digital creatures to come out of the movies.<br/><br/>Still, I did have some problems with the picture. First off, many have said that the characters are all well developed.  Well, I didn't see it that way. For me, any character development really took a  back seat to the special effects.  Sometimes that's not a bad thing, if  handled correctly.  (Ray Harryhausen's movies are a good example of that).   But when people start saying that these guys should be nominated for Academy Awards, oh come on now!     Frankly, the most interesting character by far was Gollum and he was a digital creation!<br/><br/>Secondly, like the first feature, `Towers' has it's moments where it really drags, especially during the middle.  Peter Jackson, I think, kept cutting in an out of the many different stories this movie had and as a result some of the focus was lost.<br/><br/>The final battle scene was spectacular, but then again, Jackson makes the cardinal sin of running it too long, and as result a lot of the intensity is gone.  One of the professional reviewers said that not since Akira Kurosawa, have we seen any battle of this magnitude. Well, speaking for myself, this battle comes no where near Kurosawa's fighting scenes.  Kurosawa's battle scenes were always wonderfully intense from beginning to end.  (And he didn't need digital fighting  characters).<br/><br/>If I were rating this movie film solely on its special effects, I'd give it 3 ½ stars.  But when the whole movie is added in, I'd  have to give it 2 ½ stars.  Just like the first feature, `Towers' is an OK movie, but because of the character Gollum, I found it a little bit more entertaining.<br/><br/>Anyway that's my take on this film.  It's funny how people view things differently.  Many hard-core fans view these two Lord of the Rings features as the greatest all-time cinematic masterpieces in film history, (which is perfectly fine) while I myself only found them mildly entertaining."

","Once again Peter Jackson manages the not-inconsiderable feat of making 3+ hours pass in the blink of an eye. Before I go all googly-eyed over this film, the few negatives must be got out of the way:<br/><br/>Still too many extreme close-ups and flash cuts in the battle scenes which don't really communicate anything besides the general impression of violence and aggression that is already brought forth by the build ups (one of this films and the predecessor's great strengths BTW).<br/><br/>Aragorn and Gimli's continual hurling of themselves on swathes of orcs and each time coming out unscathed. It does become a tad ridiculous after a while.<br/><br/>The lack of the enormous female spider which I was expecting to turn up...this would have been one of my most anticipated moments, but I guess I'm gonna have to wait another year because the dividers between books two and three have not been respected, which is fine I guess - compared to this, the third book is lean on action. ....that's it actually. Now...<br/><br/>Golem. He's astounding. I don't think I've ever seen a human create such an emotional and convincing performance of a person wrestling between their good and bad sides. I still don't believe it.<br/><br/>The sheer scale has been ramped up immeasurably, as races join together against their common foe. Whereas a Balrog or Cave Troll might be a major foe in the first, here thousands of orcs are the enemy, bringing a welcome expression of vastness to the saga.<br/><br/>The ents are superb - funny, and implemented at least as well as could be expected (probably much more so). There may be a tendancy for some to look at them and go 'well it's obviously digital' but that's not the point. The chracterisation and momentum they bring to the story is what matters.<br/><br/>The interleaving of the three main plot strands (Frodo/Aragorn and co/Merry, Pippin and the Ents) is handled in an awesomely inspired manner. The rythmical moving back and forth between these stories is almost digital in it's precision, and yet so, so, effective at driving the story forward (this is certainly one main reason why three hours seems like 25 minutes).<br/><br/>Anyway, I've wibbled on enough. This is the best film I have ever seen, and I simply can't want till Return of the King..."

The scenes where he is talking with himself were well done but confused me because I haven't read the books i thought that one of them was Gollum and the other was Smeagol but after my friend told me what was going on I understood fine.<br/><br/>It revolves around 3 groups of people not just one like the fellowship did. The battle of Isengard and Helms Deep were incredible, Helms Deep is by far the best battle scene ever in a film, however I felt that it dragged on for too long.<br/><br/>Gimli provides the comic relief of the film but sometimes it seem out of place.

"john-constantine","2","0","4","19 December 2002"," Disappointing at best
","One year ago, I thought FOTR got bashed too easily while it was actually a very decent flick anyone could enjoy. This one doesn't achieve anything at all. Hardcore Tolkien fans (or anyone who's actually read the book) will be very frustrated to see the appaling rewriting job done here while newcomers will just be confused.<br/><br/>Seeing the good rates this movie gets, I can only guess most viewers were stunned by the visual effects and they were right to be. _Most_ effects are great (the sheer scale of the armies is incredible) but on the other hand, you get very poor inserts, Gandalf's beard is almost falling off at times and I'm not sure I want to comment Theoden's metamorphosis.<br/><br/>Character development is virtually non existent since most characters are defined by one dumb catch phrase and idiotic exposition ruins some potentially great scenes. A few characters are still very nice, such as Gollum (the only reason I didn't give 1 to this movie), Eowyn or Sam. But Eomer's sorely lacking and don't even ask me what Arwen is doing in this movie (or why Haldir shows up at helm's deep). The writing choices made here are a real betrayal to Tolkien's work (I'm not talking about cosmetic stuff like some minor missing scenes from FOTR but about some really deep changes made to the characters and events).<br/><br/>The greatest flaw of this movie is its definite lack of structure: there's no real beginning nor ending, it needs the 2 other movies to stand. I think that's a really poor choice, deciding to cast aside potential viewers who didn't see the first flick.<br/><br/>Would I recommend it to people? No. Would I tell them not to see it? Neither, because that's the kind of movie where everyone gets lunatic and so, you'll have to make up your own opinion but as far as I'm concerned, it falls short of being one of the most boring movies ever."
"randythetool","4","0","4","19 December 2002"," An action movie based loosely in Tolkien's world.
","First things first:  before seeing this The Two Towers, you should rid yourself of the notion that it can compare to the novel.  Film translations of novels rarely do, and this is no exception. Now that you have that out of the way, you can prepare to be visually stunned by one of the most magnificent motion pictures I've seen, and be disappointed by the script that ruins it.<br/><br/>Yes, that's right, the script that ruins it.  The Fellowship of the Ring was ambitious.  It was true to the text, as much as a film so ""hollywood"" could be.  It was true to Tolkien.  It wasn't about the Uruk'hai combination of Orcs and Goblins, or Aragorn swinging swords, or Legolas shooting arrows - it was about a delightful cast of characters, all united in a common goal.  A fitting sequel to this film would be delightful.  Instead, we have The Two Towers, an action movie in Middle Earth's world, with a story similar to Tolkien's text.  Packed with one-liners, epic battles, special effects, and (believe it or not), explosions, The Two Towers is every war movie you've seen, set in a fantasy background, redeemed only by the most beautiful cinematography to grace the screen this year.<br/><br/>Andrew Lesnie saves this film, plain and simple.  His camera shows perfectly how hopeless every character in this movie feels, or, are told they should feel.  His frame is dark and dismal, in green, blue, and grey through the bulk of the three hours - a great contrast from the bright colors of Fellowship.  In the first film, the characters showed us hope, and now, they show despair.  The Helm's Deep battle is magnificent to look at, but really, the rest of the film builds to it.  Lesnie probably should not get all of the credit for this, as Peter Jackson's directing is superb in its own right.  Jackson is unafraid to use all of the screen, and with the use of sweeping airborne cameras, he uses sometimes three or four times the size of the screen.<br/><br/>The computer animation is first-rate, and there were times when I knew what I was looking at was false, but could not tell. Gollum's character is entirely computer animated, and provides the most interesting character in this film - in fact, one of only two.  Gollum is a split personality - his entire being wishes to have the ring, if you'll recall from Fellowship, but half of him wishes to help Frodo and Sam, and the other half wants to take the ring for himself.  I'm not sure if each personality has a name, but Frodo calls him Smeagol throughout the movie, so I would assume the good half is Smeagol, and the evil half is Gollum - the film is not clear on this subject.  Either way, Gollum/Smeagol talking to himself, across personae, provides the single best scene in the film.  Quite unfortunate that a host of human actors could not reach the emotional intensity of a series of zeroes and ones.<br/><br/>The other interesting character is Theodan, King of Rohan, played quite well by Bernard Hill.  He is the only face in the film that truly captures how bleak the future is, epitomized in a scene before the epic Helm's Deep battle.  Theoden realizes that his army has no chance of defending their last stronghold, but has no other options.  His talent should have been served with better writing.  That would truly be something.<br/><br/>The script is your standard action movie fare.  Dialog is swift, contains few details, and is rushed along to the next action sequence.  Elrond and Arwen, the elves, return for a short while in this chapter, which has little purpose in this film.  No doubt their scenes are more poignant in the extended version, which will be released next Christmas season, and, no doubt, be the same drivel we've seen in this ""shortened"" version.<br/><br/>I look forward to the extended version of this film.  I have low expectations, if the scenes we have here are the ones they decided not to delete, I'm not sure I want to see the ones they took out. However, where The Fellowship of the Ring earned three and a half stars from me, the extended version gets four.  Maybe The Two Towers' extension will get three.  I hope we're just being teased with The Two Towers, because I have high expectations for The Return of the King.  It would be a shame to see a project that started so ambitiously fall to the formula of the trilogy."
"blef1248","Null","0","1","18 December 2002"," Worse than the first movie, but still OK
","This movie is similar to the first one, but is slightly different. Here are the bad things: 1. The director has done a bad job running several story lines in parallel and switching between them arbitrarily. 2. bad camerawork during fights - the camera moves too quickly and it is hard to follow what is going on.  The whole movie is too fast-paced, but this is Hollywood (...) 3. ""sentimental moments"" - i.e. they turn on some seemingly sentimental<br/><br/>music and characters begin looking at each other in some special way and saying trite things about friendship or love. 4. ""Dwarf humor"".  OK, the dwarf is small and funny.  You say it ones, you say it twice, again, and again, and again.  The movie is not about the dwarf after all. 5. Too much Gorlum.  OK, he has two personalities constantly fighting each other.  You show it once, you show it twice, ...  He is not the main figure in the story.<br/><br/>So, all in all, the movie is a little bit too long with lots of typical Hollywood cliches.  But there is good animation, special effects.  The fights are really interesting in places, but, of course, easily predictable. Very nice mountains in NZ.  The movie still has a lot of good things in it and is definitely worth watching once."
"maudeflanders79","5","0","2","18 December 2002"," way too long for a movie that wasnt that interesting
","not the worst movie ive ever seen but you combine that it wasnt that interesting and the fact that it was over three hours long makes for a mid-level movie. the movie looked great at times but in a couple of scenes the use of a blue scene was very noticeable"
"kliq","8","0","1","18 December 2002"," No, it doesnt live up
","Peter Jackson tried his best, and did his best, unfortunately his best wasnt up to it. I dont know but was I the only one who felt the Two Towers crawled? The Fellowship was almost as long, but didnt drag for a second, this one on the other hand had me looking at my watch every now and then. Dont get me wrong, I'm as big as a fan as any of you there, but in all honesty - when I walked out of the fellowship I wanted to be Legolas, I wanted to be Aragorn, and I know a lot of you did too. The Two Towers however didnt do anything of the sort. The film lacked direction and somewhere Peter Jackson let the hype get to him.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, it might be the extreme expectation I had from this movie - but nevertheless no where near the first one. --kliq"
"stiefmo","10","0","1","18 December 2002"," No word in the english language can describe how good this movie is
","I went and saw The Two Towers at the midnight showing and was blown away. This movie is unbelivable in regards to the directing skills of Peter Jackson. His visual images that he uses really show his true talent and will put him in the likes of Scorcese, Speilberg, and Lucus. The acting is stellar with great comedy coming from the dwarf Gimli and great acting on Elijah Wood's Part, as he tries to bear the burden of the Ring. IF you haven't went to see the spectacle yet you are missing a movie that is proud to be in the ranks of The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and The Shawshank Redemtion, and rightly deserves to be."
"stephenb","10","0","1","18 December 2002"," Quite a ride, but not for everyone.
","The Two Towers will thrill you and drain you, don't plan on doing anthing too ambitious afterword. The computer animated Gollum, Ents and hordes of orcs are perfect or near to it. Don't look for a beginning or an end as it is the middle installment of a trilogy but it moves you there so intensely from the opening flicker you barely notice that this is the first major sequel with no reprise of the first installment to bring you up to date. Peter Jackson and crew take a few liberties with Tolkien's masterpiece but none too objectionable for all but the most extreme purists, and there are some welcome surprises as well.  <br/><br/>The Two Towers is dark and bloody with one of the longest battle scenes since The Longest Day with little relief from the intensity. Not for children and for those looking for women with large heroic roles.  The first and third installments have more of that. The three hours fly by, though be sure not to drink too many fluids or you may have to get up and miss much in the middle!  <br/><br/>Another masterpiece of film magic, I can't believe I have to wait another year for the last installment!"
"rjhtamu","10","0","1","18 December 2002"," Absolutely Unbelievable!
","I write this just coming from a midnight screening and I'm totally lost for words. I would have to be a poet to find the words that I want to describe what I felt in the theater tonight.  Alas, I'm not. Go see it for yourself and see what Jackson/Taylor et al have put forth for us on screen.  John Rhys-Davies said it best when he told everyone on set to not forget for one moment that they were part of a masterpiece here.  Well a masterpiece it is, and most certainly will be with the completion of the story in Return of the King."
"blaisepascal","10","0","1","18 December 2002"," The most epic trilogy of my lifetime
","I'm not going to leave a big in depth review of LotR: the Two Towers for 2 reasons: 1) I should be studying for a final and 2) I'm sure countless other people will point out all the reasons this movie was absolutely amazing. But I will leave some quick feedback saying this... I was not a fan of the first movie of this trilogy. I gave it a 6/10 on IMDb because I felt it just served as a poor, jumbled introduction with tons of nice imagery but no substantial plot or character development underneath. Nothing in the movie made an impact on me, and by the end I just wanted to get over with it already. <br/><br/>Where the Fellowship fell sort, the Two Towers makes up and then some. Although some characters remain rather one dimensional (Legolas), we see depth in the acting and script with characters such as Aragorn, Sam, and particularly Frodo and Golum (although the ""acting"" in Golum's place isn't of the typical kind, obviously), that rivals any film I've ever seen before. Gone is the ""who cares"" feel I got from major events in the first movie, now by the end of the film when three different sub-plots are going on at the same time, I was almost equally on the edge of my seat for all three, and certainly was not uninterested in any. The plot may be clichéd and done before, but if so it's only because this is the outline that everyone else copied, this is one of THE original epic fantasy story lines ever written, and it's sincerity and urgency still comes through, despite so many copycats.<br/><br/>I really need to get back to studying, but I will leave you with this. LotR: the Two Towers combines a deep, epic storyline, stellar acting, stunning visuals, and absolute edge of your seat action into a package the likes of which I doubt I'll ever see again in my lifetime. I hope the conclusion of the trilogy proves me wrong, but until then... do yourself a favor and see this movie over the winter break.<br/><br/>10/10"
"weine-1","Null","0","1","17 December 2002"," What's with the Osgiliath-plot?
","OK, so I have to admit that mr Jackson went and did it again. As a film it's terrific. As an interpretation of the books - quite ok. But, being a huge fan of the book, I can't say I'm totally comfortable with the fact that large chunks of storyline was omitted, and other parts inserted at what seemed random.<br/><br/>The ents were portrayed very close to what I had in mind myself, but the conclusion to go to war should've been reached at the summit, like in the book. A plus though for Treebeard - very cool character. :)<br/><br/>Osgiliath. What was wrong with just keeping the company east of Anduin, at the Forbidden Pool-site? And why was Sean Bean not casted to play Faramir too? And, most importantly, why was Faramir so ""evil""? He should've been portrayed as in the book - a crystal clear counterweight to his brother. But oh no, Peter Jackson had to go ahead and make him semi-evil and let him drag the poor hobbits of to Osgiliath. There - after a short intermezzo between Frodo and a Nazgûl - Faramir somehow - in a very hippie-like way - changes his opinion, and sends the party of with his most sincere wishes for good luck, etc.<br/><br/>""If you let them go, the blah blah of the blah of Gondor states that your life will be forfeit!"" ""Then let it be forfeit"" - no explanation given to this. Bad.<br/><br/>Argh!<br/><br/>Gollum was - in lack for better words - perfect. The fact that it was CGI alltogether never shone through. Great work! I especially like the dialogue he has with himself about whether to trust his Master or not.<br/><br/>Elronds little tantrum after Arwen refuses to leave Middle Earth is also a little strange. As is the fact that Galadriel - via some strange form of telepathy? - gets Elrond to send reinforcements to Helms deep. (My impression after reading the books is that Elrond (half-elf) is more positive to humans and other races than Galadriel. In the films he seems to be more reserved?)<br/><br/>Oh, let's face it - I dislike Liv Tyler.<br/><br/>I liked the movie though. Very much so. I think I gave FoTR 8/10 or so, so I have to give this one 9/10. It's improving, mister Jackson! :)<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it already, do it!"
"ffmdo","6","0","1","17 December 2002"," A good Movie ..
","but really hard to follow for those who didn't read the book (like me). But i liked the special effects, the battle of helmsdeep was awesome (albeit a little too unrealistic). its a pitty that they left a lot of things unexplained (the whole story about the Ents was left out, according to my friend who read the book), but this would make the movie even longer.<br/><br/>i'll give it 7 out of 10<br/><br/>p.s. Sorry for my bad english :)"
"Laffe","8","0","1","17 December 2002"," Sadly, not as good as the trailer
","[This review is spoiler-free]<br/><br/>The people who are going to appreciate this film the most are people who have read the books, but only once or twice, and not very recently.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning, although a bit chaotic sometimes... sensory overload, anyone? But that can't help the fact that this movie, unlike it's predecessor, has several problems.<br/><br/>1) The plot is split, trying to focus on three, sometimes four,  different but interwoven plot lines. IF you have read the book, there is no effort to keep concentrated. However, if you haven't read the book it might become very confusing.<br/><br/>2) On the other hand, if you are very familiar with the book, you will be a bit disappointed by the story treatment. Sure, most of the things from the book are in the film, but not necessarily in the same order, or even with the same characters, as in the book. As book adaptions go, this one strays frequently off the path quite a bit. To make matters worse, the changes in the storyline have no apparent benefits or reasons; they just exist. I mean, we all understood why Tom Bombadill had to go from the first movie, no matter how much we hate it. Not so with this film.<br/><br/>3) The characters, with a couple of brilliant exceptions, behave rather odd. Merry and Pippin suddenly mature while Gimli is reduced to an axe-weilding homicidal comic relief and Legolas seems to be very dim-witted in this movie.<br/><br/>4) Although visually stunning, the battle is just too unrealistic. Wait, you say, this is a fantasy movie. True, but that doesn't mean you just can abandon the laws of nature... since this review is spoiler free I won't go into any details, but you can only let a character miraculously survive the onslaught of a gazillion enemies so many times before it get's ridiculous.<br/><br/>So, to sum it up; most of the audience will probably like it, since it had great effects, lots of action and Liv Tyler in a skimpy dress. Fans of the book would do well to leave their brains at the door though. It all boils down to how high expectations you have, and how much you love the book. Ironically, the computer generated characters of Gollum and Treebeard are the best parts..."
"reanimator76","8","0","2","17 December 2002"," OVERRATED!!
","I like this movie no doubt about it..it would possibly be one of the best movies to emerge out of this year but the fact that annoys me is this movie is only based on special effect. Theres no actual acting talents being brought forth in this movie so why is it going so popular.True that Jackson is a amazing director but this movie doesnt come near godfather, the shawshank redemption or citizen kane. A grand film BUT definately not a masterpiece and highly overrated"
"waari","1","0","11","12 December 2002"," Well, plenty of action but as shallow as previous part
","Fast, action packed, nice effects, blood, guts & gore, fights, fights and more fights, only where is the actual movie then ?<br/><br/>Unfortunately TTT (as did FOTR) takes the easy way of making an ""epic"" while the visuals are nice and eg. battle at helm's is simply beautifully done the story and characters are two dimensional and shallow.<br/><br/>Again I am saddened of the alterations from the book as they seem to serve only to add more action, I would rather call these movies an adventure that is based on LOTR ...<br/><br/>Mediocre action movie, nothing more, nothing less . . ."
"herbavore1","5","0","6","4 December 2002"," too many plot lines, evil not menacing enough, bad computer graphics
","Parts of this movie were exciting. But there were at least four big problems:<br/><br/>1) The movie follows three sets of characters: Frodo and his buddy; the humans who are attacked by the army of orcs; and two hobbits who are lost in the forest. Since these sets of characters have their own separate story lines throughout the movie, there are lots of jumps. And only one story line is any good: the humans battling against the orcs. Everything else is just distracting.<br/><br/>2) The first movie is good largely because the evil characters, especially the horsemen, are so believable and menacing. In this installment, the bad guys are laughable -- buffoonish orcs by the thousands, a crazy Christopher Lee stuck in a tower, etc.<br/><br/>3) The computer graphics in this movie just aren't very good. Golum is a great character but, whenever he comes onscreen, you can't help thinking, ""hey, that guy's a cheesy computer graphic."" The computer effects in the last scene involving torrents of water are like something out of a bad Godzilla movie.<br/><br/>4) As much as I like Sir Ian, his White Gandolf seems stoned in most of this movie."
