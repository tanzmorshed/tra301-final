","After my third viewing, I can finally admit that this film has me. I enjoyed it during its theatrical run, enjoyed it more the second time around, and now, I can only say that I love it. The cast is exemplary. Tom Cruise is so good in this film that it is very often easy to forget he is Tom Cruise. Easily his most powerful role and best performance since Jerry Maguire. Ken Watanabe, however, is incredible in every scene - acting with a rare sensitivity and intensity and breathing life into a character much larger and more human than the grand story of which he is a part. Though the entire cast is excellent, I feel that I must also single out Koyuki and Shichinosuke Nakamura for, respectively, the female lead and the emperor, for the subtle strength and believability they each give their very challenging roles.<br/><br/>The story takes place during the early modernization of Japan, in the 1870s and 1880s. The Emperor's power has been weakened by the political and economic power of his cabinet, by his young age, and by the political influence of the United States and other western powers pulling the strings of his cabinet and supplying modern weaponry and tactics to the modernizing Japanese army. Cruise plays Captain Allgren, an alcoholic veteran who has seen and participated in too many massacres of innocent people, and is offered an opportunity to reclaim some of his honor by helping to train the Japanese military in the use of firearms. When he arrives in Japan, we learn that the first test of the Japanese army and its new weapons will be against a rebellious group of samurai who believe themselves to be in the service of the Emperor and Japan, but resist the Emperor's cabinet and the influence of western nations. In the power void left by a passive emperor, Japan seems poised to enter into a civil war against its own values, faith and honor. During the first attack on the Samurai, Allgren is captured by the Samurai and begins a spiritual, physical and philosophical journey which will bring him a level of self-respect his own culture could never supply.<br/><br/>My interpretation of this journey is that Allgren has found a place and people that offer him redemption, where, in his own world, he can find none. But Allgren's is only a small part of the story - which ultimately revolves around what is right for Japan, for the subjectivity of a whole nation, and how to portray such a subject from its own perspective. Traditional Japan is treated with empathy here, not aggrandizing exaggeration, as some of the film's critics seem to suggest. This is not a film about what is objectively right and wrong, but a film about struggling to understand and empower tradition as a means to control and benefit from change. I find no grand moral statement here, but rather an intense, sympathetic, human drama with a strong sense of honor and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick has made a film which operates well at every level, carrying simple but profound philosophical ideas, but avoiding the mistake of making these ideas and the characters that express them super-heroic. Ultimately, this beautifully shot film conveys powerful messages about war, tradition, ethics, honor and culture, which, though not particularly original, are sensitively and intelligently brought forward. There is a lot of action, including some remarkably well-acted sword fighting and martial artistry, but none of it seems unnecessary and the whole film is truly tightly woven. My highest recommendation."

","I was skeptical about this movie because not every high-budget feature with Tom Cruise is guaranteed depth or serious acclaim, although it may gather at the box office.  And Warner Bros put me through TORTURE to see this pic - changes of times AND locations, over and over.  I felt like was on an survival test, an unbearably annoying treasure hunt over weeks and was frankly ready to give it a negative review (which I'm writing on behalf of a publication).  However, I found the movie truly and unequivocally remarkable and cannot contain my review in 350 words.<br/><br/>First, the experience was powerful.  Edward Zwick was a masterful director. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  The action, sets, scenery and story - even the dialogue - were riveting.  Clearly, a ton of historical and cultural research and care went into the script, sets, costumes, casting. They didn't just Hollywoodize Kurosowa's ""Seven Samurai"" as a Tom Cruise vehicle.  Nor was it Dances with Wolves or Seven Years in Tibet, two PC-preaching pics of yesteryear.  It was a lot more like Braveheart meets Seven Samurai with elements of inculturation a bit reminiscent of Wolves and Seven Years.<br/><br/>Rarely does a movie have excellent acting across the board, but all the Japanese actors were outstanding, and the Americans and Europeans were excellent ... Tom Cruise was at the top of his game.  His Independence Day angst combined with his moral nobility in A Few Good Men and The Firm. Ken Watanabe as co-star exemplifying bravery, wisdom and nobility was outstanding.<br/><br/>In spite of this historical epic being ""in vogue"" at present, there were surprisingly few cliché story elements.  Even the requisite (American-made movie) romance with Take (Koyuki in this role was wonderful) furthered the cross-cultural elements of the plot in such a way that neither culture was violated - and above all the `chemistry' was discreet in Japanese fashion, taking a necessary backseat without overshadowing the main story line, actually adding richness to the process of ""going native"" for Captain Algren (Cruise).  The subplot went far beyond an added market draw.  Very tasteful and artful scriptwriting, with many colorful, developing characters.<br/><br/>
The thrust of the film was the Western-Japanese cultural divide, differing concepts of value and valor and the political issues surrounding Japan's efforts to ""Westernize.""  [cross-cultural studies have become a cinematic trend: Lost in Translation, Beyond Borders, The Missing, Japanese Story, etc.]  Where most of the other films fell short (and The Statement was an abomination], this film succeeded brilliantly.  The differences between the two cultures were considered and portrayed without completely bashing one (except in the political arena, but even there, the Japanese seemed to be inviting their own downfall, in many ways).  There was no simple scapegoat or cultural domination message.  The American Civil War captain, Nathan Algren (Cruise) goes abroad as not only a war hero but also a cross-cultural and linguistic expert.  Being in Japan, (at first as a mercenary hired to train Japanese in Western ways of war), he takes on the study of the people and their language.  Although Algren's sometimes superhero abilities are a bit of a stretch at times, taking the native language seriously is unique in American filmmaking (and American culture, hence our lowly reputation when traveling).  Usually the American walks into the foreign scene and the pic automatically shifts to all-English.  I was truly grateful to find the dialog half in subtitles because half the characters were Japanese - and Algren was speaking with them.  Secondly, this movie honors both cultures for their recognized strengths, even in their distinctiveness.  For example, when the woman who is hosting Algren (in captivity) makes dinner, he helps her.  ""Japanese men don't do these things,"" she tells him.  ""But I'm not Japanese,"" he says (in Japanese).  Algren is not ashamed to uphold his homeland customs (although this was 1876... pre-sensitive 90s man era, long before women's lib let alone men entering kitchens) when his own cultural customs or inclinations are ways of caring rather than domination. Another and more important example:  Algren demonstrates American resilience and perseverance when he rises again repeatedly after defeat.  This baffles the Japanese who are accustomed to falling on their swords in shame after defeat, for them a noble death.  In these and many other ways, the Japanese Samurai (especially Katsumoto, Watanabe's character) and Algren learn to appreciate each other's ways.  In many respects, the film moves past the usual PC party line [of Dances with Wolves, Seven Years in Tibet and most others of similar ilk out of Hollywood] and reflects on the beauty and dignity in the midst of difference between the two worlds, and how much they need to learn from one another without money or domination as a motive. The dignity of the young Emperor Meiji finding his own cultural center, at the end, was especially moving.  Overall, the film had depth and substance with brilliant work in almost every area of production and performance.  The editing was marvelous - although it's long, there's no unnecessary material remaining.  Not a moment of boredom.  Props all around!"

","It is said that the only thing constant is change. Old ideals die off, and new technologies replace the inefficiencies of yesteryear. The young usually have little trouble adjusting to change, but traditionalists are often dragged into the new era either kicking and screaming or silently resolved to remove themselves completely.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" manages to capture a little of both, with Japanese men living in a world in transition from ancient bushido rituals of honor into a more modern empire of industry and trade. A sweeping historical epic that hints at the brilliance of Akira Kurosawa's finest work while also invoking the melancholy of a Shakespearean tragedy, the movie is a reminder of the cost of high ideals and danger of industrial conformity.<br/><br/>It's 1876, and Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is an alcoholic wreck of a man. A veteran of the Civil War as well as General Custer's Indian campaigns, he drifts from one situation to another ostensibly looking for work but really seeking refuge from his inner demons of slaughtering innocent women and children.<br/><br/>Opportunity knocks in the form of an old Army acquaintance Colonel Ben Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who has accepted work with a Japanese businessman named Omura (Masato Harada). Omura has been charged with recruiting American war vets as military advisors to the new Japanese Army. Emperor Meiji, under advise from Omura and other parties, is interested in modernizing his nation's military with rifles and other armaments.<br/><br/>In order to unify the nation, the powers that be must first take care of civil dissidence within Japan. The samurai, led by charismatic chieftain Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), are violently opposing the invasion of Western culture into their islands. Bagley foolishly sends his ill-trained soldiers into combat against the samurai, and during the resulting massacre Algren is captured and taken to the samurai's village.<br/><br/>During the course of the winter, Algren slowly gains the trust of his captors and in turn is given free roam over the village. He fights with Uijo (Hiroyuki Sanada), who dislikes the American from the beginning, and is given food and shelter by Taka (Koyuki), the wife of one of samurai he killed during battle.<br/><br/>Katsumoto meanwhile seeks to learn about his enemy, and begins to respect Algren as a fellow warrior. Also interested in the American is Katsumoto's son Nobutada (Shin Koyamada), intrigued by Western culture. Algren finds the first peace he has known in a long time, and begins to adapt to the ways of the samurai. He acts as a surrogate father to Taka's children, learns to sword fight with a kitana blade and begins to respect the culture that he originally sought to destroy.<br/><br/>But during Algren's absence the Japanese Army has had better opportunity to prepare themselves, and time is soon approaching that will determine the fate of the samurai and the future of Japan.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is beautifully filmed by John Toll, the same cinematographer who worked on ""Braveheart."" The comparisons are obvious with moments of silent reflection and loud explosions of fury, both powerfully captured on film.<br/><br/>Director Edward Zwick brings the same determination to the screen that he did more than a decade ago with ""Glory."" The attention to period detail is near flawless and the movie never releases its grip on the audience.<br/><br/>As Algren, Cruise grows from suicidal depression to driven idealist quite realistically, drawing on the standard dishonored warrior archetype while giving him touches of humanity. Cruise's only shortcoming is his lack of dramatic range, and as such it never seems like Algren has any sinister intent even when acting selfishly. Never for a moment is there a doubt that he's destined to be a hero.<br/><br/>Cruise is also overshadowed in every scene by Watanabe, who makes Katsumoto a honorable man who is shocked by all the dishonor threatening to overthrow his country. Philosopher, poet, family man and warrior - Katsumoto wears many hats, and is realized through Watanabe perfectly.<br/><br/>Other smaller roles are captured by strong performances as well, including Goldwyn who brings class to the standard villain role as Bagley, Koyuki who plays Taka with quiet sadness and torn loyalties between her fallen husband and his killer who she is growing to love, and Koyamada who makes Nobutada young and headstrong but still sympathetic and honorable.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" only suffers during a protracted finale that screams of studio interference. The ending smacks of being safe, clean and Hollywood, something that almost betrays to whole film.<br/><br/>The movie is still strong enough to become a modern day classic. Like ""The Wild Bunch,"" it speaks to those curious of what became of warriors who outlived their time. Timeless issues of honor, loyalty and redemption as well as the clashing of ancient culture versus new technology remain omnipresent. To remain in the past in foolish, but to forget it entirely is disgraceful.<br/><br/>Nine out of ten stars. Destined to be remembered for some time, this movie honorably deals with its subject matter."

","I disagree with a lot of the reviews of this film. Yes, it is true that it does glorify a lifestyle in an exaggerated and unfairly sublime way, but I think we're missing the point. This film is romanticism vs. modernism. It's purity vs. corruption. It's not so much the premise or believability, but the substance behind it.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is an actor who is both idolized (by fans) and ridiculed (by critics) In this film he dazzles us as a drunken U.S General haunted by a bloody past. I was pushing for him to get an Oscar Nod, but alas, None came. ""The Last Samurai"" wasn't particularly well received and that was disconcerting to me. I'd recommend it to anyone with a taste for romance and for anyone who simply longs for a little less ""celebrity wedding"" and a little more ""help the old lady across the road""."

The story follows a disillusioned Civil War veteran who's recruited to train the Japanese army in Western warfare as they prepare to take on a Samurai rebellion. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe lead the cast and give excellent performances. The directing is also quite remarkable, and captures the spiritual aspects of nature and of the Samurai culture. Additionally, the writing does an effective job at depicting the culture clashes, and at developing the characters.

","The Last Samurai is a brilliantly crafted aesthetic pleasure, studded with supernal performances from Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise. In fact, Tom Cruise unarguably gives his best ever performance, surpassing his portrayal of Jerry Maguire in the eponymous flick. His plaintive portrayal of Nathan Algren, not only evokes pathos but also seeks sympathy of the contemporary viewer, who can vicariously relate to Algren's disconcertion, owing to his inner conflicts of patriotism vis-à-vis humanity.<br/><br/>However, it is Ken Watanabe, who steals the show with his mesmerizing and poignant portrayal of Katsumoto, the leader of the last clan of Samurai. His screen presence and delivery is truly amazing and even outshines that of Tom Cruise, which is a compliment in itself. The scenes between Watanabe and Cruise are pure gold, depicting fluctuating feelings of hostility, compassion and camaraderie. <br/><br/>Watanabe's intense and powerful performance in which he displays a wide range of emotions, is definitely worthy of the coveted statuette, but the academy never fails to disappoint. Watanabe's brilliant portrayal, not only mesmerizes the viewers, but also convinces the critics of his acting abilities. The tacit adoration between Algren and Taka (subtly played by Koyuki), enormously adds to the beauty of the movie. All this coupled with some brilliant cinematography and a mesmerizing score, makes it a treat to watch and a truly surreal experience.<br/><br/>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"

","The Last Samurai is a strictly by-the-numbers samurai epic set in 1876-1877 Japan. All the necessary ingredients are here - beautiful Japanese landscapes and costumes, larger than life battlefield sequences, and eastern philosophy.Although the pageantry is not as beautiful as such samurai epics as ""Heaven and Earth"", it is more than adequate.<br/><br/>Do not, however go into this film expecting ""Kill Bill"", grindhouse type swordplay nor the poignancy of a Kurosawa piece. Instead, ""The Last Samurai"" occupies the middle ground; a human story of one Westerner learning to embrace another culture kind of a mixture of ""Dances With Wolves"" and ""Shogun"", films from which it derives almost directly. And this is the films greatest flaw. It is utterly predictable. No spoilers here, we all know what happens to the samurai. If not, the title ought to give you a clue. Every scene is one that you were expecting to see. And the ending is the ending you expect.<br/><br/>But Zwick and co. still manage to weave an engaging story with panache, and a climactic (despite it's predictability) ending, and that is why ""The Last Samurai"" is such a great film. As the Zen saying goes, ""Success is a journey, not a destination"". It is equally applicable to the samurai in the film, and the film itself. A success. 8/10."

","I am a Japanese. In this movie I see many false misunderstandings and errors on Japanese culture. For example, they try to overlap Samurais and Native Americans, which is very difficult for Japanese to comprehend. In one scene, Samurais were fighting in a jungle. We do not have a jungle in Japan. They try to depict that swords are the most important thing for samurais, which is not true at all. Bushido is not that shallow.<br/><br/>The only notable thing I observed in this movie is that the Hollywood finally learned to be capable of treating foreign cultures positively. I know it is very difficult to make a movie about foreign cultures free from misunderstandings and prejudice.<br/><br/>If you want to touch the real Bushido, which Japanese natives embrace, I recommend that you read ""Bushido"" written by Nitobe Inazo, or watch ""Chushingura""."

","""The Last Samurai"" 2003 and ""The Last of the Dogmen"" (1995 d: Tab Murphy, with Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey in the lead) are both films with the theme of the 'last' of warrior spirits (one is Samurai, one is Cheyenne). The production of The Last Samurai is well worth seeing - the glory of a large-scale Hollywood production it is. From the research of the historical Japanese Meiji period, the mannerisms, the way different classes of people dress, the settings, the battle weapons and armory, how the Samurai train and fight, to the study and appreciation of the Art of War - where men of honor and integrity in service to the Emperor is the thing to die for. The film title in three Kanji characters means The Way of the Warrior (Samurai). The one character shown on screen at the very beginning (romanization: Sze) meant in the service of the King. Hence the definition of Watanabe's Samurai lifelong one true goal - to serve his Emperor, one and only, and to die in the service of the Emperor would be an honor.<br/><br/>The film, directed by Ed Zwick, is truly a combined labor of love of everyone involved. From the producer-lead actor Tom Cruise and Zwick's film-making partner Marshall Herskovitz, cinematography by John Toll and film score by Hans Zimmer, to the costuming details, diverse casting, location scouting all the way to New Zealand and training of the supporting cast - even the official Web site with extensive production notes - all provide enhanced appreciation of this remarkable film. The storyline and drama of ""The Last Samurai"" evoke various level of emotions, pulling the heartstrings of the audience with high emotional energy - suspense, sadness, smiles, empathy, joy.<br/><br/>""Kagemusha"" by Akira Kurosawa, of course, is the ultimate grandeur of a historic Samurai epic.

","I like Japanese movies and I like movies about samurais and for some reason after I saw the ads I bought a ticket and went to the cinema to watch it. I expected something like the ""Shogun"" with it holliwoodish but still interesting entertaining exploration of Japanese culture. But what I saw was so cheesy that walking out of the theatre I felt like I start hating Tom Cruise for lurking me into the 2 hour popcorn- for-the-brains show. I always expected Tom Cruise to finally die, but he never did. Instead he went on chopping the samurais (who, supposedly dedicated all their life to the sword fighting art) right and left. The scenes where he trains with the master of sword remind me all those hundreds of cheesy Rambo-Kickboxer movies where the white Americans kick the asses of their Asian adversaries in the field of the martial arts after having trained those arts for some 10 minutes. The movie is quite expensive and has a pretense of being a historical drama, but the plot and the message of it are just way too cheesy. Hollywood clichés are oozing from every scene. The worst part is the ending where Tom Cruise (an Amercian officer who came to teach Japanese the modern Western war technique and subsequently underwent a transformation embracing the ""old ways"" of noble fighting with the katana sword) together with his noble friends dash in their last suicidal charge with the naked swords right onto the machine guns of emperor's army and... what I see: all Japanese are dead and Tom Cruise is still hanging on, all wounded of course, but alive and with this tremendously heroic face he tries to stand up, alone among the corpses of all his friends. Here the director apparently wants us to cry and sympathize with our hero, but all I felt was a creepy feeling that one might feel when observing something so utterly false and cheap cheesy that you want to shudder. So my verdict is: It is bad, very bad. Even for Tom Cruise."

","In the hands of a great filmmaker, ""The Last Samurai"" could have been a great film.  As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.<br/><br/>Director Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though ""Glory"" and ""Courage Under Fire"" are excellent films (""Legends of the Fall"" is decent, while I consider ""Leaving Normal"" one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with ""Courage Under Fire"", depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old ""Searchers""/ ""Emerald Forest""/""Dances With Wolves"" tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen ""The Searchers"" or ""The Emerald Forest"" (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of ""Little Big Man"" primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).<br/><br/>But in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).<br/><br/>And this is one reason ""The Last Samurai,"" despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with ""Road to Perdition,"" Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.<br/><br/>Cruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from ""Risky Business"" who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from ""Top Gun.""  The goofball pool hustler from ""The Color of Money.""  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like ""The Last Samurai"" in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.<br/><br/>The sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.  Is anyone really expecting to see some sort of masterpiece by a T.V. producer/director named Ed Zwick?!<br/><br/>Still, ""The Last Samurai"" manages to succeed in a number of ways -- mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory ""Braveheart""-style by the great cinematographer John Toll.  It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai).  As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the sage warrior leader whom Cruise befriends.  A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to.  But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons.  Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa.  Or Lean.  Or Ford.<br/><br/>All technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent.  Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.   All in all, ""The Last Samurai"" is an impressive production. And even if it  misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment.<br/><br/>And whatever its faults, it's almost a miracle when a Hollywood studio today turns out something even a fraction this good."

","Set in 1870's Japan, `The Last Samurai' is most effective when it sticks to the harsh realities of its blood- soaked battle scenes and avoids the softening effects of its two-bit philosophizing.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is stoic and stolid as Nathan Algren, a former captain of the United States army who is having trouble coming to grips with the part he played in slaughtering a village of innocent American Indians.  Now drifting aimlessly through life, Algren disinterestedly agrees to go to Japan to help train its military in the ways of modern warfare so that the nation's leaders can take on and destroy the sole remnants of the samurai forces who are still using swords as weapons.  Once he is captured by the `enemy,' however, Algren falls under the spell of the Samurai Code of Honor and switches his allegiance in battle, ending up fighting with the samurai (whom he views as the equivalent of `Indian underdogs' in the struggle) against the people he was brought over to train.  The film, thus, becomes a study in redemption as this one man attempts to find his place in the scheme of things and to erase the life-crippling guilt of his past actions.<br/><br/>Director Edward Zwick, who made one of the best war films of modern times (`Glory'), has had less success here, mainly because he stacks the deck so shamelessly in favor of the samurai that we can't help feeing manipulated all throughout the film.  In many ways, `The Last Samurai' is as guilty of one-sidedness as those old time Westerns that used to portray the Indians as faceless savages and the White Man as noble adventurers and heroes.  Each perspective seems equally unhistorical and phony.   It's hard for us to see much meaning in Algren's redemption when the people he is following spend much of their time garroting themselves and chopping off one another's heads.  And all the talk about `honor,' `shame,' the beauty of cherry blossoms and getting in touch with the inner self through a zen-type lifestyle don't amount to too much when we stand back and realize that the samurai were basically bloody warriors who often terrorized the general populous with their acts of brutality and violence.  The makers of the film want us to see a vast moral chasm separating the samurai from both the Japanese military and the evil American colonials who support them, but it is, ultimately, a distinction without a difference.  So when we are asked to cheer on Algren and his compatriots in battle or weep over their fate, the movie loses its grip on us in a major way.  The film becomes just another case of glorifying and romanticizing a way of life that we somehow suspect was a bit less noble and honorable than we have always been led to believe by the countless movies on the subject.<br/><br/>Technically, `The Last Samurai' is a mighty impressive achievement.  In addition to the eye-catching vistas of rural Japan and a beautifully recreated 19th Century city, the film's large-scaled battle sequences have been stunningly mounted and executed - though the faint-of-heart should note that the body count on screen is enormous and the blood flows generously throughout.  There are, also, some admittedly touching moments scattered throughout the film, though the Hollywood corn is never too far from the surface (particularly in Algren's romantic attachment to the wife of a man he killed).<br/><br/>`The Last Samurai' is a joy to look at, but its unsubtle approach to its material and lack of evenhandedness make it far less meaningful and moving than, I'm sure, it both wanted and intended to be."

","Once I saw where this movie was going I thought 'Yay, this is all about Tom Cruise kicking some serious Samurai ass, it has to be lots of fun'.<br/><br/>And fun it was, nice, cheesy, campy fun. Cruise's Civil War vet character has these battleground flashbacks that make him all moody and tormented. But hey, this is no regular Joe, he is a bit of genius actually as he manages to both learn Japanese and master the art of the Samurai over the course of just one winter. Yay again for this all American wonder of a hero.<br/><br/>They've also thrown in some romance for good measure and a whole bunch of epic fight scenes you've seen so many times before and the obligatory moral conundrum to put some more weight behind the leading character self-righteousness.<br/><br/>End of story. Yawn.<br/><br/>A final thought on the cast. While watching this I thought Leslie Nielsen would have probably been the most appropriate lead here. But then I sobered up and realized the guy was old and his ligaments might have refused to cooperate. So upon further analysis I reached the final verdict. Adam Sandler. And Drew Barrymore as the warlord."

","I am a native japanese residing in Tokyo, very familiar of the actual history that took place in Japan towards the end of the 19th century.<br/><br/>In short, by all means, this movie moved me and had me crying at certain moments. What I wanted to shout out after watching this movie was, ""Thank you Tom Cruise and Edward Zwick!!""<br/><br/>From a Japanese viewer's point of view, it is evident that the story is all fiction, inspired by what actually happened. We all know there really was no American who stood for the final samurai rebellions, nor was there an American who took sides of the government. The movie also has its clear flaws if one looks at the details (e.g. there would never be any palm trees in the forests of mainland Japan, the wife of a samurai would never wear such heavy western make-up, the samurais would never be so fluent in English, etc). However, these issues are never irritating, as we could always sense a very strong, pure and innocent message coming from Tom and Ed, which I felt as a message coming from certain caring and intelligent American individuals to the nation of Japan and the Bushido (Samurai) spirit which still continues to live and influence our Japanese culture and our Japanese way of life.<br/><br/>It is no wonder American viewers have mixed feelings about this movie, partly unaware of (and lacking true interest in) the history of Japan and partly noticing the similarities between this movie with other movies made in the past. From my perspective, however, being a Japanese national born and raised in Japan and knowing the dramatic history our country has gone through, I could not help but cry feeling the respect and sympathies coming from a very successful movie star (Tom) and movie director (Ed), bothering to spend a ""Hollywood Budget"" on what is a very ""personal"" story for the Japanese. It is the fact that this film was made by Hollywood which makes this film all the more important for Japan, as it would have been just another corny self-appraisal film if created by the Japanese themselves.<br/><br/>Again, we know this is all fiction inspired by a true story and can't escape its small flaws, but I love the film all the same, and would like to thank from the bottom of my heart, Tom, Ed and others who deserve credit for thinking of creating this film in the first place.<br/><br/>I don't think a film of this nature would ever be able to receive an oscar (as I can imagine how difficult it may be for an average American viewer to appreciate the true and deep meaning of this film, not being Japanese), but I believe this is a film which should deserve some kind of a ""Thank you"" award from Japan. I would certainly like to offer one on a personal basis."

","When I watched this as a kid, almost a decade ago, I loved it. Awesome battles, yay! And when they ran it on TV a few hours ago, I was excited to watch it again. But my nostalgia filter was quickly overwhelmed by the movie's cheesiness.<br/><br/>To start with, the movie tries very hard to convince you that the samurai are the good guys and the Emperor's advisers are the bad guys. But let's think about that for a minute. The samurai are the nobility-like medieval warriors who sabotage railways and start civil wars because they lost their nobility-like status. Which included the right to execute commoners who didn't respect them. And the Emperor's people are the ones trying to reform and strengthen Japan before it becomes a European colony. But no, we get to see the samurai as noble savages, hunted down by their evil enemies and likened to the native Americans.<br/><br/>Further stomping on history, the samurai live in a small mountain village, live like Shaolin monks and refuse to sacrifice their honor by using firearms. Contrast the real rebellious samurai that the movie is based on, who were employed in government positions in cities and had no problem using guns. Oh, and many samurai accepted the reforms and joined the Imperial army, which consisted entirely of peasant conscripts in the movie.<br/><br/>None of the above would have been a problem if this was a fantasy movie, but it isn't advertised as such. And a lot of people will use it as a reference for that period of history, and for the samurai and Japan in general.<br/><br/>Moving on, we have the typical superhuman white person who has no trouble matching the sword fighting skills of the samurai after a few weeks of training. And he's apparently qualified to teach battlefield tactics to the same people who surrounded and slaughtered his own army just a few short months earlier. Oh, and he's also the only survivor of the final battle, miraculously getting missed by enough bullets to kill an army, and just shaking off the few that don't miss. That last bit is a problem with the movie in general, with the main characters being able to take multiple deadly hits and keep on fighting, for quite some time.<br/><br/>Finally, we have the ending, which literally made me yell ""Bullshit!"" at the screen. The impossible timing aside, we see the Emperor of Japan deciding that the wishes of the few dead samurai are more important than the well-being of the rest of his people. So he decides to halt the modernization of his country, right after his army had killed the only people who opposed that modernization!<br/><br/>The substance of the movie deserves 1 star, but the superb presentation elevates its score to 3."

","You know a movie has seriously missed its mark when a third of the audience (four people in this case) are pleading at the screen for the hero to die so we can please go home. Ah, but what is a great movie? Movie stars, action, spectacle, music swelling, struggle and noble ambition, new worlds unfolding before our eyes. Since The Last Samurai has all that, why is it so insultingly bad?<br/><br/>Let me count the ways. Let's start with that inability for Tom Cruise to just die and get it over with. When the only thing that comes to mind during the battle scenes is the energizer bunny, there is definitely a credibility problem. This may be a spoiler - if that is possible - so don't read on if you haven't figured out that Tom Cruise is the last Samurai. It's not some wimpy Japanese Samurai whose traditions and training go back generations, no no. THEY all die. It is the beleaguered and resigned Cruise who finally redeems all of Japan and NOBLE JAPANESE TRADITION by surrendering to the Emperor, himself, his ego and the last Samurai sword. I thought the Emperor of Japan was going to cry. Do divine Japanese Emperors actually cry? Almost.<br/><br/>
This sort of pandering is just one last unbelievable moment in what is an endlessly and insultingly manipulative Hollywood bamboozle. Let's take first the insult to Japan. What exactly does director Edward Zwick, who obviously has a real talent for battle scenes and inspirational stories, believe he is doing better than has been done in a dozen previous Samurai epics? It's one thing to remake the Seven Samurai into The Magnificent Seven. However, it's cultural hubris - to take the Samurai genre and gloss it over Hollywood kitsch and capital. The script telegraphs everything to the point that the only comparison could be Second City or Saturday Night Live. Where the script fails to elicit any emotional impact there are endless close-ups that do nothing, but demand we feel deeply, which is only possible because the maudlin musical theme asserts itself at every turn. The film even concludes on two of these meaningless close-ups and Pavlovian music moments. Is Tom Cruise even going to get the girl in the end of this unlikely epic? The close-ups say `yes'. Does it have anything to do with the story? Not really.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a wonderful actor, and he may look too pretty for this part, but even that, I think, is beside the point. The film has Cruise in many a moment of deep and picturesque meditation or blathering clichés as he learns about the nobility of Samurai culture. But these jar against the simple, graceful acting style of the Japanese actors are so capable of going from subtlety to comic exaggeration. It becomes embarrassing, like watching American tourists talk too loud in a quiet Japanese landscape.<br/><br/>
In the end the film is no less than an insult to both the Japanese and the American audience. It assumes the story can only be understood with the trappings of Hollywood excess. It's a really bad and obvious script, but, yes, it has its gorgeous scenes. That some legit' critics consider the film as masterful, is as troubling as it is to sit in the audience and feel completely manipulated. Do producers believe the movie audience is so removed from understanding other cultures and other cinemas that we have to be spoon fed formulas and cliff notes?  If that's the case we're all in trouble."

","Imagine someone giving you a neatly wrapped, elegant package: you open it and it's empty. That's what blockbusters like The Last Samurai feel like: great photography, costumes and set design, an A-list star surrounded by solid character actors, a few nicely choreographed scenes... and yet it's vapid, pointless fare.<br/><br/>Lt. John Dunbar - I'm sorry, I meant Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) - trains the Japanese Emperor's troops against rebel Samurai led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Of course Algren is the only survivor of a disastrous skirmish caused by his superiors' arrogant incompetence, of course he is captured, of course he discovers the nobility of the Samurai way of life contrasting with the sleazy mediocrity of their enemies - not the young Emperor, who, of course, is misguided but noble, although not as noble as Katsumoto, who of course comes across as a mix between Crazy Horse and Obi-wan Kenobi.<br/><br/>Question of the week: what on Earth does an American character have to do with this distinctly Japanese tale? Well, obviously he gives western audiences a white hero to identify with! Because we couldn't possibly relate to a story with only Japanese characters! (Sarcasm detectors should be beeping at this point). It goes without saying Algren becomes an accomplished Samurai in a ludicrously short time, finds the love of a pretty widow - funny how in this kind of movie NOTHING is worth doing (no quest, no fight for an ideal) if you don't get laid in the process - and is quickly worshipped by the same people he had set out to destroy. In fact, there are so many scenes in which he saves the day and is gazed at with awe that I wanted to throw something at the screen.<br/><br/>Cruise is a generally solid actor but here he gives a standard ""stoic, brooding Cruise"" performance. Watanabe is excellent, dignified and charismatic; Connolly and Spall are pretty good; the whole thing is as glossy as a luxury car commercial. The result is an oriental remake of Dances with Wolves, only without guts - and, although the last battle is slick eye-candy, hearing comparisons between The Last Samurai and the works of the late Akira Kurosawa is truly depressing.<br/><br/>5,5/10"

","The Last Samurai is a movie about the fascination of Americans for Japanese culture, more specifically Japanese heroism. But focusing on heroism alone dangerously narrows down the subject and approaching it from an American viewpoint warps and twists it into a failure. Before explaining why, here is a short summary of the plot.<br/><br/>American army captain Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is disillusioned after participating in gruesome slaughter of native American Indians. A friend of him convinces him to come to Japan to help strike down revolts of Japanese samurai, who oppose the new Meiji government's reforms. Soon he faces them, is beaten and captured, but samurai leader Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, spares his life and patiently lets him experience the Japanese lifestyle, specifically bushido, the samurai warrior code. Algren is so gripped by them that he joins their side and helps them in their final efforts to plea and fight for their cause.<br/><br/>This could have have been a nice movie. All ingredients are there: A period of turmoil with great historical importance, a clash of cultures, heroic warriors and of course a solid budget. But the movie never succeeds in convincing. There are a number of reasons for that. First, the acting is mediocre. Nobody really flunks, but never do you see one of them really being their character, instead of pretending to. Secondly, the plot follows a very predictable Hollywood path, never surprising, increasingly boring. The only surprise is that Algren manages to get into a romance with a Japanese lady, which is only surprising because you would not expect the writers to insert such a standard thing into a story that does not suit it at all. Thirdly, the sparse action scenes are shot with an overload of pomp and drama, similar to Mel Gibson - Braveheart / Peter Jackson - Lord of the Rings style, with long drawn out views of heroes dying heroically, or should I say refusing to die for minutes on end? Especially the final battle is pathetically overdone and suggest that the only purpose of the samurai was to die with honor. Did anyone ever consider that samurai also lived lives? Some people have compared this Edward Zwick - Tom Cruise combo product to the works of Akira Kurosawa, who seems to be their own hero. My advice: If you want to see a good movie about Japanese samurai, go watch movies made by the Japanese themselves. For instance, the works of aforementioned Akira Kurosawa, who could have taught Zwick and Cruise some moves."

Not all of it was realistic, and parts were very slow, but Kevin Costner put across the gentleness, kindness, and curiosity of the main character in every scene. Tom Cruise can't do that. He comes across like he does in all his movies -- like he's some cocky frat boy cooking up a prank that will get him in good with his buddies. In this case his buddies are the samurai. Lucky them!<br/><br/>BRAVEHEART is a movie about a brave people being oppressed by cruel foreign invaders who outnumber them, until one hero sacrifices everything in the name of freedom. The difference is that Mel Gibson is playing William Wallace, an actual Scot who is a first hand victim of the English. He's not some cute guy who stumbles along and decides it might be fun to switch sides. The epic battles in THE LAST SAMURAI really copy BRAVEHEART, right down to the slow motion, the sad music, and the endless bloodshed. But in Braveheart you can believe the main character has something to lose. Not so in The Last Samurai.<br/><br/>THEY DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is an old, black and white movie with Errol Flynn about General Custer being wiped out at Little Big Horn. It's quite different from the Last Samurai, but it ends with a huge battle where everyone dies. The reason I bring it up is just to discuss technique. In the old days, film makers knew how to shoot big battles so they looked fast and exciting, even when characters we loved were dying. There's no slow motion in this old movie. Just about every character dies, and they die fast and hard, yet they still have time to say something that makes you remember who they are. California Joe says ""looks like I ain't never . . . getting . . . to Californee."" And then he dies. Sharp says, ""Maybe you were right about glory, Custer."" it's not a big thing, but the emotion is there and it's real.<br/><br/>That is exactly what is missing from THE LAST SAMURAI."

Well, they don't.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise in The Last Samurai is a good example of stupid writing and ham-fisted acting, typical of all his movies after Risky Business except Magnolia. He's shoved into the role of a masculine hero with a babe on the side. Think of it -- he's a fighter jock sleeping with his aeronautical engineer instructor; he's a pool shark with a girlfriend; he's a race-car driver making it with his doctor. Here, he's a soldier cum Samurai lusting for the widow of a man he killed in battle.<br/><br/>The clichés don't stop there. The tired conceit of a diary is used to shovel soliloquies into the audience's maw between mouthfuls of popcorn and Sno-Caps. ""These are the most disciplined people I've ever seen,"" Cruise narrates in a voice-over. Later, he says, ""These people are really spiritual!"" Unable to comprehend discipline or spirituality, the writers choose not to illuminate the concepts with dramatic subtext and action, but simply to include the two words.<br/><br/>At one point Cruise, who is in love with the widow of a man he killed, is presented with a dramatic opportunity fraught with promise. He sits down next to her on a tatami when she is alone. Close-up on Cruise's painfully wrinkled brow, connoting deep thought and painful deep emotion. ""I'm sorry,"" he says, in a deeply pained voice, ""... your husband."" Does he help her, do something for her, dedicate himself to her or provide an active indication of his sorrow? No, he dumps a word on her over a cup of tea.<br/><br/>At another point, a young man tells him to fight with ""no mind."" So he mouths the words ""no mind"" whenever he fights from then on. Instead of truly creating a condition of no mind, he fills his brain with the words, ""NO MIND."" Evidently, it's a shallow vessel but quite deep enough to contain oodles of on-the-nose monologue.<br/><br/>Sitting through over two hours of these missed opportunities is bad enough, but at the end you'll be pummeled by the Hollywood happy machine on steroidal overdrive. The weak Emperor suddenly grows strong. The deeply corrupt minister is defeated. The downtrodden masses (referred to as ""the masses"") are given land. The mortally wounded Cruise is revived. The Japanese widow who spurns him suddenly drips with lust at his smile. Two malicious officers become Samurai supporters. Even the opposing army genuflects to their victims. All to a saccharine voice-over track with swelling music.<br/><br/>One of the peak experiences of my movie life took place a few years back when the Music Box Theatre in Chicago held a month-long Kurosawa/Tifune festival, playing every film made by the pair. For weeks, I swam in a sea of artistic brilliance. When I heard that Cruise and Zwick were making a samurai film, I dreaded the anticlimax, knowing that economic forces coupled with a general lack of thematic depth in their oeuvres would probably create a marginal work with lots of production and no guts.<br/><br/>It was worse than I thought, and Roger Ebert awarded it 3-1/2 stars."

","As many others have pointed out, this movie is nothing more than Dances with Samurai -- it's the identical plot line. The sweeping vistas, the way too serious actors and the very decidedly 21-first century feel of Cruise's acting choices led the viewer down a familiar path to an expected conclusion culminating in a Braveheart battle that's just dripping in Kurosawa lore.<br/><br/>Tommy's character development is executed in hyper-reality from drunken lout to honorable Japanese-speaking samurai in 60 seconds.<br/><br/>What are the Samurai rebelling against?<br/><br/>History's door is slammed shut, locked, barricaded and rewritten.<br/><br/>And if Master and Commander, arguably a better film, never reached the coveted number one spot -- why should this trite film.<br/><br/>Furthermore it pointedly ignores romance to the shock of including a widow/ Tommy possibility. I will not tell you the 'twist' of their all-too-brief sub plot. One gets the feeling it was added-on in the eleventh hour.<br/><br/>And while we're on the subject, it is humorless to the point of distraction.<br/><br/>
And lastly, who is this movie for?  Certainly not the kids who do not acknowledge any film that doesn't unfold in these hip, modern times (sic). Perhaps it is just for movie geeks. The holiday season seems a strange time to release what feels like a summer epic. <br/><br/>Awwww. But there is genius behind the cinematography. So as a travelog I think it excells beyond any of their expectations. As a holiday offering -- no."

","SPOILER WARNING!!!<br/><br/>When I first saw this movie as a 14/15 year old guttersnipe, I was dead impressed. Exciting, thought provoking, touching, everything an epic needs!<br/><br/>Of course, now I am older and wiser and understand that this movie is trying to do what many of these epics have churned out time and time before.<br/><br/>132-133 years into the past into Japan in 1876-1877 (well, actually it starts in America), Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) is parading the brand new lever-action Winchester in fairs around the country as part of America's centenary, (though sometimes losing his PTSD-riddled rag completely) and begins working for his detested and despised commanding officer Colonel Bagley to train the Japanese army in modern warfare.<br/><br/>Going over, Algren is peed off that he is ""subduing another tribal rebellion"" while at the same time stating that he ""doesn't give a damn about the Samurai"" (though they pretty much have the lie of the land here and are more than a mere tribe, let's face it! They have dirty great swords for pete's sake!) and after some poor decision making by his superior officers (just like in real life), the hastily-trained Japanese infantry is pitted against the Samurai and is knocked for six.<br/><br/>The only survivor who doesn't desert the battlefield is Algren, and Katsumoto (Watanabe) is impressed enough to take him alive. (Though this is also partly to do with the horrendous claptrap that is ""destiny"".)<br/><br/>From here on, the story is predictable. Algren is taken prisoner by the Samurai, Algren is impressed at these people as spiritual and self-disciplined warriors. Algren switches sides.<br/><br/>Back then, I didn't see the pretentiousness of the ""noble savage"" mantra that is constantly trotted out by unthinking Hollywood execs for unthinking Hollywood-junkie sheep. The Samurai didn't rebel to protect their way of life, the Samurai rebelled because the emperor had slashed their paycheck! Their women had no rights, there were untouchables in their village, progress of the human race isn't necessarily an evil thing, especially if it means that you have no right to carry a sharp sword around to randomly cut someone's head off! (Actually, there is an amusing deleted scene on the DVD where one of the Samurai beheads a smirking passer-by and somehow Algren marvels at him as he walks off - but clearly they realised that this would be a mistake to show in the movie!)<br/><br/>A couple of nagging annoyances at this film are as follows:<br/><br/>1: The constant defaming of General Custer. Sure, he was a cretin for leading his men into the Little Big Horn massacre, but he wasn't as bad as painted, not necessarily a murderer because he was quoted by an anti-Indian journalist to saying ""if I was an Indian, I'd rather live on the open plains than submit to the confines of a reservation. But I have my orders to subdue them, and return them to the reservations."" He also voiced concern over rough treatment of the Indians on these reservations. The 1868 Washita incident (or - as said and as shown in Algren's flashbacks - massacre) is a rather ambiguous one though, because despite it's depiction in the film being according to the Massacre accounts where the majority of casualties were unarmed women and children, some stories paint a different light that it was a battle, but the women and children were rounded up to a reservation after being used as a human shield from more Indians and were photographed aftewards according to the BBC, so it's hard to know which to believe. But if he is a ""murderer who fell in love with his own legend"" as Algren puts it, isn't the final battle an echo of this?<br/><br/>2: The glorification of honour and the literally ""death or glory"" culture of the Samurai is rather dubious to be the basis as an attempt to show them as the ""noble stewards of the land"" when they carry swords that can cut your head off (and would do so just as soon as look at you). I also find the ""Samurai-traditions-good-western-culture-bad"" somewhat confusing considering that the western culture does have bonuses like giving people decent human rights for once! Plus the fact that the Bushido code is the glorification of a code that inspired the Japanese armies to wreak havoc among the Chinese during the Nanking massacre (Look it up if you want the proper details, it is not pleasant!), and to slam their planes into ships long before the Saudis got the same idea to repeat the exercise with jumbo jets and buildings in New York back in 2001!<br/><br/>3: The sentimentality in this film is incredible, there's enough of it here to make The Little Mermaid look down to earth! The rubbish about destiny (I believe destiny is a monstrous pile of bull butter) and not even trying to change it (i.e. the reason why the Samurai didn't use firearms - to avoid screwing about with ""fate"", increasing the risk of being massacred!), and the confusing reason as to why a Japanese Samurai wife and caring mother of two would forgive the man who'd slain her husband and actually got with him!<br/><br/>Having moaned myself to death however, I will concede that there are some nice touches in this film. The Samurai battles are excellent and riveting, and Billy Connolly is a saving grace as a sadly short-lived Irish soldier character at the beginning of the film with some excellent lines. The settings of post-feudal Japan and the epic backdrops are very well pulled off. So if you have listened to this review and are not put off and still wish to see this film, please switch your brain off before doing so, otherwise you might just drown in a sea of sopping wet sugar!"

","Let it never be said that Edward Zwick doesn't know how to make beautiful movies.  Glory, Courage Under Fire, and The Siege are all magnificent to look at, and The Last Samurai is the most gorgeous of them all.  It is also, by far, the worst story of the four.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Algren, an American Army officer tortured by guilt over his role in the slaughter of Indians and seething with bitterness toward his former commander, Custer.  He speaks disparagingly of his comrades who died for `modern conveniences.'  So he feels conflicted when he is hired by a Japanese railroad baron named Omura to train the Japanese Emperor's army to crush a rebellion by traditionalist samurai who want to block Japan's Westernizing path to modernity.<br/><br/>Now, a word or two about those `modern conveniences' that Algren disparages. Those conveniences include living past the age of one (which about half the Western population owes to modern vaccines and plumbing), being able to read (a luxury of the church and nobility until modern schools came along), and the radical concept of constitutional democracy, which may have been conceived of in Greece but not successfully practiced until modern times. These modern conveniences are worth fighting for, and it is no credit to Algren - or to Katsumoto, the leader of the samurai rebels - that they fail to see their worth.<br/><br/>The man who does see their worth is Omura, who is made out as a villain but who ought to be the hero of the film.  He is represented as being a coward and a fool on the battlefield, but in fact he does the single bravest thing of anybody in the movie.  Katsumoto enters the imperial council chamber wearing his swords, defying the Emperor's law forbidding these weapons. Omura bars Katsumoto's way, standing unarmed before a master swordsman who could cut his head from his shoulders with one well-practiced motion, and says, `We are a nation of laws.'  Omura stands in the shoes of many Japanese who stood up for law against Japan's feudal reactionaries, and happily he wins, instead of being defeated and murdered like many of the militarists' opponents in the 1920s and 1930s1.<br/><br/>The message Zwick wants to get across is simple; the samurai lived for honor, therefore they were good.  Westerners are dishonorable, and any Japanese who wants to Westernize his country is a despicable sellout. This is simply an ignorant idealization of the samurai.  There was much to admire about the followers of bushido: allowing for individual variation, they were disciplined and brave beyond anyone else the human species has yet produced, and were taught to make and appreciate art in a manner that their Western counterparts, the medieval knights, would have scorned as effeminate.  But like all human beings, the samurai were far from perfect.  They were hidebound traditionalists who froze Japanese society in stasis for hundreds of years.  They may have protected the common folk from bandits, but they were equally capable of testing a new sword's blade by cutting down a passing townsman.  They were xenophobic to a degree even the most ignorant and bigoted redneck would be hard-pressed to match.<br/><br/>Akira Kurosawa, who understood the history of the samurai, saw through the simple-minded myth that Zwick has swallowed, as he showed through his character Kikuchiyo's speech in The Seven Samurai: `But then who made them [the Japanese farmers] such beasts? You did! You samurai did it! You burn their villages! Destroy their farms! Steal their food! Force them to labor! Take their women! And kill them if they resist!'  Kurosawa's samurai are people, real individuals with both good and bad in their natures.  Zwick's samurai are simply symbols, non-human ideals to which his guilt-ridden hero aspires.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is an excellent example of what George Orwell called `transferred nationalism.'  Orwell saw that after someone like Zwick has been stripped of attachment to his own country, he `still feels the need for a Fatherland, and it is natural to look for one somewhere abroad. Having found it, he can wallow unrestrainedly in exactly those emotions from which he believes that he has emancipated himself. God, the King, the Empire, the Union Jack -- all the overthrown idols can reappear under different names, and because they are not recognized for what they are they can be worshiped with a good conscience. . . . [Transferred nationalism] makes it possible for him to be much more nationalistic -- more vulgar, more silly, more malignant, more dishonest -- than he could ever be on behalf of his native country, or any unit of which he had real knowledge.'  This is exactly what has happened with Zwick.  His knowledge of American history has made it impossible for him to portray the U.S. cavalry or the cowboys as pure-hearted superheroes, so he has simply transplanted those traits into the samurai, and because he does not know much about the samurai he can avoid seeing that they do not live up to these ideals.  Kurosawa, with a real knowledge of bushido and its influence on Japanese culture, could never have done something so silly.<br/><br/>But despite its naivete, The Last Samurai is worth watching.  The cinematography by John Toll is breathtaking.  The acting is very good all around.  Anyone who was watching Tom Cruise with an open mind saw that he did an outstanding job of shedding his 20th-century persona.  Masato Harada is excellent as Omura despite Zwick's butchering of his character; Shin Koyamada is heart-wrenching as the young samurai Nobutada, and Hiroyuki Sanada does great work as the gruff old warrior Ujio.  There is a magnificent score by Hans Zimmer, which Zwick uses to excellent effect (there is a sequence in the final battle where Zwick times his cuts to the beat of the music, which may be the single best use of a film score that I have ever seen).  As a story and a lesson, The Last Samurai is poor; as just plain cinema, it's terrific.<br/><br/>Rating: **½ out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation:  Watch it, just don't believe it."

It was like making a New Year promise, as I started thinking about so many different things afterwards, like how much people whine nowadays at the simplest tasks etc. How badly I want to be in love...lol. How beautiful Japan is (I'm going to the Far-East for my first time in July - China). How beautifully Taka (Koyuki) was portrayed, and was not degraded once, by OTT sex scenes or nudity. Her relationship with Nathan (Tom Cruise) was so beautiful, and I felt the pain of both their lives/situations. Just shows how ridiculous wars are...you could kill a man on the battle field....and he may very well have been a good friend. However, the battle scenes were extremely well choreographed and moving and the film contained the perfect amount of action, romance and culture. As a westerner who hasn't ever been to the far-east, yet alone lived in the 19th Century I cannot comment on it's accuracy, but nonetheless I enjoyed every breath during this superb film.<br/><br/>I am now determined to practice my martial art more often, get my revision done for my exams next week!

"bkoganbing","9","16","36","19 February 2006"," The Saga of Saigo Takamori
","Although the central character is American mercenary Tom Cruise, the story of The Last Samurai is about the little known to occidentals event of the Samurai revolt of 1877 led by Saigo Takamori who operates under a different character name and is played flawlessly by Ken Watanabe. Changing his name much like the way Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were under different names in Inherit the Wind allowed for some dramatic and historic license.<br/><br/>Japan was undergoing a tremendous transformation at this point in time. The United States had with Commodore Matthew Perry's voyage in 1853 opened Japan and cracked her isolationist policy. Over 200 years before the Japanese government had instigated a policy of isolationism in regard to the countries of Europe. It seems as though they looked askance at the Christian missionaries and their activities. They put an almost total embargo on trade or contact of any kind with the west.<br/><br/>The Dutch who had very specifically not sent any missionaries to Japan were allowed some extremely limited trading rights in the city of Shiminoseki during this period. So in a limited sense the Japanese kept up with western technological developments. Firearms in fact unlike in the film were in some use in Japan even at the time of Perry's voyage. The Samurai did make some use of them.<br/><br/>Cruise is an American Civil War and Indian War hero who's making a living shilling for the Winchester Rifle company. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train a modern army for a whole lot of money and he accepts. <br/><br/>In between Perry's voyage and the events of this film, a new Emperor came on the throne. The Emperor Meiji was anxious indeed that his country catch up with the rest of the world and not become a colony of some modern technologically advanced western country. He also did not want to lose sight of old traditions. Duelling advisers competed for his heart and mind in the film and in real life.<br/><br/>Cruise's trained troops the first time they're in battle with the professional samurai turn and run. He's taken prisoner, but while in captivity grows to respect and admire Watanabe and what he represents. He also falls in love with a Japanese woman and I have to say his romance made a whole lot more sense than the one John Wayne had in The Barbarian and the Geisha.<br/><br/>The final battle scene is impressive, the samurai's own Alamo to put it in American terms. In defeat Saigo Takamori though a rebel became a folk hero in Japan. <br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a great story and Americans should see this story about a Japan they only know from World War II films, both good and bad. Tom Cruise should be given a lot of credit for using his star power to bring this story to American audiences."

"jon2005","9","11","23","22 May 2006"," The Last Samurai
","A note for the uninitiated: this is not Braveheart (1995) in a different guise. Instead, this is a far more sophisticated piece of art, a film that makes history a subject well worth investigating further. With the Last Samurai, director Edward Zwick has created a film perfectly showcasing heroism at its fullest. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars in (arguably) his finest role to date, as the American Captain Nathan Algren, who is captured by the samurai warriors he is training the Japanese army to defeat. At first reluctant to explore the new world he has been pulled into, Algren slowly begins to see that perhaps these samurai are not the ""barbarians"" that he has been led to believe they are. Usually when you see a Tom Cruise film, the mega-star status shines through instead of the character he is playing, but in the Last Samurai Cruise has presented himself admirably, as the viewer is sucked into the samurai world with him. He at once shows strength and bravery, but also compassion and a weakness of spirit, not to mention a fine sense of humour, usually directed at his samurai guard, ""Bob"". Algren's development from a drunken waste to a samurai himself is utterly compelling, and comes through at its best when the samurai village is attacked by ninja's, and Algren instantly decides to side with his captor's leader, Katsumoto.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time getting to the point of Algren's capture, but when he gets to the samurai's village, the film takes its time showing the samurai's way of life, and many people may think that this is where the film begins to drag, but this is not the case. Throughout much of his time in the village Cruise says very little, but his silent wonderment at the samurai life gives off a dramatic effect unreachable by many effects-driven blockbusters, and it is this part of the film that Zwick shows off his talents as a director. <br/><br/>However, the real star of the show is Ken Watanabe's samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is the perfect actor to play a character driven by the need to keep up the ways of his ancestors, and to stop Japan being pulled into an industrial revolution, however futile this may be. He is the true embodiment of the samurai code, never giving up, and sticking to his principles even in the face of certain defeat. Watanabe is a hugely convincing actor, making you want to root for him all the way, despite the fact that the samurai are actually fighting against the emperor.<br/><br/>This film is an action film, though. Whilst there is plenty of drama, Zwick proves himself to be an admirable action-director, whether handling the large battles of the samurai versus Japan's army, or the more intimate one-on-one fights that Algren is involved in during his time in the samurai village. <br/><br/>The screenplay is very well written; not surprising as it was co-written by John Logan, the writer for the immensely popular Gladiator. Cruise is well backed up by the supporting actors, including Billy Connelly and Timothy Spall, in a film that has been carefully crafted rather than slapped together, producing a film that, despite its relatively unimpressive box office success, is still one of the finest mainstream films that has come out of America for a long time. <br/><br/>Rated: 9/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

Now seeing it again now more mature and more knowledgeable of history this film has allot of meaning to me. It's epic, sprawling, beautiful, intelligent, brutal, honorable and most of all heart breaking.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai chronicles the story of a beaten and battered Civli War hero who's seen one too many innocent lives and people killed during his service in the war. Now in 1870's he accepts an offer to train Japans modern army to battle the samurai's, but soon in some strange twist of fate he finds himself learning form his enemy. It's an intense and heart breaking piece of film making that is of the highest caliber, it's a great and powerful film that tells a story of honor and respect and the way of the samurai. It's grand and spectacular and it gives so much of it's self and of it's story the power that it releases is in small capsules that slowly but surely open one at a time releasing strong and bracing scenes from each of them.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise deliverer's one of his finest performances of his career as the battered Civil War hero. Tony Goldwyn is fantastic in the scenes he's in he gives a very good an very convincing antagonistic performance. Billy Connolly(in his small role) does good as always and puts on a very commanding show as the good sergeant. But it is Ken Watanabe who steals the show, his performance is absolutely fantastic and stunning as the leader of the Samurai, he pulls no stops to prove himself and take his game to the next level, he is utterly fantastic. All in all the cast does extraordinarily well in this handsomely mounted film.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a blend of old traditions and honor mixed with American military strategies. This film put's up a very good fight and pulls no punches when it comes to story, characters, scenery it put's it's self in the middle of the fight as the Samurai did. It's a beautiful and grand film that needs to be cherished as much as it needs to be respected It's powerful in it's execution, beautiful in it's scenery and production and a staggering piece of film making at it's finest Edward Zwick tops all his previous films and creates a great and magnificent portrayal of what true honor is. All in all The Last Samurai delivers a truly great movie going that will not be forgotten."

","The academy awards really missed the mark with The Last Samurai. This film should have been nominated for best picture, and Tom Cruise should have been nominated for best actor -- and, in my opinion, both should have won.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is everything one wants in a movie. The story was deliberately paced and touching. The acting is superb. The cinematography is high art. The main characters learn and grow throughout the film due to their experiences with one another. The film touches you on a personal level with the character development and it also gives you a nice history lesson about Japanese culture and politics.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's character begins the film a drunken mess, disillusioned with his experiences in battle with Native Americans. He is hired by Japan to train their soldiers modern warfare. However, he is captured by the enemy, the Samurai.<br/><br/>At first, not trusting his captors, Cruise is reluctant to open up to the Samurai. Slowly, the Samurai begin to trust him, while he begins to open up to them.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the audience enjoys the beautiful scenery of the Japan countryside and old Tokyo. We learn about the struggle the Japanese people had in becoming a modern nation while at the same time trying to hold onto its rich and precious traditions.<br/><br/>This film is not to be missed. Rating 10 of 10 stars."
"Vuduguy","2","10","21","6 May 2006"," Historically inaccurate, lack of cultural understanding.
","At first, I was disappointed. With what this movie was trying to do, it was just falling short. As the film drew on, I became increasingly angry with the director's stereotypical portrayal of the samurai and lack of understanding of Meiji Period Japan. The oversimplifications in the film make Pearl Harbor look like a documentary. There is no discussion of why the samurai are angry, why they rebel beyond ""Japan is losing its way."" The fact that, after more than 250 years of almost total isolation from the rest of the world, Japan had been forcibly opened to foreign trade in 1853 is simply ignored. The rapid influx of Western ideas, science, technology and personnel and the tension this caused is considered to be of no importance. The humiliating terms of the Ansei Treaties that Japan was forced into are mentioned in passing and out of context. The traditionalist backlash, the violence, the overthrow of the shogunate--all are condensed into a bunch of angry samurai rebelling. Why are the samurai rebelling? Is it because they were stripped of their titles of nobility? Or because they were no longer permitted to carry swords? Or because they lost their government stipends? Perhaps because Saigo Takamori wasn't allowed to invade Korea? We don't know, because the movie mentions none of these things, choosing instead to depict the restriction against ponytails while reiterating that ""Japan is losing its way."" The politics of Meiji Period Japan are also horribly condensed into some oily Japanese businessmen out to make a buck by coddling to the West. The Emperor's role is horribly exaggerated; his position was almost entirely ceremonial and he played virtually no part in the political process. For him to discuss a treaty with a foreign diplomat is absurd. I could go on, but I'm running out of space."

","In 1990, Kevin Costner directed and starred in ""Dances With Wolves"", a story about a disillusioned American army officer who goes to live with native Americans and learns something about himself. The ""Fish Out of Water"" tale is an old one, but Costner and screenwriter Michael Blake managed to inject some soul into it and the result is now a movie classic.<br/><br/>Transplanting the ""Fish Out of Water"" story to 19th Century Japan doesn't work because it has no human or emotional core. All that ""The Last Samurai"" manages to do is provide Tom Cruise with another star vehicle. I reckon that there is more truth about Bushido in the comic book, ""Usagi Yojimbo"". Cruise has acted well in other movies but in this one he merely goes through the motions. He is like a man learning to handle a katana sword without understanding any of the ritual or tradition behind its use.<br/><br/>The script is a tired cliché from start to finish. Despite the director's visual flair and the efforts of the actors (apart from Cruise, who faxes his performance in from Palm Beach), the film fails to offer anything more than the odd moment of spectacle. The rest is a mish-mash of cod philosophy and second-rate political thriller filler.<br/><br/>The final battle of the film is pure Spaghetti Western and an unworthy tribute to the last real Samurai of Japan.<br/><br/>Not a truly awful film but too bland and uninspiring to be rated as highly as ""Dances With Wolves""."
"krael74","4","6","11","4 May 2004"," A pretty bit of tedium
","****Some Spoilers Follow****<br/><br/>
Here we have the familiar ""Dances with Wolves"" cliche of the American so disgusted with the evils of his own country and past that he seeks enlightenment in a grossly misunderstood and embattled culture.<br/><br/>Despite the ruthlessness of their initial introduction, the Samurai are cast almost as misunderstood peasants forced to take up arms against an invasive enemy. Despite the fact that said enemy is the emperor himself, the suggestion of blame seems to lie more with western culture...who have poisoned a gentle people with their railroads and rifles. The samurai's reliance on the sword in the face of superior weaponry seems to personify this, but is not a sword - despite it's glamourous hollywood image - an instrument of butchery as sure as a gun? Are those who carry it not just as capable of abusing it? And wasn't it the Japanese emperor himself who requested the presence of the American officers to modernize his military? Yet we are treated to righteous rebuke of the Americans by the same emperor...as if it were they who had forced themselves on the defenseless Japanese.<br/><br/>Cruise's cynicism towards war seems to vanish after his turn. If taken as a rebellion against the acts he had seen and participated against in America, perhaps you'd have a more interesting character. Instead, his turn is treated as an awakening to a higher existence...never mind said existence is leaving just as bloody a trail as the one he left behind. The usual cereal-box treatment of eastern culture is tossed out complete with the gentle imagery of flower blossoms blowing on the wind, gentle snowfall and happy, running children only to be torn apart when the brutal, bullyish forces of the emperor (but not really) arrive to kill, torment and take up swords against little boys...and even among this, we're directed to a hired American officer for our villain rather than the Emperor.<br/><br/>
Naturally, in the end, Cruise is the lone survivor of a massacre. Naturally, we're left with western culture to blame...as the American ambassador is sent packing with much bluster. It's familiar ground, just not as well executed.<br/><br/>The movie is nice enough to look at, but unless you go in for this ""western root of all evil"" hollywood cliche, I'd skip this one. At one point, our wicked Colonel Bagley asks Nathan Algren what he has against his own people. He doesn't answer. Neither does this movie."
"Ray H.","10","8","16","5 August 2009"," I (Japanese) love this film, though some scenes seem strange.
","I, as a Japanese born and raised in Japan, and living in Tokyo, have seen on TV and at theaters countless period dramas of samurais for more than fifty years. They all were written and made by Japanese, and their historical descriptions were more precise, real and convincing. Some of them were impressive and unforgettable. The film ""Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurais)"" (1954) was a typical and the most eminent example.<br/><br/>However, I love this film, really enjoyed it and have repeatedly viewed it. The biggest reason must be: This is a story of Japanese, who tried to keep Japanese own spirits and philosophy at the time of the Meiji Restoration in the mid 19th Century (dynasty change from the Shogun Government back to the Emperor), and a story of an American who tried to understand them. The last speech made by the Emperor in the film represents the thoughts and feelings which must have been unchanged during these 150 years for Japanese, who have lived, traveled or worked in other countries than Japan.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was great. His acting in this film was one of his best performances. He well expresses the agony at the beginning, the gradual changes into being healed in a beautiful Japanese village and the resolution to take sides with samurais. The last scene where he pleads with the Emperor to understand the spirit of samurais is really impressive and touching.<br/><br/>Another important factor of the great success is Hans Zimmer's music. He has been one of my most favorite composers, but this sound track is ""music in the heaven"" for me. I have listened to it every day, at the time of commuting, more than a hundred times, but never been tired of it.<br/><br/>You must see this!"

The men wear striped shirts and play pétanque everywhere they go, and ceaselessly sing chansons and discuss the writings of Michel Foucault. The women wear polka dot skirts and say oh la la. And here comes Tom Cruise, rolling his eyes and sighing 'It's all soooo French!'<br/><br/>That's The Last Samurai in a nutshell, only it's set in 19th century Japan and not in France. Samurai are primitive yet sophisticated and honorable men, meditating, reciting the heart sutra, writing haiku's, sipping green tea, enjoying kabuki theater, and contemplating the falling cherry blossoms all the freaking time. It all amounts to an okayish action flick marred by a stupendously shallow look at (and understanding of) Japanese culture. Half a Kurosawa movie like 'Seven Samurai' weighs more than ten Last Samurais.<br/><br/>Dances with samurai, indeed. What would 'tatanka' be in Japanese?"
"TheOtherFool","4","9","19","23 September 2004"," Oh no. It's one of those dying with honour movies again...

And it's exactly that. It's long, it's loud, it's purposeless, meaningless and shallow: it is, really, my worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Not that The Last Samurai is a complete waste though: there's some good acting (although the academy award nomination for Watanabe was a bit overdone) and a couple of *decent* (mind you, not *good*) battlescenes. But nevermind the story: overblown pretentious silliness disguised rather poorly as an epic action movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps for the people who liked 'Gladiator' (Oh, how I hated that movie), but if I were you I'd stay away from it. 4/10."
"jake-179","1","17","42","9 December 2003"," A long, boring let down
","***MILD SPOILERS*** I had such high hopes for this movie.  But, with my high hopes came cautious pessimism.  Of course I knew way ahead of time that Tom Cruise was the star of this movie, and he has proven time and time again that any movie that he so much as touches is ALWAYS ruined.  The same holds true for ""THE LAST SAMURAI.""  This movie was way too long, drawn out, and just plain boring.<br/><br/>
The plot is not only thin, it is underdeveloped and vague.  Tom Cruise delivers a HORRIBLE job, filled with over acting.  Right from the start we see Cruise as a ""drunken, troubled military hero.""  His performance is absolutely embarassing to watch.  The rest of the movie leading up to the poorly motivated action sequences are filled with long shots of the characters looking at each other.  This is supposed to be the characters looking in disbelief or having a moment of epithany, but it is so over done it looks like the characters are about to KISS eachother!<br/><br/>
I could go on and on about all the parts that are horribly wrong with this movie.  In particular (SPOILER ALERT) I will mention that Cruise is shot MULTIPLE TIMES with a .50 CALIBRE GATLIN GUN and he SURVIVES.  IMPOSSIBLE! Also, the flashbacks were SO amatuerish!  I couldn't believe it!  Zwick has been to film school, he should know better than to try to use flashbacks to develope his characters.  That kind of thing is better left to the real professionals.  What a doofus!<br/><br/>The only decent scene in the movie is when Cruise is training his new troops and the superior officer comes down and declares them ready for battle. So this sparks the drama between Cruise and his superior officer.  Cruise argues that the men are not ready.  As the stakes are raised in the argument, Cruise places himself in front of the men and commands them to fire on him.  That was a good scene, it was well written with good conflict and good tension...TOO BAD THAT SOLDIER WASN'T A BETTER SHOT!  He would have killed off Cruise and saved the rest of my evening from being ruined!<br/><br/>
In short, let me just say that if you want to see a REAL Samurai movie, go watch one of the many Akira Kurasowa classics.  If you have had the priveledge of viewing ""THE SEVEN SAMURAI,"" then you know why I am slamming ""THE LAST SAMURAI.""  Akira had NO WHERE NEAR THE BUDGET when he made his classics, and yet they are all MORE exciting than this overblown pile of crap!  If you have not watched ""YOJIMBO,"" or ""SANJURO,"" or ""THE SEVEN SAMURAI,"" or ""THE HIDDEN FORTRESS,"" then you have no idea what a good Samurai movie is.  It is THAT simple.  If Akira Kurasowa had the emense displeasure of sitting through ""THE LAST SAMURAI,"" he would just sit there and shake his head.  So much missed opportunity!  So much wasted effort! ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" is SO BORING!  I hated it!<br/><br/>That night, after I sat through the TORTUROUS 3 hours of ""THE LAST SAMURAI"" I went home and watched ""SANJURO.""  That satisfied my longing for Samurai<br/><br/>action.  Of course, my favorite Samurai movie is ""THE SEVEN SAMURAI,"" and if you have not seen that movie, then you don't know anything about film."

"arahman","8","5","9","15 February 2007"," A classic
","Tom Cruise's career no longer focuses on mind less action movies where the plot revolves around his cheesy grin. Whilst these movies have a place in film action history and have catapulted Cruise to the upper echelons of the Hollywood 'A' list it is safe to say that he now undertakes more complex and varied roles and is also more involved in the production of his films. Hence, one does not know what to expect from him in a historical action epic like the Last Samurai, Cruise can no longer be typecast. The Last Samurai documents the last days of the Samurai in the late 19th century and the simultaneous embracing of Western modernity by Japan. The Samurai are warriors sworn to serve their emperor to the death and whose lives are governed by a strict code of discipline, honour and dedication to their role in society. When Japan develops an arms and trade agreement with the USA the Samurai are the only ones who stand between modernism and the ancient way of life. Nathan Algren (Cruise), a tormented war hero is chosen to lead Japanese forces into battle against the Samurai but once taken prisoner embraces their way of life. The Last Samurai is a visually magnificent movie with fluid battle choreography, stunning landscapes and a detailed recreation of 19th century Japanese architecture and locations. The acting is excellent across the board with Cruise and Wantanbe (Katsumoto) delivering particularly memorable and moving performances. The action sequences are captivating, the dialogue engrossing, the story emotive and the love story whilst understated is so well executed that the movie could be billed as part of the Romance genre. Koyuki (Taka) delivers a brilliant performance as the widow who gradually changes from despising Cruise to caring for him. Whilst she has limited dialogue in the movie her expressions speak a thousand words. Special mention must also be given to Hans Zimmer's score which could actually be the most powerful score that I have ever heard in a film. High octane tracks such as 'Red Warrior' successfully get the heart racing during the film's action sequences whilst more emotive tracks such as ' A small Measure of Peace' seem to be penetrate through to the listeners soul and fit the atmosphere of the movie beautifully. Zimmer has truly out done himself this time and I fear that he will be unable to surpass this achievement. Excellent direction, strong acting performances, visual splendour, engrossing action, emotional depth and a truly beautiful soundtrack combine to deliver a deeply enjoyable and memorable movie experience. Seldom is a movie able to deliver on so many levels and in doing so The Last Samurai should be categorised as a classic in the movie history hall of fame."

","I didn't expect anything from this to be at the level of Kurosawa. In fact this has no style of its own at all...it's all about reassembling pieces of other movies into a stage for Cruise to strut and fret on. They include Zwick's own ""Glory"", Frankenheimer's ""The Challenge"", & Lawton's ""The Hunted"".<br/><br/>You see, Cruise is out to prove he can handle the big budget epic, specifically through topping the physicality of Crowe in ""Gladiator"" or ""Proof of Life"", or Gibson's ""Braveheart"". And that he can top his own ""Mission Impossibles"".<br/><br/>The most frequent comparison is with ""Dances with Wolves"", but the similarities are actually quite faint. ""Dances..."" stuck to simple, no-nonsense storytelling; its visual structure was that of a horizontal canvas. This has nothing of interest in terms of perspective (it tries to build vertically, but weakly); and it's loaded with all sorts of post-""Dances"" clichés -- the worst being the pathetic attempts to tap into the 'spirit' of a native people. Cruise comes across as though he's pitching for Honda Motor Co. <br/><br/>I know Cruise is not interested in art; he hasn't been for at least 20 years, since ""Top Gun"" showed us all he would ever really be as a leading man. He has only one objective for every production he invests in - that elusive golden statue.<br/><br/>But I am interested in art, not stardom. And if you share my appreciation of the visual master who gave us ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Ran"", you'll be equally insulted by Cruise's vainglorious exercise in egotism."

You probably also knew that the target was Kurosawa: his amazing mass combat choreography (which is more a matter of a sonata of motion than of person killing person), his samurai themes (not at all unique to Kurosawa, but he brought them to the west with '7 Samurai') and even his faces (for instance the 'speechless samurai' strongly resembles the quiet one in '7').<br/><br/>What you may not appreciate is that Kurosawa crafted every frame as Japanese painting: many layers with no perspective. He worked hard with his optics and staging to accomplish this, and was so successful that the samurai genre is necessarily tied to this cinematic world.<br/><br/>Zwick has none of that. This world is bright and deep. He really does think that the perfect blossom is a matter of physical beauty. He profoundly allies himself with the unknowing American business interests that visit with the intent of exploitation. He solidly equates this rich cinematic culture with Injuns, who he thinks can benefit what we can impose as a world view.<br/><br/>(For example, he takes the normally quick bursts of staccato Japanese, and tones them down so they have the languor of Italian. )<br/><br/>What he needs is a dose of 'McCabe and Mrs Miller,' in a double bill with 'Rikyu.' It is what you, dear reader, might view instead of this obsession with the mundane.<br/><br/>I have come to believe that the big box office stars doom every project they are in. They simply cost so much that each project demands over a hundred million in production and nearly that in promotion. So someone like Cruise automatically ruins a project because they need to water it down so much. That's before the star makes his demands, like the tackedon ending here, designed only for his mugging - and even before intrinsic limits of what the star can do. Cruise had power before, during the 'Color of Money' period. Now he's a star instead of an actor.<br/><br/>The best thing of this film to my mind was the wonderful design of the typeface used in the subtitles. It is a 'humanist' face, something between precise calligraphy and mechanical venetian-roman type. It has energy, individuality and soul, just like this film could have. These letters are servants just like the samurai, something that Jarmusch understood with ' Ghost Dog.'<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

Don't get me wrong, I generally like Cruise and his movies, but you can't sacrifice story and authentic historical research just to showcase one actor. Well you can, but it doesn't make for a good movie imo. The movie spent way too much time on Cruise and not enough on making an actual movie. Some people have compared this movie to ""Dances with wolves"", a good movie, but Last Samurai didn't have time to deal with both a similar story and the actual rebellion/westernization of Japan. Obviouslly Cruise's screen time won out.<br/><br/>2) Complete disregard for history.

And they most certainly did not train Japanese soldiers.<br/><br/>3) Story. There is a wealth of background available on the Satsuma rebellion that could have been utilized in this film. I was hoping that the film would have delved into this as a central theme, but nothing more than the bare essentials (samurai rebel against westernizing!) was used.

Go rent ""Seven Samurai"", or nearly anything by Kurosawa for that matter, and see a real Samurai movie.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 3/10 only because of Ken Watanabe's acting and some of the cinematography.

","take the ingredients of the Hollywood Western, displace it onto Asian shores, and focus it on a misfit who embodies the stereotype attributes: 1) faithless, 2) lacking in morals, & 3) reluctantly gets himself into a situation that calls for the wakening of conscience & the resurrection of his heroic ideals, now add the mythical attractions of the East from the P.O.V. of the West, and continue to enforce the believe that ""we're American, and even though there are lots of us--good and bad, we eventually will make your world a better place""...<br/><br/>what do you get in result? a typical Hollywood treatment that caters not just to entertain the audience with a long stretch of some facts with fiction, but an indirect statement that can be inferred as glorification of values that once stood tall as pillars and foundations of the American spirit.<br/><br/>Zwick probably did his research, and probably does have a lot of respect for the history, culture, and honors of the Japanese... but the film doesn't show it beyond the ""been there and done that"" plot-points we've seen in so many other films dealing with Americans in Asia (think BLACK RAIN)--""we love your sense of honor and loyalty, and your artwork and etiquette... but we have a better way--better yet, we can adopt your ways and do it better than you, and your women will end up liking us too!"" Tom Cruise hold no candle to the likes of Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada, but they are the support cast? wow, who came up with that formula? The Marketing guys thought hard about appeasing the Japanese audience with their revered thespians... but as a sidecast to Tom Cruise who basically plays the same character in every movie? movies don't have to be history books on film--all facts and no fiction, but I would expect this type of menudo to have been made in the 40's as WWII propaganda... we're in the 21st century now. If not for the innovation, audience do expect more than poorly written scripts that try to do a wool-pull over our eyes with budget and promotion.<br/><br/>and on the battle-scenes, even Wong Kar'Wai's ASHES OF TIME (1994), made on a shoe-string budget compared to THE LAST SAMURAI, presented a more compelling and heroic depiction of the warrior's fight."

","SPOILERS.................... Tom Cruise stars, though one could easily imagine the movie built around Jean-Claude Van Damme. The actor gives his flattest performance in years as a one-time Union hero who, in the film's early innings, inexplicably has turned to a life as an alcoholic sideshow performer. Despite the sorry state of his life, Cruise's character is the first guy the US government looks to when a lucrative arms deal with Japan presents itself. Please don't plan on using your brain if you are going to try and enjoy this flick. Now, in order to enjoy a film like this, you have to let several things go. First, that Algren, who has spent a considerable amount of time in the bottom of a bottle, could not only take on several samurai at once, but actually survive for more than a millisecond in order to be taken captive. Second, that in the six months of his captivity, he could go from all-American rifleman to Bruce Lee as far as martial arts are concerned. Finally, that almost everyone speaks English. It is possible to get past them, though, if you really, really try."

","Its title brings me in a new sense, whenever I recall it  The Last Samurai. When I went through the description at the back of the DVD case, to me, it was a foreign solider torn apart two worlds: Modern Japan and its traditional counterparts. Now the most interesting factor holistically is that the foreign-born military officer gets to know about the traditional flavour whereas Japan's own people do fail to identify it. My recent cram for the exam reminded how Japan switched into an open-foreign policy from a close-foreign policy during Meiji's ruling. However history records indicate Meiji continued with the Samurai backing. And I quite well remember how the Samurais were described under Meiji rule; they had reputation but no wealth because they loved their tradition. May be the Meiji's officials wanted a Samurai-free reign open to foreign policies. The Emperor must have been a cat's paw in this phenomenon hence so shown in the film. He is shown as somebody  like a protégé  of his council. When the Samurai chief approaches him for the help in presence of the council, he remains silent. But alone he renders a great helping hand to the Samurai chief by reappointing him to the council. The movie's irony is perhaps the war that happens between two peoples of a same tribe. But it reaches a crescendo when Kotsubo, the Samurai chief and the last Samurai breathes his last giving in to the enemies, his fellow people. The incessant release of skirmishers against Samurais keeps the Japanese Army General warm. He begins feeling his heart  the Japan. He suddenly commands the halt of the firing ignoring his superior's presence. When the Last Samurai breathes his last, the whole Japanese Army kisses the earth in respect of their fellow rival. This scene is followed by the signing of the agreement between US and Japan on free trade policies. However the scene is interrupted by the foreign military official's visit to the Emperor. He is here to hand over the last Samurai's sword to the Emperor. The irony here again is that it is a foreign official who leads the Emperor to trace his traditional ways and means. With receiving the sword, the Emperor becomes sentimental; he realises the futility, or perhaps the danger of maintaining the foreign relations. The Emperor remains almost silent all along the film, and begins his oratory consequently abolishing the treaty signed between US and Japan. Nathan Algren is American but Japanese in heart. Omuro is Japanese but American in deed. The encounter between Taka and Nathan is also charming. The relationship so grows gradually along with the movie itself. The relationship reaches a kind of climax with a light oral kissing. Apart from this, the bond is always shown on facial expressions. Taka's richness in her facial expressions of her feelings towards the foreign-born is really amazing. And what caught me very much is a line in Captain's journal that from the moment they wake, the Japanese devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. Captain's words pervade the film and the Japan's history on the practical end. There is not a single moment they are seen just gossiping around; all the time they are busy: men with their fights, women with their household chores. So above all, the film is so inspiring."

","The Last Samurai is a decent film. I think Tom Cruise was very good in the movie and in fact I think this maybe his best performance. His look was very fitting. All of the actors were also good including William Atherton, Billy Connolly, Scott Wilson, and Tony Goldwyn. The film has some great action but since the film is well of the two hour mark and only a handful of battles this will probably disappoint many fans of the genre. Despite the movie's slowness the end is really incredible. The music by Hans Zimmer was very good. The movie has very good direction by Edward Zwick. Everything looked very realistic like the armor the Samurai's wore was awesome looking! This film in My opinion is original and does not try to be like other films. If you like Tom Cruise and the cast mentioned above and want to see some great sword fighting action then I strongly recommended you watch The Last Samurai today!"

","Edward Zwick with his solid foundation in Kurosawa's cinema, brings the world of the samurai onto the modern silver screen to its fullest realization, while striking the fine balance between entertainment and historical authenticity. If Kurosawa were still alive I believe he would be impressed. There is no doubt in my mind that this raises ""Japanese"" cinema to whole other level.<br/><br/>It is a cinematic journey led by capable hands that do not  steer the boat in the wrong direction or rock it unnecessarily, or spring leaks along the way. which is a VERY welcome relief watching a movie about Japan from a Japanese POV, Considering how easy it has been for hollywood to go for fast buck Jap-ploitation and poor enunciation. What I like about this movie is the level of authenticity, respect and dedication with which Ed Zwick and the creative talent has handled the samurai story. There is a level of richness to this movie that would sustain delving into it as far as you want to go.<br/><br/>Essentially it is a Great Story, with Great Characters, with Great Execution, which is much easier said than done. It allows you to take a journey and discover another world and a way of being that is close to approaching the transcendent as Ive had in any modern day experience.. To me its pretty close to cinematic nirvana.<br/><br/>The combination of the creative people involved here is a Dream Team. John Logan's script - his name is what got me excited back in the beginning. Hans Zimmers score - just hit me again Maestro! Ed Zwicks Directing - he IS the Man for the Job. John Tolls Cinematography - I dont think I'll get tired of this view. Costumes - the armour looks so dam good. Sound - one word howitzer. Supporting performance by Japanese actors - makes me proud. and Tom -  performance, and dedication to the role and project. oh and vfx - if its there you dont notice it because its good. oh and Im sure the editing is top notch too.<br/><br/>I believe this is a good movie regardless, so I wont be suprised but WILL be excited when this pic recieves multiple oscars in any and all of the categories. but watch out!  because this WILL be the year that the maverick finally does good ! Im also wondering if there will be a first for a Japanese actor.<br/><br/>Tom mentioned the spirit of the film as a ""gift"" and I would have to accept it with gratitude. and to Edward Zwick my respects.<br/><br/>BRAVO<br/><br/>P.S WarnerBros please release the dvd NOW !"

","Why did they bother? What a shallow, confused, obvious and ultimately chaotic mess.<br/><br/>I love samurai films. I have a love of Japan and a love of Japanese films. I can watch even a bad Japanese film because the minute of the Japanese environment can captivate and engross. Yet the Last Samurai is so stripped of meaning, detail or subtlety that I came away wondering why they bothered.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai runs an epic, humourless two and a half hours. it seemed much longer.<br/><br/>The Meiji Restoration is a fascinating period of Japanese history. The Last Samurai examines it with all a finese and insight that can only come of producing it entirely in New Zealand. Japan looks a lot like Middle Earth. Come to think of it, the badlands of Little Big Horn look a lot like Middle Earth. No amount of blue tinting can disguise this basic, unsettling visual impairment. In the first battle sequence, you are expecting bands of orcs to come grunting out of the forest. Instead, you get samurai in *medieval* armour. Welcome to 1876.<br/><br/>Confused? Don't worry, you're not alone.<br/><br/>In The Last Samurai, for all its bushido posturing, Japan and the Japanese are a mere afterthought.<br/><br/>They got the US flag wrong too. And San Francisco. Given this, you don't have much confidence in their treatment of the history and politics of the period, or the intricacies and beauty of Japanese culture. Luckily, there's almost none. It mighty as well be Arrakis as Japan. The Last Samurai is a fantasy.<br/><br/>This is a nothing so much as boys own adventure, and brings the very best and worst of the genre. There are few women, in fact only one who counts, and she is...uh huh got it in one. Tom Cruise is Nathan Algren the curiously centreless, ammoral hero, a character without subtlety, who of course out-samurais the samurai in just a few months. Whitie wins again.<br/><br/>Cruise can bring little of the necessary gravitas to the role, little to make Nathan anything more than a action figure who can talk and bend.<br/><br/>The next paragraphs contain spoilers, an odd term in this context because there is very very little in the plotting to surprise.<br/><br/>American comes to Japan to fight rebel samurai. American is captured. American lives with samurai. You can guess the rest. Everything is perfectly two dimensional - noble rebels, complete with rebel leader who is really uh huh, grudging tough guy warrior who uh huh, and beautiful widow who uh huh. Its join the dots fantasy, rarely rising above stereotype... weak Emperor, two faced politicians, amoral Europeans. There's the obligatory 'use the force, Luke' scene, a few token culture clash scenes, and of course, the meat of the movie, lots of noble, chop-suey style battle scenes. Well choreographed, drawn out and messy, they are the heart of the film, and the measure of its appeal or lack thereof. The bushido way is death before dishonour, but heck, there's always a hollywood exception, right?<br/><br/>The entire effort is curiously humourless, even given the serious themes and supposed dramatic depth of Cruise's character. The film has one good joke, completely out of genre, that takes us into Kevin Smith territory. (What was the name Ethan gave to his minder?)<br/><br/>Billy Connolly makes an all-too-brief appearance as Nathan's loyal NCO. As the film dragged on, I kept thinking what a much more satisfying movie this might have been if it was Zebulon who was captured and whose story we followed. There would have been a film of much greater humanity, sensitivity and humour, if less macho posturing. Alas.<br/><br/>What troubled me most of all was the moral confusion at the heart of the film. What was the message again? A generation on, those bushido values led to the Japanese invasion of China, Pearl Harbor, and beyond.<br/><br/>Kurosawa, at least, never forgot that."

","I would say this movie held my attention until Tom Cruise is captured by the rebel band of Samurai.  From that point forward it was all down hill.  Not only is the dialogue mundane when it is trying to be prophetic, but it also leaves you feeling totally dispassionate about the characters.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was a bad choice.  He is supposed to be a man of stature and experience - a man who has seen the worst of the Indian Wars.  Instead what we have is Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise.  Sometimes drunk, sometimes sober. His natural build does nothing to enhance his credibility, either.  I see no real emotion from Cruise in the character, but simply a man trying to be somebody else.  It just wasn't believable.<br/><br/>One thing I would ask my fellow reviewers is:  Don't you feel the ending was totally over-blown?<br/><br/>I found it personally insulting when, in the film's final battle, both main characters are shot all to Hell by bullets flying everywhere.  There is what is supposed to be an emotional scene between the two leads holding each other at death, which is so silly and over the top that it makes me wonder what the author was thinking.  Then Cruise, after having been shot full, is seen staggering into the Imperial Palace in a clean uniform.  He respectfully hands over the rebel sword to the Emperor.  That triggers an emotional dialogue between him and his ambassador.  It is a meaningless conversation about their past coming to an end and the tragedy of it all. It is supposed to be deep and meaningful.  All it really succeeds in doing is dragging the movie on for another five minutes.  Finally Cruise, (because Hollywood believes its' audiences just can't stomach a sad ending) is filmed walking off into the sunset, with trusty horse in tow, to the quiet little village of the rebels.  At least I had a good laugh here...<br/><br/>I wish I could stay so healthy after being shot up so well.  I wish I could find meaning in dialogue that has no sense of real human feeling or even so much as a complete understanding of what the characters are really suffering through.<br/><br/>Too bad David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, or John Huston aren't around today. If they were, this film could have been a masterpiece handled by men who could appreciate a story like this.  All we have is a typical example of a Hollywood film that carries a good concept, but is never fully explored. Hollywood today should stay with action films and comedies.  Serious drama is not something the industry seems capable of exploring - thanks in part to the cash culture of the business."
"FilmSnobby","3","7","15","6 December 2003"," Cruise discovers Kurosawa; audience pays the price.
","Tom Cruise stars in  *Dances With Samurai* . . . er, *The Last Samurai*, a movie that asks us to bemoan Western cultural imperialism while at the same time being a piece of Western cultural imperialism.  But that shouldn't particularly bother American audiences, who are never so happy when spoonfed the same mush over and over.  And boy, is this movie the same mush!  It takes its plot directly from Costner's  *Dances With Wolves*, right down to the Civil War era  (OK, this takes place a little after the War)  and even the journal kept by the hero.  And once again, this movie, like Costner's, proposes the patrician notion that only a scion from Western Civilization can possibly teach the older and presumably more naive culture about just how corrupt Westerners can be.  Again, the hero renounces his own culture and thoroughly steeps himself in the alien one, and again the benefits of the cultural exchange are given primarily one way:  FROM white, TO Other. AND AGAIN  (sorry to keep repeating myself, but  *Samurai*  and  *Dances* are really the same movie), the story tries to have its cake while eating it, i.e. by trashing the Westerners as corrupt while carefully eliding any unpleasant aspects of the older culture it purports to elevate.  Meaning, we see none of the degrading subjection of women, the narrow and limiting tradition of the tribal blood feud, the empty militarism at the expense of cultural broadening, the rigid caste system, the scientific and medical ignorance, etc. etc.  On the contrary.  The village where Cruise is held prisoner during the winter and spring is seen as an idyllic paradise where its inhabitants spend every waking hour doing some self-improving activity or other.  It's a village run by some pretty nice warlords.  Needless to say, Akira Kurosawa wouldn't have made this movie.  (Remember farmer Mifune's excoriating of the samurai in  *Seven Samurai*?)<br/><br/>But it's inevitable, and doubtless intended, that this movie will be compared to some of Kurosawa's samurai epics, particularly the later ones like  *Kagemusha*  and  *Ran*.  To give  *The Last Samurai*  its due, the swordfights and the climactic battle are very well executed:  staged intelligently, and throbbing with catch-your-breath excitement.  Director Edward Zwick shows that the superb battle scenes in his earlier  *Glory* were no fluke:  if anything, he has improved as an action director.  The great battle in this movie excels Gibson's accomplishment in  *Braveheart* by a good measure, and even touches Kurosawa's savage beauties.  But that's where the artistry -- and the comparisons to Kurosawa -- end  (or should end, if there's any critical acumen out there).  I'm sorry to say that Mr. Cruise, perhaps even out of a love for Kurosawa's old films, just couldn't resist the ample opportunity to horn in on one of cinema's great traditions. Perhaps the ego dictated that he could  ""add""  to this tradition, or at any rate make it  ""accessible""  to modern  (and American)  audiences.  One hopes the Japanese won't be fooled:  surely they'll see that what this movie is REALLY about is Tom Cruise, not the warrior caste of old Japan.  It's about HIS sufferings, HIS saintly guilt, HIS learning of an alien, old tradition (and HIS subsequent improving of it), HIS romance with the beautiful widows who can't help falling in love with HIM because HE is, after all, Tom Cruise Of The Magnificent Long Hair Blowing In The Wind, and finally HIS moral supremacy over everyone else in the movie.  Armies genuflect to, Emperors and warlords take advice from, HIM.  Or, to sum it all up in a line:  ""SHOW ME THE MONEY!!!"""

Except for some scenes where there were one-on-one fights, NO SAMURAI will fight in the way they were portrayed in this movie. The sword fighting scenes were especially awful.

The solutions proposed: ghost dance, more perfect adherence to the ways of the ancestors, hierarchy-worship, a servile acceptance that some are born to fight and others are born peasants, and the fetishization of a ""glorious"" death, are all immature and unhelpful.<br/><br/>The movie is self-conscious enough (of course being set in the past, and knowing how it all turned out helps) to know that its ""answers"" are not actually useful, but is also completely uninterested in this --- what matters is that we have an excuse for explosions and sword fights.

","Directed by Edward Zwick, ""The Last Samurai"" is the story of Civil War veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a man who is fighting his inner demons that originated from some actions against Native Americans that he didn't feel so good about. So he drinks a lot and is a freelance military adviser. His latest assignment is to go to Tokyo with some former colleagues and train the Emperor's troops in modern weaponry so they can defeat the last of the country's Samurai. During their first battle, he is captured by the Samurai who then take him under their wing, helping him heal his wounds and teaching him how to fight, etc. When the time comes to return back to his ""rightful"" place, he makes the choice to fight with the Samurai, who he now relates to most of all.<br/><br/>I'll say it right out of the box I really didn't like this movie that much. The film drowns in clichés: The slow motion fight scenes, the shots of Cruise in silhouette at sundown, practicing his moves, the screams of ""Noooooooooo"" as the incredibly wounded men charge, and Cruise getting knocked down five times during one of his early sparring matches, yet refusing to stay down because he's just a scrappy guy these are just a couple of the things I found myself rolling my eyes at. I rolled my eyes at those scenes, I chuckled at the fact that he managed to keep a perfectly trimmed beard and clothes that miraculously cleaned themselves after a fight in the rain and mud, and was actually howling during Cruise's detox scene in which he yells ""Sake!!!!!!!!!!"" over and over. But I was downright confused after the fight in the alley between Omura's henchmen and Cruise; we experienced the fight once, then suddenly he goes slo-mo and we have to watch the entire fight all over again. Why?! Don't even get me started on the ending. When he walked through the door to chat with the Emperor I almost fell out of my seat; I couldn't believe the film would seriously end that way.<br/><br/>I did not hate everything about the film. I thought that Ken Watanabe was phenomenal, and I really liked the fact that they spoke a lot of Japanese. I can't stand it when films think we assume that everyone in the world speaks flawless English. I think that the decision to keep the native language as pervasive as it was, was a good thing. The ninja scene was good, and there were also some great shots; particularly landscapes. However, these things only raise my opinion up from an extremely low position, they don't save the film for me. It was ironic that I watched this when I did because I watched ""Rashomon"" the day before, a film that was made 55 years prior, on a tiny fraction of the budget of ""The Last Samurai"", which got me thinking about Kurosawa. Of course, it is very difficult to compare Kurosawa to most filmmakers of this genre because he is pure genius, but conversely, it is sad that a film that does have the benefit of finances and precedents could make such a pale comparison. Also, when did someone decide that Tony Goldwyn was going to be THE bad guy in every movie ever made? It's become almost cliché at this point; go figure that he would be a part of THIS film.<br/><br/>I suppose if you like Tom Cruise, historical epics, or action films you should see ""The Last Samurai"", but it is barely mediocre, and although I had low expectations going in, I was still very disappointed. Merely because of the handful of positive aspects of the film, I give it a 5/10, a generous assignation in my opinion.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Deliberately paced and opulent production from director Ed Zwick (of ""Glory"" and ""Courage Under Fire"" fame) tells the story of a U.S. military adviser (Tom Cruise) in the post-Civil War era who is hired, along with several others, to modernize the Japanise Army in 1876. Cruise has to work with friend Billy Connolly and nemesis Tony Goldwyn in the venture, but the fact that he is being paid handsomely makes it a relatively easy decision to go to the exotic land. However it seems that the only true purpose for Cruise and company to go to Japan is to wipe out the last of the samurai warriors. The Japanese government and people look at the group as savages who must be wiped out because they pose a legitimate threat to everyone else (this is a strange view in the film though). After training a group of farmers and civilians, Cruise and his men are ambushed. The event leaves many of the commoners dead and strangely leaves Cruise a hostage (the only one taken). Samurai leader Ken Wantanabe (in what could possibly be a star-making role) is fascinated by Cruise and his military background. He looks at the enemy as an interesting counter-part rather than a sworn adversary. Tension continues as Cruise is nursed back to health by Koyuki (Wantanabe's sister and the widowed wife of one of the warriors Cruise killed). Soon though Cruise comes to realize just how honorable, respectful and classy the samurai way of life is. Sure it may not be what he is used to, but Cruise had become a war-weary alcoholic due to things he was used to. Youthful puppet emperor Shichinosuke Nakamura is constantly put in bad situations as he is torn by his friendship with Wantanabe and what everyone else in his country wants (the elimination of the samurai life forever). Modern warriors and new battle-styled technologies are bound to clash in possibly the most bloody of ways. ""The Last Samurai"" is a near excellent movie experience. Admittedly the set-up is difficult and the first act of the movie is honestly pretty bad. However Zwick uses a good tone and interesting characters to keep the audience going and then the movie reaches a near classic level. Cruise is a revelation (as he usually is). He is almost always near the top of his game and this is no exception. Wantanabe though practically steals the show. His character is quietly humorous, intelligent, sophisticated and definitely has an intense depth as well. Zwick, who is arguably the least respected director in Hollywood today, once again proves he can handle intense battle sequences and quiet character moments as well. The heart, soul and intelligence that made ""Glory"" and ""Courage Under Fire"" such wonderful productions once again shine through here (though probably not quite as brightly). Perfect cinematography by John Toll and an unforgettable score by Hans Zimmer just accentuates all the good things that are found within. Definitely makes a case for the best film of 2003. 4.5 out of 5 stars."
"harrymadsen","1","11","28","26 November 2003"," Over the top and superficial
","A major disappointment.<br/><br/>How many times must we see bloody battle scenes shot in mind numbing slow motion to the strains of overpowering string music?  Apparently, the filmmakers who brought us The Last Samurai think we need to see it many more times.  My guess is that Ed Zwick and his team meant to portray the horror of war, but guess what, we got it after the first thirty minutes. Showing the same thing over and over again, especially when the result is pre-ordained does not make for good film making.<br/><br/>And it's not like the script offers much of anything in the way of characters.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but don't expect any insight into any of the characters, they are strictly superficial, have no life of their own besides trading platitudes with each other and you keep waiting for them to develop but they don't.  And this coming from the screenwriters who wrote Thirtysomething and Once And Again.  It makes you wonder if there's any place for good screenwriting in today's studio films.<br/><br/>Another major problem is the complete inconsistency in the main character's fighting ability.  After slaying countless Samurai warriors, he finds himself unable to resist for more than three seconds when, taken prisoner he trains with them.  And given that this training takes a good half hour of screen time, that is no minor peeve.<br/><br/>Another major screenwriting snafu is that apparently, Ed Zwick and his crew were too busy filming everything in slow motion that they didn't notice that at no point is the reason for all this fighting explained.  Maybe they have a degree in Japanese history, for they clearly are quite bright and display a real interest in Japanese culture that bring about one of the the sole qualities of the film, but the rest of the audience doesn't.  I know about the Meiji era being the time of cultural upheaval when Japan modernized itself by importing Western ideas and knowledge, but that's about it.  I was looking forward to learning more but after the first ten minutes of the film, the bloody gore takes over and any insight into Japanese history is forgotten.<br/><br/>Add to that a picture quality that was much less than satisfactory (was the whole film treated with a low resolution digital intermediate, because it lacked any sharpness or detail in the blacks in 90% of the shots) and you have a film that can be summed up as a complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs unless you're a major Tom Cruise fan (and he does a great job with what little the script gave him) and you need to see every frame of every project he's in."

Anyone with a modicum of taste should have seen the dailies and pulled the plug, or at least fired the director of photography and the director. B But of course John Toll and Ed Zwick have the awards. It proves they're great, so the Studio executives think, in the way they always neglect to use their heads.<br/><br/>John Toll's photography is terrible and Ed Zwick can't direct action. The two together makes for an unwatchable, if expensive, piece of tripe that repeats itself ad nauseam because the screenwriter, probably inspired by the director, neglected to have a story that could extend past 20 minutes without endless boring repetitions.<br/><br/>speaking of repetitive, how about those endless, boring, slow-motion scenes. Will someone give a clue to Zwick and his bad action director brethren that slow-motion is not touching, nor is it a way to make the violence more poignant. It works when used in small doses, something the Studio bosses don't understand.<br/><br/>And then they wonder why the box-office keeps sliding. It's films like The Last Samurai that turn you off going to the theater again."

","The Last Samurai (2003): Dir: Edward Zwick / Cast: Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Billy Connolly, Tony Goldwyn, Timothy Spall: Epic action film that educates viewers on the meaning of samurai. It means to serve and Tom Cruise is sighted as the last server. He is assigned to train soldiers in a war against samurai warriors but they are not ready. Waging into war he watches his troops get demolished until he sinks into exhaustion. Strangely he is treated with respect and wanders freely about a village with an overseer. Although he challenges the leader he comes to realize that the so-called enemies are actually peaceful. Fine setup falls into clichés before its predicted battle where Cruise really becomes the last Samurai. Director Edward Zwick presents great sword play action but the screenplay is weak and seems to xerox the same clichés that are common with these films. Cruise is strong but Ken Watanabe delivers the strongest performance as the samurai leader. Where the film goes off track is when it sidelines its themes for a mindless climax that serves mainly as an action set piece. Also with Billy Connolly and Tony Goldwyn in flat roles that amount to nothing. Technically well made film that dapples between theme and message although the lifestyle of the Samurai at least render a point of view. Despite action clichés the film gives insight upon those who oppress us. Score: 6 / 10"

"jazzest","5","3","5","29 July 2004"," The Late 19th Century Is Not Suitable For Samurai Epic
","This samurai epic made by American filmmakers realizes an exotic fantasy towards Middle-Ages Japan for some people from the West and an idea of multiculturalism for everyone else, but a late-19th-century setting weakens the film's backbone. While the setting is a necessary excuse for the filmmakers because that was the time when an American could go to Japan and be a part of a guerrilla samurai group, it is apparently not suitable to portray samurai positively, when they are the obsolete people who cannot adapt themselves to the changes. With the emperor clearly pictured as a puppet of the new government, the motivation of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) to support him and resist the government is unclear and maybe historically inaccurate; throughout the Middle Ages, the nation of Japan had been ruled by a samurai government that also used the emperor as a figurehead.<br/><br/>Technical note: Montages are overused; almost all scenes are established by them."

","Last Samurai is one of those underrated films that truly is not another Hollywood concoction or cliché. Kudos to Ed Zwick for not getting into stereotypes and doing research.<br/><br/>It manages to exist on a number of levels, as a superbly competent action thriller, and as a cultural study into the relationship between the U.S. and Japan. It manages to exist on these multiple levels without sacrificing any for the good of another. It has at its center a complex spherical character in Tom Cruises' character.<br/><br/>There are also strong supporting characters in Ken and the other Japanese characters. <br/><br/>Ken's character is a man who stresses honor and propriety, who is at first repelled by Cruise's character and his ways. As the film progresses, he comes to a greater understanding of Cruise's character and comes to respect him as a shogun, as a man of honor, and as a friend. <br/><br/>On top of all these elements, the film also delves into cross-cultural issues, namely how Japan and the U.S. are different in terms of honor code, civility and customs. It spends some time on the mutual exclusivity of these two cultures, how one cannot exist without the other, and how the have helped shape and form one another over many years without favoring one or the other.<br/><br/>All these things combined the film still manages to maintain itself as a highly competent action thriller, with taught suspenseful pacing, and an intelligent storyline. It also contains one of the best and most memorable endings in recent years, which alone makes the film worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone who might enjoy this unconventional type of shogun-type film, a film with depth and intelligence.

"crzymnky","9","2","3","2 March 2018"," This Is Not Your Usual War Film.
","In The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise and Ken Wantanabe star in an original historical fiction film that takes place during the Meiji restoration period of Japan. In 1868 under Emperor Meijia rule, Japan was involved with an unprecedented chain of events, which restored practical imperial governmental power to Emperor Meijia over Japan. Primarily, one side of Japan wanted to stay with traditional Samurai warrior practices. Katsumoto, played by Ken Wantanabe, stood by these beliefs and practices with the way of the samurai. On the other hand, Emperor Meiji wished to advance into a new and modern Japan. 
Emperor Meiji acquired the assistance of the Americans to fight the revolution against the samurai; this is where Tom Cruise's character comes into the story. Playing a decorated yet ragged Civil War veteran named Nathan Algren, drifting through life with no purpose and drinking away his war-torn suffering in hopes to forget the horrific actions he was forced to commit against the Native American people. Hired by the Americans to train the army of the Japanese emperor in an attempt to eliminate Katsumoto's fearless and drastically outnumbered Samurai squadron. In Algren's efforts, he was captured by Katsumoto, with no casualties from the samurai side. During Algren's captivity, he sees the beauty in their culture. Learning the way, the Bushido Spirit, of the Samurai and siding with Katsumoto and becoming ""one with the samurai."" Algren finds peace in this way of teaching because of its values of honor and internal morals it has against war and death. The institution of the samurai only bound Katsumoto and Algren together even closer, from enemies to brothers. <br/><br/>In review of Edward Zwick's work in The Last Samurai, we have to acknowledge his previous films. Zwick is known for various historical pieces such as Glory, Defiance, Legends of the Fall, and one of his most successful works, The Last Samurai. This action and adventure/drama not only includes some of the most significant choreographed fighting scenes in the film industry but also with the fantastic official soundtrack orchestrated by the legendary German film score composer Hans Zimmer that ties the film into a perfected unison. The first time I saw this movie, I was deeply affected by it. An essential element that I took note of during my review of this film is while the battle scenes are gloriously epic, and indeed everything looks brutally realistic, the battle sequences were not the primary focus of the film. The center of The Last Samurai was a deep friendship that blossoms between Katsumoto and Algren. They both come from two very different cultures that would not have met if it wasn't for war in the mid 1800's. Despite their differences, two cultures who were clashing at the time learned from their differences and found similarities in one another, binding them in unison. The idea of coming together with the mind and soul into one is a crucial element of the samurai way of teachings in the Bushido Spirit, which is prevalent in the film as exponential teaching and growth. This element in The Last Samurai was very emotionally resonating because usually, movies with a war theme like this leave me at a rapid disillusionment with the slow segments within the film's plot, waiting for the battle sequences to come back. For The Last Samurai, this is not your usual war film. <br/><br/>There is an extreme lack of CGI that still holds up 15 years later. So much of the film's epic battle sequences are adapted by just cinematography alone with traditional and effective camera tricks. With those impressive cinematography skills, the film is bound by fantastic editing, which is added by the magical touch of Hans Zimmer, beautiful scenery, and impeccable costume design. In the sense of unison, The Last Samurai shows direct traits of the Bushido Spirit. This sense is backed up by having everything inside the film universe having a purpose, everything in The Last Samurai happens for a reason. There are no costumes or extra deaths in the battle scenes for a ""just because"" effect. All the factors are implemented into the film to give a binding unison with The Last Samurai Universe. To this day, the audience would agree that this film is still today looks visually enthralling. <br/><br/>Zwick's decision to focus on this beautiful friendship between Katsumoto and Algren, in The Last Samurai, is a central theme in the film. We as an audience see both Katsumoto and Algren grow together from enemies to brothers. This theme of the film leaves the audience excited for every scene that follows with the impeccable acting from Cruise and Wantanabe in their character development. One thing that should also be mentioned, at the time this film was initially released, there was a lot of controversy for having a white lead who wins the day in a foreign culture. These complaints, in my opinion, are from people who have never seen the film. The Last Samurai is about two cultures that were at war with one another, who learned to work together, respect one another, and became almost family with an bonding love for each other. <br/><br/>Ken Wantanabe's character is one of my favorites in this film, playing the part of Katsumoto. The audience is presented with a jaw-dropping performance from a man, who at the time, was never really heard of. Wantanabe conveys such a passion and devotion. The character Katsumoto is seen to have such a love for his country, for his country, for his culture, for his emperor, but Katsumoto believes the Emperor is going in a cultural direction that is against traditional beliefs of Japan. Katsumoto is then forced to separate himself from worshiping the Emperor to preserve the way of the samurai and the Bushido Spirit. This makes Katsumoto such a compelling, conflicted, moving character that contrasts with Tom Cruise's character similarly. Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is feeling very similar conflict struggles that Katsumoto is enduring within the film. When Algren is captured by Katsumoto and his forces the relationship between the two leading characters is seen as a struggle to find similarities. Katsumoto views Algren as a drunken barbarian because of Algren's American background and the reputation for savagery towards the Native American people/. From Algren's perspective, he views Katsumoto and his people being uneducated, ancient, stubborn, barbarians for fighting in battle against lines of muskets with only swords and basic armor. As the film progresses, Algren sees that he is being trusted into an utterly different culture, that reminded him very much of the Native American people. Understanding that, even with an emphasis in war and combat the samurai people, Katsumoto believes in an emphasis of finding peace with oneself, a unity in the body and soul, something that Nathan Algren has looked for in almost all of his life. The samurai way of teaching works and loves one another in their community, dying for one another without a moments notice. The theme of compassion, friendship, and understanding is prevalent throughout the film. <br/><br/>The Last Samurai resonates with Zwick's style of filmmaking, with it's beautiful and vast battle scenes, lengthy run times, and incredible soundtrack that ties it all together. This film has always been a favorite of mine for as long as I could remember and comes with a story that isn't like any other. What is pulled off in this film is hugely impactful with the audience. Having the ability to convey such a compelling story between two cultures, showing that no matter how different our views are, or what our beliefs are, we can find a common ground and unity with one another through compassion for another human being."
"Tyson14","10","2","3","31 May 2015"," Grand & Entertaining a mixture of history and fiction
","The honour and code of the samurai has always been enticing to a Western civilisation that is far removed from such customs, which perhaps makes The Last Samurai such an enticing, enigmatic film. Edward Zwick crafts quite an epic adventure rich in mythology & thematic resonance that while traditionally Hollywood in its construction still manages to exist a cut above many such movies of its ilk, a touch of class surrounding how the story of Captain Nathan Algren is put together, based as it is on several real life legendary American figures who played key roles in the Satsuma Rebellion in Japan during the late 19th century. This isn't a direct re-telling of those events but serves as a leaping off point to construct a tale about a stranger in a strange land, of a man haunted by fighting an unjust war who rediscovers his honour & place in the world through a dying culture. Zwick's film is slick, sweeping, beautifully shot and frequently involving, backed up by a strong performance by Tom Cruise in one of those roles that remind you just what a good actor he can be.<br/><br/>In the role of Algren, Cruise begins a dejected man living out of a bottle, bereft of purpose & suffering post-Civil War nightmares of a man touted as a hero despite feeling the guilt of slaughtering Indians crushed under the might of a military machine; in that sense, The Last Samurai is very anti-war in its message, John Logan's story painting the Americans and specifically the Imperialist Japanese not in the greatest light. Cruise takes Algren on a traditional voyage of discovery, first pitted against the samurai code & eventually becoming consumed by it, consumed by the similarity of the way of the warrior between both cultures - and Ken Watanabe's dignified samurai 'rebel' Katsumoto learns from him, as well as the other way around, with Cruise remaining stoic & only getting flashes of a chance to display the usual Cruise charm, but that's OK - Algren isn't the kind of character to benefit from that, Cruise's natural magnetism is enough here. Wit is provided thankfully through, albeit briefly, Billy Connolly as a tough old Irish veteran & chiefly Timothy Spall as our portly 'narrator' of sorts, who serves to help mythologise Algren & the legend itself. Zwick is most concerned with that, you see, the idea of legends and how men become them, exploring that concept alongside digging into the cultural rituals and practises of a changing Japan.<br/><br/>Logan's story is placed at a time when the old ways of Japan were shifting, under the pressures of global politics & business; the Emperor here is a naive young man, sitting on an empty throne, looking to Watanabe for validation as his advisor's push to quash a rebellion fighting to preserve the old ways, preserve Japanese interests as America knocks on the door. That's why Cruise's role here is so interesting, his character learning of the samurai code & helping those around him remember their history, and Zwick explores well the concept of national identity alongside personal ideas of myth, legend & destiny. It all boils together in a careful script, never overblown, which neatly develops the relationships involved & helps you fully believe Algren's transformation into the eponymous 'last samurai'. Along the way, Zwick doesn't forget theatrics - staging plenty of well staged & intense fight scenes which utilise the strong Japanese production design, before building to a quite epic war climax with army pitted against army, with personal stakes cutting through it, backed up indeed by another superlative score by Hans Zimmer. It becomes more than just a historical swords & armour film, reaching deeper on several levels.<br/><br/>What could have been a slow paced, potentially ponderous movie is avoided well by Edward Zwick, who with The Last Samurai delivers one of the stronger historical adventure epics of recent years. Beautifully shot in many places, with some excellent cinematography & production standards, not to mention an impressive script well acted in particular by Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe, Zwick creates a recognisably Hollywood picture but for once a movie that doesn't dumb down, doesn't pander and ultimately serves as an often involving, often damn well made story. Especially one to check out if you love the way of the samurai."

What sets this apart from all the others is the sheer breathtaking beauty of the cinematography, the level of authenticity in recreating ancient Japan, the attention to detail in depicting Samurai culture, and the utterly brilliant Ken Watanabe in the supporting role as the legendary Samurai warlord Katsumoto. On a deeper level the film also serves as a poignant observation of how technological progress and so called civility can destroy century old tradition to the heartbreaking detriment of society.<br/><br/>Initially the Samurai are depicted as vicious warmongering savages. However along with the character of Nathan, played by Tom Cruise, we are taken on a journey of enlightenment to the Way of the Samurai so emotionally gripping and compelling that the viewer cannot help but feel completely awestruck by the end credits. This is a film that you will remember for a very long time and that you will re-visit time and again.<br/><br/>If you like beautiful visuals, if you like excellent acting, if you like breathtaking action, and if you like historical fact instead of the usual Hollywood embellishment, then this film is definitely for you."
"tburke85","9","2","3","9 May 2010"," The Last Samurai An Entertaining Action Adventure Drama
","The Last Samurai is an entertaining action adventure drama that was much better than expected. Writer/Director Edward Zwick is admirable in making this action adventure epic tale about Nathan Algren a disillusioned Civil War Captain who goes to Japan to fight the Samurai and instead ends up pledging himself to their cause. Tom Cruise stars as Algren and he turns in probably one of his best performances to date. In recent years he's been getting a lot of crap from the press because of his behavior but Tom Cruise proves to still be a talented actor none the less with this film. Cruise immerses himself into the character Algren who goes through a major transformation and he certainly shows his range as an actor. Well done. Ken Watanabe is equally impressive as Katsumoto, a Samurai leader facing a vanishing way of life, whose destiny becomes intertwined with that of the American Captain. Watanabe proves his talent as an actor giving audiences such a well rounded character in Katsumoto who eventually gains your sympathy because you know this man is willing to die in order to protect his people. Watanabe had nice chemistry with Cruise which really showed on the screen making their growing friendship and respect for each other very believable. Timothy Spall is convincing as Simon Graham a cynical Britich translator in his limited screen time who helps Algren in his quest. He provides a little comic relief from time to time that lightened up the serious mood of the film. Tony Goldwyn does a pretty good job as the villain Lieutenant Colonel Bagley whom Algren deeply hates despite not being given a whole lot to do in his short screen time. Goldwyn does what his role requires though. Billy Connolly does the best he can with his small part as Algren's old army colleague Zeb Grant whose written out rather quickly but like Goldwyn he does a decent job with his brief role in the film. The rest of the cast including the family Algren stays with while among the Samurai and the men who them played all turn in exceptional performances. The epic battle sequences are well executed/paced, intense, and realistic giving audiences a look at what warfare was probably like back then. For a film that's 154 minutes I was worried it would feel overlong like (Artifical Intelligence, There Will Be Blood, or Avatar to name a few) but the story kept my interest making the running time fly by at a steady pace. It's one of those rare two and half hours movies (with the exception of The Departed, The Dark Knight, and Blood Diamond which were about just as long but kept me entertained throughout it's running time) that I can watch easily without getting bored because the film pulls you in with a compelling story and interesting characters. In a way The Last Samurai shares similarities with most recently Avatar but I thought it was much better handled in this one than James Cameron's overlong sci-fi action adventure which was a letdown considering the hype built around it at least to me. The Last Samurai has some flaws the good however more than outweighs the bad with this one. A few characters (Connolly and Goldwyn particular) sort of get the short end of the stick development wise but I guess they're in a long enough so you know a little bit about them. Other than that though there wasn't too much I didn't enjoy about this film. Also worth mentioning is the music by Hans Zimmer which fit the tone of the film perfectly and was full of emotion. The location they chose for the setting was beautiful. It added so much with very little CG which they blended into the story seamlessly without going overboard on the effects (A mistake I feel Tranformers 2 made). Overall The Last Samurai is a well made action adventure drama epic that was much better than I anticipated. It's now one of the my all time favorite films along with The Dark Knight, The Departed, Batman Begins, and Blood Diamond to name a couple which were all epics in their own way. If you're looking for a good entertaining movie to watch than you can't go wrong with the Last Samurai. It has character development, just enough of intense action, drama, some suspense, a little humor, and impressive performances by the cast (especially Cruise and Watanabe) who make this film worth the time to watch. You won't be disappointed with this one."

","There are flaws in this film. The ending is Hollywood, the mattework of Yokohama Bay is weak, and maybe a few other things, but there is also a great deal right with it.  The filming is gorgeous, the acting very good, and the story deserving, if not inspirational. The technical depiction of the arms and armor is sensational. My personal take on the film may be very different than much of the viewing public because I am a longtime martial artist and have studied sword.  Those aspects of the film are absolutely excellent on the whole. There are minor things (***maybe spoilers!***) ... for instance, hitting people with a boken (wooden practice sword) doesn't give them a bloody nose of make them limp - it breaks bones, period. Tom Cruise throwing his sword in a climatic battle was the height of absurdity. That said, the kenjutsu/sword and jujutsu (not juJITsu) techniques were very good and realistic overall, and the essense of Bushido portrayed in the film is, at heart, true. The paradox of modern Japan vs. its warrior roots is very much a real and lingering thing. Something to consider is that altho' hokey, the ending is appropriate since the spirit of Budo did and does live on ... just maybe not in the form of Tom Cruise. He did a great job with training, however. See the film and try not to quibble - it has valuable things to show and tell. I related to it from the heart."

"professional_shizoku","Null","2","3","17 December 2003"," ""Life in every breath . . . That is Bushido""
","Honor.  Integrity.  Loyalty.  And Bushido (translated, `way of the warrior').  What place do these hold in life and all it encompasses. Warner Bros. `The Last Samurai' attempts to depict the epic and time age tale of traditional norms versus a new and modernizing society.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Japan.  However, not Japan as we know it today, but just as it was emerging from its bloody, feudal cradle.  A feudal bloodbath entailing Japanese ways of life no more than 150 years ago.<br/><br/>`The Last Samurai' begins with a Japanese empirical advisor who needs the samurai eliminated in order to finish his railroad.  At first the samurai are viewed as imperial rebeliests; `barbarians' with no sense of what is right and wrong.  The advisor hires an American Civil War veteran, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and for $500 a month he trains a small army of men to fight the samurai.  But when the samurai attack a railroad construction village the advisor becomes impatient and orders Cruise's superior officer Colonel Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) to lead the small and unprepared force against the samurai.  The skilled and experienced samurai easily overpower the unpolished army and take Cruise as their prisoner.  Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the group leader of the samurai, along with other agendas, wishes to `know his enemy.'<br/><br/>Cruise eventually grows to love the simplicity and stillness of the samurai way of life.  He adopts the concept of Bushido (Japanese for `way of the warrior'); a theme that flows compassionately throughout the film.  Over the course of a year he learns samurai ways, their fighting methods, and even eventually begins to learn their language. But when his new found life is threatened by the old, he chooses to fight with the men he once considered his enemy.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a downtrodden Civil War veteran who douses his troubles in alcohol.  He suffers from flashbacks that give Cruise's character a sense of shame and weariness.  And while Cruise's performance is exceptional even he cannot take precedence over the grandeur and scope of what `The Last Samurai' does symbolize.  The death of an era, and the usherance of technological assimilation.<br/><br/>Asian actors Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), and Koyuki (Taka), play their roles brilliantly; and while their dialogue is not as numerous as Cruise's, their actions speak for more than themselves.  Katsumoto, is a proud, thoughtful, and an integrible samurai leader.  For more than 900 years he and his ancestors have protected the ways and honor of his people.  He and Cruise periodically converse in philosophical meetings sprinkled with humor. Taka shines as Cruise's caretaker.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: However, very early in the movie we find out that Taka is a widow of a samurai that Cruise has killed in battle; an enigma that lends a sense of depth and responsibility to both characters roles throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the more historical points is the weakness of the Japanese Emperor, Meiji, played by Scichinosuke Nakamura.  At this point of Japan's history, the Emperor became more of a figurehead, controlled by a group of economist advisors only wishing to fatten their wallets.  But this is portrayed in more of a symbolic matter throughout `The Last Samurai.'<br/><br/>Both the complexity and simplicity of `The Last Samurai,' enjoy ubiquity throughout the film.  There is never a moment in which both must not be weighed equally.  With every scene there is a sense of duty and honor, while there is at the same time enjoyment in the stillness of life.  A concoction of artsy filmography and articulating background music allow the plot to encompass all aspects of the movie; never will a moment take precedence over the plot or all that it strives to facilitate.  The facts of the matter are perhaps best but in a quote from the movie:<br/><br/>Algren:  `Life in every breath . . .' Katsumoto:  `That is Bushido'<br/><br/>All in all I would have to say `The Last Samurai' will be going on my all time favorite list.  Never have a watched a movie with such compassion and dedication towards one fervor.  Every fight scene is not without purpose, and a message.  And the action does not sway the viewer from the movie's ultimate and undeniable essence.<br/><br/>Several comparisons by other film critics have compared the movie to `Lawrence of Arabia,' and `Dances with Wolves,' in which the westerner becomes infatuated and then eventually assimilated into the natural culture; I even noticed several parallels to `Glory,' which was also directed by Edward Zwick.  And while these aspects may have lended something to the movie, simply enjoy it for what it is; volumes could be written on the parallels to Akira Kurusawa's `Seven Samurai.' No matter how many similarities there may be, there are just as many original concepts to be beheld.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: (IF YOU'VE SEEN ""DANCES WITH WOLVES"") The only one complaint I have is the `Hollywood' ending.  Hauntingly familiar to `Dances with Wolves,' it was ending that did not seem befitting of such a cinematic masterpiece.  However, I would have to say that it is worthy of any notable DVD collection.<br/><br/>After the movie was over and the credits began their usual scroll, I noticed that nearly half the people in the audience sat there while the other half stood and enjoyed the music.  I would like to think that they remained in deep contemplation and awe of all that this movie put into essence.  I know I did . . ."

"deepcheck","9","2","3","23 November 2003"," An unexpectedly, and admirably restrained, introspective film
","Like many people, it seems, I had severe doubts for this film.  From the trailer, it seemed very much like a Dances with Wolves knock-off at best, and typical Hollywood tripe at worst.  I am grateful to say that this film surprised me and impressed me on all accounts.<br/><br/>Having studied in the field of Eat Asian Languages and Culture, I was worried about the film's historical accuracy, or lack-thereof, given the period, but I was very impressed with how closely they managed to come while remaining far enough away from the actual historical record to make the events of the film plausible.  Most of the major characters, with the exception of the Emperor, are either completely fictional, or based on real historical figures, but with different names.  Katsumoto (Watanabe), for example, is obviously based on Saigo Takamori, Japan's greatest cultural hero, and the leader of the 1877 rebellion against the Meiji government (but not the Emperor).<br/><br/>In any case, this film is excellently paced, most thanks to the excellent spot-on acting job across the board from the entire cast.  You can actually feel the greater ideas and issues at the core of the conflict, and while many of them remain verbally unstated, they are nonetheless clear to any viewer.  Visually, this film is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, for the breathtaking backgrounds, the vibrant colors, the attention to minute details such as the cut of clothing, and the ugly beauty of the battles.  The soundtrack is perfect.<br/><br/>Just as impressive is Algren's (Cruise) own subplot, about his own quest for personal worth that he is pushed into through the events in the film. Despite what could have been a horribly campy plotline, much of the emotional content of these scenes are implied and left completely unstated, but just as apparent.  This act of restraint, so atypical of Hollywood, is one of this film's major strengths.<br/><br/>It's obvious I enjoyed this film, but to put aside many people's apparent fear of the ""ethic-woman-loves-minority-killing-white-guy"" syndrome, you will not find it in this film (despite the trailer), at least, not as you might expect.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is excellent in this film, but he is completely overshadowed by the amazing Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto.  It should be expected really, as Saigo Takamori, even after his death, defined the very core of the Japanese national mindset.  There were only two ways that this character could have turned out, and fortunately for the audience, and this film, it turned out the best way.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","17 July 2017"," Could have been a little better, but rises above the precedents of the action genre.
","I was a little disappointed with this movie, but it was pretty good on the whole. Even though I didn't agree with some of the sentiments that the samurai held, I could understand how someone could live their life the samurai way. The people that Algren comes to know display a level of devotion to their lives that is rarely seen in modern civilizations, which is what the movie seems to be all about. The logic behind the samurai obsessing over how they die is thrown into question, perhaps because the samurai seem more focused on their own honor than on what consequences their deaths will have. It does seem illogical, but there is something to the fact that they are willing to die for something. The spirit is there, it's just not channeled in quite the right way.<br/><br/>That may seem like a long digression, but the concept is actually pretty important to the film's identity. Although there is enough big Hollywood entertainment in this movie for it to attract action/adventure fans, there is also a fair amount of emotion and ideology that comes into question. The story may not be accurate to historical events, but it brings to light one of the darker parts of American history that is often swept under the rug in a way that feels accurate. Algren's background on the Western frontier plays a major role in his arc as he redeems himself for the pain he caused the Native Americans in the past.<br/><br/>Equally important to Algren is the village leader Katsumoto, who becomes the sage of the movie but is not without flaws. He and the rest of the villagers along with their way of life are not perfect and are certainly not modern, but they possess ardent beliefs and a purpose that is lacking in the westernized characters. By the end of the movie, Algren and Katsumoto are not exactly seeing eye to eye, but they each understand where the other is coming from and have partially adopted each other's views.<br/><br/>There is a good amount of action present throughout the movie, though it's meant to disgust as much as it is to excite. Laced into all of the action scenes are character moments, mostly for Algren but not exclusively. There's some good camera work that goes into the action scenes, particularly the one in which Algren duels one of the samurai. But the movie does not let itself get too caught up in the action, putting much focus on the relationship between Algren and the family that takes him in. There is also a lot of time dedicated to the conversations between Algren and Katsumoto. There are points where the acting is overly dramatic and the lines feel too written, but that is the movie's only true fault. Not to say that it couldn't have been better, but there is not much to complain about. Overall Rating: 8/10"
"eric262003","8","1","1","25 April 2016"," Works Well On A Lot Of Levels
","Odd as it may seem, but ""The Last Samurai"" never quite had that much of an impact on me. Which seems unorthodox because I happen to enjoy samurai films. Not only that, but I've been a fan of movies that were directed by Edward Zwick (especially ""Glory""). And Ken Watanabe comes to the table fully prepared in whatever role he plays. So the least I could was give this movie at least a try. <br/><br/>The story begins during the American Civil War as eternally inebriated war veteran Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) has his life twisted in an indecipherable knot. When he's not gulping down the sauce, the unforgettable traumas come back to haunt him as he can't forgive himself over the murders of several Native Americans. <br/><br/>Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) assigns Algren to Japan and guide their army with more advanced military weapons like rifles, muskets and cannons to their advantage. Only doing if for the good pay that comes with it, Algren agrees to it and as way to expunge his troubled past behind him. Much in the same route as ""Dances With Wolves"", Algren is leading a very inexperienced army against a very well-trained group of samurai warriors led by the oracular Katsumoto (Watanabe). Algren's army is defected and Algren is captured. <br/><br/>During his abduction, Algren starts to progressively bond with the knowledgeable but understanding Katsumoto as each start to learn more about the purposes of war and what it means to each of them. As time progresses, Algren starts to feel a more spiritual vibe about the samurai way of life and the not so glamorous depiction of war by the Japanese Emperor and what his modernized fighters represent. The events eventually transpires to an all-out climactic battle and who in the end comes out on top. <br/><br/>So what was it that stood out like sore thumb about this movie? It must be the fact that Tom Cruise doesn't look like he's cut out for a period piece film. He tries to fit in, but he can't really quite grip in breaking away from the fact he's living in the 1860's and not 2003. His acting is very well executed he just lacks that connection that catches him off guard and that can be a problem when the audience feels it too. <br/><br/>Fortunately everything else seems to work out very well. The production values are quite spot on, the locality of this film was top of the line and the costumes and the props give you that feeling that you've returned to the Meiji period in Japan. <br/><br/>For a movie just shy of three hours long, Zwick succeeds in keeping the narrative sharp and the editing well packaged and the dialogue the freedom to go at its own pace. The audience also gets to observe what samurai life is like and the predicament that Algren finds himself. This can be done thank to some brilliant photography by John Toll and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, we know this film is not playing with kid's gloves. The action really keeps the pace go by very quickly and it really flies by that you never once have to look at your watch a single second. <br/><br/>Sure those who've studied Japanese history or culture will find a major hole in the plot. It seems that the samurai culture is unapologetic in glorification. It seems the feudal samurai people were dominate over the peasants. What they failed to understand was that the Japanese Emperor was catering modern warfare to all the people of Japan and not just the more wealthy samurai. Some of these civilians see this as an advantage and those who rebelled missed what the intentions were and feared they'll lose what power they've been holding. <br/><br/>Overall this is very well made film, however it lack in some areas where it loses some of the more effective ways it could have been. If given the right performer would've made a big difference."

Bagley approaches him with an offer on behalf of a Japanese businessman, Mr. Omura (Masato Harada), to help train the new Western-style Imperial Japanese Army. Assisting them are Algren's old army colleague Sergeant Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and Simon Graham (Timothy Spall).<br/><br/>Under the command of Bagley, Algren and his companions travel to Japan. The newly-formed Japanese Army is a poorly-trained and equipped conscripted army of peasants totally lacking in combat experience. He does his best to remedy this, but before the men are trained to his satisfaction Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) attacks a railroad outside his province. Then,Bagley orders him to lead the inexperienced conscripts to engage Katsumoto. He then points out the army's inexperience and inadequate training. But Bagley dismisses his concerns and then orders a regiment to track down and engage Katsumoto. Yet when his ill-prepared superior force sets out too soon, their panic allows the sword-wielding samurai to crush them. Badly wounded Algren's courageous stand makes the samurai leader spare his life.Once nursed to health he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way, and participates as adviser.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie is outstanding especially with Ken Watanabe as the samurai leader Katsumoto.He truly deserves the numerous nominations that he got from this movie.Aside from that,the movie is written very well as the history of the samurai is presented in way far from what normally people perceive them.Aside from that,the production values and battle scenes are worth mentioning.Overall,this movie presents the history of Japan in the 1800's with the ways of the samurai in particular.Highly recommended for people who loves movies about history and Japan."

","On its simplest level, The Last Samurai is a straightforward story, well told, of a damaged man trapped by circumstances in a culture clash which changes him profoundly.<br/><br/>But this is just one of many layers. There is the political story of late 19th century Japan, still essentially feudal in nature, beginning to interact with the western world. There is Cruise's voyage of discovery and redemption, but there are also the stories of Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and Taka (Koyuki). There is the story of culture clash - explored in Shogun, and still fascinating here. There is the spectacle of battle.<br/><br/>And all this is told wonderfully visually, with excellent performances from all concerned - the performance of the nervous Japanese soldier being told by Cruise to shoot him is as well measured as Cruise's own. The film looks good, is gripping throughout, well paced, and moving.<br/><br/>One of the best films of its time."

","Every year a crop of prestige pictures get dumped out of the major studios in Hollywood.  Every one of these large scale epics is full of wild battles, romance, outstanding performances, and the cream of the crop celebrities. These are the films that are especially created to win the coveted Academy Awards.  The problem is every year one film is so big, so bloated, and so prestigious it turns into a silly mess.  This year's film is EDWARD ZWICK'S THE LAST SAMURAI.  A fun action film that longs to be SCHINDLER'S LIST.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai stars Tom Cruise (Vanilla Sky) as Captain Algern, a soldier who stood with General Custer as he made his famous last stand.  While in battle he is forced to kill innocent Native American women and children, and it eats away at his soul.  Turning him to drink. <br/><br/>When his old associates give him a job training Japanese soldiers to fight against a Samurai warrior named Katsumoto (Ken Wantanabe, T.R.Y.). Everything seems okay.  That is until he's captured by Katsumoto and begins to learn the law of the Samurai.<br/><br/>THE LAST SAMURAI at it's best boasts some of the most breathtaking close up battle scenes I've seen in a long time.  I could hardly believe that for once I could follow the battles, because for the first time in a long time the camera stayed pretty steady.  It simply wasn't sound effects and shaky steady cams moving around.  It was real, and true battle choreography.  Now that made me smile.<br/><br/>I also loved the scene in which Algern battles a group of overzealous Japanese soldiers who are attacking his friend.  The scene actually works and is a rare sight.  A modern fight scene that doesn't feature wire effects or CGI.  It reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies.  A scene that was about a fight and not about special effects creating it.<br/><br/>SAMURAI also features a nice relationship between Algern and Katsumoto. Enemies that become friends, Wantanabe's character is strong because it feels real.  Unlike SONNY CHIBA's silly turn as the proverb spouting sword dealer in KILL BILL.  Wantanabe exudes the feeling of a real Samurai and not of a silly Kung Fu movie reject.  I loved how he could embody this man who is torn between his country and his king.  <br/><br/>SAMURAIS real flaw is that it thinks it's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, THE SEVEN SAMURAI, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, and DANCES WITH WOLVES, when it's really just a fun battle movie.  It takes itself far too seriously.  You watch it with this feeling that at any moment you'll see a graphic pop on the screen that says `FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.'<br/><br/>It also gets the award for the silliest and most melodramatic thing screamed by an actor in peril in 2003.  Algern is going through alcohol withdrawal and screams `SAKI' at the top of his lungs.  I was sitting next to my brother-in-law, and every time the film hit another stupidly melodramatic moment I would whisper `Saki!!'  It kept me entertained.<br/><br/>I was also aghast that in front of me a small boy no more than five was sitting there.  There is a pretty gruesome scene in which a man loses his head.  Never have a felt so badly for a little child than I did when he screamed out in terror and then latched onto his mothers shoulder.  LISTEN PARENTS OF THE WORLD, THE RATING SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED SO THAT THIS KIND OF THING DOESN'T HAPPEN.  YOU WANT TO WATCH AN R-RATED MOVIE RENT IT AT YOUR LEISURE.  DON'T BRING A FIVE YEAR OLD TO THE MOVIES TO WATCH IT. (Calming Down) Thank you!<br/><br/>THE LAST SAMURAI is a mixed bag.  On one hand its breathtaking to watch and on the other its kinda of silly.  I'm going to recommend it to those whom like really cool battle sequences.  But for the rest of you why not give THE SEVEN SAMURAI or even BRAVHEART a chance.  They are far better films."

Although the theme of an outsider becoming part of a fading culture has been told countless times - most obvious comparison being the superior Dances with Wolves - Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai is a grand and intelligent film that stands on its own.  Our tale begins in 1876 where burnt-out Civil War hero, Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), spends his days as an unconvincing drunk.  He is approached by two of the Emperor's men who want him to come to Japan and train the military in modern warfare in order to put down a Samurai rebellion.  The Samurai are fighting to preserve their culture as well as Japan's  from becoming westernized.  Eventually Cruise is captured and now has theological discussions with Katsumoto, the Samurai leader. The two men are from opposing cultures but share the same values and Cruise starts  understanding who and what the Samurai are.  The rest you can guess.  <br/><br/>
      As you watch the story unfold, it becomes obvious that Tom Cruise has thrown himself into this role.  He read Civil War diaries, Samurai articles, took martial arts, gained thirty pounds, and grew a beard! He also learned some of the language and studied Bushido, a code of loyalty and sacrifice.  So you can't fault his preparation. Yet somehow he still comes off as Tom Cruise.  And for this movie that's all you need.  Think about it:  Who would you rather have leading you into slow motion suicide battles?  Tom Cruise or some ""character"".  Cruise looks heroically handsome whether he's pointing a rifle, spinning a sword, getting stabbed, or doing the obligatory putting-on-the-armor scene before the final battle.  His co-star, Ken Watanabe, brings a dignified presence to the role of Katsumoto.  He is also a wounded man, defending the Samurai code even though he senses the end is near.  Watanabe acts with conviction and his performance is worthy of award consideration.  The rest of the cast is fine, there are no weak links.  The movie's look is authentic and the battles are well choreographed and bloody.  But there are some pacing problems and an unnecessarily long drawn-out ending.  There is also too much of a been-there done-that feeling that is hard to ignore.  The Last Samurai is a thoughtful film - meaning it will flop - but it's not the great epic that it aspires to be."

","This is the worst bastardization of Japanese history and culture I've seen in a last time. The producers and directors must have pieced together Japanese history from old episodes of Teenage mutant ninja turtles.<br/><br/>1) Just because a film is placed in Japan does not mean it requires ninjas, not to mention there were ninjas in 1860/70's Japan. I thought I was watching a bad cartoon. 2) Why are Japanese samurai's in the late 19th century fighting like they're in medieval Europe? 3) Which side did Watanabe's character fight for in the revolution? Please, tell me, b/c either way the story makes no sense."

","This is an epic film; probably one of those classics which will shine more brightly down the years. Basically the film hits all the bulls eyes; good plot, powerful characters, fine acting from the leads, great supporting acts from the Tim Small , Billy Connolly and Koyuki (whose ability to conduct feeling through facial expression alone is stunning), great cinematography, stunning battle choreography and a wonderful musical score by Zimmerman. Perhaps the best film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>This film plays well again and again which is a sign of its class. Very few films are good enough for me to say ""I'd like to watch that again"" and very few films move me to tears. This does both.<br/><br/>TLS undoubtedly deserves 10/10 and the fact that on this site it does not get that mark is due to some very silly and immature remarks from some 'critics' who either do not like Tom Cruise or have some political axe to grind. The rest of the criticisms revolve around ""It is surely improbable that ....."". Quite lot of them are not accurate; here are a few.<br/><br/>"" ..... Ahlgren survives the last battle and does so without without suffering a scratch."" <br/><br/>Ahlgren does not inevitably survive the battle; the narrator states that ""nobody knows what became of him"" and that he may have died of his wounds. Ahlgren does not survive the last battle without a scratch he is hit in the shoulder and leg.<br/><br/>"" .... that Ahlgren can learn the art of Japanese sword in 6-9 months.""<br/><br/>As a cavalry man and civil war veteran Ahlgren already knew how to handle the sabre for at least ten years before his capture. From sequences it is apparent he is extremely adept and coordinated <br/><br/>in movement and he has six to nine months daily practice in Japanese fighting techniques as a prisoner. Its not inconceivable he could turn into a fairly formidable figure.<br/><br/>"" .... that Katsumoto speaks English.""<br/><br/>Katsumoto speaks English - not unusual given he is a daimyo and not a samurai from a local village as some commentator mistakenly says. Katsumoto had been a senior figure in government and Japan had been open to the West for 25 years.<br/><br/>"".... that Katsumoto speaks English in his final words.""<br/><br/>Katsumoto's final words are in English because he is addressing his friend who is American.<br/><br/>""... Katsumoto seeks advice in war from Ahlgren.""<br/><br/>Not at all - Ahlgren knows the tactics of the enemy far better than Katsumoto.<br/><br/>""... Ahlgren could learn Japanese in 6 months""<br/><br/>The great Richard Burton remarked that he could ""break the back of any foreign language in a month"". Burton was extraordinary in learning 40 languages. But he proved what can be done - and Ahlgren was credited in the film as gifted as a linguist.<br/><br/>""... Japanese were advised by an American in military matters.""<br/><br/>Yes, correct, Japan was advised by Germans on army matters and British on Navy ones. So really what we should have watched was a guy speaking authentic C19 German with a Prussian accent and subtitles from beginning. What fun - NOT. <br/><br/>People who argue this stuff rarely stop to think that fanatical adherence to historical detail at the cost of rendering a film unwatchable does no good service at all. Historical verisimilitude must be respected as contributing to the film as a piece of art, but when it overrides the mission of the film, it performs no good service. I think Zwicker got this right.<br/><br/>If you're one of these historical nerds who watches a film only to see if they've got the shoulder pads right then you must avoid Shakespeare - he has historical anachronisms everywhere.<br/><br/>""... that the Japanese wife could come to care for the man who killed her husband""<br/><br/>Well Ahlgren did save the life of her child at risk to himself! We can see that Ahlgren killed in the line of duty to defend his own life and that he is a brave & decent man. Perhaps she could see the same - can anyone predict the human heart?<br/><br/>One other criticism you will read here - TLS is like ""Dances with Wolves"". And so? Dances with Wolves is no doubt similar to one or more of thousands of previous films. This is the silliest criticism.<br/><br/>My advice: go and get the DVD if you have never seen it. Ignore the losers who try to put you off. You're in for a treat. ."
"evanston_dad","4","4","9","29 April 2005"," A Good Movie Turned Bad
","How disappointing that ""The Last Samurai"" becomes dreadful in its last half, because the first half is quite engaging. This movie is what results when a director with left-leaning sensibilities tries to make a liberal-minded ""message"" movie without the courage of his own convictions. So the movie is not content to merely show us the crisis facing the Samurai in the face of westernization and letting our sympathies lie with them....Oh no, fearful that an American audience would not take to a film centered around Japanese characters, we have to have a white, hot-shot Hollywood actor to root for, who sweeps in to be our hero. We get a token Japanese hero to root for as well, but guess who remains living at the end of the film? Didn't Kevin Costner already make this movie? Tom Cruise's heart is obviously in the right place. He gives an incredibly earnest performance...and that's part of the problem. He's SO earnest that I never forgot for a second that I was watching Tom Cruise, Mr. Hollywood A-List, feeling self-important for attaching himself to such an important film. Ken Watanabe received heaps of praise for his performance, but I fail to see what the hype is about. And the obligatory love story is just silly---obviously, the movie makers thought so too, because they make only a half-hearted attempt to develop it in the first place.<br/><br/>I loved the message in ""The Last Samurai,"" but I hated the approach taken to the material. It's yet one more movie in which the creators give the audience not one single amount of credit for having a brain; emotions are force-fed to us through superficial means like slow-motion and thundering music. Not comfortable with any amount of ambiguity, all of the Americans except for Tom Cruise have to be evil, and all of the Samurai have to be entirely noble. The film inadvertently makes the point that killing someone with a sword or a bow and arrow makes you a better person than killing someone with a gun, conveniently sidestepping the fact that killing is killing, regardless of how it's done.<br/><br/>My summary: a pretty film with not a brain in its head.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"
"Tulsa90","5","4","9","6 January 2005"," Very Overrated, Does not belong anywhere near the Top 250 films!
","Being a movie buff, I have come to love the IMDb website. It is fascinating to review the careers of directors, actors, actresses and to find out about movies that you haven't seen that look interesting. The only bad thing I can say is that there is a strong tendency towards recent or new films being rated highly. This is inevitable as there is a disproportionate number of younger people using the internet who primarily watch only new movies. Even knowing this, it is still a little disgusting to see an average movie like 'Last Samurai' rated in the same company as some true classics and masterpieces from the last 100 years or so of film making. This movie is OK, but I was disappointed in many aspects of the film. I thought that a lot of the scenes that were supposed to be the emotional climaxes of the story were kind of ridiculous and almost laughable (I did laugh a few times when I wasn't supposed to be. Anyway, how can this movie be ranked up there with Hitchcock's classics such as vertigo, Rear Window, etc. and a whole laundry list of much better films? I just don't get it."
"dennisyoon","5","4","9","25 December 2004"," Last Samurai? Get Real. I Don't believe the hype.
","It's a decent action flick. The fights are entertaining. Cruise is decent with a bokken but I doubt the good Captain could match a real lifelong practitioner after one season of training. The male bonding is familiar and Watanabe is interesting mostly for his deep voice and macho posturing. The line about spending a whole life looking for the perfect blossom is rubbish--useless words for a Samurai. The Japanese Emperor would not consider an American as one of his subjects back then, either. Yeah, it seems even American white people are tired of the self hating American white guy going native story. Maybe not, though, according to the many favorable reviews. It's hard to justify a fantasy by grounding it in historical reality-- Too many things to nit pick about. They should also avoid pompous statements like Last Samurai if they are trying to be serious. I don't think they were trying to be serious, though. I think they were trying to make a blockbuster movie that people liked, so good for them. <br/><br/>I must admit I was biased when I heard the title and then there was a picture of Tom Cruise in Samurai Armor. I was like,""Please, don't go there."" As for all the acclaim, all I can say is Cruise must have some type of mojo. More Power to him. Well, I liked the culmination of the battle near the end. It was like you killed a part of your self and your ancestry and you lost something for it. The resolution of it all is confounding and and contrary to history. Why engage in a war to modernize and then refuse the thing over one Samurai and his sidekick American renegade? History shows the opposite occurred as well. Oh wait, it's a movie...and of course the ugly, greedy guy has to get it in the end. Not Bad. At least it's not Black Rain. Check out ""Yakuza"" with Robert Mitchum. It goes way deeper into Samurai Spirt than this one. That movie deserves all the acclaim this one got and more. Done with a whole lot more believability, craftsmanship and sincerity. Enough said. Cheers!"

"Coventry","5","4","9","24 January 2004"," Routine heroic stuff...Same old stuff, different setting
","I usually get a stomach ache of these overbudgetted and overhyped heroic epics. They often are too loud, too long and especially way too fake. Big budget-stuff with a bunch of unnecessary moral and side plots. The Last Samurai is no exception to this. It's a very pretty decorated, but empty package. Like Braveheart...like Gladiator...only this time is set in the late 18th century Japan. These movies certainly are worth wating if you enjoy breath-taking locations and terrific sound and visual effects. These aspects are ALWAYS superior to the story. The history lesson it tries to tell is loosely based on true events but to please and gain a huge audience, they're throwing in the life story of a fed up American Captain ( Tom Cruise ), a forced romance and a lot of pathetic family values and 'codes of loyalty'. I have to reckon that the battle sequences in The Last Samurai are exiting, though. There's a good amount of blood shed and the chopped off limbs are flying from one side of the screen to the other. That's the least thing you expect from an historical epic, no? It's a real shame that the story which connects these battles is so lame. What I really don't understand is that Cruise is tipped as an important Oscar candidate this year, 2003?!? I thought that he overacted terribly (like he usually does) and that his performance was nowhere near interesting. The British comedian Billy Connely does a much better job, I think. Too bad his character dies really early...The largest part of the characters in The Last Samurai are uninspired and not very believable or convincing. In general, the entire production lacks a few aspects to become as successful as Braveheart or other epics, but it certainly fits into the same category. Well made but mainstream stuff intended to make profit The occasional film fan loves this, but the more developed cinema freak is far from impressed."
"Dockelektro","4","4","9","8 January 2004"," Keeping up with the formula doesn't pay off
","Mr. Hollywood woke up one day and realized that his ideas were running thin. He went to his book of history and decided that it was time they did a movie about the samurai. He went to work and activated the movie-making machine, and in it added all the ingredients to make a box-office smash out of the genre. So, in the movie, everything you're expecting to see about the samurai is in fact depicted, even when it makes little sense (Where the hell do those ninjas come from? Who sent them?). Thus, from it comes little effect and result, and probably the most overrated of the year to come. It is simply not genuine, only the best the money can buy. Everything about is enormous, and, as usual, Cruise is the only reason for the movie to justify its existence. Did I mention that they also payed 75 million dollars for him? Well, as expected, he has done his homework well: speaking japanese, fighting with swords, the whole works. But it's a pity that the movie he serves ends up being such a flat effort. Shamelessly ripping off its concept from ""Dances With Wolves"", trying to make it evolve into something with deep emotions and meanings, and creating a movie whose story is predictable from beginning until the end (the trailer only tells half of it) is a fraud, and to me is insulting. Ok so it can be entertaining. But I wasn't entertained. Only hurt, for so much has done so little. A saying in my country says that ""the mountain has spawned a mouse"". And this pretty much sums it up. I rest my case."
"paultjiam","1","8","23","12 April 2005"," the worst samurai-movie ever made
","In this visual spectacle, Tom Cruise has again one of his many bad appearances. Tom Cruise said this movie was an ode to the Japanese Samurai culture. This movie looks more like a parody on the old Japanese culture. It is just one of the many American superhero movies, with a plot as predictable as a sesame-street-episode. The only thing that kept me from running away were the visuals and the costumes. The story is simple and straight. American veteran Tom Cruise is asked by the new Japanese government to fight the remain samurai in Japan. Then those same samurais kidnapped him, and instead of killing him, they keep him alive. Bit by bit he gets their confidence and learns how to use a samurai-sword and the life-style of a true samurai. Of course, he becomes a samurai, and at the end he fights with the samurai against the Japanese government. The final confrontation between the samurai and the Japanese army is by far the worst fight mankind has ever seen on cinema. The drama was totally overdone, Tom Cruise's overacting was as bad as (or worse) an average soap-actor. If people are interested in samurai-movies or the Japanese (old) culture, please watch Kurosawa instead of this Tom Cruise crap."

","Finally a movie that depicts the wright values, in the best of Hollywood traditions of times now long gone. This film is about friendship, honor and pride, all of whom unfortunately look so archaic today, almost as if they do not (and according to many, shouldn't) exist any more. Luckily, there are still some of us who believe in such principles and try to live by them. As the movie shows, they may be old fashioned, but some human values are timeless as well as priceless.<br/><br/>I am not a great fan of Tom Cruise, but in this film I think he did a very good job. His acting was very good, never over the top, very believable. For an actor so well known and identified by the public with a completely different image, this must not have been easy. Ken Watanabe's performance was amazing, incredibly powerful, definitely worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination. I cannot imagine anybody could have portrayed this for us alien culture any better that he did. My compliments go also to the Director, this film was very well directed and filmed. The sound, camera and costumes should also all receive at least a nomination (amazing, the Academy and I almost completely agree this time). All in all, very good, quality entertainment. Well done."

","First, I'm introducing by saying that I gave the movie only 9/10 because I've recently learned that Last Samurai is built on the same plot as Dances with Wolves, starring Kevin Costner. Since I haven't seen that I don't dislike the movie because it's a ""Rip-off"".<br/><br/>The movie starts with this peaceful introduction (Where the narrator says one of my favorite quotes; ""I say Japan was forged/made by warriors..."") and during that time you see beautiful landscapes. Summary: Nice introduction.<br/><br/>""So it begins"", the movie continues with Nathan getting sent to Japan to deal with these ""savage rebels with bows and arrows"" but you learn throughout the movie, that savage is the last thing they are, and that these men have more sense of honor than any race to walk the earth. When Nathan gets captured and introduced to the Samurai way of living, he feels somehow relieved to be captured. Soon he's healed from the wounds he obtained through the battle which he was captured in, and starts wandering around (With a guard which he calls ""Bob"") admiring their way of living. Summary: Fantastic continuation, with admirable acting!<br/><br/>The whole movie ends with Nathan Algren going to the ""enemies"" side; the Samurais side. He finds himself training to become a Samurai, and learning Japanese so he communicates with his new people. The final battle is filled with emotions, strategy, bravery and last but not least revenge to his captain, which he has hated since Custer fell to the Siouxs.<br/><br/>All around summary for the movie: Admirable, truly fantastic and impressive.

","This movie frustrates me endlessly. The Hollywood machine has been cranking out these cookie cutter historical dramas for the last 10 years now and while at first there was a freshness and a genuine quality to some of these early films (such as Braveheart, Dances with Wolves, even Gladiator), they have put out too many films in too short a time that are THE ESSENTIALLY SAME THING, differentiation occurring only in the setting of time and place.<br/><br/>Captured by enemy Japanese samurai, a US soldier who himself has witnessed the horrors of cultural manifest destiny comes to embrace the ways of the culture he was there to fight. Western boy meets world...Western Boy has inner conflict and must choose his allegiance...Western boy effuses emotion in a drawn-out, overacted 40 minute concluding sequence where people can take 40 bullets and still die slowly and in a touching way...Western boy becomes assimilated into new culture and lives happily ever after. Basically, western culture and history are slammed repeatedly by producers who concurrently make their living off of western commercialism in western theaters from hordes of western cola-drinking sheep.<br/><br/>The problem is that this movie looks really good artistically. They had a huge budget to get a good cast, beautiful scenes, and good action choreography. Yet they graft the same ""makes you think"" plot as Kingdom of Heaven, Dances with Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, etc. onto it - there's nothing original here!

"OttoVonB","5","3","6","9 December 2004"," Shogun Redux
","Last Samurai was the first of many historical epics green-lit after the revival of the genre by Gladiator, and though it shares a screenwriter with that Oscar-winning epic, it hearkens back to something a bit older.<br/><br/>I find myself on the fence about this one because it manages to be the very best of Hollywood and the very worst for different reasons. The same can be said of director Ed Zwick, who's brand of earnest schmaltz can result in either a perfectly tuned masterpiece - like Glory - or saccharine dreck - Blood Diamond, another film with excellent ingredients but the same antagonizing flaws found here.<br/><br/>Drawing deep parallels with James Clavell's Shoun, and the miniseries that followed (one you quickly become convinced everyone involved with this film was made to watch at some point), Last Samurai follows disabused Westerner to the Empire of the Sun. There he will put his own life and honor code in question and become seduced by local culture - and, of course, a local woman - and redeem himself in heroic ways. Tom Cruise lays it thick as the self-loathing Captain Algren, especially in a misjudged parody of a firing lesson scene from Glory, but then the screen is lit up by Ken Watanabe, and much is forgiven, wrapped as he and everything else is in lush cinematography and a rousing score.<br/><br/>Where the film falls flat - like Blood Diamond to a certain extent - is in underestimating our intelligence or cultural openness. Since a non-white or non-American character is apparently not enough to hold our interest, we are made to see everything through Algren's eyes, rather than merely have be our initial conduit into this unfamiliar world. Having Cruise in the role, capable actor that he is, compounds the problem: every scene that tries to make him a Hollywood hero, rather than an actual character, is unconvincing, especially the physics and culture-defying silliness of the ending.<br/><br/>An okay Summer blockbuster, but hardly worth remembering."
"EijnarAmadeus","7","3","6","15 May 2004"," Samurai art
","Tom Cruise is probably Hollywood's most popular actor, and he's been doing movies like COCKTAIL, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, JERRY MAGUIRE, MINORITY REPORT and VANILLA SKY, and well, here he delivers probably his best performance. Although maybe MINORITY REPORT is his best film, this is without doubt then a very worthy second place. <br/><br/>Nathan Algren is a retired soldier that's drinking heavily and doesn't have any kind of job. But soon he's back into the military where his mission is to lead a bunch of un-trained Japanese men into battle against the feared samurais. Well, the samurais wins the battle easily and Algren fights for his life alone, but instead of being killed he gets taken prisoner by the samurais and soon lead to their village. Here he soon understands that the samurais is good people, and with bad nightmares and a huge hatred of his old military colleges he makes peace with the samurais, and join them in their fight...<br/><br/>A movie that's so beautifully made that you simply can't avoid being charmed by it. The fantastic photo and the fabulous directing makes the movie elegant, delicate really, so while sitting there I just had such a good time. Tom Cruise is brilliant as Algren who suffers of bad nightmares and has to make peace with his mind. Samurais is something I think everybody thinks is pretty cool, and this movie shows a side of the samurais that they're peaceful, relaxed and intelligent people that studies war. THE LAST SAMURAI stands very alone, and is a dead-on movie, and it has got it's competitions; TROY, KING ARTHUR and ALEXANDER THE GREAT are all big movies with big budget and costumes, battles and stuff, so well...if THE LAST SAMURAI will win the four-on battle is a question.

"Naoum","6","3","6","5 May 2004"," Why do you have to explain everything so explicitly???
","'The Last Samurai' was better than I expected, since the trailer made me think that Tom Cruise would be the Last Samurai which I found to be an offense to my logic!!! However, this is not the case and the film has the potential of becoming a masterpiece until the halfway of the movie, with an interesting plot and intense feeling.<br/><br/>The main problems start at about that time, when some logic gaps start to appear (according to my sense of logic that is...) and the movie cannot persuade me about the goal of protecting a culture from imperialistic influences when the origin of the film has already consumed much of that cultural elements that are meant to be protected by Tom. Hmmmm!!!<br/><br/>Anyway, another problem is the explicit statement of what the movie is all about and what message is meant to get across. We have to think by ourselves about the meaning and find our own, or not?

"larsgrimstad","9","3","6","31 March 2004"," The Last Samurai - Bushido ""The Warrior Code""
","This movie blew me away...i've liked Tom Cruise for years, but he surprised me this time. I did read some other recommendations, and i cant understand some of the criticism.<br/><br/>This film portrays an american soldier, Colonel Nathan Algren(played by Tom Cruise), who has both nightmares and moral issues with what he has seen of slaughter in the indian wars, and his demons makes him seek comfort in alcohol, like  so many soldiers do when not coming to terms with their beliefs and the reality of having done horrible things in battle.<br/><br/>So when the Director draws parallels from the native americans to the samurais, he actually shows us the last days of two dying cultures.<br/><br/>Now the samurais in this movie are not evil, nor is the imperial army. The fight between the two sides is a cultural battle, wich i think the movie portrays well. The only character that comes away as a ""bad guy"" is the war minister, Omura, who is the one that originally hire Algren, to train the japanese in modern warfare. Cruise is pressed into battle by his senior commander, played by Tony Goldwyn (in a good role, i might add), and he is subsequently captured by the Samurai's, when the attack disintegrate as the samurai charges.<br/><br/>This teaches us all a simple lesson, if u want to make a statement, be prepared.<br/><br/>While Algren is fighting off the attacking samurais, we see the vivid dream of Katsumoto, as seen in the beginning of film. The flag with the white tiger... a subtile symbolism, and premonition of two destinys, Algren's and Katsumoto's (played with magnetism and conviction by Ken Watanabe) coming together.<br/><br/>The way Cruise and Watanabe plays these two characters impresses me, they both know, and the actors shows us...without words that their characters fate are bound to each other. Cruise kills the husband of Taka, Katsumoto's sister, and gradually, with time, Taka, understands she does not hate Algren, but she comes to terms with the events that led to her loss. She then opens up to Algren, making it possible to fall in love with him as the cultural barrier (in this case, the language) is broken down.<br/><br/>
The battle scenes are excellent, and the sword-wielding is caught on film with such force, that it can actually make u gasp for air.<br/><br/>What i liked about the film was the way it portrayed the samurai's, like Ujio, Katsumoto's samurai lieutenant and the older silent man (Algrens Guard)...<br/><br/>Ujio comes across as the tough samurai u dont want as your enemy, but later in the film, as the village starts to trust Algren, Ujio then becomes more humane, and in the end u are sad to see him die on horseback.<br/><br/>
The old man guard is another heroic character, along with Katsumoto's young son. In the late part of the movie, as a soldier is about to shoot Algren, he charges the enemy as he screams out the only word from him in the whole movie, calling out to Algren his name, then runs in front of him to take the bullet ment for Algren, in this moment he becomes a hero of mine.. pretty powerful stuff.<br/><br/>The battle between the ""new"" army and the samurais has its parallels to battles where a small band of warriors charges a larger force outnumbers and outgunned.<br/><br/>The motive for all this fighting, u might ask ? Algrens primary objective is money, but in his encounter with the samurais he finds the clensing he needs regarding alcohol and nightmares, and he discovers a true meaning to being a warrior, fighting for your beliefs and your honor.<br/><br/>The end, after Katsumoto and all the Samurais are dead, has some twists, the trade agreement is rejected by the emperor, as Algren brings him the sword of Katsumoto, who's wish it was only to serve the people and the emperor.<br/><br/>This is where Omura's actions comes back to haunt him, and Katsumotos death becomes justified. As for Algren, well i, like Mr. Graham likes to think that Taka and Algren found some sort of peace together after the turmoil and agony shared through-out the movie.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie highly, the fact Tom Cruise is in it should be 1st reason, but Katsumoto's character, and the story itself even overshadows Tom Cruise a bit. There are subplots and personal dynamics in it that gives the movie a lot of depth, that makes it a good 2nd reason, and the 3rd...all the Samurais looks fierce, proud and commited.<br/><br/>The Bushido - The warrior Code, i have never really grasped the essence of it fully, until i seen this good film.<br/><br/>The way Katsumoto finds the last sentence for his poem just when about to die is what i found to be the best scene in movie, and it sums up the ""Last Samurai"" for me."

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>Very predictable and very, VERY Hollywood. ""The Last Samurai"" moves along just as you would imagine. No surprises here. Just Tom Cruise doing his Hollywood superstar thing and saving Japan from the Japanese. Hoo-ah!<br/><br/>Cruise is asked to go to Japan to help the Emperor with his Samurai problem. Those pesky Samurai won't adjust to modern times. The Japanese industrialists and other exploiters want to wipe them out. So Cruise teaches the Emperor's army to fight the Cruise way: Guns, cannons and more guns will squash those Indians/Samurais.<br/><br/>But Cruise takes a detour with the enemy he was paid to vanquish. Soon he comes to appreciate their ways of discipline. He will be called ""Dances with Samurai's"" by his new friends and dubbed ""Unforgiven"" by the establishment. Cruise is the Last Samurai.<br/><br/>The ""Last Samurai"" is clearly a superstar vehicle for Tom Cruise but it's not an out of control star vehicle like ""The Postman"" or ""Battlefield: Earth"". When you see the very last scene in the movie, (""No one knows what became of him..."" cue Cruise grinning), you'll know what this movie is all about: Sell Cruise! But the movie had plenty of good battle scenes and two beheadings as well. I'd give it a 7/10."
"misterjones","Null","3","6","24 November 2003"," Epic Aspirations.
","With `The Last Samurai', director Ed Zwick appears to be aiming for an epic on the scale of a David Lean or Akira Kurosawa film.  He couldn't possibly aim higher, and if he is not entirely successful he has nevertheless produced a film which will leave audiences grateful for the ways in which he is.<br/><br/>Impressively, Zwick never forgets that a great epic is based in equal parts on quiet moments of personal growth as well as on spectacle, and the two are in proper balance throughout `The Last Samurai'.  Furthermore, this film never falls into the trap of presenting its American hero as the savior of a group of savages.  It's presentation of the Japanese culture as represented by both the government forces and the Samurai warriors is informative, entertaining and never less than three dimensional.<br/><br/>The film's opening (and, later, closing) moments are its weakest.  Simply stated, Tom Cruise is completely unconvincing as an embittered and alcoholic Civil War veteran.  Watching him deal with stock characters (such as the photographer played by Timothy Spall), we are reminded of school-level productions in which a young cast can not possibly understand much less convey the life experience we are supposed to believe they have had.<br/><br/>Fortunately, things pick up considerably when Cruise finds himself in the hands of the Samurai warriors he has come to Japan to train the soldiers against.  Not only is the actor convincing  in the physical daring-do we have come to expect of him, but he is able to project a subtle variation on a theme he has explored before.  His characters always seem to exist for the purpose of getting some form of comeuppance.  Here it comes not in the form of a big emotive scene, but gradually, over the course of time, as he gives himself over to a world based on ritual, respect and honor. These quiet moments, juxtaposed with his learning the ways of the warriors, are the heart and soul of this film.  Cruise is greatly abetted by the excellent actors Ken Watanabe and Koyuki in these sequences, as well as by the boys who play Koyuki's sons.  Indeed, the greatest example of Zwick's skill in piloting this film can be found in the ease with which the film alternates between two languages, with none of the clunky feel too often associated with joint international ventures.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the film leads up to a spectacular battle sequence which, if anything, is even more impressive than any found in `Braveheart' or `Gladiator'.  ""The Last Samurai"" can not help but recall ""Dances With Wolves"", with which it has a great deal in common, as well. <br/><br/>
There is, however, a hokey quality to the film's final half-hour which brings it back to the level of its opening, with an unrealistic coda that its title portends to.  There are, in fact, too many endings, and none of them are on the level of the film's best moments.<br/><br/>But if `The Last Samurai' sometimes falls short of its epic aspirations, it nevertheless is far more successful than many of its recent peers.  It will be interesting to see how it holds up with time."

","Actually as I would have expected from a major hollywood movie it is technically well done. What else positive is to say about ""The last samurai"" It has, some nice views, good choreographies in the fighting and battle scenes, some average to good acting with a great performance by Ken Watanabe. The movie can deliver an nice one time evening entertainment.<br/><br/>
So normally I would have rated this movie 5 [well done fast food for the general public].<br/><br/>But I rated it 1 for the total faultiness of the plot if you look at it earnestly. Starting with a very mediocre basic story, that reminds me a lot of ""Who dances with the Wolves"", the movie deals out some very major historical inaccuracies and tops them all by portraiting its american hero as rescuer of the soul of Japan.<br/><br/>A bit more feeling for history, a better talent for telling an epic, a ,much more refined script, a lot less american perspective, a bit less or better none tom cruise at all would have helped to make the plot shine.<br/><br/>

","LAST SAMURAI is not the sweeping East meets West epic it aspires to be. By the end, it amounts to little more than a vanity project for Tom Cruise. At first, the story seems to be setting Cruise up for his own personal Lawrence of Arabia, but as soon as his character arrives in as a captive of the Samurais' village, the almighty Hollywood Cliché takes over the story. You've seen this story a hundred times before, in better films... the fish-out-of-water beginnings, followed by the inevitable reluctant-mutual-respect, and eventually, the rebellious partnership. I don't understand all the praise that has been heaped upon this dull, formulaic action film. Perhaps it's American affinity for Asian culture. If you look past those cool sword fights, you'll find a movie that you've already seen a hundred times."

Tom Cruise wasn't able to convince me that he was in fact what he was TRYING to act to be. He should stick to the suite-roles. Terrible actor, no charisma what so ever. Shame on you Mister Cruise, shame on you!<br/><br/>2/Screenplay: One cliché after an other (the woman who cares for the wounded lead character becomes the love interest, ...). While watching the film, I could literally predict what was going to happen. The movie wasn't able to surprise me, not once.<br/><br/>3/Directing: Terrible directing. Give me a camera and even I can make a movie of the same quality (except for the action scenes, I admit). Those close-ups all the time, to show the expression on ones faces! And then that awful music to accompany them.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: This movie wasn't able to move me, except in the direction of: HELP TURN THAT **** OFF! BAD BAD, one of the worst films I saw in years.<br/><br/>No depth, no beauty, an empty annoying box of Pandora. Go Brad Go!"

Anytime a movies impresses me, all the other viewings beyond the initial one is to study and absorb how the film was crafted. In my opinion it was Tom Cruise's finest role and I'm just guessing it was one he is proud of and could identify with. The whole philosophy behind the Samurai history and life was well expounded. It's a long movie but the quality was such that every scene was a delight to watch and important enough to be included. I lost track of the fact there was acting going on, the story telling was was so well executed. I'm sure I'll be watching it again."

","I really liked this movie because of its well-developed plot, and the effective personalities of the characters. The changing emotions and views of the main character are also felt by the audience (or I felt that way, at least).<br/><br/>I think this movie had a very good plot because it followed the life of military man with ""shell shock"" and how he deals with that, how his views and beliefs changed while being a prisoner, and how he related to the audience's feelings when he decided to fight with the Samurai. <br/><br/>As for the other characters, Omura was an effective ""bad guy"" because he was stubborn and wanted victory and success by any means possible, and it was very satisfying to see what happened to his character at the end because there was an amount of loathing associated toward him. Algren's superior officer Col. Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) played a military colonel who only cared about money and victory, though he does follow orders. I liked what happened to this character near the end of the movie because of what Algren said to him near the start of the movie. Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) was a great character because he embodied the traits and personality of an honorable Samurai in the early 1900's. At the end, I felt a range of emotions, which kept me thinking well after the movie was over. The other rest of the cast, though seen less-often, played powerful roles for plot development.<br/><br/>This movie is very slow at parts, which is one of the bad things about it. It also is not a family movie, but even though it's rated R, mid to older teens might be able to watch it.<br/><br/>For the movie as a whole, it left me thinking about what it would have been like to live in a time like that. I would recommend watching this movie."

Landscapes are beautiful, as well as scenery. And the soundtrack is made by Hans Zimmer (although not as touching as his usual stuff).<br/><br/>If you like, for example, movies like Armageddon, maybe you like this one too.

","I am amazed by the flood of positive comments regarding this film. Maybe its because i am not from the US, but I found this movie to be an incredibly formulaic and clichéd; the sets looked like sets; and every character a familiar stereotype. Katsumoto (sp?) for example is regal, benevolent, cultured, noble and insanely courageous - there is no complexity or ambiguity there. the bad guys are all bad, and the good as pure as fallen snow. And the English photo guy is erudite but buffoonish - just like all English people, right? Wrong. Nothing is as simple and black and white as Hollywood blockbusters would have them be. I am really concerned that this same idealised, candy floss view of the world is shared by most Americans.

","I am a fan of Cruise. He has done strong work throughout his career (including the powerful psycho in TAPS right up to the nuanced pain of JERRY MAGUIRE)but event though there IS a strong story at the core - a damaged, haunted soldier from the Indian Wars looking for something instead of a whiskey bottle or suicide or both - is quickly brushed aside for the typically hollow, beautifully photographed Hollywood ""epic"" - lots of shots of Cruise practicing with a stick or a sword in front of gorgeous sunsets and snow-capped Japanese mountains. It becomes so predictable and ridiculously close to Costner's immersion with the Indians in WOLVES that it becomes stale and one-note. Sweeping, yes. Some great fight scenes, yes. And the Japanese lead is wonderful. But this Zwick film becomes as tortured and ridiculous as his other bloated ""historical epic"", LEGENDS OF THE FALL. Not worth your hard-earned cash."
"Pro Jury","5","3","7","11 December 2003"," Imported war expert profoundly dumb
","There were times in THE LAST SAMURAI when Tom Cruise has both smarts and skill.  Then, at other times, Tom is shockingly inept.  In his first battle it was easy for him to kill many Samurai.  Then all through the middle of the movie he suddenly is unable to lay a hand on any of them.<br/><br/>Next, Tom leaves his room to go rescue his friend, but he forgets his weapon that just moments ago was in his hands.  It was quite the airhead blunder.<br/><br/>Last and worst, all the nice Samurai who are seen to be husbands, fathers, sons, uncles, brothers, village elders and kind neighbors, are too often little more than cannon fodder for no good reason during the final third of the film.  <br/><br/>Specifically, there was no reason for the Samurai to patiently remain  the same distance away from the cannons as the gun crews worked to re-sight all of the cannons for a second volley.  Changing distance would make the second volley less than a sure thing.<br/><br/>In BRAVEHEART, each side has the same weapon type.  The face-to-face confrontations are most realistic.  But in THE LAST SAMURAI, Tom sees that he and the Samurai have only arrows and swords, while the bad guys have long range cannons and deadly rifles.  Any experienced soldier, most specially one who was alive during the time of the American Civil War which was a major teaching war for the western world, would want to OUT FLANK the cannon and infantry lines.  A face-to-face confrontation would be madness.  If you are looking for a smart flanking maneuver at the end of this movie, you will be waiting for a long, long time.  Tom's battle tactics are lazy and rather dumb for a so-called expert."

","A perfect example of a movie trying to have substance, but eventually winds itself down into a warm manageable action epic.  The Last Samurai does like most movies, in that it relies on movie cliche's to drive the story and in turn loses the ideas and meaning that it desperately tries to convey.  I rate it as a four because it fell short in so many ways, but I do appreciate certain aspects that the movie wanted to reveal.  I would like to add that those who liked the movie Braveheart will probably like this movie, and it in many respects can win over those who love action also."
"TxMike","Null","4","11","30 July 2004"," Excellent Samurai movie that never seems long.
","Students of film invariably turn to the older 'Seven Samurai' as one of the better movies of all time, but to me this movie, 'The Last Samurai' is much better for viewing by most of us modern movie-goers. That is not to say that 'technically' it is a better movie, because that doesn't matter for most of us. What matters is whether we can become emotionally immersed in the story, and this one allows that. While there are a number of good actors, only two carry the story -- Ken Watanabe, superb as Katsumoto, the leader in a remote village of last remaining Samurai in 1876 Japan, and Tom Cruise, equally superb as Nathan Algren, a battle-scarred  American soldier who is in Japan, along with others, to help them come into the modern world, and part of that is to develop an effective force of soldiers. <br/><br/>While historically significant, and based on the real transition Japan was going through in the late 19th century, the story here is fiction. The Japanese government in pushing its modernization was also bringing an end to the feudal system and the role of the Samurai. Carrying the sword became illegal. The bands of Samurai rebelled against this and the lead character, Katsumoto, both swore allegiance to the young king, and at the same time fought to keep the Samurai tradition. The finale features a defining battle between the village of Samurai and the newly-trained and weaponed Japanese troops. <br/><br/>The title, 'Last Samurai', refers to the group of Samurai, the last ones in Japan. The word is either singular or plural, depending on its context.<br/><br/>Overall a very worthwhile story and movie. The DVD is superb, and the extras are worthwhile."

","In a bid to try to improve trade links between Japan and the US Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired to train an army to overthrow a rebellious group of samurai led by their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). However, the army that Algren had been training encounter the Samurai before their training has been completed and the army end up being overpowered and defeated by the highly trained Samurai. Algren is the only survivor of this battle and in recognition of his bravery and determination Katsumoto spares his life and invites him to stay with the Samurai. During his time with the Samurai, Algren learns quite a bit about their culture and eventually embraces it and fights back against those that had originally hired him to overthrow the Samurai.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's performances and films tend to vary greatly in quality so I do tend to approach a lot of his films with caution. I can safely say that this is one of his better films and also one of his better performances. Cruise is well-known for bringing a sort of smug arrogance to a lot of his roles and he definitely brings some of that to his role as Captain Algren - although there's only a whiff of it here rather than full on smugness that we've seen from him before. Director and screenwriter Zwick gives Cruise a character he can really sink his teeth into - Algren is obnoxious and rude at the start and shows very little respect for his employees. He's the same with the Samurai at the start, but I think the difference is that the Samurai show him respect and allow him to embrace their culture. The general saying in life is that to 'gain respect you must first give respect' and I got the feeling that this was one of the messages contained within this film.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so of this film are slick and fast-paced, but the momentum does slow down where Algren is staying with the Samurai. Although the pace slackens at this point the film never becomes boring and Algren's narrative and the exploration of the Samurai culture were interesting enough to keep me involved with the story. The only criticism I have with this aspect of the story was when the ninjas attacked the Samurai - I just didn't see the point of it and it also seemed to add nothing to the story, but this really is a minor criticism.<br/><br/>Much like Seven Samurai, The Last Samurai is a slow-burning film that rewards the viewers patience with a spectacular closing act that is epic, clever and heart-breaking. Technical aspects of the film are also superb most notably the beautiful Japanese scenery and wonderful cinematography.<br/><br/>Clearly there are some politics involved here, but the politics are side-lined for the most part to make way for an interesting story about one man identifying more with an alleged 'rebellion' group over his own people. I've no idea how much of this story is true - it certainly references real life people such as General Custer and real-life events such as the battle of little bighorn, but never says anywhere that it's based on a true story. Truth be told, it doesn't matter to me whether the story is true or not because the film has a good story, it's moving at times, it's beautiful to look at, has some wonderful performances and to top it all the final battle is fantastic. Therefore it's very much worth seeing on its own merits."

If Holliywood knew how this former ridicule truly hurt my Japanese friends, they would have have taken a second look before slandering a wonderful culture.<br/><br/>So many have romanticized this era, despite the pall of death obviously borne by people of other countries.

","Excellent study of the Samurai culture. While the benevolence of these warriors is questionable from history, this movie makes a very earnest attempt at portraying their intentions as honorable.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe as the leader of the Samurai colony shows intense power and charisma in this crucial role. He is a brave warrior, a gifted commander, and a master of all things Samurai; yet he is fierce and ruthless in battle. He takes a captured US soldier under his wing, and converts that man from an enemy to a friend and ally. His new comrade in arms becomes as imposing a force on the field of battle as himself. The supporting cast of Samurai warriors and their families do magnificent jobs in making their characters believable and sympathetic.<br/><br/>The action choreography is handled extremely well, also. When blades are swung at innocent children, you feel intense fear for their safety. The US army serves as the dangerous invader, and this is accomplished well. William Atherton makes a fearful bad guy, as do others.<br/><br/>But then, ""Samurai"" dishonors itself with a fatal blunder.<br/><br/>It was like the the movie committed hari-kari on itself, casting Tom Cruise as the lead. Usually, Tom's ""deer-caught-in-the-headlights"" stare can be hidden behind intense action or a particularly good performance by other actors. This movie had both, but is still slashed to pieces by would-be-Samurai Tom. He handles a sword like a kid playing T-Ball. His intensity as a Samurai is about as electrifying and believable as a ""Rock 'em Sock 'em Robots"" toy.<br/><br/>His performance reveals nothing about the character, why the character changes, why he becomes a traitor, or throws in with his former enemies. It's almost a sin how his lamentable acting job diminishes what could have been a powerful story."

A hero of the American Civil War, the general Nathan Algren (played by the famous star whom it is useless to introduce) has however a strong bias for alcohol and is haunted by his murky past. However he is given the chance to start a new life in Japan where he has to command the army of the Japanese emperor who wishes to modernize his country. It is however more his counselor Omura who guides him in his choices and decisions. One day, Algren's army is slaughtered by a platoon of samurais. Algren becomes prisoner of them and is taken to their village. At first mistrustful because he is in a state of captivity, he ends up embracing the samurai way of life and gaining the friendship of the chief Katsumoto, apparently mesmerized by this bearded stranger with long hair with whom he thinks he has a lot to learn. Alas, the emperor (or rather Omura) wants to put an end to this archaic way of life and endeavors of negotiation with Katsumoto come to nothing. The samurai chief decides to attack maybe for the last time the army of the emperor now under Grant's command and as for Algren, he's stuck between a rock and a hard place...<br/><br/>Japan exerts a vivacious fascination on American cinema these last years and of course the Hollywood industry couldn't resist it. One year before ""the Last Samurai"" opened, Gore Verbinski made a remake of ""the Ring"" with satisfying results. Would this fascination serve to conceal a block from the most famous cinematographic firm in the world supposed to convey dream and escape? Here, if one goes on uncharted waters or rather uncharted lands at the level of the backdrop, one can't say the same thing for a story which is academic to a fault and to a film full of tasty tastelessness. I don't want to be malicious towards Edward Zwick but it seems to me that his scenario (even with the help of two partners) is like a catalog of clichés and commonplaces about several points. Just check the persona of Algren and his adventures: alcoholic, a mind eaten by past demons, a chance to redeem himself and to find a new sense to his stranded life by adapting to the samurai way of life which he embraces with pleasure and fascination. Then, after the emperor's denial to negotiate with Katsumoto, he's haunted by the sense of honor and sacrifice. So guess what camp he will choose. I forgot that there was also the obligatory idyllic love affair between him and the Japanese inhabitant which put him up under her roof. The story has unfortunately a stale Hollywood whiff which pervades the whole film and makes it formulaic from the first to the last image. I must say that I began to stay out of the film very quickly.<br/><br/>Apart from being compelled to the Hollywood codes and trademarks, the story also partly acts as a pretext to make the audience discover the treasures and secrets of the samurai way of life (Cruise is the intermediary between the two faces of Japan the film presents) but I must say that there's absolutely nothing wrong about it if one has kept his sensitivity and his thirst for knowledge about different peoples with different cultures. Zwick and Cruise manage to make us share their fascination for this ancient culture in which silence, patience and wisdom help to an improvement of one's personality.<br/><br/>But some qualities emerge of this linear story and this spate of clichés. The cinematography is clean, splendid. The fighting and war sequences are superbly organized and filmed and momentarily get the film out of its lethargy even if the final combat through its organization smells the reheated but Zwick tried to insert at all costs a happy-end to stop the film to end in a bitter way. Given the weight of this happy-end it's an artificial way to end his film.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is also handicapped by weak dialogs and his main star. Tom Cruise is as expressive as a brick wall, except in the sequences when he is supposed to be in anger. Then, he manages to shade his acting. His partners aren't well served because they have to act cardboard characters. Only Ken Watanabe, through the intensity of his looks and the eloquence of his lines is the stand-out of a lackluster cast. He even beats Cruise hands down.<br/><br/>So, ""the Last Samurai"" will appeal to you if: a) you are interested in Japanese culture b) you are a Tom Cruise devotee c) you are deeply attached to the standards of the Hollywood industry.<br/><br/>The others can easily do without it."

Won't describe it, see it and not read it. The action scenes are pretty good.<br/><br/>But I have one major doubt. The machine guns, I don't think the Gatler Guns were ever taken out of America. The machines guns were introduced in Europe only in the late 1890's or so.correct me if I am mistaken. There is also a lot of things about Japanese Customs that I didn't know about in the movie too.<br/><br/>How come this movie is not on the top 250 Greatest Movies of all time?

"spellzbreaker","9","2","4","21 February 2006"," A must see film
","This film is unarguable the greatest war movie in the early 21st century, as every events and actions that is occur in the film truly express the audience about the Japanese traditional life as it is back then. The scenes is well organize and carefully design. Specially the ending when the samurai face the imperial army of japan. The film maker really owe the martial art of war trainers they hired ""they really did a great job"". Like how we can see in the final battle, every single warrior is moving and show the real emotion in their face, not just the main character like other war movie. Everything is taken care so careful on almost every details that made the movie so perfect (and also good job on the sound affect, they successfully made an expression that greatly support the acting). Above all our effort, we cant run away from the fact that we are human and human make mistake no matter how hard they try to evade. The mistake is soo little, but really annoying if you notice. That American captain and the samurai's leader, is surely a man of war and a both a tactical genius. But what happened in the final battle really do not show their skills as a master of war, but more about a kid with no tactical strategy. As a Samurai, they know they can only kill their enemy as far as their katana can reach. Then why fighting in an open ground ? can't it just like the 1st battle in the wood? that way they have more chance to win. In my opinion,-although it is not precisely told in the film-, the samurai tried to separate the imperial army from their general, as they think the samurai is retreating, but they could at least form a loose formation that way they could reduce their casualty, not just stand in a group and wait to be hit by a howitzer. Overall, this movie is beyond extraordinary. I give 9 stars, 1 is flying to hell as the the last little mistake."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","2","4","14 September 2005"," The true meaning of honor.
","Quite honestly, I didn't expected very much from this movie when I first saw it. Like so many others I expected a sort of ""Braveheart"" with Samurai swords. The movie however turned out to be so much more than just another 'epic' historical movie. The story is told with almost poetic beauty and lots of visual splendor.<br/><br/>This movie also made me realize what true honor is. I understood why it was regarded as a beautiful thing for the Samurai to die on the battlefield and that death is not something that you have to fear. I finally understand the real meaning of dying with honor now. This is thanks to the way the story is told. It takes it time slowly, to explain the way of the Samurai and in the end you really feel somehow related, fully understanding and emotional involved with them.<br/><br/>Visually this movie is also a beautiful one. With ""The Thin Red Line"" director of photography John Toll already showed that he can beautifully handle poetic movies and with this movie he shows that once again. You can tell that lots of talent was involved behind the camera's. The art direction, costume design, every thing adds to the beauty and perfection of the movie. The movie is directed by Edward Zwick, who with ""Glory"" already showed how well he can handle this genre. Just like ""Glory"" this movie has its over-the-top moments but also just like in ""Glory"" its done so beautifully that it not becomes a complaint.<br/><br/>Unlike many others at the moment, I'm really a fan of Tom Cruise. I mean this guy is basically the best action-movie star at the moment. He has got the right looks and on top of that he truly is one great actor, which he already has shown on several occasions. Also in this movie he is the perfect leading man. Another fine role is portrayed by Ken Watanabe, who even received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. A bit too much credit perhaps but it doesn't take away that he plays his role perfectly.<br/><br/>But the movie is not just only beauty, it also is quite action packed and features some nicely filmed battle sequences and a spectacular finale.<br/><br/>The musical score by Hans Zimmer and friends also adds to the beauty of the movie and is quite underrated in terms of how well known it is.<br/><br/>A splendid looking, almost poetic like movie with still plenty of spectacular moments to also entertain and captivated the more 'casual viewer'.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"brainofj72","8","2","4","27 August 2005"," A Gentle Epic
","There is certainly no shortage of Hollywood epics these days, and it takes a certain flair in order for one to stand out amongst the rest. ""The Last Samurai"" is a film that most certainly separates itself from the masses.<br/><br/>The story follows American Army Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise), a man haunted by the horrors of war, as he is hired by the Japanese to train their army and lead them to victory over the Samurai, who are rebelling against the modernization of Japan. During the first battle against the Samurai, Algren is taken captive and forced to remain in an isolated Samurai village. There, he learns the enigmatic ways of the Samurai and comes to love their unique brand of civilization. He then switches sides and fights along side the Samurai and against his former peers.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is gentle, caring study of how modern society often tramples over ways of the past without even flinching. The film showcases beautiful cinematography and expert pacing. However, it is not without its flaws. The acting is hit-and-miss. Tom Cruise and Tony Goldwyn deliver average performances, while Ken Watanabe is quite exceptional as the peaceful leader of the Samurai village. The film, while excellent, also does have its share of clichés, such as a shaky slow motion scene where Algren remembers the massacre that haunts him. There are also a few moments where you have to wonder if director Edward Zwick is kind of trying to tug at your strings (to release the waterworks, that is).<br/><br/>But flaws aside, ""The Last Samurai"" is a film people should most certainly see. The social commentary is very relevant to modern society and the blend of beautiful scenic backdrops and violent battle sequences make this film truly stand out amongst a sea of stinkers such as ""Troy"".<br/><br/>8/10"
"racquel127","10","2","4","2 August 2005"," so much has been said about this movie, but still:
","just one more fan of this movie. I have seen so many movies, I guess you could call me movie-jaded. I barely like to go out to see new movies because they don't do what movies are supposed to do - interest, haunt, cause you to think, mesmerize, enchant - if I want some sick humor or plain old Hollywood plot, I can always tune in to the news... So here is a movie, The Last Samurai, and I figured: OK, let's try it... and I loved it. I'm not a big fan of wars, unfortunately in my country we see way too much of that, but the way it was portrayed was incredible. Really very, very good. I read that some people didn't like the romance part in the movie. There wasn't much of it, just a hint, and as a (very) romantic woman, I actually wouldn't have minded a more explicit romance between them, but even without it, there was such an aura of drama and suspense, that really, the movie didn't need it. I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. :-) Bye, Racquel"
"dee.reid","10","2","4","20 July 2005"," ""The Last Samurai""
","It seems I have only been given a few occasions in my life where I am genuinely ""in"" a film. Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" embodies the elements of the rousing historical action epic and strong human drama so perfectly I found myself unable to turn away from the glorious battle and sentimental character-driven plot. Where most films of this particularly high caliber sacrifice themselves to Hollywood conventions ¾ of the way through, ""The Last Samurai"" remains consistent and stays with you, even long after the credits and action have ceased.<br/><br/>One should also take into account the West's immense fascination with the East too. Samurai pictures, as relayed to Western culture most popularly by Akira Kurosawa, and martial arts flicks from the 1970s, have been the focal point of an intense study by American film-goers in the last half-century. ""The Last Samurai"" remains faithful to the myths of Japanese swordsmen by building on the mystifying qualities that made them so fascinating in the first place and also by carefully shying away from stereotypes.<br/><br/>Add to that, it has a magnificent leading actor, Tom Cruise, who is no stranger to action cinema and really threw himself into his character of Capt. Nathan Algren by training in various sword-fighting techniques and learning to speak much of his dialogue in Japanese. Similar to ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) and in the tradition of fish-out-of-water tales, Cruise's Algren is the disillusioned outsider from American civilization who wholeheartedly adopts the ways and the culture of a ""savage"" people and eventually participates in a grand epic battle against his former walk-of-life.<br/><br/>As the film opens, Algren is already a highly decorated Civil War veteran, who of course is suffering from open wounds of his battle time experiences. Living on the bottle and reduced to retelling fabrications of epic battlefield skirmishes (chiefly General George Custer's famous last stand), he makes an a** out of himself on stage and becomes a huge embarrassment to the theater owners.<br/><br/>His days as a soldier are not long behind him, however, as he is called to journey to Japan by Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) and a man named Omura (Masato Harata) to aid the Japanese government in crushing a rebellion of the samurai led by Katsumoto (Academy Award-nominee Ken Watanabe, in his first English-speaking American performance). The emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura), a young and indecisive man, has grown an immense fascination with all things Western, which has put the samurai, who have a 900-year history of serving the Japanese government, and their glorious past written out of future accounts of Japan's culture.<br/><br/>Algren's job in Japan is to train and act as an adviser for the emperor's army. After very little time training them, Bagley takes the opportunity to see them in battle; Algren says that they are not ready, as proved in a scene that is reminiscent of Zwick's own ""Glory"" (1989). In Japan's hills, a skirmish breaks out between the army and samurai, and in the ensuing chaos Algren is captured.<br/><br/>I have always admired films that embrace their subject matter like this one does, and I have to admit I have always admired films about the outsider who embraces an alien culture. Algren writes in his journal, about how he comes to question what he is doing there and how the Japanese and their culture are not so primitive. He engages in deep philosophical conversations with Katsumoto; for the first months Algren is in captivity, he does not speak to Katsumoto, as he still feels his allegiance to his own native America. But he comes to question that loyalty as he witnesses how disciplined and loyal the Japanese are, and how the questioning of own his values eventually makes him comrades with Katsumoto.<br/><br/>Where movies like this have failed, the Japanese would be very ignorant and would warm themselves up to the way of the White man and Algren will be the one to lead them to victory; that does not happen here. Algren is merely a participant in something far greater than himself and just as he had been assigned to do with the Americans, he acts an adviser to Katsumoto's samurai.<br/><br/>While in captivity, Algren, the outsider, is eventually welcomed into Katsumoto's household and is introduced to his family. Katsumoto's teenage son takes a strong liking to him but Katsumoto's sister-in-law, whose husband Algren killed in battle, is not so forgiving. Eventually Algren finds himself warming up to his captors and their dedication to preserving the Samurai code.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is really one of those movies that doesn't seem to get the praise it deserves. There are many breathtaking action sequences (none of which are stylized in any fashion) and you will not find any trace of the ""modern"" action movie in this film.<br/><br/>We are shown here, the way of a dying culture - the samurai. In this film, they are presented to indeed have a strong and dedicated ethic of preserving their history, a glorious history that will be forgotten as Japan moves forward into its modernization with the West and director Zwick shows us this.<br/><br/>The performers are excellent, especially Cruise but even more compelling are many of the Japanese actors. Ken Watanabe is simply amazing in his first American role. We actually believe in his strength and dedication to preserving the samurai code. Cruise takes on the role of acting as Katsumoto's outsider general in the film's final, spectacular action sequence between the Japanese military and the samurai.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is a beautiful and rousing epic that will certainly live on as a fantastic samurai film; it almost rivals any Kurosawa action-set piece (just kidding). But ""The Last Samurai"" does raise the bar as far as portraits of the East go in Western cinema. If ""The Last Samurai"" is remembered as the grand epic it surely is, then the East will get its respect in due time.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tomwerner","9","2","4","16 July 2005"," An excellent film ...
","An excellent fusion of Japanese and American film making with amazing photography and strong characterisation. The journey and the way it is followed by the director is rich and interesting, don't expect this to be a light-hearted film, many serious issues are covered throughout. Tom Cruise offers an atypical performance, breaking away from his usual mould of acting. Before watching this film I had never known much about Japan's rich history, now I want to learn more! One of the best things about this film is how impeccably you are made to believe that it is set in the 19th Century.<br/><br/>If you can get your hands on a DVD of this, the commentary is also very interesting, it is amazing that this film was shot in both Japan and New Zealand. <br/><br/>Films like this also further stead me in awe of the amazing culture of the far east (past and present).<br/><br/>All in all a great film!"
"winner55","3","2","4","5 July 2005"," The film television actually did better
","There's nothing wrong about this film - except pretty much everything. I.e., the film is fairly well directed, with enough money in production to give it a good look. The problem is that it is poorly thought-through, miscast, and politically and historically ill-conceived.<br/><br/>Actually, a much better story along similar lines was produced years ago on American television: ""Shogun"", with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune. That pains me to say. While I love Toshiro Mifune (hard to dislike, really), I hated Chamberlain and thought ""Shogun"" one of the more boring episodes in American TV history. But, dammit, the writers of that ""mini-series"" actually did their homework and got it right! Anyone familiar with Japanese culture had to give them the grudging respect that they had neither ""Westernized"" it nor subverted it.<br/><br/>Alas, the same cannot be claimed for ""The Last Samurai"". Watanabe, at 6'2', and with the most pale skin and bland features of any Japanese actor I can recall, is as about as typical of 19th Century samurai as his co-lead, Tom Cruise, who is as typical of 19th Century Americans as, say, Michael Jackson. Both over-emote embarrassingly. In America, this is as forgettable as Kevin Costner, but in Japan it's virtually criminal.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors all do fairly well. The depictions of life in a Japanese farming village are not insulting - they're just out of place. Samurai lived in the manor, they had little to do with the farmers supporting them. The battle scenes are very well choreographed, but utterly detached; I felt I was watching a soccer match between two teams I didn't care for. AS for the politics - did the producers, director, et all., not realize that the writers had essentially written apology for the eventual rise of the Tojo junta, which invaded China (to the tune of 36 million dead), and bombed Pearl Harbor? Not even right-wing novelist (and leader of a failed coup) Yukio Mishma had that audacity! To the Japanese right, Tojo was an embarrassment, to the left a shame. In fact he himself, converted to Christianity just prior to his hanging, hoped he wouldn't burn in hell; but no other Earthling agreed with that hope, even the Emperor condemned him. <br/><br/>To be fair, probably even the writers of this distasteful script did not know what they were doing. Neither did the film's investors. or they would never have sunk so much money into such a shoddy script.<br/><br/>See ""Shogun"" instead - or, better, rent some films by Kurosawa or Mizoguchi. (Actually, even some early Godzilla movies would be more representative.... Japan has a great culture; Tom Cruise is a bad actor; do the math yourself.)_"

","This movie is a good movie. The story is fine. I think this story is telling us the different of Japanese culture and Western culture. Samurais are lofty at that time. The people think that samurais are hero. The screenwriter writes a lot of samurai's culture in the movie. Nathan Algren ever resistance the Indian. He follows the superior's order to massacre a village that the people are unarmed. If he is a samurais, I think he will not massacre. After Indian had entire family, Japan become the buyer of Western, the Western make a good profit by selling things to Japan. I think this kind of things, It's only a kind of invasion culture. I love the samurai's wears. Tom Cruise is a Western people, after he wore the suit of armor, I think he is a real samurai and his acting is good."
"kaplara","6","2","4","26 January 2005"," The last Hollywood waste?
","As may be gleaned from the above title, I was not terribly impressed with this film, which was not to say it didn't have high points.<br/><br/>We'll start with what was impressive. Tom Cruise. The scene where he is selling rifles while drunk and half reliving his Indian fighting days had some creepy and impressive acting. When his military superior pulls him aside and Cruise tells him he'd kill him for free, chilling. When the translator asks how to scalp someone, and Cruise shows him, freaky. But these are just a few scenes; it's not that Cruise is bad during the rest of the movie, just that he has few lines which are at all impressive outside of those 3 scenes. Besides, by half way through the movie you're thinking oh not another boring Hollywood plot, which of course it is.<br/><br/>Well, I was already started on what's bad, so I'll continue. Essentially although none of the acting is bad, the plot is stupid putrid Hollywood garbage. It is always so sad when a movie starts with promise and ends up being such a fizzle. I mean did he have to live with the wife of the man he killed? I mean if she didn't fall in love with him and just hated him throughout the movie I wouldn't care, but she did fall in love with him, how ridicules! To make matters worse, white boy insists on riding into battle dressed as a samurai, and being the only survivor to return the fallen master's samurai's sword to the emperor. Oh, and who can forget the scene in which all the Japanese military, who just finished the slaughter, bowed to the people they killed, STUPID. Hollywood needs some new ideas, why couldn't they have let the movie progress with good dialog and interesting introspection. I found the scene in which the master of the samurai was looking at the Indian pouch a very telling and powerful moment, no noise, no violence, no campy push for a tear, just letting what is be, and letting that have the power. Towards the end the movie has way too much slow motion death and forced sadness, it's hokey and over-dramatic.<br/><br/>While this is no Battlefield Earth, I still could not recommend it overall. Parts of this movie show great potential, and parts reek of Hollywood hype.<br/><br/>~Ryan"

","Just to bring this up as an idea... The movie may not have been focusing on any particular samurai as the last samurai, but the resistance group lead by Katsumoto as a whole.<br/><br/>Samurai is both singular and plural, you don't say samurais. I think the title was actually meant to encompass the Samurai as a whole, fighting for bushido, and the old ways of Japan, versus the westernization or ""Americanization"" of Japan.<br/><br/>The movie really does show the struggle of all the samurai, not just Katsumoto, Katsumoto is just the star samurai, since he's the Daimyo.<br/><br/>And yes, this movie made me cry at the end.

","The Last Samurai was a trip to cliché city and back again.<br/><br/>It was a sort of Dance With Wolves II - The Japanese Episode.<br/><br/>Despite what some other reviewers have said, I believe the<br/><br/>second half of the film to be stronger than the first.  The first half<br/><br/>was woefully boring (most of the film was given away in the trailers<br/><br/>anyway),, the second half was much better, apart from the ending<br/><br/>which takes Hollywood syrupy schmaltz to another level.<br/><br/>Other comments are that Cruise overacts as usual, he's a good<br/><br/>actor, but I assume he took this role for the money.  Likewise, the<br/><br/>supporting cast was abysmal.  Tim Small wasn't bad as the<br/><br/>narrator/bumbling Englishman (stereotyped beyond belief)and for<br/><br/>me the best bit about Billy Connolly was the early resolution of his<br/><br/>character - you know the one, the Scotch/Irish role he has never<br/><br/>played before.

","It is hard to use enough superlatives to describe this film: epic, mesmerizing, breathtaking, etc. This is how movies are supposed to be. An intense storyline infused with action, emotion, and even a tad bit of humor. The acting is superb by not only Cruise, but also the supporting cast. Ken Watanabe (Kasumoto) is brilliant as the Samurai leader, and Tony Goldwyn once again portrays his despicable character so well that you think he should have a patent on it. Easily the best film so far this year. If Tom Cruise does not finally win the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Capt. Nathan Algren, then the Academy should have it's head examined."
"ChicagoRonin","Null","2","4","5 December 2003"," Overrated and Ignorant
","I am both surprised and a bit appalled at all the good buzz this film is getting from critics and audiences alike.  I don't want to seem snobbish, but I strongly believe the ""Last Samurai"" has serious problems from beginning to end.  The first points being historical - although the Japanese Meiji government did hire Western military advisors during their late 19th century modernization, they were primarily Prussian (for their land forces) and British (for their navy).  In addition, nowhere in my academic readings (I was an East Asian Studies major) did those advisors take part in putting down the actual samurai revolts that occurred (primarily the Satsuma and Choshu Rebellions), and certainly none became samurai and joined the revolts.  My next big problem is the one several others have mentioned - the ""Dances With Wolves"" syndrome.  Tom Cruise's character's exposure to the samurai, his observations and eventual assimilation seem honorable to many viewers, but this one found them both shallow on one hand and condescending on the other.  The characterization of all the samurai as being just, disciplined, and honorable is terribly one-sided, and seems to be part of the filmmakers agenda of casting everything in black and white terms (with ""good"" samurai on one hand and ""bad"" modernists on the other).  In actuality, though there were aspects of the samurai lifestyle that deserved respect, one most not forget it also involved a rigid caste system (with oppressed peasants at the bottom) and these men above all were soldiers - men trained to kill other men.  The so-called ""bad"" modernists did aid in the extinction of part of Japan's cultural uniqueness, but they also brought about modern sanitation, science, universal education, democratic reforms and rule of law.  And, to add, the sympathizers of traditionalists movements such as those advocated by the movie's character of Katsumoto (based on real-life warrior-rebel Saigo Takamori) were the one's who eventually rose to power in the 1930s, using the bushido code to justify the brutal militarist regime that subjugated China, Korea, and Southeast Asia and sneak attacked the US Navy at Pearl Harbor (makes Tom Cruise's decision to aid the suicide charge during the ""Last Samurai's"" key battle all the more ironic). Tom Cruise's rapid learning of traditional kenjutsu (swordfighting) and mastery of using 'mushin' (no mind) in battle is both inaccurate and insulting - especially since anyone who knows a little about traditional Japanese martial arts is aware that it takes years (and not the movie's four months) to become capable enough to utilizes these skills effectively in actual combat (Heck, it took me ten years to get my black belt in aikido, and I started training in Japan and am half Japanese).  And don't even get me started with that climactic scene in which Cruise seems to lecture the Meiji Emperor on the meaning of being Japanese.  Last of all, I have problems with ""Last Samurai"" strictly in movie terms.  I personally found the film's pacing to be a mess.  The introduction of Tom Cruise's character at the film's beginning seemed rushed - I would have liked to get a better grip on his psychology before the voyage to Japan.  Once in Japan, too much happens over too much time without any real drive or motivation.  Why do Katsumoto's men allow Cruise to train in kenjutsu?  Why doesn't Cruise (a veteran field soldier with frontier experience) even attempt an escape into the mountains once he's well?  And despite director Edward Zwick's publically stated admiration for Akira Kurosawa, he doesn't have that great director's painterly eye, or the ability to capture the true kinetic ferocity of combat (cinematographer John Toll gets the lighting right, but otherwise, during the battles, stuff just happens without any real internal rhythm).  He even misses out completely on what Kurosawa brought to his period dramas thematically - even in his most rousing adventure films, Kurosawa always reflected on the downside of the samurai lifestyle: the unceasing violence, the uncertain life, the entrapment by rules, and the hollowness of making a life by killing.  The ""Last Samurai"" was not even really filmed in Japan - its verdant green fields and hills shot in scenic New Zealand (I kept waiting for Frodo and Gandalf to leap from behind a hill) and its Tokyo city streets built on an LA backlot - and I felt the sense of artificiality running through its every frame."

","After viewing several comments on this site, I honestly don't get how so many people could think this movie was as bad as they say.  But that is their opinion and they are entitled to it.  But I, for one, absolutely LOVED this film.

To me, all that stuff takes the element of surprise and true appreciation away from a film.  I like to just know what it is about, and decide if its good for myself.  The ONLY thing that I didn't really care for was the computer graphics in some of the early scenes, but that is it.  And that, to me, had no affect on the story.  But if you didn't like this movie, no big deal.  That doesn't change how much I loved it.  But just let people decide for themselves.  I wouldn't want people potentially not seeing, what I thought to be, a great movie just because of some bad reviews.  So in conclusion, SEE THIS MOVIE."

It's difficult to fault the film based on its technical merits.<br/><br/>From an average viewers perspective, however, it's far from the perfect picture.

","I must admit that in watching The Last Samurai, I was totally amazed with the movies' stunning visualizations portrayed by the director. In the tradition of ""bushido"", the way of the warrior, one can easily see and understand the films transition as it progressed from the cynical/irrational/desperate behavior of Tom Cruise, with his portrayal of his part as Nathan Algren, a veteran of the American Civil war who will work for anyone, is hired by Americans who want lucrative contracts with the Emperor of Japan to train the peasant conscripts for the first standing imperial army in modern warfare using firearms. The imperial cabinet's first priority is to repress a rebellion of traditionalist Samurai who remain devoted to the sacred dynasty and reject the West and their policies and even refuse weapon, such as rifles. Yet when his ill prepared superior force sets out too soon, their panic allows the sword-wielding samurai to crush them. Badly wounded Algren's courageous stand makes the samurai leader Katsumoto spare his life; once nursed to health he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way, and participates as adviser in Katsumoto's failed attempt to save the Bushido tradition, but Omura gets repressive laws enacted, he must now choose to honor his loyalty to one of the embittered sides when the conflict returns to the battlefield. In Japan, Civil War veteran Captain Nathan Algren trains the Emperor's troops to use modern weapons as they prepare to defeat the last of the country's samurai. But Algren's passion is weighed when he is captured by the samurai and learns about their traditions and code of honor. He begins to understand the enemy and realizes the error of many ways. As the Emperor attempts to eradicate the ancient Imperial Samurai warriors in preparation for more Westernized and trade friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him. Still, ""The Last Samurai"" manages to succeed in a number of ways, mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","0","26 June 2011"," Amply unfolded, albeit with a real sense of nuts and bolts execution at work, Zwick's film drags us around but ultimately into a world of alienation and shifting attitudes.
","When we first observe the lead in Edward Zwick's The Last Samurai, he is sitting alone in a small room, looking dishevelled, backstage somewhere, as his presence at the evening's function he is partly hosting is verbally stirred to a large crowd. He looks rather despondent, as if only something akin to that of a house-fire could get him to shift out of his chair; around him, crumpled up American flags of the era lie strewn around encapsulating how it is he feels about both the nation he is presently in and the sorts of things more broadly linked to that of the warfare in which they are engaging. The man makes intermittent use of a bottle of hard liquor, both later whilst on-stage as well as now; each of these things seeing him firmly within a state of disenchantment and dissatisfaction at where he currently is in life. Whom he is, is Nathan Algren, played here by American actor Tom Cruise; what he is, is a fearsome Civil War Captain and all-round warrior figure whose experiences on the front line of America's untamed west in the 1870s has led him to be what he is now. His eavesdropping of the master of ceremonies talk him up as one thing, when it's clear he's something else, goes hand in hand with the erratic nature of his later performance; something which should have seen the reciting of stories from the front but instead, has Algren scare the audience half to death with a loaded rifle – the entire episode acting as the final straw for a change Algren sees fit to apply to his life.<br/><br/>That change, or turning of a proverbial page to begin anew, arrives in the form of a couple of cross dissolves; cross dissolves enabling us to leap to the port of Yokohama in an unobtrusive manner after a mite of exposition from those required to provide as such. Thus begins Algren's new existence, an existence allowing him to once again feel good about what it is he does well during the throngs of war thus incurring the reinvention of that drive to get up and fight once more for a cause. Edward Zwick's film goes on to formulate into a neat little war film-come-character study, something with an eye on the grandeur; an eye on the sweeping, all-embracing drama of it all in spite of the actual nucleus of what it is that's interesting here being the intricacies between varying cultures that co-exist as well as beliefs and minute shifts in attitude.<br/><br/>The seeds of Algren's arc to a happier existence begins with a small clan of Japanese warriors at war with those of whom occupy similar grounds. He is employed by the existing Japanese Emperor to whip an army of runts into shape; an army of whose recruits are without the necessary skills needed to take on this additional force in combat, of whom are a renegade bunch that have already up-and-gone off into the wilderness under the tutelage of a Colonel Kurtz-sort it's eventually revealed is none other than Ken Watanabe. In beginning with these troops, Algren is able to put aside all his prior problems with alcohol and begin afresh relatively quickly; his abilities as a warrior and skills as a teacher some would say unrealistically coming back to him in no time at all. His point of no return is established via his standing beside a large target and demanding a yet untrained warrior fire off a musket round; Algren is far from being afraid to die, and here displays a real dispassion toward his own life such is where he presently is.<br/><br/>The crux of the film arrives when that of the opponents to The Emperor's army arrive; shrouded in armour and ominous looking masks upon greeting the battlefield, they are mysterious and carry with them a preordained aura. Staying in sync with introducing something as one thing before breathing fresh life into them thereafter, the eventual developments see Algren caught and held by this renegade bunch, a bunch whom actually come across as rather nice and are a far cry from the threatening, inhuman introduction they carried. The film beds into a quaint groove of training montages and a flurry of forlorn facial expressions as time ticks by; Watanabe's interests lie in sticking to an older, more traditional way of life away from the modernising and expansion of Japan those of whom in the Emperor's ranks wish to adhere to - the parallels lying with the fact Zwick himself is sticking to a very old, very world weary framework but constructing the whole thing as if he were inventing the damn idea.<br/><br/>The film is not without a certain charm, nor indeed degrees of guile in its flicking through the necessary obligatory scenes allowing for one to overcome personal changes we are able to see coming and the conflict we observe nearing. Most of the early exchanges generally call to mind an awful lot of what Zwick did far more effectively in his 1989 film Glory, specifically those scenes involving Broderick's character and a squad of African-Americans, only here it is without the same level of bite. The Last Samurai is hit and miss; a film in which, away from all the obligatory shooting and slashing, lies an intricate character piece which works for what it is in the long run, but does enjoy a good action sequence in spite of the fact it is precisely these things that led its lead to the mind-frame he was in. Yet, the film is difficult to truly get riled about – it treads enough water to keep us involved to its finale and chugs along with a heavy, mandatory feel about proceedings, all too often leading to well executed, if rather tame dramatics."

","Where would Hollywood be without its all-pervading soundtrack? Often, I think, nowhere. It's no secret that the soundtrack is an important element in any film, but when you get a wall-to-wall sentimental swish of sound such as in The Last Samurai, you know the film isn't half as good as its cracked up to be. This is very much Dancing With Wolves with sushi - the noble reactionary Japanese as symbolised by all that noble samurai history and it noble traditions pitted against the venal modernisers who will stop at nothing to drag their country into the modern age and get their filthy hands on all the gold and goodies the modern age will bring them. The Last Samurai is, sadly, despite some well filmed battle films and some great scenery - even the pouring rain is picturesque, don't you know - pretty much standard fair (and it doesn't surprise me that the saintly Roger Ebert gives it four out of five - he made too many elemental errors in too many reviews for me to be able to take him fully seriously any longer). The story is loosely based on a real-life character, a Frenchman called Jules Brunet, who sided with the shogun in a civil war in the late 1860s. This Cruise vehicle inexplicably postpones everything for ten years and in many other ways simplifies the truth. Nothing wrong with filching and then bastardising history as a basis for your film, story, musical or poem - even Shakespeare did it - and I'm sure it can be well done. But when it comes with that mushy wall-to-wall soundtrack and faux profound lines about 'destiny' you know this is art as popcorn entertainment rather than anything more serious. As usual, the IMDb fraternity and, no doubt, it sorority either loved it - awesome and 'so deep' - or hated it. I did neither. The Last Samurai is a competent actioner with Tom Cruise and an absolutely gorgeous woman as the 'love interest', the widow of the samurai warrior he killed. Our Tom starts off living in her house on her brother's orders - her brother is the top dog - and initially threatens to kill herself if he doesn't leave (she thinks he stinks like a pig). But eventually she softens and falls in love with the reformed drunkard and, were this to take place in America, would undoubtedly have 'fixed him a steak' and shown her all her high school pictures. As it is, she insists he wears her dead husband's samurai armour for the final showdown battle with the venal, nasty, two-faced modernisers. Look, The Last Samurai is a great film for a night in with two bottles of Shiraz and loads of nibbles. It's pretty, has Tom Cruise - part of the prettiness - and that wall-to-wall soundtrack I keep banging on about whose sole purpose is to to keep you happy and informed as to what you should be feeling. It might well be your bag. By the way, I really, really doubt Japanses cities had telephone poles and lines littering their streets as this film would have you believe. So ignore them and get on with the soundtrack. Oh, and by the way: in an odd sort of way the casting of Scotsman Billy Connolly as an Irishman sums up that The Last Samurai doesn't quite add up. Connolly's oirish accent keeps slipping into his native Glaswegian within just a few seconds of him opening his mouth. So why couldn't the producers have simply made Connolly's character a Scotsman? Problem solved (well, except for that bloody soundtrack)."

","Hollywood have often found subjects in history and have try to make it into an American story. World War II is often a subject that is tackled to make the Americans look great with the expenses of the role the British and other allies had. This time Hollywood focuses on Japanese history in 1870s where the Japanese starts to modernise, industrialise and contact the rest of the world. It makes out that the Americans played an important part, despite that it was the British and the Germans were actually involved.<br/><br/>Set in 1876 and 1877, Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a veteran of the American Civil War and Indian Wars. He performs for audiences in San Francisco and suffers from alcoholism and war guilt. He receives an offer from his out sergeant Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and former commander, Lieutenant Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to go to Japan to help train their new army to fight the Samurai resistance, fighting against modernisation. Early on he makes some progress when training the Japanese conscripts, similar to Edward Zwick's earlier film Glory (including having an Irish sergeant and shooting a pistol to show the soldiers are not ready for battle). But Algren and his regiment are sent to fight the samurais before their were ready. During the battle the new Army is easily defeated and Algren is capture. The leader of the Samurais, Lord Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) keeps Algren alive, hoping to learn about his enemy. Algren is trapped in a small village for a whole winter, but Katsumoto and the village teach him about the samurai culture. Algren goes naviee, and ends up joining the samurais, improving his fighting style and respecting the fighters.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick is a respected director, having done some good films in his career. He is an action director, but his films do have a moral core behind them, such as Glory and Blood Diamond. The action in this film is bloody, and well executed. It is excellent viewing in that sense. His cinematographer John Toll also shoots some lovely scenes, with excellent landscapes of New Zealand (a stand in for Japan). Hans Zimmer also conduces a good score to the film. Zwick does show Algern and Katsumoto as out and out good whilst Bagley and the Emperor's adviser Omura (Masato Harada) as the true bad guys in a typical Hollywood fashion other characters are shown to be more mixed. The Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is shown to be a weak-willed young man who needs advise, but respects Katsumoto and is only bringing about modernisation because he thinks that is what is best for Japan. Timothy Spall plays an English interpreter Simon Graham: he starts out as the Hollywood stereotype of an Englishman (which I hate), but shows to be a character who respects both sides and is a more realistic character (except for the Hollywood Englishness). There is a really good cast to the film (except Billy Connolly). Ken Watanabe earned an Oscar nod for his performance and he was really good: he is a talented actor. Tom Cruise offers the typical Tom Cruise performance, which is pretty decent and he is good in the action scenes. They are a number of talented Japanese actors in the film who performed well. Zwick has been good at casting in the past.<br/><br/>This is an interesting subject of history, and an area which isn't very well known by people in the West. The film was very popular in Japan and was praised for it's handling of Japanese culture. But there are historical inaccuracies (which I will also score down a film if they are major). As said it was the British and the German who was trained and built up the Japanese military because Britain had the best navy at the time, and the Germans had the best army. The Japanese saw Britain as a model because they were island nations. Japan's first modern alliance was with the British in 1902. Japan also modernised because they did not want to end up being like China who was seen as the sick man of Asia and was being craved up by European nations. Russia was a serious threat to Japan. The Bushidō code also had a darker side to it, which we saw during the Second World War. This was skipped over during the film.<br/><br/>The film also reminded me Glory and also trying to be a bit like Dances with Wolves goes East. Zwick did lift some scenes from Glory and placed them in The Last Samurai. That was a bit lazy. Zwick also seemed to try and be like David Lean and Akira Kurosawa when making this film, especially the latter. He wanted to make a grand epic like those two, but more violence. He should have just tried to make a film in his own way.<br/><br/>It's a decent enough film, but I think it would have been better as a Japanese film, not a Hollywood film about Japan."
"JJohns","Null","0","0","12 March 2004"," Pleasing to the Eye yet questionable
","This was yet another interesting film to watch and enjoy for the year 2003. I however, patiently waited for it to come to the dollar show. Initially, I thought it was another movie seen before. Another miss. So with a story as historically enriched and complex as this one, I can only give my perception of the film. *Spoiler Warning Ahead* My overall impression of the film was that the overall performances were admirable from everyone. I felt the fellowship, the honor, the courage and the fight for the Samurai tradition to prevail with a little Braveheart and Dances with Wolves thrown in. Hell even a taste of The Last Emperor. What I didn't feel was the story's credibility and ending. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren who is a damaged war veteran who drowns himself in whiskey and despair. He is then called upon by Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to train unskilled Japanese soldiers for war. During a fight, he gets kidnapped by the enemy Katsumoto and his men. Instead of killing Algren, Katsumoto (played very well by Ken Watanabe) spares his life ""to learn his enemy"". As a result, Algren learns to love and respect his enemy and joins them in the battle(s) to preserve their heritage. I'm missing some key points here but I'm sure its been summarized somewhere else.<br/><br/>What I found intriguing about this story is the respect and discipline the Samurai people lived by. The culture alone is so rich and unique. One of the driving themes of this story is the Traditional codes these Samurai people lived by. Once Algren is kidnapped, he is thrown into a world and concept unlike the life he knew. You could say that he is literally thrown into self-discovery, peace and through this peace, he discovers  a life of simplicity and careful fellowship that it enriches his life. He becomes focused. I also found Algren's perseverance admirable.<br/><br/>
So what are the things that turned me off? Tom Cruise being the last Samurai. In that last battlefield scene, he should have died but being Hollywood, we are forced to suspend our disbelief. I just didn't appreciate that. Then he limps himself in to give the Emperor Katsumoto's sword. He just comes out with a limp and tears. The Emperor should have just let him commit Seppuku. Then the Emperor decides to become a leader and deny a treaty they battled over. I'm not feeling that. Overall, a watchable film just not credible."

","7.5/10 ""It is a bit over dramatic, and if one has no prior knowledge to the samurai, he/she will most likely overlook many things.""<br/><br/>
This movie is one of the best American made movies I have seen concerning the Samurai. There are so many subtle points of accuracy that, without prior knowledge of Bushido or Japanese culture, one would easily miss or disregard.<br/><br/>Of course, there are better films out there concerning Samurai (Kurosawa anyone?) and this book shares some similarities with the epic novel Shogun (and Shogun is far more detailed and less Hollywood, of course) and how can one not complain of the Hollywood ending? Except for the fact that Tom Cruise repeats a line that Ken Watanabe said which establishes Tom Cruise as ""The Last Samurai."" Of course, it can be argued that Ken Watanabe was the Last Samurai.<br/><br/>What is with the emperor! My biggest complaint is the emperor, who is a major pansy! hahaha unfortunately I do not know how the emperor was at the time, perhaps he was young and perhaps he did have a high pitched English voice (if I were Japanese, I might even be a little offended that the living god says a line along the lines of ""I am only the emperor if they want me to be""... c'mon! This is a country whose Emperor ruled under a mandate until MacArthur forced the Emperor to denounce his own divinity after World War II)<br/><br/>Still, the cinematography is great! I have heard some complains, such as some scenes where they show a man meditating and pouring tea (for those who don't know, the tea ceremony was quite the cleansing experience, held in high esteem) and I do agree; some of the music does border on over dramatic, although I enjoyed it a lot.<br/><br/>The ending p***ed me off. I mentioned it above, it did go all Hollywood.<br/><br/>Some question ""why did Tom Cruise's character go to their side"" to me, the most questionable aspect was why the samurai didn't kill Cruise. To the Samurai, and to the Japanese soldier in World War II, capture is worse then death. In death one can find dignity, however, being captured is being put lower than a dog. The Japanese did some sick stuff to their prisoners, because they do not see captives as human anymore. Anyways, it is sort of feasible that they kept Cruise (ooo~ because he has the strong fighting spirit ~ooo) , although, the Japanese had this whole idea back then of Westerners being the devils (with big noses)<br/><br/>On a side note, the ninja scene was awesome. The weapons they used were very historically accurate. This is an example of one of those small details most people probably did not pick up.<br/><br/>This movie is so underrated. I think that Cruise and Watanabe (especially Watanabe) do a great job, and despite some of its more Hollywood aspects, it does an excellent job of capturing the Samurai It is a bit over dramatic, and if one has no prior knowledge to the samurai, he/she will most likely overlook many things. spirit and even throwing in some hidden Bushido."

","It is always refreshing to see a film that eschews the standard American chest-beating patriotism. The Last Samurai certainly has all the hallmarks of a Hollywood epic: slick production, blood splattering battle scenes and a hefty dose of schmaltz, but its over-riding message is that the West in its bullish over-exuberance, has habitually steam-rollered ancient indigenous cultures in its relentless pursuit of progress.<br/><br/>Obviously, this is not a new cinematic idea: a small bunch of stubborn warriors up against vast armies in the defence of some abstract ideal. Mel Gibson gave those nasty Englishmen a good battering in Braveheart (FREEDOM!!!), Asterix and Obelix gave the Romans a pasting on a regular basis - people just love an underdog. Luckily, the soldiers they are up against are generally really crap at fighting, so the little guy often prevails.<br/><br/>In The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise is Captain Nathan Algren, a veteran soldier, disenfranchised with American battle strategy after years of bloody conflict with the American Indians. After hitting the bottle in a big way, he is persuaded to help train raw Japanese recruits in modern battle techniques as part of a trade agreement between the two countries. The Japanese authorities hold sway over the young teenage Emperor and are worried about a rebellion led by the legendary Samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanbe).<br/><br/>It is soon clear that the men in Algren's charge are hopelessly inexperienced conscripts who cannot even fire a rifle straight. But the Japanese and American authorities led by the unscrupulous Colonel Bagley (Algren's former superior) are determined to crush the rebellion early. Even with guns, the army are no match for the deadly Samurai, and in the ensuing massacre, Algren is captured and taken to Katsumoto's village.<br/><br/>During his captivity, Algren discovers that his hosts are far from savages. They are disciplined, honourable warriors who live to defend the Samurai way of life. He stays with Katsumoto's sister, Taka, and her two small children. Even though he had killed Taka's husband in the battle, he is made welcome. Over the following months he immerses himself in the culture, learning the fighting technique and brushing up on his Japanese.<br/><br/>Eventually, he is returned to Tokyo, but when Katsumoto is banished from the Emperor's council and effectively exiled, Algren's patience with the authorities finally runs out and he rejoins the Samurai.<br/><br/>Algren's running conflict with Bagley is a key part of his decision. To him Bagley represents everything bad about American history and Western short-sightedness. It was Bagley had ordered the cold-blooded killings of Indian women and children that haunted Algren's dreams. Through Bagley, the Americans are portrayed as self-important bullies greedy for power - it is a skewed vision of the American dream - Algren views General Custer as a 'murderer who fell in love with his own legend and his troops died for it.' In a nice twist, it is this animosity that leads him to side with Katsumoto as the Samurai face their own Last Stand against the newly tooled-up Japanese.<br/><br/>Cruise is on good form. His transformation from embittered alcoholic to sword-wielding Samurai general is well handled and not too hammy. He has always done a nice line in tortured heroes searching for inner-strength, and in that respect this is the perfect vehicle for him. He is, however, acted off the screen by Ken Watanbe who is immense and totally believable as the rebel leader torn between loyalty to his Emperor and protecting his people's traditions.<br/><br/>As epics go, The Last Samurai is admirably unassuming - it is a simple story that is well told. The ending is overblown and far too long and Algren's love interest with Taka seems to have been shoe-horned in to appease the studios, but it is certainly worth a watch.<br/><br/>7/10"

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","11 February 2004"," Superior entertainment
","The critics have not been overly supportive of this movie, but it is one of the best action-adventure films since ""Gladiator"". It is far more exciting than ""Master And Commander"" with well-choreographed fights and stunning battle sequences, while the visceral violence is even more gripping than in ""The Return Of The King"". <br/><br/>Set almost exclusively in Japan in 1876 with a good deal of Japanese dialogue, this is far more respectful of oriental culture than ""Lost In Translation"" and reminiscent of ""Dances With Wolves"" in its appreciation of the 'native' way of life. In fact, it was largely shot in New Zealand and the cinematographer is simply wonderful, while the weaponry and costumery are impressively authentic. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays Nathan Aldgren, an American civil war veteran who is still revolted and traumatised by the role he played in the indian wars. In the life of the samurai, he finds the honour and dignity that give purpose to life - and death - and, when taken captive by them, soon goes 'native'.<br/><br/>
Ken Wanatabe is noble in the eponymous role and indeed all the Japanese actors give deeper performances than their Hollywood counterparts. If director Edward Zwick - who did so well with ""Glory"" - had dispensed with the narration and ended the movie with the conclusion of the final battle, this would have been an even stronger work, but it is still superior entertainment."

","The epic movie seems to creating a lot of interest among producers and when we see this we can wonder no further. These movies are very moving and draw you in with their deep characters and even deeper stories. The dedication required from cast and crew will be far higher than for the regular popcorn movie designed to put butts in seats. If well done this does translate to the audience who become fully engrossed in a good story and will remain transfixed to the very end despite these movies usually long time length.<br/><br/>
The Last Samurai' is indeed an epic movie displaying all the necessary characteristics indicated above. Unfortunately the translation to the audiences did not carry through to the Academy and this will be largely due to the fact that The Lord Of The Rings' trilogy has come to end and is due for a few necessary awards. I am not going to look at the look at the reasons for the few Academy nominations, but rather at what aspects made this movie capture my imagination above others.<br/><br/>As good as it is - it is flawed in a few places. The one area of particular note is the beginning. It is a logical start to the movie which quickly introduces us to some of the main characters and tries to show us the mental torment of Nathan Algren (Cruise). He is plagued by the memories of the atrocities of the American army when they fought the Indians. The right direction was thus set as this enables the story to ease quite nicely into an interesting clash of cultures later on, but at this point the moviemakers seem intent on quickly moving us through an important part of the film where we see the characters problems of conscious and the shame he holds for his own culture. The scenes splutter across the screen as we are ushered through the obligatory character aspects to the juicy part of the movie which for me is where the unprepared Japanese trainees have to face the formidable Samurai's. From here on, the movie flows gracefully until the final scenes.<br/><br/>During the final stand of the Samurais', some of the Japanese soldiers start to exude pity and remorse in the face of the slaughter of their fellow countrymen who are after all only taking a stand for the Japanese way. The acting here is not of the highest caliber and nearly ruined what was a most grand climax. It appears hammed and although this was the right emotion to portray for the moment, it was not strong enough especially in the face of other performances.  <br/><br/>Despite the opening scenes, there is a real effort to tell a meaningful story. This is evident through the restraint exercised over the characters. The bad guys do not have cheap punch lines, but as in the case of Algren's superior officer, seems well schooled and sophisticated. The love interest between Cruise and his fallen foes wife is completely devoid of the high testosterone charged skirt chasing reminiscent of some of Cruise's past characters. The only hint at sexual yearning was when she lovingly dresses him for the final battle. The final scene consists of a loving look into each others eyes. This clearly indicated the intent at making a meaningful movie which may mature on DVD stands like a fine red wine.<br/><br/>The epic movie needs an epic character and this is provided in the form of Cruise. Complexities of character for the lead role are necessary. To this regard, he portrays a man distanced from his own culture which practices the end justifies the means. The culture which he falls into the capture of has elements which he does not approve of, such as their apparent lack of value for life when they must take their own life in the face of defeat. But he warms to them since they are standing against the predatory culture of which is so ashamed. The Americans and ambitious Japanese see savages while he sees a people who wish to retain their ancient ways which are pure in intent. The characters obstacle of acceptance is great since he has killed one of their best in battle but was ultimately defeated meaning that he should have taken his own life. His spirit and discipline wins them over and they accept him as a warrior worthy of their own. The epic character had found that their belief in similar principles endeared them to each other.<br/><br/>Cruise as always has a commanding presence throughout and after the opening twenty minutes truly shows that he has what he takes to win an Oscar. Although it will not be this year, his dedication to making each project that he takes on a success must mean that he will eventually win it. I have always thought of his name on the poster as a quality stamp of approval. Even his less popular movies are still commendable. The Last Samurai' leaves no room for doubt that this is a man who takes his craft very seriously indeed  for a movie of this magnitude, it needed to be.<br/><br/>
Authenticity is important for the epic movie and we are not disappointed. The sword fights are well rehearsed and the cinematography is well orchestrated here as we do not stay long with one shot which heightens the action as well as not allowing for evidence of unskilled swordsmanship  not that these guys were that bad, though. The costumes were striking and did not appear to drown the characters as sometimes occurs in period movies.<br/><br/>
The acting was solid throughout with a few minor noticeable exceptions. Connolly was entertaining for the short screen time that he occupied. Tony Goldwyn was good as the self  righteous and pompous Colonel Bagley. The Emperor was portrayed very well by Nakumura as being weak and open to influence from the greed of the West. At the end he realizes his heritage and sees the traders for what they are. A lot of acclaim has gone to the supporting actor, Ken Watanabe, and although rightfully bestowed it is for me as already mentioned, Cruise who leads from the front.<br/><br/>Depth of character and depth of story is the strongest redeeming elements here. We have a character haunted by a tortured past, disillusioned with his culture and sells' his skills, which were used for suppression, for money. He is captured by a group of rebels who may be different in many ways from himself, but have the same sense of disillusionment with their culture which is losing it's purity for greed. He had finally found himself and was willing to die for it, as were the Samurai. The epic movie must mean that the hero has to have something that he believes in so dearly, that he is willing to die for it. Only by doing this, will he find ultimate fulfillment and become the gallant hero that the audience were wishing for. This story is delivered with a juxtaposition of cultures skillfully crafted leading us not only to the end of the hero's journey, but to teach us something about ourselves as well. Indeed, this is upper end entertainment well worth a place in the DVD cabinet."

For much of the duration of the film, it meets the expectations, especially with respect to the rendition of the atmosphere and in the building of the conflict between the modern world and the old ways of the traditional Japanese culture. Tom Cruise is good as you expect, but does not get to the level of an Oscar performance. The film gets worse in its last part. First it is too long, suffering as many of the Hollywood films lately of the tendency to add the unjustified half hour to our film experience. The historical truth is badly twisted, but this would be no problem if this would buy some real emotions. What happens is that the Hollywood clichees take over any artistic logic - soldiers die in the slow motion we have seen in that many action films, the main hero dies exactly the way you would expect from minute two of the film, and even some dream-like  rosy end is stuck as a final scene without any reason. <br/><br/>That's how what could have been one of the great films of Hollywood falls into mediocrity.

He never presents an authentic one if you ask me!) or was I watching Top Gun all over again ... but his character stabilised and solidified to be easily overshadowed by the more imposing glacial Katsumoto and Samurai support cast.<br/><br/>Read other comments for the plot which I think, to be fair, was quite earnest. Ex. Civil War Captain takes a contract in Japan to teach the newly formed Japanese Imperial Army (if there is any historical merit in the story line it makes me shudder just thinking of the catalyst for the impending 20th century atrocities on the Chinese mainland and throughout SE Asia), they are under-prepared, he gets captured, an affinity is established which drives him to rescue his captor and take them into battle one last time...<br/><br/>Now the bits that jump out at me: costume - absolutely stunning - I recently went to the exhibition at the New South Wales Art Gallery where many Samurai relics were displayed including a full suit of 17th century Samurai armour... fantastic and authentic; cinematography - gorgeous - sure you could see some of the paint-ins but the vistas during the final battle were tremendous; the fight scenes - visceral, gristly, gory and realistic - especially the helmeted samurai appearing from the mists to take on the unprepared Japanese army - limbs flying all around; the characterisation (usually missing or at least superficial for most Cruisers) was great - especially Katsumoto and the relationship between Algren and Taka (god, she is gorgeous) and finally sound - I find most people overlook this as cinema is such an intense ocular experience - great surround and effect - the unsheathing of swords, their echo of intertwine - the subtle soundtrack - obviously western with so many Japanese overtones.<br/><br/>If you can tolerate a period piece, and a Cruiser at that, with a reasonable but obviously regurgitated story line then this is definitely worth a watch."

He is convinced by representatives of the Japanese government to train their ragtag troops to fight against the samurai.<br/><br/>In their first battle against the samurai, the army is routed and Algren is captured.  He switches allegiance to the samurai after staying with them, learning their ways.  I suspect he is trying to find honor as a warrior by reversing his role into the Indian's.<br/><br/>This is where I find it hard to embrace the picture.  I don't think the samurai are noble.  Indeed they are foolish in the face of modern weaponry. And Algren is a tragic figure.  He can't return to America where his demons lie but he also stands apart in Japan as a foreigner."

","OK, I was predisposed to dislike this movie, having seen some of Tom Cruise's questionable prior choices, like the bizarre Vanilla Sky, or the appallingly awful Mission Impossible II, yet here I was more than pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This is Tom's BEST movie for years!<br/><br/>But let's ignore the fact that Tom Cruise is in this movie at all and concentrate on just how fantastic this film actually is. It follows the tradition of movies like Gladiator; great music, a great script, fantastic casting, brilliant direction and a wonderful location.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe is magnificent in his role as the leader of the last of the samurai warriors. The action is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The samurai are portrayed in a way that shows them for the noble breed they were, and when the final fight scene ends (and I will give nothing away about what happens), there were a lot of people reaching for their tissues because the director got his point across so well - the samurai were fighting their own people and it was a total waste and should not have been allowed to happen.<br/><br/>If this movie isn't nominated for Oscars this week, well, there is something wrong with the Academy, and I think my tip for best supporting actor is Ken Watanabe, he really was fantastic in this film.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie if you liked Gladiator, or Cold Mountain, or even Gone With The Wind - it's that kind of an epic, timeless!"

"Axel-9","8","0","0","24 January 2004"," Powerful, emotionally moving with some brutal cracking action
","The film starts in a standard Cruiser style, with Tom doing Tom and pretending to be drunk and acting a bit mad, but his performance improves all the way through, following the arc of his character as he becomes a changed honourable man. He is also helped by some cleverly done flashbacks, showing the war crimes his character Captain Nathan Algren has committed. This makes the pain he is feeling far more believable than his attempts at drunken rambling. Once in Japan he really catches fire as he starts to immerse himself in Japanese culture.<br/><br/>It is at this point though that we meet the real star of the film, Ken Watanabe playing Samurai chief Katsumoto. He is the heart and soul of the movie, and it is an immensely powerful turn. I can't recall seeing Cruise take a back seat for so much of a film before, but he is put in the shade here. Watanabe is able to use simple facial expressions to take control of scenes and his dialogue is powerfully delivered. When the action comes he is more than up to the task, slashing at ninjas (in perhaps the movies best sequence) as they raid the samurai village and charging lines of rifle wielding troops. He fully conveys the values and coda of the samurai, and it is a performance worthy of awards recognition.<br/><br/>The film itself moves from harsh battle scenes to gentle moments as characters are developed and friendships forged. The growing mutual admiration between Algren and the samurai is well portrayed. Edward Zwick's direction is at times cheesy, but for the most part it is powerful and gets a strong message across, something along the lines of preserving ancient cultures against the tide of growing consumerism, which is certainly relevant in today's climate. <br/><br/>There is one piece of direction I particularly like, when Algren has defeated four opponents, Zwick cuts to Algren replaying it in his mind, shown from a new angle. This finishes with an enemy shown to be still standing as Algren finally finishes him.<br/><br/>There is also some wonderful cinematography of the landscapes and of the epic final battle sequences, as 500 samurai take on the American guns and mortar rounds of the newly formed Japanese army. I thought these were incredibly moving moments, interspersed with some fairly brutal combat. It actually reminded me a bit of the Last of the Mohicans, but raised to another level.<br/><br/>With strong supporting players, there's a decent turn from Timothy Spall as a British expert on Japanese culture as well as numerous Japanese actors filling out the samurai group, The Last Samurai is a very strong package, at times viscerally brutal and honourably emotional. Nine out of Ten!"

","If you take for granted that a Japanese samurai in 1876 can speak impeccable English you will most certainly love this movie because all the rest is practically flawless and it's a really unmatched work of art, romantic and epic. We watch here the conflict between two civilizations, cultures and ways of life: a dying one based in honour, heroism, valour and loyalty and the other based in greed for power, disloyalty and meanness. The outcome of this unfair fight takes place in the battlefield through scenes hardly reached till now in any movie I have seen before. The brilliant direction of this movie is not affected by the apparent easiness and lightness of the final scenes which leaves us with a few doubts from the angle of the logic and likelihood of that part of the plot. But like an Italian would say: ""se non e vero e bene trovato"" (if it's not true it's well invented). The main character whose role is performed by Tom Cruise is very well depicted, showing us the spiritual evolution of the soldier who goes to Japan with the charge of teaching and training the new army, haunted by the memories of massacres of innocent women and children that he watched in his own country perpetrated by the army he had served till then. In contact with the rapidly changing Japanese reality his mind suffers a complete catharsis which leads him first to abandon alcohol into which he had taken refuge, and then progressively to assimilate the moribund cultural values of the people whom in principle he should help to fight. On the whole a beautiful movie to be seen in terms of images and which will make you think a lot of things over."

","Rating: **** (out of *****)<br/><br/>Everyone knows that once in a while, an epic adventure will comes along to challenge for awards. The Last Samurai is the latest film of this kind, and even if (at just over 2 ½ hours) it's probably a little too long, it still offers at least more than two hours of compelling cinema (and is therefore one of my favourite films of the year).<br/><br/>Like Braveheart and Gladiator, The Last Samurai is a period epic. Here, it's the late 19th century in America, where Tom Cruise steps into the shoes of an American Civil War veteran, Captain Nathan Algren. Looking for a new challenge, he teams up with his friend Zebulon Gant (Billy Connolly) and his commander, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) to travel to Japan, where they will train soldiers to battle against a group of warriors who are being trained by the last true samurai, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). When Katsumoto captures Algren alive in an unexpected skirmish, he does not kill him. Instead, he holds him as a hostage in his village. Both men soon find themselves learning about one another, with Algren getting an especially strong insight into Samurai culture. The question is: what will happen when the time comes to face his fellow Americans again?<br/><br/>The themes of love, trust, honour, heroism and adjustment are nothing new in epics. But director Edward Zwick (whose resume includes war epics Glory and Courage Under Fire) touches on these themes without being heavy handed. Even the scenes which call for serious emotion are handled with the correct amount of restraint.<br/><br/>It seems that Zwick wants to fit something for everyone into this epic, and he very nearly manages it. Action, adventure, discovery, romance, humour...you name it, it's all here. Where Zwick doesn't manage 100% success is in the expository sequences. The first half of the film is riveting, but some of the later scenes outstay their welcome. <br/><br/>Regardless, Zwick should be praised in the many areas he does succeed in, such as the actual battles. These are close to competing with anything to come out of Middle Earth in the last few years. They are beautifully shot and genuinely exciting. Like Peter Jackson, Zwick uses panoramic shots to great effect and even if CGI is being used, you really can't tell. The setting really feels genuine, and therefore it must be commended.<br/><br/>
Tom Cruise is undoubtedly more of a star than an actor, and many continue to label him either overly smug or wooden, or both. Recent films, however, have shown that these tags are a little out of order. Actually, I think this is among his best performances of recent times. One of Cruise's central strengths has been his ability to carry a film while not overshadowing everyone around him, and that is exactly what he shows here. Regardless of how the rest of the cast acts, he is still the film's central character, and if Algren is not believable, then the film fails. It's one of the more demanding roles he has played, and he is definitely up to the task, even (apparently) poking fun at his own image once or twice. Certain people will see this as his best chance in years of a Best Actor award (even though I personally don't think it's fully deserved). <br/><br/>Cruise's reliability has always left room for certain members of the supporting cast to really steal the show. Cases in point: Renée Zellweger in Jerry Maguire, Samantha Morton in Minority Report. In The Last Samurai, it's Ken Watanabe. We not only accept him more in his role because he is more of an unknown this side, but because, like Cruise, he immerses himself in his character. The difference is he does so with more depth and greater authenticity. Talk of nominations for him should not be dismissed.<br/><br/>I'm certain that this will be an Oscar contender. Do I think it should be, though? Well, I would have definitely said yes had it been a little less uneven. A superbly done epic on a grand scale always makes for welcome viewing, though, and The Last Samurai should therefore be warmly received by the majority of those who see it."

","This posting is probably going to be lost in the sea of reactions this film will get. But I want to make a point or add to a similar one. Of course this film is commercial, when you have Mr Cruise in it, one has to make the big bucks to pay him. This is probably why the producer turned a blind eye/ear when Mr Cruise compared the Samurai philosophy with the church of scien-you-know-what. (see his press conference in Madrid, for the opening of Last Samurai) OK, now about the film itself: I think it's fabulous! It's a film with a film director, as opposed to a comics book fan turned into a film director or a video rental clerk who flirts with all cultures and types of guns. (was this more than a hint?) I also felt the camerawork and the rest of the team believing in their work. The sword fighting is beautiful choreographed, without strings attached and therefore very realistic. (I personally had enough of flying Keanus. That's flight from acting. But I digress) The scenery is photographed with great sensitivity and I didn't find any scene too long, too short or there just to show you what the post production can achieve with the computers. I think Kurosawa would have liked the direction. The story is made for us, the ticket payers. It must be the only way one can attract the public so my `blaming' finger is pointing towards the street, and not the film crew. And to end: believe me, I'm not a Cruise hater but I didn't understand the decision of casting him in this film. Powers dictating?"

","After the disappointment that was The Matrix: Reloaded, I decided I wasn't going to see another movie until Return of the King.  But on a whim, I decided to go out and see The Last Samurai.  And while it wasn't the greatest movie of the year, or anything like that, it was a very good film. One I wouldn't be upset to see again if I had to.<br/><br/>The opinion on Tom Cruise seems to be quite mixed.  I don't like him very much, but every once in awhile I think he makes a movie that shows he is a much better actor than he usually seems to be.  I think this is one of those movies, yes at times the egomanic in him resurfaces, but on the whole I feel he gave a wonderful, quiet, understated performance that enhanced the movie.<br/><br/>And about the movie itself - there were elements of countless previous works, such as Dancing with Wolves and Shogun.  But honestly, who cares? If the movie is good, if it is entertaining, who says it has to be the most original movie ever made?  And that's exactly what this was, entertaining. There was a quiet respect throughout the movie for the Samurai way of life, I especially liked the line that Tom Cruise's character gave about probably never completely understanding it.  It shows that us ""Western intelligent people"" can't understand everything, that there are other ways of doing things besides our own.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were ordinary, but still good.  Hans Zimmer wrote a magnificent score, just one more in a long line of excellent work from him. The supporting cast was great, the fact that the intimacy in the movie was subtle and implied rather than outright and brash was appreciated, and added to the depth of the movie.<br/><br/>Reading over this, I'd say this would be rated somewhere in the mid to upper range from me. But something about it makes me really like it, I think it's just a combination of the small factors that combined to make this a really good film.  Not excellent, but certainly worth the price of admission."

","I have to admit, I was very excited to see this movie. It had all the makings of a great epic if not an Oscar bound flik with love, intrigue, passion, and treachery all combined and woven into a turn of the century feudal Japan story. Could it go wrong? After viewing it, I can honestly say that it is not an OSCAR bound movie but an above average Sunday flik. The characters were very stale and the love between the main characters, Nathan and Taka seem contrived. Poor Nathan can never get killed (even though he wishes it) after being shot multiple times at the end of the movie and pummeled by a wooden stick in another scene. And some of the dialog seemed rather laughable and every time Katsumoto spoke, the English never matched his lips (was it dubbed?). Rather unbelievable at best. The savior of this movie is the cinematography, the well choreographed violence, and the magnificent shooting locations. Did someone mention New Zealand? Definitely worth seeing but I just could net get over the title (and Tom Cruise) being the Last Samurai"

The film portrayed the samurai code, called bushido, very well. I don't care if it does follow some of the plot lines from other movies. I went into it saying that ""If i start laughing at how rediculous something was I am sorry."" but that is not how I came out of it.<br/><br/>The use of the tiger, and the cherry blossoms, and how they recreated sepuku in a way that showed how disgraceful a samurai found surrender and loss in battle. I admit that it could have gone into more detail about somethings, the Meiji Emperor's council for example.<br/><br/>When Katsumoto's son had his top knot cut off and swords taken from him you could just feel the emotion and disgrace that he and other samurai would have felt when the anti-samurai laws were put into place.<br/><br/>I am not sure exactly how much of the movie actually followed the Taisho Rebellion, but it did show some rather accurate pictures of the industrialization and modernization that were occurring at the time.<br/><br/>

","...in which Pooh learns that the only way to respond to increasing modernization is through a violent, brutal uprising and senseless killing in order to preserve outdated, regressive ideals.<br/><br/>Does anybody remember that one episode of the Simpsons in which they're watching a historical movie, and Lisa makes some comment about how its completely inaccurate, only to have Bart tell her to shut up, because 'here come the ninjas'?<br/><br/>That is this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, in the middle of the movie, there is a completely random ninja attack. It is not pointless or superfluous, but it is jarring, to say the least, to suddenly see ninjas come out of no where and then vanish for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not going to bother with nitpicking all the historical inaccuracies, the follies of the final battle, nor even will I mention Tom Cruise's merely adequate acting (looks like I lied).<br/><br/>Let me compare it, for a moment, with Gladiator, and the Lord of the Rings. Each of these are fairly epic historical flicks, (or historical-fantasy, as the case may be), but behind all the battles and violence there is a single overridding goal. Maximus' goal is simple: Revenge against the man who murdered his family. The goal of LotR is equally clear: Save Middle Earth from the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>So what is the Last Samurai about? What are the samurai fighting for? Why are they willing to risk, not only their deaths, but the slaughter of thousands? Throughout the movie, the modernists and westernizers are demonized. It is obvious from the way the subject matter is treated that we are supposed to respect and sympathize with the samurai, who are fighting, I suppose, for the preservation of their old order.<br/><br/>But that's not worth fighting for, and if a story's heroes fight for a worthless cause, it is much more difficult to compel the audience to believe that they are, in fact, heroes. Doubly so for The Last Samurai, in which the cause of the samurai is sickeningly glorified to the point of absurdity.<br/><br/>
The old order is not worth fighting for because it is a backwards society. Men can only devote their lives to the martial arts if they do not need to work in the shops and the fields, and that is what the samurai represent: a warrior class, above and aloof the common man, superior in every way, arrogant and stagnant. They are no less autocratic than the Emperor's councilors.<br/><br/>But certainly worth $7."

The real star of the film is the Samurai played by Ken Watanabe. His character exemplifies what makes his culture so precious to the Japanese people.  And through the movie, it shows us how the culture of a people make them who they are and can never really be taken from them if they are strong with it.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, old TC, though a decent actor himself, never convinced me that he was the character...the film needed a much stronger character for that role.

What impressed upon me is that Nathan Algren, a disallusioned, alcoholic American soldier who went to Japan to train the emperor's troops, was able to find friendship and respect the great samurai, Katsumoto.  These two men, from different countries and cultures, were able to become friends because they are both warriors under their very different exteriors. <br/><br/>
Tom Cruise is so good in this movie, but it is easy to overlook his performance and just think, wow, this man is so hot!  He's even sexy as an alcoholic!  This guy is so good looking that it took me awhile to see him as Nathan Algren, and not just Tom Cruise, sexy superstar actor.  But once I got use to seeing him in this character, I believed him totally.  But Ken Watanabe's emotionally, intense performance, totally blows away Tom Cruise's performance.  One can't help but grow to respect this samurai who opposes the western influence in Japan and wants to retain the samurai way of life. This japanese actor is terrific!  I hope to see him more in American movies. Even if you don't care for historical movies, you should still go just to see the performance of Ken Watanabe and Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot.  I think everyone has a pretty good idea of what the plot is.  I just have to say, I don't see anything wrong with the japanese emperor trying to modernize Japan by associating with the Western powers, and I don't understand why Katusomoto is so against that.

","To determine the popularity of a movie, answer a single question: are the characters and story sympathetic?  By that yardstick, `The last Samurai' failed for me.<br/><br/>In `Saving Private Ryan' and `Band of Brothers', men fight to destroy Nazism.  I understand that motivation.   The 300 Spartans at Thermopylae and William Wallace (`Braveheart') fought to defend their countries from a foreign invader.  I understand that motivation.  But in the `Last Samurai', an elite hereditary class fights to maintain its privileges.  Pardon me if I don't find that sympathetic.<br/><br/>In the late 19th Century, Japan was emerging from feudalism and its social system included a rigid hierarchical caste system.  Samurai were near the top of that hierarchy; they had a lot of privileges that they didn't want to lose them.  Did you notice the scenes in the movie where Samurai walk thru bowing crowds?  The crowds weren't bowing because they wanted to; they bowed because if they didn't, the Samurai could lop off their heads for disrespect.  The movie portrays Samurai as noble, dedicated to high pursuits like sword fighting, poetry, calligraphy and nature-worship.  What about the peasants condemned by low-class birth to a life of feudal servitude, working like dogs so that Samurai like Katsumoto could agonize over poems and seek perfect cherry blossoms?  How about a little screen time for them?  Sure Katsumoto is dedicated, but to what?  Bushido (the code of the Samurai) does not include compassion nor forgiveness nor love of neighbor.  Bushido produced the rape of Nanking and the Greater Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere (the World War II Japanese euphemism for stealing anything that wasn't nailed down and raping any female that moved).  Samurai hated modern weapons because one soldier with a rifle and an hours' training could defeat a Samurai with 20 years of skill in sword fighting.  Samurai hated modernization because they had the most to lose by it.  Yes, yes, I'm sure I'm generalizing; but not by much.<br/><br/>Additionally, beware the word `honor'.  It's a word that has no universal meaning.  A few weeks ago, the BBC had a story about men in Jordan who killed their sister because she dated a man they didn't approve of.  By their standards, her death was necessary to redeem their `honor'.  It was called an `honor' killing.  Anytime you hear the word `honor', a bell should ring inside your head, impelling you to ask `what do they really mean'. `Honor' is to scoundrels what a magic wand is to a magician.  It's used to distract the audience from the real action.  Don't be fooled!<br/><br/>Also the movie inaccurately portrays Japan as a poor helpless little nation, under assault by the greedy, corrupt Western powers.  Please!  Does anyone really believe that Japan didn't have corruption, greed, brutality and racism before 1876, that it had to be imported from the West?  Does anyone really believe that the Japanese had to be reminded to act in their own self-interest?<br/><br/>In short, the movie didn't work for me because it violated basic history and basic principles of human nature."

His supporting caste, to name a few, Billy Connolly, as Zebulon Gant, and Timothy Spall, as Simon Graham, is superb.

Overall, the emotional depth of characters and inter-relatedness among them is like a highly stylized, yet, easily comprehensible violin piece.  The local color of the Japanese country side, at every season, is breathtakingly beautiful.  Every battle scene is so heart-wrenchingly executed, with such a show of physical stamina, that we are completely awed by it.  The film is masterfully crafted, from writing, by John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick, to directing by Ed Zwick, to cinematography by John Toll, and finally, to all of the actors, who contribute to creating such a magnificent film.  At the conclusion, I found myself in a wondrous, emotional, and reflective euphoria.<br/><br/>The film begins at a San Francisco Fair, in 1876, where Captain Algren, of the U.S. army, while under the influence of a little alcohol, is now undesirably promoting the sale of rifles to the American consumer.  We see a young man full of regret for having served his country with orders to kill innocent Indian women and children.  Soon enough, his past war efforts will pale in comparison, for the challenge that lies ahead.<br/><br/>
American, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) is in the midst of negotiating an arms agreement with Japan's wealthy army leader, Mr. Omura (Masato Harada). Nathan's assignment is to train and refine the Japanese army, bringing this country into its modern age.  In turn, Mr. Omura promises to buy arms from America.  In Mr. Omura's vexation, he thinks that Japan can only come into its modernization, if the long lived traditional tribal group, known as the Samurai are once and for all defeated.  This group of people is steeped in a more ancient Japanese tradition of living.  Every day they awake to executing daily tasks with pride, care, and excellence of execution.  They will die by their own sword to defend the life they know best.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, the country's Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is all of about sixteen.  As a result, he simply fears for his life and the country's, to speak out in defense of the Samurai.  In not speaking up, he spurns the exact war, he is so quietly trying to avoid.<br/><br/>Nathan, the dutiful soldier takes on his task at training the Japanese army. But, once the Samurai, unsuspectingly take him captive, he becomes intimately involved and greatly attached to their way of life.  The Samurai are proud, tough, yet, still humble servants among their community.  Taka (Koyuki) now a widow Samurai, whose husband is killed by Nathan's hand, must now welcome Nathan into her home, and mend his physical and psychological war wounds.  At first, she is reluctant, but her brother, Katsumoto, (Ken Watanabe) the Samurai leader, reminds her of her duty to serve.<br/><br/>From the start, Nathan is rather ignored by the community.  A silent elder Samurai, who Nathan names `Bob,' follows Nathan everywhere, to be sure that Nathan does not rebel or attempt to escape.  Ironically, Bob will serve as a protector to Nathan in battle.  Slowly, the group takes an interest and liking to the able bodied Captain.  Likewise, he takes to them, their ways, and their beautiful territory.  To a degree, Nathan even becomes self taught in their language.  The local men teach him, most importantly, how to defend himself with the Samurai sword.  Probably, equally as important, is the close rapport Nathan develops with the highly disciplined, yet, warm hearted Katsumoto.  They become really like brothers.  Tom, so truly engaged as Nathan, has such a natural way of relating to all of the other actors.  In some moments, I felt as if I was watching a Julia Roberts documentary.  I know that sounds funny, but I mean it as a sincere compliment.  These moments are just so human, lovely, and touching.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, war awaits Nathan and the Samurai people.  Nathan has now decided to help defend the Samurai against Japan's newly trained modern army.  A heart-wrenching and intensely physical battle scene transpires. Nathan's roused soul, shines in his eyes, like that of an anguished and angry tiger.  The Samurai are warriors who live and die by their own sword. It is their code of honor.<br/><br/>After so much blood shed, the young introspective Emperor finally speaks his words, supporting the tradition of the Samurai.  With honor, the young boy Emperor accepts Katsumoto's sword, as a symbol to accepting their tradition, from a war worn Nathan.  Having defended a tradition based upon honor, loyalty, and service, Nathan feels a greater sense of resolve.<br/><br/>Cruise and this caste take us on a sacred journey, to another world, in another time.  Tom's utmost respect for a tradition and culture is clearly visible on screen.  His sense of commitment to playing Nathan Algren comes from somewhere special inside himself.  He is completely wrapped up in the character, yet, he is not detrimentally all consuming, on screen either. His inter-relatedness to his fellow actors is clearly visible and critical to this successful portrayal.  As Nathan, Tom deeply shares himself with others, and they in turn, share with him.  Tom Cruise, in The Last Samurai is bound to move you in a way that you have never see before, on the big screen."

","After finalllly watching this movie thru a sneak peek and going thru so much just to watch it, I have one word for this movie: AMAZING.<br/><br/>Just minutes after the movie started, I became absorbed with Tom Cruise's character and his disgruntled past.  Soon thereafter, the movie changes its settings to Japan and that's when a heart of the movie comes in: the Japanese culture integrated throughout the whole movie.  Then , more stuff happens, Cruise becomes part of the samurai and sees how different and unique their lifestyel is compared to the western world, etc.<br/><br/>
Although these theatrical elements may seem boring at first, The Last Samurai contains much more than just that.  First, the battle scenes are amazing and on par with those in Braveheart.  Second, there is comic relief throughout the movie that keeps you on a emotial rollarcoster.  Maybe those people who gave negative reviews dont like feeling that way, because they want to be the one's ""in control"" of how they feel.  Whatevers, those fools :P  Lastly, if you are human, you will feel very emotional at certain scenes in the movie.  As I watching it, I could feel myself tear up as well as mannny sniffles in the audience.  Maybe I just got too into the movie, but there must be a reason why I did so.<br/><br/>Basically, my advice for you is to walk into the theatre not expecting some boring, drawn out melodrama with fighting, but to watch it as a movie that wishes to entertain and make you CARE about it.<br/><br/>LETS ALL BE SAMRUAI!"
"dr_rjp","Null","0","0","12 December 2003"," ""Dances with Wolves"" meets ""Shogun""
","Overall, I enjoyed the film but would have enjoyed it much, much more if they had left out the ever-present Hollywood overtones, and the inevitable sellout to the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>Why is it that Hollywood assumes the average audience is too stupid to follow innovative plot lines, or that they always wants to reach closure with a simplistic ending?<br/><br/>There are a few parallels between ""Samurai's"" Capt. Nathan Algren, a disillusioned Civil War vet suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome, and ""Wolves'"" Lt. John Dunbar, also a disillusioned Civil War vet, but for different reasons. Both try to destroy their lives and both discover new ones in the process.<br/><br/>There are also parallels between the gorgeous scenery of the US and of Japan, and of an intimate look into the intricate culture of both the American Indian and the Samurai.  Added to it are wonderful musical scores.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though the film goes to great lengths to draw parallels between the American Indian and the Samurai, it stops well short of clarifying why they were similar and why they were different.<br/><br/>Where ""Shogun"" comes into the mix is how the protagonist begins his life as captor, and becomes a hero for saving the life of the local leader.<br/><br/>These derivative elements aside, my main problem with the film was how aimlessly, at times, were the significant interchanges between Kastumoto and Algren. There was SO very much that could have been learned from Katsumoto's mouth, but he spent way too much time simply spouting Zen platitudes.<br/><br/>Another bothersome part of the film was how little the writers did to clarify the conflict between Kastumoto, the Emperor, his advisers, and the Council. What were they fighting about exactly? <br/><br/>There was a real Samurai revolt in 1876, but the story here shed little light on it.<br/><br/>Cruise gives a great performance in this role, but IMHO, it is not on a par with his performance in ""Minority Report"" -- an outstanding film that got totally snubbed at Oscar time.<br/><br/>Maybe my opinion of this film will change when I see it again on DVD. Hopefully, they will include an alternate ending -- the one that should have shown who really was the Last Samurai."
"landmarkstyle","Null","0","0","11 December 2003"," Story of epic scale
","The last samurai follows a number of movies made in the east-meets-west style. What makes the movie successful is Zwick's portrayal of eastern culture and the influence of western culture during the given period. Everything in this movie is of epic scale. The sets, the battles, scope of time, as well as the range of characters. . . .<br/><br/>NOT giving anything away (less damage than a trailer would do), just like other ""last"" movies such as ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" the last samurai is about the end of an era when the samurai is no longer paramount. The clash between old ways and the new, east and west, physical and spiritual, are all elements of this film that add to its dimension.<br/><br/>Of course the best examples of samurai film are by Akira Kurosawa. This movie does not contend to be better or a replacement for any of Kurosawa's classics. Rather, in the spirit of Kurosawa Zwick creates a historical epic capturing the brutal beauty of the samurai warrior during a setting when Japan is becoming increasingly more western.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Went to see the film last night and really liked most of it. For someone who likes historical or cultural period films this is a must see. There are so many good visual pleasures that the two and half-hours seem to go by very quickly. Even the acting, by everyone, was very good. Then comes the ending. I don't know what it is about the people in Hollywood today, but their need to make their own distorted political statement has not only destroyed true historical events but it has rendered them incapable of making a really good classic film. Because of this self serving Hollywood ending they have delegated this film to be just another of their soon forgotten could-have-been movies. For a film that deals with honor and integrity, they have dishonored the Samurai with their false ending."

I would give this film a 10 if it weren't for the last 15 or so seconds, which I feel was not needed, and for the notoriously bad shot of Tom Cruise on the horse in the final battle.

"tipplerunkus","7","0","0","11 December 2003"," Dances with Samurai
","Few films in recent memory have inspired as much ambivalence from me as Edward Zwick's action epic `The Last Samurai'. Zwick has made his best film since 1989's `Glory', a truly gripping and visually stunning effort. But `The Last Samurai' is frequently undermined by it's extreme similarity to Kevin Costner's `Dances with Wolves'. In fact, the mid-section of `Samurai' could be considered a virtual remake. Admittedly, I am perhaps overly sensitive to this - `Dances with Wolves' is one of the films that most influenced my views on film, and will therefore always stand out in my mind. But to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Costner's film,. the similarities will be distracting (the decision to have the Tom Cruise character actually keep a journal which is used as the filmÂ‘s voice over narration ranks among the worst ideas in movie history).<br/><br/>The third act of `The Last Samurai' corrects that problem. While at this point the film actually shifts into something more akin to Mel Gibson's `Braveheart', it is far less blatantly so, and at this point Zwick's movie takes off and assumes a life of it's own, with dazzling action scenes and strong performances from Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe. In fact, the film plays so well at this point that it's tempting to completely overlook it's earlier missteps, which speaks very highly of Zwick's abilities as a director (as well as the abilities of two-timeOscar winning cinematographer John Toll. who will probably win his third statue for this one)..<br/><br/>Other than it's derivative nature, the biggest flaw to `The Last Samurai' is that it never clearly demonstrates what exactly the samurai are fighting against. Whether or not you agree with `Dances with Wolves' take on western expansion, you have to admit that IN THE FILM, the Sioux are clearing being mistreated, and their plight is made clear. In `Samurai', we are told that the Japanese Emperor is listening to advisor who `act in their own interests', and that a proposed treaty between Japan and America is `not in the best interest of the Japanese people.' And yet, we never really see or hear exactly why this is true. <br/><br/>In the end, `The Last Samurai' is really a dressed-up action movie, and as such, it's one of the best we've had all year.  If you are able to get past the `been there, done that' feel of the mid-section, there is much to enjoy, and despite my reservations I give the film a strong recommendation."

","This is a good film, the acting is good, as well as the story and battle sequences.  In particular, I was impressed with Ken Watanabe's acting as the samurai lord.  The special effects in the battles (standard explosions with horses falling and guys spinning away to their death in sword fights) and 1800's style backgrounds were decent (you can obviously tell the backgrounds in San Francisco and Tokyo are paintings in the background).  The costumes were very well done, and depicted the era quite well.<br/><br/>
Now a couple of the fight sequences were not that great.  The opening battle is fantastic, and the end battle is good as well (the Tokyo street fight with Tom Cruise was ok).  The fight when the ninjas attack the village was well done for the most part except for the silly timing of the attacks towards the end of the sequence (the ninjas ran through the door in groups of two, when one group was finished off, the next two jumped through the door to attack).  Some better editing could have made this look less choreographed.  <br/><br/>
The only fight sequence that got on my nerves was the escape scene.  This was just poorly done.  Cheesy effects (like the exploding pellets on both sides of the bridge handle bars as Tom Cruise ran down the middle) and the ridiculous repeat shot of guards getting hit with an arrow in the exact same corner over and over.  Coupled with the overdramatic death of one samurai, made this scene just plain annoying.  This over-dramatic death is similar to the prince of Gondor at the end of the first Lord of the Rings movie, but better editing in that movie made that scene more subtle.<br/><br/>
Finally, the fact that everyone was on the verge of tears or just plain crying in every other scene was just really overdramatic.  Some would have been fine to show the character's passion, but this was overdone."

Just as things are looking their worst, he is offered a new job: Travel to Japan and teach the Emperor's troops the ways of modern warfare, in an effort to squash a rebellion of samurai led by one Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). The story is fairly predictable: Without going into too much detail, Algren is captured by the samurai and comes to respect their beliefs and way of life, eventually joining their side in an effort to redeem himself for the Native Americans he had killed, and whom he sees mirrored in this proud warrior culture.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully shot, with great care given to the costumes and landscapes. The peaceful samurai village has an almost mystical air, of some far-off legend which cannot exist in the modern world. There is plenty of action and heroism, and a suitably grand battle scene to end things. It's all been done before, but this does not mean the movie is not entertaining.<br/><br/>The one problem I have had was the over-use of cheap devices to provoke emotion, which had the action bordering on melodrama on several occasions. We don't need slow, sad music and slow-motion footage every time some character dies or gets hurt. Subtly inserting emotional content is one thing, but this film takes it and beats you over the head with it, then shoves it down your throat. It felt rather insulting and unnecessary, almost like the sad equivalent of a laugh track.

","I just want to say that I went into this film wanting to hate it. Although I've never really hated a Tom Cruise movie I've always been put off by the fact that he's in them. It angers me in a way. I don't think he's a particularly good actor and his film choices usually seem like crowd pleasing safe ones. Don't get me wrong he's not really a bad actor either he's ranged from the slightly off(Born on the fourth of July) to the decent(Jerry Macguire) and to the even more confident(Eyes Wide Shut). This film presents his performance in various degress from cheesy and melodramatic to inspired and worthy. Sadly enough theres not an overwhelming abundance of the second. But the film fares just fine without it. Edward Zwick of legends of the Fall has created a truly moving epic. It's in the race to be the most depressing film of the year right after Ron Howard's The Missing. Although it seems a bit contrived the film ultimatly delivers on a very emotional epic scale.  Tom Cruise stars as a Captain during the civil war. He suffers from guilt and has turned to alcohol from seeing so many innocent native americans butchered. He longs for his life to have meaning and to find some sort of peace. He's shipped off to Japan to teach their soldiers to defend themselves in combat with guns against the samaurais'. He is unfortunatly captured after a fierce and gory battle and succumbs to their way of life and their teachings. Ultimatly adapting to it and learning to love it and the people around him. It is truly a wonder too see the film progress on an emotional level and no matter who you are it will at least draw a tear or two. The film for the most part is well acted, the script is decent with a few unintentionally funny lines, the direction is simplistic and grand at the same time, the score is moving and the cinematography is lush and mood driven. All in all you must give Credit where credit is due. And although Tom Cruise may not totally deserve it he does do an average to above average job of capturing his charachter's complex emotions. Tom Cruise aside, the film more than meets the criteria for a memorable film epic."

"lotus_chief","9","0","0","8 December 2003"," The Last Samurai  one of the best films of the year
","***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW!!***<br/><br/>Seeing all the previews for this film, I repeatedly told myself `Last Samurai? TOM CRUISE???  No way!  That's gonna be so BAD!!  What is Hollywood coming to??'  After seeing it earlier tonight, Ill just saydon't be fooled. All of the praise and Oscar buzz this movie's been receiving is justified. This is a powerful, moving, engaging movie.  I was very impressed.  Tom Cruise is great in his role as Nathan Algren; he's a hit or miss with me, but he was wonderful.I'd even give him an Oscar nomination.  His performance is his best in a long time.  The person who absolutely stole the show, however, is Ken Watanabe as the last samurai', Katsumoto. He definitely should get an Oscar nod for his charismatic, poised, and extremely convincing portrayal of the rebel samurai.  He was absolutely wonderful.  <br/><br/>The story of The Last Samurai is a human one at its core.  The many layers of the story all connect to the human element, and this is the beauty of the film.  I thought Tom Cruise was very convincing as Nathan Algren as he transformed from the drunken, arrogant yet tortured Civil War hero'..to the morally born-again, self-realized, humbled warrior, whose initially reluctant exposure to the culture he must help extinguish, helps him broaden his horizons and grow as a man and ultimately a soldier.  He falls in love with the culture that he and his culture deemed as savage and uncivilized. It's a beautiful story.<br/><br/>The way the Samurai are portrayed is the arguably the most realistic and believable I've seen in a movie.  I was very intrigued to learn more about the culture and the way of the Samurai warrior.  I'd have liked the makers to go deeper into this with more detail, particularly on the fighting techniques and philosophies, but it was intriguing nonetheless.  The appearance of the ninja was a pleasant surprise and VERY exciting. <br/><br/>
My only gripe with the movie is that I felt that Nathan Algren should've died at the end.  It just didn't seem very feasible that he lived, seeing that he was the enemy now and they'd already started the job by shooting him several times during the Samurai's last stand.  Why didn't they finish him off?  Because he's an American?  He didn't seem like one when he showed up with the enemy with every intention of betraying and fighting against them!! The US Colonel himself said that he'd be treated like one of them' if he indeed betrayed them, which he did.  I found that to be a little unbelievable.  Then again, who else could've given the Emperor Katsumoto's sword?  There are plenty of names one could throw out easily, but it wouldn't have had the same impact that Tom Cruise had.  In my opinion, if Tom Cruise died, it would not only have been better for the overall impact of the film (note the deaths of Mel Gibson in Braveheart, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan and Russell Crowe in Gladiator) but also better for the story; the reign of the Samurai does indeed end, they are slaughtered; the fact that he is the lone survivor is kinda lame.I'm sure the reason' is only because he was American.  But under those circumstances there is no way Cruise would've been spared.<br/><br/>After Mystic River, The Last Samurai is one of the best films I've seen this year.  It's an epic that doesn't depend on being sappy and melodramatic. The gritty, treacherous tone of the film stays constant throughout, and you're forced to be intrigued throughout.  Sure the battle scenes (which were very well done) reminds us of Braveheart, but they're as exciting and moving as I've seen.  One can always question the historical accuracy of films like this, and The Last Samurai is not immune to those questions.  The cinematography was excellent, with the beautiful backdrops of Japan serving as the perfect canvas for the emotional and spiritual story laid before it. The acting is first-class and the story is rivetingwhat else can anyone ask for in a movie?  With all of the garbage being released by Hollywood, it's nice to see a movie that doesn't depend on CGI and silly gimmicks to get their point across.  I was surprised at how good this was; it was executed very well and I congratulate the makers of The Last Samurai for their great work.  I hope this film is recognized at the Oscars, particularly Ken Watanabehis performance, to me, is unforgettable.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of **** stars."

","The best thing about this movie was being introduced to Koyuki, Ken Watabnabe and Shin Koyamada, yet the premise that cultures other than the white man's cannot learn to do anything right unless the American hero (Tom Cruise) teaches them should be insulting to any one outside of Hollywood. It was clear that the target audience was the average American moviegoer, but the premise is really outdated. Granted, the hero ultimately learns that other cultures have noble features equal to or greater than his own, but it was so manipulative a presupposition that it left an embarrassing impression, especially when **SPOILER ** all the samurai were left dead on the battlefield, except of course for Tom Cruise, who goes back to the village and takes the prettiest widow for his wife. Now that's a happy Hollywood ending.  Audiences were clearly meant to feel warm and fuzzy at the end, in spite of the bloody battle scenes, because Tom Cruise's intervention enabled the samurai warrior to die a noble death. For all the work put into this movie, it used every worn out cliché in the book. Shogun was better."

","We all know Tom Cruise is one of the biggest stars in hollywood with numerous box office hits under his belts (and the ladies love him) but the problem with The Last Samurai is there is too much Tom Cruise. Tom's character Nathan Algren,who is struggling to find himself(or kill himself)overnight converts from western drunkerd to samurai warrior and lame vioce over jornaul entries due a bad job of trying to convince the audience that more than 5 minutes has elapsed(captain's log stardate 1876). The relationship between the leader of the Samuri Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and Cruise isnt explored enough and allowed to develope, it is only briefly used to show the conflict between the Japanese and American culture. The director Ed Zwick too easily allows Cruise's character to domninate a warlord that had the strengh and courage to lead a revolt as well as restore Algren life. The weak romance between Cruise and the wife of a dead samurai doesnt connect emotionally. Not to mention the one or two of the now classic MI2 Tom Cruise super slow-mo shots that ruin a few scenes. Despite all of the above that movie does deliver some of the best fight sequences in recent memory. The swords are sharp , blood is shed, and the Samurai display there skills in battle very satisfyingly(die NINJAS die!).The movie displays the fear/ respect of the Samuri have of the people in a very western (magnificant seven) feel, but does little to explain why. Overall this movie entertaining and at least worth the price for the sword play and beautiful cinematography.It could easily be a 10 with less of a chopped up story and a few changes but I'm not sure hollywood can make a 10 anymore.

Instead they delivered a very surprising and well-done movie.  Although Tommy Boy is on the camera a majority of the time they didn't seem to depend on him as the movie's saving grace.

","Cruise's Last Stand<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's performance as Captain Nathan Algren in ""The Last Samurai"" is one of his better roles. I especially liked the scenes where Algren drunkenly promotes new weaponry and shocks a genteel crowd with a few home truths about the butchery of war; where he finally focuses his thoughts and fights like a true samurai; and where he learns his first words in Japanese. I was also moved by the delicate, understated romance between Algren and Taka, the widow of a man he killed.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I didn't expect much from Cruise in ""The Last Samurai"".Yes, he has delivered solid performances in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""Magnolia"". But he will probably forever be remembered for dancing in his underwear in ""Risky Business"". Like legions of moviegoers and movie critics, I plead guilty to dismissing Cruise as a pretty face, but not much of an actor. <br/><br/>But whatever you think of Cruise's acting ability, I think he displays courage and deserves respect for taking this role in this film at this juncture in American history. Cruise's character in ""The Last Samurai"" empathizes with a foreign people, the Japanese. He is sent to teach them the military techniques of the West. He ends up learning the ancient ways and fighting with them on the battlefield. He blames General Custer's arrogance and megalomania for the massacre of his troops at the Battle of Little Big Horn. He feels guilt for his government's treatment of native American Indians.<br/><br/>It is not difficult to see the parallels between the world of Nathan Algren and our own, in which the US government has deployed half the might of its military force and technology to impose its political will on the peoples of Afghanistan and Iraq. In ""The Last Samurai"", we see Tom Cruise, Edward Zwick and the Hollywood establishment's liberal-democratic response to the muscle-flexing and warmongering of the Bush administration.<br/><br/>You could say that Hollywood has deployed a Cruise missile of its own."

","""If your enemy thinks of the mountains, attack like the sea.  And if he thinks of the sea, attack like the mountains.""  Miyamoto Musashi, ca. 1600.<br/><br/>You gotta love how Hollywood--at a time when the US has got the worst world image ever, has refused to sign the Kyoto Treaty, and has imposed itself overseas in so many ways--doesn't blink an eye at inserting us Americans as heroes in another country's ""history,"" at the same time that it pretends to be anti-American, anti-west, anti-technology, and so effing guilty over Nagasaki and the Native Americans. The Last Samurai! If I tell you who it is, you'll yell at me SPOILER!  but I think you can figure it out, because predictability is the name of this game.  It thinks we're thinking of the mountains and attacks like the mountains.  How can I do better than Ted G's eloquent criticism of this movie?  It's hard to top ""it panders to the white man's ego (as in ""Dances With Wolves"") in that only a white man can save non-whites from evil whites,"" but that's exactly what ruffled my feathers about this film. Yes, I too grumbled on the way home that TLS had all the faults I disliked in ""Dances With Wolves,"" including the phony hatred of us evil Americans (undoubtedly the norm), who must be set straight by an American expatriate. <br/><br/> Up until it was revealed who the Last Samurai was, I was intrigued by the depiction of two different kinds of warfare: the newfangled late nineteenth-century repeating rifles and early machine guns designed to become the contemporary face of war--where soldiers didn't really need to see their enemy, just crank the bullets out--against the medieval war tactics of soldiers on horseback with swords, bow 'n' arrow and face-to-face combat.  That was fascinating.  So was the guile used in the last battle; shades of Sun Tzu and Miyamoto (attack like the sea!).  But the rest of the film didn't capture the real discipline and history of Japan.  It has made me want to go research the movie's historical underpinnings (one good thing that came out of seeing the film). Who WAS the emperor of Japan in 1876? Did he REALLY call upon Americans to make an arms deal in 1876?  What REALLY happened to the Japanese Samurai in 1876-77 (Meiji Restoration in 1868; Takamoto Saigo was the Samurai who led a rebellion against the Japanese forces), and did an American captain REALLY go and involve himself in their honorable demise, such that he becomes the star of the whole show?  (No. Of course not).  But it's that insertion, which the director claims (in an on-line interview I read somewhere) is an attempt to reflect upon Kurosawa's identification with American westerns, that annoys me for what it never intended to suggest: American self-congratulation and appropriation. <br/><br/>
What was missing from the film, typically, was the patient depiction of the discipline that is REALLY involved in learning how to fight like a Samurai: the different positions--by foot, by hand, by sword--and their different names and philosophies that have to be painstakingly learned over years, and that no Japanese warrior would stint on.  Nathan Algren learns it in a season from teachers who seemed remarkably accepting for a warrior aristocracy that viewed even its fellow Japanese with  disdain.  And what about the score that saturated the film?  Did you notice how so very little of it was Japanese?  Western sentimental orchestral melodies permeating every last gouge and lunge, and especially throughout the sentimental scenes at the end.  Couldn't they have invoked SOMETHING more Japanese than that? I think that the American element could have been cut out of this altogether, including Tom Cruise, and that a creditable film in collaboration with Japanese film makers could have been made about the real last Japanese Samurai facing an increasingly westernized Japanese military. But then we might have had a film about Takamoto, and not Katsumoto, and certainly not a Hollywood tear jerker.<br/><br/>My advice: go rent ""Rob Roy"" (1995) for a much more compelling film about war and intrigue and history.  Or go rent Kirosawa's ""Seven Samurai."""
"ilovedolby","8","0","0","7 December 2003"," Starts our rough, but the film improves immensely.
","Advertisements pushed Edward Zwick's `The Last Samurai' as if it were an Oscar worthy film. In some ways it is, in others, it is not. One cannot deny that the film has fantastic battles scenes, lavish sets and costumes and good performances, but the film struggles to find itself because of the main attraction-Tom Cruise. He is an accomplished actor with undeniable talent. But the problem is that he does not fit the character. Combined with a movie clichés, it leaves some disappointment. However, the film does an about face when the samurai enter. 	Nathan Algren (Cruise) is a former Civil War captain turned drunk because of his inability to deal with his past blunders under command resulting in the massacre of a Native American tribe. Now performing as a Winchester Gun spokesperson, he has been offered an opportunity to go to Japan to train Japanese soldiers to fight a samurai rebellion. He chooses to take the assignment because it offers him $500 a month. Soon after beginning their training, Algren is informed that the samurai intend to attack at a certain place and time. He argues that his men cannot fight the samurai because their training is insufficient. Regardless, he is forced to send his men into battle, which they lose easily. Algren is captured and taken prisoner to the village where the samurai live. While there, he becomes friends with the samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and learns of their traditions and why they rebel against the new dreams of modernization by the Emperor. Furthermore, he comes to self-actualization in this land where strength of mind and heart counter all. But he will still have to face his old life and former government on the battlefield once more. Cruise is a good bet when casting a film for his appeal among moviegoers. But one cannot cast an actor for that purpose alone. In the beginning, Cruise comes off as an actor trying desperately to play a drunk. Hardly believable when you have someone reading their lines so phonetically. His character should seem cockier, giving a greater presence of his arrogance and ignorance. However, as the film progresses, he falls into the role better. As such, his speaking so perfectly seems appropriate considering he is living a life that requires him to show respect. Another problem is one that I can only blame on the director-a cliché from one of his best films, `Glory.' In `The Last Samurai,' Algren tries to show his soldier's inadequate readiness for battle by having a soldier try to shoot at him. Obviously the soldier misses, but the scene plays out with Algren yelling at the soldier to load his riffle quickly, although he cannot. Algren yells, `DO IT! DO IT!' This is very similar to a scene in `Glory' where Commander Robert Shaw tries to get an African American soldier to do the exact same thing. Most will not recognize the obviousness of this scene. But to film buffs, it will leave a bitter taste on the part of Zwick's direction. The entrance of the samurai is incredible. They come out of the mist of the forest on horseback in slow motion evoking an eerie, yet astonishing sight. This is wherein the film gets far better and pulls itself out the pits of failure. Between lavish battle scenes, light moments of philosophy, and the improving performance on Cruise's part, `The Last Samurai' becomes an epic in movie quality similar to that of `Seabiscuit'-it starts out with clichés and errors, but quickly turns itself around to become a sweeping epic. ***"

"gregsrants","8","0","0","5 December 2003"," An Epic film that is not without its flaws
","While researching for this review, I again marveled at the filmography of Mr. Tom Cruise as I do with each new film to which he is attached.  Like him or hate him, you cannot neglect the fact that this actor likes to change pace and takes roles that are so different from the last.  Just look at his last five films for example.  He has portrayed a detective (Minority Report), a tormented publisher (Vanilla Sky), an inspirational speaker (Magnolia), a doctor (Eyes Wide Shut) and a sports agent (Jerry McGuire). Each role was such a departure from the last and each were successful Hollywood vehicles.  <br/><br/>Enter Cruise's next stab at celluloid, The Last Samurai.  When I first heard that he was attempting this film, the title gave me reservations as to whether this was a misguided career move.  After all, those of us that grew up in the 80's remember Cruise more for his young pop-culture roles in films like Top Gun and Cocktail, so to think that he could divert our minds from his Risky Business role dancing in his underwear to being an American Samurai in Japan, is asking a whole lot.<br/><br/>But the movie did have something immediately going in its favor.  Edward Zwick, who directed Glory and Legends of the Fall was at the helm and the film was co-written by John Logan who penned 2000's Oscar favorite Gladiator.  So there I was, popcorn in hand as the lights dimmed, and it didn't take long for me to get caught up in the fact based backdrop of the Japanese civil war between the Emperor's troops and the last of the samurai. <br/><br/>The movie's plot is really quite simple.  Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a war-hero in General Custards battles with the American Indians, who is recruited by the Emperor to help train his troops using new weaponry from the west (guns, cannons).  Algren agrees for a ridiculous fee, but is forced into battle before he believes his troops are ready, and they are defeated and Nathan is captured by the samurai.<br/><br/>While a prisoner in the Samurai camp, Algren begins to respect the ways of it's people (everything they do is to perfection'), and befriends the family of one of the soldiers he killed on the battlefield.  Fall soon turns to spring, and Algren and the leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe), have turned their captive-captor relationship into a mutual friendship, and when Katsumoto is taken prisoner by the Emperor and sentenced to death, Algren orchestrates an escape and the two head back to the village to begin a war strategy to fight the oncoming troops.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a film that will be classified as an epic due to its exotic locations, cast of thousands, costumes, battle scenes and running time (144+ minutes).   Edward Zwick actually does a very commendable job in maintaining a story amongst all the visuals, and Tom Cruise is able to dig deep and put together a fairly convincing portrayal of a man that is torn between honor, love and responsibility.  <br/><br/>But for all its positives, there are many flaws also.  The thought of an American riding along side the Samurai just doesn't fit right  especially in today's climate, it was just another example of America putting their nose where it doesn't belong.  The scene where Algren is beaten repeatedly by a samurai warrior and continues to rise every time he is submitted to the ground, played more like something out of a Marvel comic book rather than a real life will to show up the enemy.  <br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a good movie despite its obvious shortfalls.  The battle scenes are visual feasts for the eyes and ears, and the, and Zwick moves things at a rather healthy pace leading up to the eventual climax.  It's not as memorable as his last war film, Glory, but The Last Samurai will still garnish a nomination or 10 when it comes time for the Academy to elect the best of 2003.<br/><br/>And my final word goes back to you, Mr. Cruise.  Thank you for at least trying new things each time in front of the camera and not stereotyping yourself like so many of the other 80's superstars did in their careers (paging Sylvester Stallonepaging Sylvester Stallone).  Keep it up and we will forgive you for self-indulging yourself with such fare as the Mission Impossible series."

There is enough sword fighting to make you long for the wide-open spaces of `Tora! Tora!

In terms of its characteristic score, amazing views of landscape, heroic plot and, oh yeah, bloody sword fights, `The Last Samurai' stands clearly as a Japanese counterpart of `Brave Heart': what's more is the inspiring adventure of U.S. Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) into the diminishing Samurai society led by his Samurai mentor Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe); what's less is the mystic love story of William Wallace (Mel Gibson, Brave Heart). But I'm not saying this movie is impaired by its insufficiency of feminine flavor; in fact the subtle feeling between Nathan Algren and his nurse, Taka, is nicely presented in an oriental way. Although I didn't see any acting sophisticated enough to win an Academy Award in this movie, I believe its box office will be quite satisfying because with a right blend of commercially successful elements, this nice little Japanese meal is deliciously ummm. enjoyable."

Tom Cruise stars as Captain Nathan Algren, an American army officer hired by the Emperor of Japan in 1876 to train his army to use modern rifles and artillery.

Katsumoto takes him back to his village as a brave warrior, not an enemy.  In their conversations, both men learn from each other.  Captain Algren learns what samurai honor is, and Katsumoto learns some American battle techniques.  Captain Algren becomes a samurai and fights with Katsumoto in the last battle scene.

The Emperor wants to modernize Japan's army and promote trade with the west.  He also is facing revolt from the samurai class who think Japan is becoming too westernized. So the Emperor hires American Indian fighters to train this new modern arm to fight against the samurai.  Capt.

In his encounters with the samurai he regains his sense of honor.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a three-hour epic war movie rated R.  There are no nude or sex scenes. The battle scenes are as brutal, graphic and bloody as Saving Private Ryan. Even though there are more killed in this movie than in Kill Bill, there is less blood. Battle scenes are as authentic as The Seven Samurai.  I found myself gasping from the release of tension after some of the battles.  Like in Dances with Wolves, I could sense a culture dying. The small love story and culture lessons don't get in to the way as they did with Dances with Wolves or Shogun. Americans are not depicted as evil hordes as Hollywood likes to do in such culture clash movies. This is one of if not Tom Cruise's best performance.

A samurai never surrenders his weapons but to fight would be instant death from the riflemen.  Nathan Algren (Cruise) at the last possible second is able to step in to defuse the situation.  But it costs the young samurai his swords and topknot.  Both symbols of the samurai's soul and once removed is lost forever.  I believe this scene also symbolized the loss of Japan's soul.<br/><br/>As cops don't like cop movies I generally don't like martial arts movies. I've studied the Japanese martial arts for over 10 years now.  Too many martial arts movies rely too much on wirework and special effects making fight scenes unrealistic.  But The Last Samurai keeps its martial arts with in reason and believable.  My daughter and I both liked this movie. If you like any of the above mentioned movies, I think you'll really like The Last Samurai too.<br/><br/>I would give it 4-1/2 out of 5 cut off topknots."

","The last samurai may not be as good as others have already praised it to be. Having just left the theater, I feel a bit disappointed. I leave with a let down on most levels.  I will spare you the plot points that everyone else has found it necessary to include and get to the juice:<br/><br/>Tom Cruise:  A bit ""Tom Cruisish"" in some scenes.  His athleticism and action prowess are incredible, but at times lost me in the unfolding of story.  In the beginning I was amazed at how ""un-Tom"" he was, but once in the Samurai camp, he lost me.<br/><br/>Zwick: Good direction of a bland story.  Zwick had great vision, and the sword fighting scenes were shot well, but the story became so cheesy and forced by the beats of silence we are forced to sit through.<br/><br/>
The Plot: A cool idea but cheesy lines.  Extremely melodramatic.  One of the worst final lines in a film.  Weird that Cruise is in Eyes Wide Shut which has my favorite closing line in a film.<br/><br/>Toll:  Praise, praise, praise.  Not as great as his Oscar wins, but Toll delivers some breathtaking shots of beautiful scenery.  Most setups were clever and well shot, a few seemed too presentational and rushed but you have to question if that is Toll or Zwick.<br/><br/>Last but not least:  Oscar contention for Ken Watanabe.  Incredible performance that commanded attention.  Each time he appears, you believe this man.  Incredible surprise to a mediocre film."

","Well, at the beginning, I would like to say that I liked this movie. It is colorful, nicely shot, and actors played well. However, there are some details which bugged me quite a lot in the movie. First of all, japanese swords never produce this horrible 'zzzzzingggg' sound when unleashed (I think this mistake is quite common for hollywood movies). Secondly, when releasing a sword from the scabbard, you never *never* want to have a thumb right in front of the sharp edge of the blade which is as sharp as a razor (unless you want to loose the thumb, of course). Finally (which really bugged me), the concept of kaishaku, or assisting in ritual suicide or seppuku(harakiri) is completely unknown to the director. Person, assisting the suicide (usually a friend or a relative of a person who commit the suicide) must cut only through the spine *leaving* the head attached to the body. To remove the head from the body is a disgrace and it is usually done only to execute criminals. In addition to that, helper must perform an assistance in a very dignified manner, not screaming like the one in the movie..."

","One of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen. The film satisfies on all levels: a wonderful screenplay, expert acting, sweeping visual cinematography that will take your breath away, and relentless action. If this one is not nominated for Best Picture, it would be a crime. I especially appreciated the fact that, outside of the graphic violence, this movie was pleasantly old-fashioned: very little profanity, no nudity or vulgar sexual references. The results of the final battle and the denouement came off as contrived and may have been the film's only weakness, but it is minimal, and should not damage the film's overall merit. I would still rate it as one of the best movies of the year."

I wonder if it would have been better if Tom Cruise wasn't in it, and they just told the story of the Meiji Restoration period in Japan.

","I caught a sneak preview, and was very glad I bought the ticket & got in line, early. The sell-out crowd really seemed to enjoy the movie as much as I did. Sure, Tom Cruise might not be the best, but the movie is not all about him, and in any case, I think he did do a good job. It is a surprise to realize that I sat in that seat as long as I did. While the 2.5 hours could not to be said to have flown by, nor was the film a tedious thing, where one looks to their watch to see how much time has elapsed, for when the suffering might end..... Surely some will feel that way, but get real- this movie will not appeal to all (obviously!!). There certainly was gore- yet if you've watched much CSI on CBS, you've seen as much or more. I would say the level of blood is somewhat similar. It was more intense, of course, being on the big screen, and the amount of it- meaning, longer scenes. It was not over- done, in my opinion. Enjoyable, and chances are good I will see it again. Perhaps even purchase it when it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>Enjoy!! Eddy ~~~"

","Truly one of the better films I've seen so far in 2003 (which may or<br/><br/>may not be the highest criteria I could give a film, but it will have to<br/><br/>do). Even if you are not a Tom Cruise fan (he's actually quite good in<br/><br/>this one), this is a film not to be missed! I jokingly refer to it as<br/><br/>""Dances With Samurai,"" because plotwise, it is  very similar to<br/><br/>""Dances With Wolves,"" although really, I think, it is much better. In<br/><br/>fact, while the first half of the film is like ""Dances With Wolves,"" the<br/><br/>second half is more like Braveheart - so if you liked either of those<br/><br/>films (or both), you will definitely like this one! This qualifier begs a debate on the merits of remaking old<br/><br/>plotlines for Hollywood movies, but when a film such as ""The Last<br/><br/>Samurai"" comes along and is clearly better than its predecessor, I<br/><br/>have no problem in giving it praise. For fans of historical epics, this will not disappoint - nor will it be a<br/><br/>disappointment to those with an interest in Japanese culture, as it<br/><br/>focuses on ""Bushido,"" or the code of the Samurai warriors. Also, one last detail - I enjoy films such as this that do not insult<br/><br/>my intelligence by having the courage to present the actual<br/><br/>language of the country being portrayed. Although there aren't<br/><br/>many parts of this film with Japanese dialogue, I would much<br/><br/>prefer hearing Japanese being spoken and read subtitles, to<br/><br/>hearing Japanese actors speaking in a fake, broken English<br/><br/>dialect."
"Reiqi","7","0","0","30 November 2003"," Lovely Epic; Welcome Change from Recent Popcorn-fare
","My love for epics, Tom Cruise, and Japanese culture drove me to see this film. Repeatedly if possible. Having just come back from the sneak preview of the film (viewing #1 and counting), it is difficult for me to accept much of the criticism reviewers have generated. Some seemed upset by the lack of hacking-and-slashing action that the trailer appeared to promise, others offended by the apparent Love-the-White-Foreigner complex. Both criticisms are easy to dismiss once you've actually seen the movie.<br/><br/>You will be disappointed if you enter the theater expecting hacking and slashing and gore-galore. God forbid that the movie be filled with *gasp* plot! The action that exists is beautifully choreographed, yet the filmmakers never forget that the stillness in between is just as important. There is no gore for the sake of gore itself - morbid beauty is found in every death and injury that occurs, and each only serves to remind us of the futility and bitterness of the conflict these warriors find themselves in.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise may be billed as the star of the picture, but never does he become the glaring centerpiece of what is clearly an ensemble film. Each member of the Japanese cast explores a different perspective of a culture that may at first be incomprehensible to westerners. The eventual interest between Taka and Algren is beautifully restrained, as it would have been at the time. Some have deemed this plotline silly and unrealistic, yet when we see Taka's reaction towards Algren's relationship with her children and his own introspective growth, the eventual attraction is not so surprising. Nor does the film fall into the ""white man attraction"" cliche - that Algren is a foreigner seems highly irrelevant in their interest in each other - Taka hardly falls all over herself when he first crashes into her life. It is the tension and slow acceptance of eachother that makes this affair all the more delicious.<br/><br/>There's much more to be said about this film, but really, it's been said, and said better, by my fellow reviewers. All in all this film ranks as one of my favorites of the year - I will be seeing it again -a lovely epic that comes as a welcome change from the recent popcorn-fare that has populated screens, possibly only to be topped by RotK.<br/><br/>And, on a less intelligent note: DUDE. NINJA. I nearly squealed in joy at the neat surprise that it was."

","It has been true throughout history, that when two opposing cultures clash the one with the most modern weapons wins.  This film tells the story of which weapon may truly be the best.  Tom Cruise produces and stars in a film which could have been a cliche of a burnt out soldier drowning in booze hired to train a foreign army in ""modern"" warfare.  It could have been bloody battles and explosions.  It was neither.  It was more.<br/><br/>Captured by the Samurai early in the film he is taken in order for the leader to ""learn and study"" his enemy.﻿It is apparent to everyone watching the film that Cruise's fate is to be death at the hand of the man Cruise believes  his bodyguard.  But over the long winter, Cruise develops a curiosity about his captors, their method of fighting, their beliefs developing a respect for the Samurai and their leader.  Stockholm syndrome in the 19th century? If so, the film goer is also subject to it, enthralled by the storytelling and performances.   Paired with Cruise in a interesting yin/yang relationship is Ken Wantanabe as the Samurai leader.  Wantanabe's acting skills duel well with Cruise. Over the winter, Cruise barges into the training and bruisingly gains enough skill to encourage betting among  the Samuri as to how long he will last in a bout. While there is a gory climatic battle scene, most of the film is preparing for war, planning for war, practicing for war and finally engaging in war between two elements of Japan's culture.  Bows and arrows and swords against howitzers and gatling guns.  The victory does not result as one might surmise.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise disappears totally into his character probably earning an Oscar nod by doing so."

","I walked into this one with 0 expectations. I do like Tom Cruise as an actor and actually think he is underrated in that category, but as soon as the end credits rolled and the lights went up I hit the moment of clarity....<br/><br/>that this movie is just like dances with wolves, except with swords.<br/><br/>I really hope somewhere down the line that whorywood one day realises audiences are growing tired of another movie in which a white man infiltrates a foreign culure, chews it, and spits back out in the faces of those whose lifestyle is ""celebrated"". This I say as a great fan of samurai cinema and culture in general. It's just silly seeing this dude lecturing a Samurai army on how to be one!<br/><br/>I know it's just a movie, and it's not a bad movie. But the cliches stick out like a sore thumb and what it needed was an artist's touch to subvert some of these cliches and make a more interesting film. To it's credit, it's got good not great photography and a vast setting that 100 million can buy. What is missing is soul and purpose. It feels more of a producer's vision than a director's vision up there. Edward Zwick is a good director, but somehow it feels like a hackjob.<br/><br/>Let me take a moment to call out Tarantino on his onerrated ""Kill Bill"". That was another good movie that nevertheless has the good parts bogged down by a filmmaker whom is desparatelly trying to top the very filmmakers he's trying to emulate...All this yields diminishing returns.<br/><br/>Filmmakers in japan work with a fraction of the budgets and resources these brats have and are able to produce films in the same genre that are far more satisfying and free from the constraints of formulas that american audiences are used to. Here the more sensational and manufactured, the better.<br/><br/>
I can picture Kurozawa turning over in his grave if he saw these films. These guys can't mess with the god of the samurai epic.<br/><br/>Well those are my two cents. If you want good samurai action rent Yojimbo or The Lone Wolf and Cub series, or you can wait until next year when Miramax releases a butchered version of Takeshi Kitano's very good remake of Zatoichi the blind swordsman.<br/><br/>I really love movies. Just movies that feel like cinema and not shameless product. Now I will watch Yojimbo and marvel at a good movie that earns it's greatness."

","Having been subjected to the stupidity that is Master and Commander, where Russell Crowe basically does his usual thing against a mean-spirited and angry background. I thought, not another story of White makes Right. Yuck!<br/><br/>So, I attended a screener of this film with much trepidation. Let's face it; the old (not to mention VERY tired) device of having a white guy out ""native"" the natives hasn't been interesting for a couple decades. That Cruise's character is hired by a Japanese high government official to teach the Japanese Army to fight ""Western"" seemed a warning sign. But all the flashbacks and his obvious hatred for his former commanding officer seem to be telling the audience that this guy isn't some gung-ho soldier.<br/><br/>The movie, which really doesn't get going until Cruise is captured by the titular character and forced to spend a winter recuperating, is a bit overlong at 2 1/2 hours. It also has a strange editing choice that occurs at the top of the third act where Cruise kills several men in a beautifully shot and cut sequence that is then repeated, without giving any new information, in a blue tint. It is confusing to many and takes the viewer out of the action.<br/><br/>Deeply violent, as war movies should be, there is a muted love interest, thankfully never realized during the film. It is Cruise's slack-mouthed ""lust"" gaze (the same look he's used since Risky Business) in addition to many of his facial ticks and use of overly loud emoting all reminded this viewer we are watching Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise as a racecar driver. Tom Cruise as a motivational speaker.  Tom Cruise as a war vet. Tom Cruise as a samurai. It is all the same.<br/><br/>As a word of extreme praise, I want to commend the casting folks for putting Ken Watanabe to such fine use. He is an ACTOR of extreme gifts. As the Last Samurai, his interactions with Cruise are the only times Tom actually seems to bother trying to act. It must have been a bit intimidating being in the presence of such a fine artisan.<br/><br/>The deeply jaundiced view of people in power is amazing considering the Don't Gripe, Don't Protest view so common here in the states. And because it is a movie, satisfaction on all fronts is only 2 1/2 hours away.<br/><br/>Spectacular acting (though none of it by Cruise), imaginative casting, over-the-top violence and grace, The Last Samurai is a spectacle of the first order.

I always question myself about its position within my personal TOP10 movies but whenever I get the chance to watch it - I'm clear. <br/><br/>I really love historical movies, especially based on some real events. Tom Cruise is probably the best pick from all those Pitts and Depps around (and not only because he's looking like lumberjack here) and when it comes to Asian actors - I didn't honestly know them but they're all cool.

","I love this film. Everything about it is spectacular. The film follows the story of Captain Nathan Alrgen (Tom Cruise) who is an American war veteran in the late 1800's and is hired to train Japanese soldiers how to use guns to quell a rebellion by a group of Samurai. The films follows his experiences in Japan. The plot is loosely based on the real life Satsuma rebellion of the Samurai. One of my favourite things about The Last Samurai is the score by Hans Zimmer and it truly compliments the film in its greatest scenes. I do admit I may enjoy this film more than others as I do have a love and keen interest of Japanese culture. The film does a brilliant job of showing Japanese people and culture in a respectful light and paints a brilliant picture of a Japan struggling to find the balance between becoming a modern country and also keeping their identity. Ken Watanabe is brilliant support in the form of Samurai leader Katsumoto but I would say Tom Cruises character and indeed is character progression is the star of the show. Haunted by events prior to the film, the story follows Cruise as he slowly settles in to the Japanese way of life and while originally finding their customs strange and foreign, he learns to love the Japanese way of life and grows to find peace in it. The real life Engyoji Temple is brilliantly used and the director makes great use of the beautiful Japanese scenery. Timothy Spall does a very good job as a supporting character and also as a narrator and gives one of the best openings to a film I have heard which I will repeat: ""They say Japan was made by the sword. They say the old Gods dipped a coral blade into the ocean, then pulled it out again. Four perfect drops fell back into the water, forming the islands of Japan."" I can't recommend this film enough. The battle scenes are epic and very well choreographed. The character of Algren is initially dislikeable because of the actions of his past but his redemption through his love of Japan is very relatable. Give this film a watch, you won't regret it."

","A beautifully done film, and a sweeping and spellbinding epic in every sense. The Last Samurai is exquisitely shot, with stunning locations, wonderful cinematography and well designed costumes. The music by the ever reliable Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, dramatic in the battle sequences, and poignant in the slower scenes. Speaking of the battle sequences they were extremely well staged and came across as spine tingling. The story is strong, and the performances and direction are too. I have never really liked Tom Cruise, but here he gives one of his better performances ever in this film, sometimes I forgot that it was him acting. Billy Connelly also handles his role well, though I usually associate him with comedy. However, it is indeed Ken Watanabe who captivates, and easily walks away with the acting honours. The script is well crafted, and while the Last Samurai is sometimes overly idealistic and a tad stereotypical, me and my brother cannot help deny this is a superbly shot and well performed film. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"drystyx","3","2","5","20 June 2008"," Well meaning flop
","This movie has a spirit of realism about it, mixed in with the modernism of blood and gore (not that blood and gore is modern, but the fascination, obsession, and glorification of it is). Cruise plays the ""Steve Martin"" role (as Raymond Burr's Steve Martin was inserted into ""Godzilla"" for an American or English speaking character.) It is his character that probably weakens this movie the most. The film centers on the escapades of traditional samurai in a changing empire. It would definitely have been a stronger movie had the English speaking character not been inserted just for...what was he there for? He serves no purpose, and he is not really identifiable as a character. He is void of personality and evokes no sympathy from the viewer. He isn't bad. He just isn't anything. This is no reflection on Cruise the actor. It is a reflection on a dull, ho hum character badly written. This makes the movie plod along, and the viewer just wants to get it over with. It was well intentioned, but a flop."
"Batkid1","9","2","5","29 August 2007"," One of the best Adventure movies and an excellent performance from Cruise.
","Sure, Tom Cruise hasn't always been the most respected person in his actual life, but you have to give him some kudos for his performance here as a Civil War vet caught between two opposing sides at war with each other in 1870 Japan. <br/><br/>The movie has basically everything: excellent cinematography, skilled direction by Edward Zwick ( GLORY, COURAGE UNDER FIRE ), skilled supporting actors ( Billy Connelly, Ken Watanobe,etc.) and brutal battle sequences. These all flow very well together and, by the end of the film, you'll be crying a river for it's dark history and characters, that the viewer have grown attached, to that will bleed for others and a cause they all believe in.<br/><br/>The violence never feels gratuitous and will fit perfectly in your DVD collection of classics. It is a spectacle for the eyes, an education for the noggin and a pleasing film for fans of other feudal Japan movies like Akira Kurosawa's ""RAN"" and ""THE SEVEN SAMURAI."" <br/><br/>A must-see !"
"MadeOfScars","10","2","5","29 August 2006"," Cruise's best movie ever!!!!
","I don't care what anybody says, this is Tom Cruise's greatest acting performance ever. I absolutely love this movie, it's in my Top 5 for sure. I honestly do not see how anyone can not like this movie. Even if you hated Tom Cruise, you would have to love this movie. The portrayal of Japanese culture is just amazing. It's unbelievable how honorable and self-reliant these people can be. I have always been such a huge fan of the Japanese culture as a whole. The lifestyle lived by a Samurai, the whole devotion to the simpler things in life, is very enviable. If our society could learn the honor and loyalty exhibited by the Samurai, we would live in a better world today. If your a fan of real acting and a very tasteful portrayal of Japanese culture then I HIGHLY recommend this movie."

","Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a soldier who has seen too much death and the uglier side of life, having fought in the Civil War and against the Indians out west. Thus when he is told to go to Japan to train soldiers there in the art of modern weaponry and warfare, he doesn't have much expectation that life will bring him anything new or worthwhile. Japan, under the leadership of the Emperor Meiji, is modernizing. However, a small group of samurai warriors cling to their old values and resist this change. These samurai, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), must be dealt with harshly and swiftly. Thus, Algren and his imperial troops are sent into action before they are properly trained. In the ensuing battle, the troops are routed and Algren is captured. Taken to a remote samurai village, Algren learns a new way of life he never before imagined. <br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie comes at this point. Taka, Katsumoto's sister and widow of a man killed by Algren, is given the task of taking care of the strange foreigner who has come into their midst. While they are eating together, Taka comments on how Algren ""smells like a pig."" She never stops smiling while saying this and Alrgren has no idea of what has been said. Oh, so true.<br/><br/>For anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of Japanese history, the ending, which I will not reveal, is ludicrous. Japanese have a unique view of themselves, even though Japan borrows a lot from other languages and societies. When challenged on this, they will say in defense, ""Japanese spirit will never die."" Though what Japanese spirit really is had to be pointed out to the emperor in this movie, it doesn't seem to bother modern Japanese audiences. Instead they focus on the character of Katsumoto, proud that one of their own could more than hold his own in a mainstream Hollywood production. <br/><br/>Discounting the unbelievable finish, I would rate ""The Last Samurai"" as satisfactory. There are a lot of exciting action scenes, especially the ninja attack at night. However, I would much prefer watching an old Kurosawa samurai flick."
"Ryan-Shem","9","2","5","13 January 2005"," Realistic, Emotional and action-packed.
","My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>The reason I have voted this film to be so high is not because the plot was cohesive, but because it incorporated culture, both Japanese and Americna and gave an insight to viewers what sort of chaos and strife existed. But I'd say the meat of this film has to be the determination of the Samurai who want to keep Japan to the original state and not become an updated civilisation that has up to date technology and such like the Emperors minister, he believe Japan should be civilised and able to compete with world powers - economy wise and militarily wise but the Samurai are determind to prevent this.<br/><br/>It is a very powerful film that will have viewers crying as there are some tragic events in the film, but conversely it will also make the viewers support the Samurai and will want the Samurai to win, I know it did that to me. But the intention of the ending was that the Samurai did win, yes, they were obliterated but they won because the Emperor heard the cry of The Samurai Leader and abolished all things that were not of Japanese origin. If anything, it got stronger as the film progessed. So from that, the film is really about fighting got a worthy cause and even if thew odds are against you, it does not mean you cannot win."

","I totally disagree with the statement ""This film in My opinion is original and does not try to be like other films."" In my opinion any who has seen ""Dances with Wolves"" would have to notice many obvious similarities between the two movies. They might as well have called it ""Dances with Samurai."" This movie presents an over dramatic and romanticized view of the samurai. Many of the samurai that rebelled against the Mejia era government did so because their stipend (aka payment for being samurai by the government)was being reduced. Is this as honorable as the movie shows, no. Were all samurai rich and honorable, no. But the movie fails to show this."

","If you saw MASTER & COMMANDER you don't need to see this and vice versa. It purports to be about a historical culture clash and accommodation, and about honor. It's really about technology, not culture. What both  movies are, are old-fashioned battle films, gussied up with modern cinema technology.<br/><br/>If you love Japanese samurai films, if you know the work of Kurosawa and Mifune and Nakadai and Shimura and Shintaro Katsu (Zatoichi), it will be obvious how much this movie  suffers in comparison.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a technically gifted actor but there is something cold, as if his performance is predetermined and he does not react to what other actors do. The ""girl,"" Taka, played by Koyuki, is gorgeous and makes lots of goo-goo eyes. The samurai, Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, is good. But what would Mifune or Nakadai have done to make the part more meaningful?<br/><br/>The battle and fight scenes were excellent, though crucial blows were out of frame so it is mostly in our imagination. SEVEN SAMURAI, 1954, RAN, 1985, both Kurosawa, did them far better. I think this is below the standard writer/producers Ed Zwick and Marshall  Herskovitz set with ""St. Elsewhere"" and ""Thirty Something."" Sorry.<br/><br/>No horses were injured, it says at the end. Good.<br/><br/>OK entertainment. PIECES OF APRIL and LOVE ACTUALLY, both current, would do better. A weekly TV episode of ""Boston Public"" is better that this movie."

The last samurai is not only a war epic but also an emotional drama, some of the best battle scenes and had me in tears at the end. A must watch for anyone who loves an epic or drama or both."

"claudio_carvalho","7","3","10","26 June 2004"," A Reasonable Adventure With Wonderful Photography and Arithmetic Problem
","In 1876, the decadent and alcoholic Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a former officer from the American army, invited to train the troops of the Emperor of Japan to fight against the samurais. The Japanese troops are sent to the battle field before they are ready and Nathan is captured alive by the samurais. He stays with them in their village along a year and assimilates their culture and becomes friend of their leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). On the next battle against the Emperor's army, Nathan fights in the samurais' side. This movie is a reasonable adventure, having a wonderful photography. The choice of Tom Cruise for the role of Nathan Algren does not fit well, since this character is supposed to be at least an older man. Further, with the advent of the use of computer for battle scenes, the exaggeration rules most of the present films. In this story, for example, before the last battle, Katsumoto tells Nathan that there are approximately five hundred samurais ready to fight. However, we see lots of them dying, and lots more continuing to fight, in a typical arithmetic problem. I suggest the directors of this type of movie to see the combat scene on the frozen lake filmed by Eisenstein in his 1938 `Aleksandr Nevsky' and learn how to choreograph a realistic battle scene. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): `O Último Samurai' (`The Last Samurai')"

Funny aside: my bro-in-law asked me what the inscription on the samurai sword said (near the end of the movie) and I replied, ""jolly good"". Then we cracked up laughing.

","This movie is such a movie that you could notice another detail every other time you watch it.

Everything falls into place brilliantly and every actor/actress in this movie did a great job from top to bottom in my opinion, surprisingly Tom Cruise included, i think this movie is one of the movies he played his part best. The ambiance of the movie is so wonderful, authentic, and historical,the music by Hans Zimmer is so exquisite i think one of the best movie music has ever been created that represents the environment and emotional level of the film. So many detail levels this film has, it just inspires and appeal to your intellect with grace and cool satisfaction. Legend, bravery, romance, dignity, and profound comprehension at their best. One of the few wonders of the movie world as it is showing one of the wonders of real world which Japanese culture has been sharing with us and cherishes it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Marthian80","8","1","2","7 August 2017"," Beautiful scenery, interesting history and awesome battle scenes makes a great combination
","I missed out on this movie back when it came out and finally got the chance to watch it. It is loosely based on real events about the samurai and Japanese history which sound interesting to me, but how does that combine with Tom Cruise?<br/><br/>The film opens in San Francisco in the summer of 1876. Ex-United States Army captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is having troubles dealing with his military past: he drinks a lot and has nightmares of the horrors he has seen, especially the battles against the native Americans. His former commanding officer Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) offers him a job in Japan: train the new imperial Japanese army to strike down the samurai rebellion who are opposing the new western-style changes to Japanese civil life. Although Algren hates Bagley he accepts the job and travels to Japan. He starts training the soldiers but they are very inexperienced and can't hit anything with they're firearms. Despite not being ready for battle, Bagley orders an attack on the samurai. In the battle that follows, the heavily experienced samurai easily overwhelm the soldiers who flee the battlefield in terror. Captain Angler is left alone but to his own surprise he is not killed, the samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) spares his life and he is taken with the samurai into the mountains. Once he is nursed back to health, he learns to know and respect the old Japanese way and develops a friendship with Katsumoto. Soon Algren begins to doubt where his loyalty truly lies. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, all the actors did a good job (especially Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe), it looks gorgeous and the story keeps you glued to the screen for two and a half hours. Everything looks authentic and it really feels like you are in a different time era. I also like that there is actually Japanese spoken in this movie, this makes it all feel more real. One of the best things in this film is the chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe, it really made me feel like two completely different people who slowly develop a friendship. Cruise also did a good job acting out the transition of a man who doesn't care about anything first and then becoming more and more attached to the old Japanese way of life. <br/><br/>The only thing that troubled me is that it got a little bit to dramatic at the ending for my taste. It felt to me that they were pushing ""the message"" a little bit to hard. But fortunately they did not make the imperial army that fought against the samurai look like inhuman monsters (like 'the Patriot' did with the English) but just people that did as ordered and thought was best. Perhaps the move could use a little bit more action, but on the other hand they needed to take the time to show the way the samurai lived which was important for the story so it's all good in the end.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is an excellent historical war movie that teaches you many things about the history of Japan, has lots of beautiful scenery pictures and has some very good battle scenes as well."
"colm-hearne365","9","1","2","20 May 2017"," An underrated masterpiece
","I can't understand why The Last Samurai got mixed reviews by critics because it's such a powerful and beautiful movie. In fact, it's up there with other sword fighting movies like Braveheart and Gladiator. But at least, it was a success with audiences and at least Empire Magazine gave it a five-star review.<br/><br/>But all that aside, let me just say that I really enjoyed the film. The two lead actors, Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are superb in their performances. Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a traumatized soldier who finds peace when he's taken prisoner by the samurai warriors and he learns how they live and their culture and language and even becomes a father/husband figure to the family of the samurai that he killed in battle and even becomes a samurai himself. To me, this is Tom Cruise's best performance of his career despite what people might say about him but he's acted well in other movies like Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Ken Watanabe plays the samurai leader, Katsumoto who is in conflict with the Japanese Emperor and politicians because he wants to keep the old culture and traditions and honour of Japan alive and goes into battle against the modern Japanese army and I'm glad Watanabe was nominated for an Oscar for his performance.<br/><br/>The action scenes and battle sequences are as compelling as the story. And I like how they depict the locations of 19th century Japan at one side, a revolutionary city and at the other side, a vast and beautiful countryside. The cinematography is shot beautifully and the rest of the cast do really well too. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I just want to say The Last Samurai is one of my favourite movies of 2003 (a rather good year for movies) and I recommend to anyone who likes great drama and action."

","I've worked enough call centers to know their motto: ""Change is Good"" isn't really the case; it's just lies to avoid riots. And here's the proof.<br/><br/>I wondered how they were going to explain away the once again whitewashing of American movies made in/about foreign countries. This movie is all about Japan's wakeup call to come to the future (of 1870s, anyways) and revolves aroundTom Cruise. Well, he is short. There is that<br/><br/>But, no need, it was the whole story of him going to Japan in 1876. Once Japan got hit hard with the new technology of the West – or gunpowder, to be precise – the kid Emperor freaked and sought out America's help to evolve. This led to hiring a troubled U.S. Captain (Cruise) to train their armies against the Samurai, or the Japanese equivalent of Native Americans. Or so he thought.<br/><br/>Without knowing the background – which I did a little research following this first screening, I knew where this was going: Captain (Cruise) is caught by the Samurai and guess what happens from there<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is one gorgeously made movieon the surface. Yes, it's Dances with Wolves deep down, but it's what happened to the old ways of Japan. It's both sad, but in some respects, what needed to be done. Now that said, little did we know then, this all eventually triggered Japan's involvement in World War II in the worst possible way.<br/><br/>The movie is 100% believable, includes great acting and you do get a sense of what life was like for the Samurai. It's just pretty darn long and a hard sell to get me to see it again since everything that will happen in the movie is so painfully obvious. This is not a good sign since I blindly bought the BluRay movie on good word of mouth and since I needed to fill up my Amazon order to $25 for discounts. <br/><br/>I definitely don't regret seeing it. The stunning cinematography alone was worth it. I just probably should've streamed it firsthand since it really is a one-time viewing. <br/><br/>On a completely different note, anyone interested in buying a slightly used BluRay copy of The Last Samurai? <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Notice how I didn't mention Tom Cruise much upstairs. Meaning, I didn't go into his acting, what he brought to the project and if he enhanced it in any way. The last answer is: Nope. He was okay. Good, perhaps, but seriously, anyone could've played his role. The movie's extreme positives come from the story, scenery and direction. <br/><br/>Now, I'm not downing Cruise. He is one of my favorites and I've probably seen his movies more times apiece than any other actor. It's just he was incidental to this project. Make that, fourth or fifth tier to the rest."

"canperincekster","8","1","2","9 June 2016"," Nostalgic Values
","The movie is a juxtaposition of modernism's cruelty and immorality with the feudal/moral values of the past. In other words, it glorifies the nostalgic values (collectivism, honor, morality, kindness etc.) against the modern inhuman, individualist and ""cold"" values. Politically, in the context of Japan, this is a struggle of feudal structure against the central and modernizing state. The movie is very successful at reflecting all these, and positions itself in the ""feudal"" side. Although I suppose that the movie defends the wrong position; it was a great movie.<br/><br/>First, it was so long; but as much as it is long, it was fascinating. It was very heroic and emotional, especially the last parts. Musics accompany the movie very great. Visuality was so impressive. It was one of the most impressive musics I've ever seen in a Hollywood movie; by the master, Hans Zimmer. If Lord of the Rings was not candidate for Sound, Costume and Art Direction, The Last Samurai would gain at least two Oscars, I believe.<br/><br/>Last but not least, reference to ""300 Spartan"" Western myth was unnecessary and incompatible with the spirit of the movie."
"peylizabeth","9","1","2","29 February 2016"," Breathtakingly brilliant despite slight historical inaccuracy.
","If you have never seen this movie, you are not only missing out on some of the best cinematography that the film industry has to offer, but also an intriguing plot and elegant characters. The story has the perfect mix of traditions, action, love, and discipline, giving the viewer an opportunity to connect with the traditions of the Samurai and learn the basic history of the conflicts in Japan. <br/><br/>The only discrepancy found in this film is the slight historical inaccuracies, for example the Samurais refusing to use modern weaponry or the ninja attacks on the city, seeing as the Samurai did not have a problem with using the modern weapons of their time and ninjas were not around at the same time as the Samurai. <br/><br/>However, if you are a person who will not be bothered by the most minimal errors of history, then this film will rank high on your list of favorites. It is, in my opinion, a true stand out in all of film, and despite whether or not historical facts are important to you, is a must see in everyone's lifetime."
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","2","7 September 2015"," A clash of changing cultures.
","This film is set in the late nineteenth century and tells the journey of Nathan Algren, a veteran of the wars against the Native American Indians, to Japan, where he will collaborate in the training of the armies of the Emperor who want to modernize his army in Western patterns. But he will eventually know his opponent, the samurai leader Katsumoto, whom Algren begins to wonder.<br/><br/>The opening of the Eastern countries to the West was not easy. China and Japan were two imperial countries with ancient cultures and a special attachment to their traditions, so regarded Westerners with some disdain. What they haven't: advanced military technology. Using the ""diplomacy of the cannon"" and the Opium Wars, the two countries were coerced to trade with western countries (curiously, they already did it, with Portuguese and Dutch, since the seventeenth century, but they refused to open totally to the outside world). When they did it there was a great clash of cultures: if some were displeased, other loved the westerners. This was the case of Emperor Meiji of Japan and this is the historical context in which the film is set.<br/><br/>Directed by Edward Zwick (who got here one of the biggest hits of his career to date), the movie features Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe in lead roles (Algren and Katsumoto, respectively). The two main actors, like the rest of the cast, we can only speak well. Cruise and Watanabe got on well and this was reflected in the way they interact each other. The way both embody the characters was also excellent and we must notice that we're talking about characters with a strong psychological and dramatic load. Katsumoto is an embittered man, considered a traitor by those who only wish to serve in the best way and aware that day will come that he will die without knowing if will be understood. Algren is a man who lives haunted by his own military past, feeling that made mistakes and helped an unjust war against innocent people. Only in Japan he will recover from this depressed state thanks to the bravery and nobility of the samurai. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is iconic. The visual and special effects, particularly in combat scenes, are beyond reproach. The costumes were made with all the details and the traditional samurai armor are worthy of special note.<br/><br/>For all these positive aspects this film was acclaimed by critics and a successful box office, receiving four nominations for the Oscar (supporting actor, art direction, costume design and sound mixing) and three for the Golden Globes (best dramatic actor, best dramatic supporting actor, best original soundtrack). Its a film that deserves to be seen by all who appreciate the oriental culture, the history or just want to see a good movie."

I enjoyed seeing the transition from drunken, arrogant, emotionally damaged leader, to a man at peace who found a place to call home. I don't know the true story of samurais and such, but I sympathize with the so-called ""barbarians"" and ""savages"" who were slaughtered by the big powerful governments and people because they were intimidated by them. I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind and who likes Tom Cruise movies. I was disappointed that the main samurai whose name escapes me died though."

Cruise finds that the rebels are fighting a worthy cause, they should be allowed to continue, and he fights on their side against the much more modern army of the emperor.<br/><br/>As a film, it's very well directed and acted. It has a lot of great scenes of action and enough drama to keep you glued to the seat. The romance in it is rushed and unrealistic and I can see many people brushing it off as more of a ""summer film"" with a lot of flash but no substance but deep down I can see that spirit of the samurai coming through. It's a movie that showcases the honor and vitality of the samurai and condemn the more modern approach to warfare. It's also got some historical weight, showcasing a piece of history, the Meiji Restoration, that western films never have touched upon (well, Samurai movies in the west are very rare).<br/><br/>I feel that The Last Samurai is an excellent film overall and a definite watch if you haven't experienced it yet."

It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai). As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the SAGE warrior leader whom Cruise befriends. A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to. But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons. Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa. Or Lean. Or Ford.<br/><br/>All technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent. Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud. All in all, ""The Last Samurai"" is an impressive production. And even if it misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment. 8/10"

","I was a bit hesitant to watch this movie solely because of Tom Cruise. I have never been a huge Cruise fan and when this movie came out, I dismissed it right away. I didn't watch it until 5 or 6 years later. I'm very glad I did and I have watched it over and over again, learning new and wonderful things about the movie each time.<br/><br/>I also watched it with the commentary and if anyone is into such a thing, I would say don't miss the movie with the commentary. I know some people don't like to watch the movie in this manner because it takes away from the mystery and the intrigue of the film, but I find it adds more depth to my understanding of movies and it made this one more meaningful for me.<br/><br/>I love movies and I love to learn everything I can about each one I watch. The Last Samurai is a beautiful movie about culture, tradition, family, loyalty, friendship, love and destiny. It shouldn't be missed."

","I love this movie. <br/><br/>The story is interesting and exciting, it can keep up your attention for the whole time. It shows you a fast changing Japan, what is a really different from the western countries, the strong and weak points of the samurai and modern culture, and an American man's life, who is trying to find his peace after so many battles and terrible things. I love the characters and the actors perform well. I has an original mood, and if you listen to it carefully it has plenty of things to teach you about the values of life.<br/><br/>I can't find any weak points of this movie, thats why i gave the the points (what is really rare from me).

"mornicdavis88","8","1","2","21 July 2014"," Last Samurai
","The Last Samurai is a 2003 American epic war film directed and co- produced by Edward Zwick, who also co-wrote the screenplay with John Logan. The film stars Tom Cruise, who also co-produced, as well as Ken Watanabe, Shin Koyamada, Tony Goldwyn, Hiroyuki Sanada, Timothy Spall, and Billy Connolly. The film's plot was inspired by the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion led by Saigo Takamori, and on the westernization of Japan by colonial powers, though this is largely attributed to the United States in the film for American audiences.<br/><br/>Set in Japan during the 1870s, The Last Samurai tells the story of Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), a respected American military officer hired by the Emperor of Japan to train the country's first army in the art of modern warfare. As the Emperor attempts to eradicate the ancient Imperial Samurai warriors in preparation for more Westernized and trade- friendly government policies, Algren finds himself unexpectedly impressed and influenced by his encounters with the Samurai, which places him at the center of a struggle between two eras and two worlds, with only his own sense of honor to guide him. The sound in movies are broken into three basic categories of sound. They are dialogue, sound effects and music. As stated, dialogue, sound effects, and music require careful balancing to serve the story; because of this, each category is typically recorded separately and mixed together during the final editing process (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011).<br/><br/>The movie is consistent with its storytelling method. Of course, I love the reference to one of the greatest last stands in history as it foreshadows an epic, final battle. Next, Algren helps Katsumoto devise a strategy where the Samurai can get close to the soldiers so they can use their swords and neutralize the advantage of guns. The movie's title foreshadows a tragic denouement, but that in no way lessens The Last Samurai's impact. The film is in many ways about the clash between the old ways (those of the samurai) and the new (those employed by the American-trained troops). While history makes the results predictable (six decades later, a thoroughly modern Japan would attack Pearl Harbor), it's our involvement with the characters and their situations that energizes the experience of sitting through this movie. The historical context may be established, but we don't know what happens to Nathan, Katsumoto, Taka, and others.<br/><br/>The dialogue itself is the requirement for most movies. Without the dialogue, the story and the plot cannot come to conclusion. The dialogue helps shape the mood, the direction, the balance of any movie that the audience is watching. It is also important to note that emphasis on certain portions of the dialogue, whether it be change in tone, pitch, or sped up and slowed down, the dialogue can change the mood of any movie. If done correctly, it will make an excellent companion to the music and the sound effects of that specific film. (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011). As he walks among the people, there is very little dialogue, but many scenes of the beautiful Japanese countryside. This is the perfect place to put music to help the audience appreciate the beauty that he is discovering for the first time. As stated in our text, ""with the advent of sound, music became a basic element of constructing a movie, as essential an element as lights and cameras"" (Goodykoontz & Jacobs, 2011).<br/><br/>http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-last-samurai-2003<br/><br/>Goodykoontz, B., & Jacobs, C.

","""The Last Samurai"" is a very satisfying movie and it is definitely worth checking out. This a beautiful looking movie, and I do think everyone should give this movie a shot. I thought Tom Cruise has done an amazing job for his role as Captain Nathan Algren. This is one of his greatest achievements for his career as an actor. Ken Watanabe was absolutely fascinating as Katsumoto, and he really deserves plenty of recognition, and deserving an Oscar nomination. The chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe is quite enjoyable, and really does work as they try to get know each other. Also, I thought Koyuki the actress that play the Samurai's wife that was killed by Cruise's character is actually very good. While I do give praises to the chemistry between Cruise and Watanabe, I also do enjoy the chemistry between Cruise and Koyuki; they both played each other really well. The romance between the two really works, especially during some of the quite moments in the movie are actually very well effective. I thought the cinematography is beautifully shot, and really does capture that particular time era as it is set in Japan. Edward Zwick's direction is actually very good, and he does tell a great story. The music by Hans Zimmer is powerful, energetic, and it is beautiful. The battle scene at the end is well done, but I do think that it is a little bit too long and wish if they trim some parts out so it wouldn't be too long. I really do enjoy watching ""The Last Samurai"" and I am giving it a 10 out of 10."
"info-993-674706","10","1","2","6 May 2014"," the most amazing twist in a story
","The last samurai was exceptionally inspiring to me because of the way the story was intelligently interwoven with a tender twist of fate and choice. Tom Cruise just nailed it. The emotions were so real and I was particularly impressed with the way he managed to fit into the character in the story; especially with the intensity of his personality - even when he is silent. The scene where the wife of the warrior he killed had to dress him up in her late husband's robe was most remarkable and then, the resilience of the samurai warriors in the face of intimidating firearms evoked so much sentiments in my mind - reminding me of the 1897 punitive expedition in the Ancient Benin Kingdom of West Africa."
"with_the_flames_i_die126","10","1","2","27 April 2014"," Without question one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
","The 2003 film 'The Last Samurai' is such a great but overlooked and underrated movie. I don't remember hearing much about it when it came out (maybe because I was only 13), but decided to check it out one night from Hollywood Video. After watching it, I can honestly say I have never been so emotionally connected to a movie in my life. I immediately decided I was going to spend the $20 to buy it, and watched it probably close to 20 times over the next 2 years. 10 years later it still remains one of my favorite movies of all time. <br/><br/>The movie follows Captain Nathan Algren, an Indian War survivor who has become an alcoholic and theater actor in an attempt to forget slaughtering the innocent Indian tribes he was ordered to during the war. He receives a visit from an old friend with a job opportunity: train Japanese peasants to soldier in order to stop the Samurai rebellion in Japan. He accepts and we now have our character journey. <br/><br/>The basic story is one you've seen before, and more than once. A soldier on one army joins/gets captured by the other side, and through spending time with the enemy, ends up pledging to their cause. The Last Samurai uses this formula, but makes it believable and real. While watching the movie, you understand why the appeal of the Samurai are more than that of his own army, and you believe that for the first time in his life he's willing to die for something he believes in. <br/><br/>While the story is unoriginal, the characters are what drives this movie. It is very much a character movie, and when something unfortunate happens to one, you empathize with them. Tom Cruise gives an Oscar worthy performance as the lead, but as far as standouts go, Ken Watanabe owns this movie with his performance as Katsumoto. He puts so much into being a tribal leader willing to die for what he believes in, and you buy it completely. Honestly one of the best performances I've ever seen, without question one of my favorites. The movie is worth watching based on Watanabe's performance alone.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is just as great too. Everyone from Katsumoto's sister Taka, who has to take care of Algren when he had unknowingly done something terrible to her family, to his son Nobutada, to the American and Japanese generals, everyone does their part to make the characters real and believable. You also feel an emotional tie with all the characters, which is a credit to the acting as well as the writing. Definitely have to give credit to the writers here, they may not have followed history perfectly, but they gave quite a few characters with some serious depth to them, and I felt such a strong emotional tie with them. <br/><br/>One final element of greatness to this movie was the score by Hans Zimmer. Easily one of the greatest composers in Hollywood with credentials like The Dark Knight, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Lion King, and Inception to name a few, I personally think this might be his best work. Very few soundtracks do I listen to after the movie is over, and this is one of them. The score fits the movie perfectly and does nothing but enhance the performances and ties you feel with the characters. It's such a beautiful and yet somber score, that you can't help but listen to it and almost cry at the same time. I'm listening to it on repeat as I write this now because it's that breathtaking. <br/><br/>As I mentioned, I first saw this movie when it came out on DVD in 2004 and watched it numerous times over the next couple years. It's been at least 6 or 7 since I've watched it, so I decided to buy it on Blu-ray and give it a re-watch. The re-watch reaffirmed why this movie is still in my top 5 favorites of all time, a list shared with The Dark Knight, The Prestige, The Return of the King, and Inception. For me, a great movie is not defined by spectacle, it's defined by story and characters. Spectacle should add to a movie, not define it. And that's how I feel about all these movies. They are all strongly built on characters, and it's those movies that give the emotional ties. Out of all of them, this one and The Return of the King probably have had the biggest emotional effect on me, they're 2 movies that I am very likely to tear up during. <br/><br/>In closing, there's not enough good things I can say about this movie. Obviously everyone's different and some will like the film more than others, but I do believe the story is strong and the characters are great enough that most people will enjoy this movie on some level. It just so happens that for me it struck all the right nerves, which is why I rate it so highly and love it so much. I definitely can't call it a 'feel good movie' and it is fairly long (about 2 and a half hours) and draining as well. But it is without question worth watching and in my opinion, worth many re-watches. A truly rare gem that never got the recognition it deserves. 10/10."

","It is 1876. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a returning veteran after slaughtering indians. He is haunted by his past, and is now a suicidal drunk hocking guns for the manufacturer. Then he is hired by the Emperor of Japan to train his troops to fight renegade samurai who opposes modernity. He is forced to send his men to battle before they are ready. Then he is taken prisoner by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).<br/><br/>Drunk acting is arguably one of the most difficult, and Tom Cruise doesn't do it well. He overacts. One can see his acting rather than inhabiting the role. Once he is taken prisoner, the movie moves along too slowly. There is a little too much simplification. Too many minds may be the better option. However, one cannot deny the beauty of this movie. If you're looking for semi-realistic battles between samurai and ninja or samurai and civil war era soldiers. This definitely has that going for it. However there is something wrong with who the last samurai is. There is something off-putting about this movie."
"Wuchakk","5","1","2","12 March 2014"," Likable, but Lacks Originality
","""The Last Samurai"" is a story about a Civil War veteran who goes over to Japan to fight the last pocket of Samurai; he is taken captive by the Samurai, but eventually learns to respect this dying culture and adapt to their way of life.<br/><br/>WHAT WORKS: The movie is beautiful to look at; the cinematography is magnificent. The story is generally engrossing and it's great to envision how the Samurai may have really lived in Japan hundreds of years ago. Speaking of which, the costumes and sets are outstanding, no doubt about it.<br/><br/>WHAT DOESN'T WORK: I enjoyed the movie, I did, but the plot is obviously taken from ""Dances With Wolves,"" a very superior film. One could also cite ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Last of the Dogmen"" as films with similar plots. (Although ""Dogmen"" is basically a rip-off of ""Dances With Wolves,"" the story takes place in the modern world, so it definitely possesses its own uniqueness). The scene in ""Samurai"" where the Samurai make their first dramatic appearance is obviously ripped-off straight from a similar scene in ""Dogmen"" wherein the Indians make their first appearance (compare the two scenes for verification).<br/><br/>The score in the film is certainly serviceable but parts of it painfully sound like a watered-down variation of the fabulous score from ""The Last of the Mohicans."" <br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Although ""The Last Samurai"" could be subtitled ""Dances with the Last Dogmen of Arabia,"" it's still quite enjoyable. People who have not seen these other four movies that so-obviously influenced ""Samurai"" will likely rate ""The Last Samurai"" higher than I have. If you really like this film and haven't seen these other movies I've mentioned, I encourage you to pick 'em up ASAP -- especially ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Dances With Wolves,"" which are two of the best movies ever filmed, period.<br/><br/>GRADE: C+"
"DDragoMIRceaM","Null","1","2","23 August 2013"," A great movie
","Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" is about two warriors whose cultures make them aliens, but whose values make them comrades. The battle scenes are stirring and elegantly mounted, but they are less about who wins than about what can be proved by dying. Beautifully designed, intelligently written, acted with conviction, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic. Its power is compromised only by an ending that sheepishly backs away from what the film is really about.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe co-star, as a shabby Civil War veteran and a proud samurai warrior. Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a war hero who now drifts and drinks too much, with no purpose in life. He's hired by Americans who are supplying mercenaries to train an army for the Japanese emperor, who wants to move his country into the modern world and is faced with a samurai rebellion.<br/><br/>The role of the samurai leader Katsumoto (Watanabe) is complex; he is fighting against the emperor's men, but out of loyalty to the tradition the emperor represents, he would sacrifice his life in an instant, he says, if the emperor requested it. But Japan has been seized with a fever to shake off its medieval ways and copy the West, and the West sees money to be made in the transition: Representatives from the Remington arms company are filling big contracts for weapons, and the U.S. Embassy is a clearinghouse for lucrative trade arrangements.<br/><br/>Into this cauldron Algren descends as a cynic. He is told the samurai are ""savages with bows and arrows,"" but sees that the American advisers have done a poor job of training the modernized Japanese army to fight them. Leading his untried troops into battle, he is captured and faces death -- but is spared by a word from Katsumoto, who returns him as a prisoner to the village of his son."

","In other words, as a book I recently read, it's ""McWorld vs Jihad"", Modernisation vs Tradition. It's evident in this movie but if this debate is really acute today for America and Europe, this movie helped me to understand that this question was started already a century ago in the countries that have been colonized. Here, it's Japan and the choice is interesting because there, traditions mean honor.<br/><br/>From a different point of view, you can see an American idol (Cruise) turning his back at America and giving his soul to fundamentalist warriors. For a movie post 9/11, it's a courageous choice: Some said it was a hidden plea for his church of Scientology but I don't feel a religious message here: on the contrary, this suffering soul have found inner peace with enemies that welcomes him and it's the power of love and not faith that saves him. Another proof of courage comes from the director who doesn't hesitate to depict US Army as racist and savage killing innocent people. But if the side that has technology always have power, it doesn't mean also victory.<br/><br/>Despite of this gloomy and violent world, the movie is also a wonderful moment of peace, wisdom and love. A lot of this tenderness comes from the Japanese cast that are much more moving as new faces that a lot of Hollywood stars (fortunately none in this movie). I was totally touched by their non-verbal communication: it's all in glances and they say much more than with words.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the score of Zimmer is a masterpiece: it sounds very Japanese, pure and simple and totally emotional as this movie."

","I liked this movie. However, after watching it, I noticed that it seemed familiar.My sudden epiphany was fueled by a sudden thought of how much this film is like ""Dances with Wolves,"" a film that I also like. In short, a stranger with a checkered past comes to a strange land to do his duty but comes to admire and respect those who should be his adversaries. Climactic battles result in his being irrevocably estranged from his own people, who now see him as having betrayed them by going native. The scenery is majestic, the battles are epic, but a seven year old could have predicted the end. The female lead, Lady Taka, is very beautiful. The ending is confusing. At the end of the climactic battle Tom Cruise's character, Algren, is surrounded by the enemies and is apparently being the only survivor for the Samurai. Despite this, he later appears before the emperor in time to convince him that doing away with the Samurai and modernizing Japan was the wrong thing to do. Why didn't the modernist Japanese take him prisoner, kill him, or at least deport him?"

","The last samurai truly succeeds in depicting the clash of the western philosophy of ""win at any cost"" vs the eastern philosophy of ""carrying yourself with dignity and honor"".<br/><br/>The setting for this theme is Japan in the 1870's. Captain Algren (Cruise), is a war hero, but he has become a suicidal alcoholic and despises himself and his superiors for the way they slaughtered women and children during the Indian wars. <br/><br/>After taking on a mission to train the Japanese army in western warfare he is captured by the samurais he has been paid to kill. In the samurai warrior code he finds the kind of philosophy and dignity that a soldier can live with in victory and defeat. So much so that he switches allegiance to the samurai side even though he knows it is a lost cause and that it can only mean certain death. This being a Hollywood film though, he survives and gets the woman in the end...<br/><br/>Even so the film succeeds on so many levels, including showing emperor Meijis difficult task in combining new technology and knowledge while retaining the Japanese culture and heritage.

No I was certainly not disappointed but comments like ""absolutely perfect"" or ""flawless"" would not likely come out of my mouth.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a rather ""hollywoodized"" representation of the changes in Japan that took place in the second half of the 19th century. The first half of the film I thought that a more detailed depiction of the ""leap"" to a more modern Japanese society will be neglected. Later on we see that the samurai were also an important part of the Japanese society at that time and that they were not entirely excluded in participating at important discussions.<br/><br/>What I also mean by ""hollywoodized"" in this film is the exposure of the samurai lifestyle and the relationship between Nathan Algren (Cruise) and the samurai. I think that is the most important part of the film. I found Cruise's convalescence, his view and his adaption to the new lifestyle rather clichéd and stereotypical. I thought I've seen it all before.<br/><br/>You can call me petty but I think the films biggest plus are the battle-scenes. They were carried out with a lot of attention to the viewer and everything about them was amazing from sound to costumes. I will remember this film particularly because of that. I saw the movie again three days ago on DVD and I realized that I forgot most of the dialog and the content. I even found them more clichéd and ordinary than before. But I still thought that the battle-scenes were amazing or even more amazing than I did before.<br/><br/>....... - 4/5 ......."
"Rich B","10","1","2","28 May 2005"," Wonderful, powerful movie with amazing performances and an insightful look to Japanese history.
","I was biased from the get go on this movie, totally biased. Tom Cruise playing a hero again, and a movie where the Americans go and teach the Japanese how to fight. I just saw a big epic with Cruise-isms all over it and another movie where anything about the historical aspect of the Japanese is lost in a parade of how great America is and how they saved Japan. I was wrong, incredibly so.<br/><br/>The first thing you realise about this movie is that Cruise is going somewhere he's good at, a tormented, bleak and actually quite dark character. For me, these are his best roles. Not the smiling, charming character that's made him so famous, but the kind of character we've seen him play only a few times, and each time he's brought something unique and truly superb to the screen. At that point I perked up and paid a little more attention, this was actually going quite well.<br/><br/>After that the next major surprise is that this is not an all American movie, it talks of the massacre of Custer, but also of the massacre he inflicted on so many innocent Indians. No, this does not treat history with an all American paintbrush. At this point I had hope for a good movie, then the unthinkable happened.<br/><br/>The movie turns to the Japanese, and looks into their traditional way of life with reverence, intellect and a surprisingly deep understanding. It turns the story around and takes the American deep into the heart of the Japanese Samurai and shows his slow understanding of their customs, traditions and way of life. This treats the Japanese with so much respect you wouldn't think it was a Hollywood movie at all. It was at this point I was noticed leaning forward in my seat at key moments of the movie, keen on not missing a second. I was enthralled.<br/><br/>During the movie Cruise looses his big name status and becomes an interesting and deeply engaging actor here, only bettered by the intensity of the amazing Ken Watanabe. I'd never seen this actor before, or rather I'd never singled out his presence in a movie, but here he positively steals every scene he enters into, giving the complete feeling of a real Samurai set on a single course and almost welcoming the fate the Emporer has dealt him. He's deliberate, controlled but there's so much warmth in his performance it's wonderful to watch. Yet that's not to put down the performance of Cruise, he shares the screen wonderfully and shares many of the amazing qualities of Watanabe.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, beautifully lit, visualised and filmed and the respect for the Japanese and their culture just pours onto the screen from the locations, sets and the smallest of details. The action is slow and measured with larger set pieces orchestrated so beautifully and never distracting from the morality of the tale. At all times it seems that the core of the movie, the Bushido, the way of the Samurai, is kept at the forefront of every scene and the movie makers have crafted the movie so carefully and precisely, as the Samurai would craft their blades.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick proves here that he is one of the best Directors in Hollywood. He not only captures a script on film, but he delves into it and understands the story, its surroundings and history and brings it to life in the most epic of ways. He seems to totally drop the modern Hollywood movie production style and really steeps himself in the lore of the story and brings the production to the story, rather than making the story match the production.<br/><br/>This movie really has seemed to have been developed with total respect for the history of the Japanese Samurai, and has been crafted together with a real love for movies and the story itself. I can't praise the movie enough, not only is it a wonderfully engaging and immersive tale, but it also carries with it many morales both of the traditional Japanese way of life, and the twisted ways of modern man. It carries with it exceptional performances and amazingly dramatic scenes which are beautifully captured on film throughout the movie. There really isn't a dull, wrong or even Hollywood moment in the movie.<br/><br/>The DVD extras are extensive. On the first disc there's a very interesting commentary by the Director Edward Zwick, which provides some great insight into the making of the movie, smaller scenes and some of the actors, as well as getting across his enthusiasm for the great Japanese warriors and their history.<br/><br/>The second disc gives us two deleted scenes, both with commentary by Zwick, and one with a how did we do it section, both interesting to see and understand why they weren't included. However, the interesting thing here is not to judge the extras on the content of any one, all the extras ad up to provide a hugely insightful exploration of the movie, actors, and Japanese history. The ideas and comments on one of the extras will come through again and again, referenced throughout bringing together a much larger experience of the movie.<br/><br/>Also on the second disc are a number of features examining the costumes, sets, Japanese history, Samurai and Bushido, the actors including Cruise's training to become a convincing Samurai swordsman, and an interesting discussion between Cruise and Zwick, slightly indulgent at times, but very interesting.<br/><br/>The movie is wonderful and the extras are a hugely satisfying addition to the film itself. This is definitely a must watch, and a must watch again."

","Its difficult for me to understand why this wonderful movie garnered an R rating. Such a shame for a story with lessons to be learned by all ages. The last time a movie affected me as this did was Peter O'Toole in Lawerence of Arabia. I did not see this movie in the theater but have now seen it on cable television every time it has aired and each time I see something new. The acting directing locations were perfect. I cant remember ever seeing Ken Watanabe before but his portrayal of Katsamoto was outstanding and a role to be proud of. This whole effort is something to be very proud of. I believe The Last Samurai will survive the test time and continue to delight viewers for decades to come. I have now just finished my 22nd viewing and still can honestly say that I would enjoy watching this for years to come. To Mr Watanabe well done sir. I look forward to seeing your future efforts. My compliments to the whole cast."

","Well what can i say about this film,,,, Amazing!! Tom Cruise just proves AGAIN that he is the best actor of our generation. The Last Samurai fills you with every emotion a film could possibly produce, action, humour, love, etc. I cant count how many times i nearly cried, this film is so emotional, i was on the edge of my seat throughout. Tom plays civil war hero Capt. Nathan Algren who is employed to train and lead the Japanese army into battle against the samurai but after being captured and living with the samurai ends up pledging himself to their cause. Edward Zwick has made the perfect sweeping and emotional epic tale of the birth of modern Japan. I could go on all day about this film but i promise you if you haven't seen this film already watch it you will be blown away. Amazing Atmosphere, Amazing Costumes, Amazing Sets, Amazing Actors, Amazing Score, AMAZING STORY."
"youredg","8","1","2","18 April 2005"," Much more than a cultural film
","The previous commentaries are right on the money and leaves me with very little to actually say. It should be noted that my take on the movie crossed into the ever-changing scenery that we read about in China and Japan. The ways of the old are much by the wayside and this film does a very good job of delving into that situation both here and abroad. Simply the factor of respecting others for whom and what we are is portrayed very well. It is quite ironic that the film requires all that watch it to take a hard look how things have changed even in many of our Americanized-Industrialized lives here in the United States.<br/><br/>In a world where less than ten percent of owners and renters can tell you their neighbor's names, or the last time the family sat down together at the table and spoke to their children about how things were at school today. The abomination of society is truly a socially reflective indicator of what baby-boomer's and post baby-boomer's have forgotten from when we were children. The Last Samurai in this aspect portrays greatly how respect was experienced within a culture and a family. Kudos to the movie and most especially to FilmLabRat stated with great poise many of my respects to the film overall."

","This movie, I would have to say, displays an immense amount of truth in how the early ""Americans"" actually thought. Because I am Native American and also have a respect for tradition and morals/honor, this movie was the best movie I've seen in a LONG time. Maybe that's why I bawled like a baby for more than 10 minutes the second time I saw it. The emotions were extremely intense because you are seriously going through everything with Katsimoto and Nathan (2 amazing actors, by the way). They make it feel SO real (with help from the music as well). I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who sincerely enjoys an excellent plot and an astonishing line of actors/actresses."
"sweetrupturedlight","9","1","2","22 March 2005"," One of the finest movies ever
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai. What a movie. From the minute I first lay eyes on the opening scene, something tells me this is going to be fantastic. The music moves me, the scenes unfold. You spot a man, yet unknown, sitting in silent contemplation as a voice-over informs you of the myth surrounding the birth of Japan. You meet another man, desperate in his attempts to sabotage his life it would seem. A drunk. A man confused, with no direction, with what seems like a tiny piece of his soul intact after much hardship. What has he done? What is his story? We don't know yet. But I am intrigued.<br/><br/>I have to start by saying that I am not one to critique, dissect and cross-examine movies. I know little of brilliant film-making techniques. All I know is what I like. Sometimes I like trash, sometimes I like movies critically acclaimed as masterpieces. It's a matter of personal gratification and what I get from a movie.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai, the story of an American captain  played my Tom Cruise  who after being instrumental in the death of thousands on the battlefield, finds solace in the bottom of a bottle of brandy. He cares neither if he lives nor dies. He is volatile. He is hurt, has no honor and seeks to sabotage his life. He is asked to lead Japanese soldiers into battle against a group of rebellions  the last group of Samurai. It is here that we begin to see where his destiny might lead. The Samurai takes him captive, lead by Katsumoto  played by Ken Watanabe. And the second act of the movie begins. Algren starts to feel again. He is forced to examine the man he has become, and also forced to play an active role in what his destiny is to become. In the Samurai village we see Algren interact with many characters. Katsumoto, Ujio (Katsumoto's general), Taka (his caregiver and the wife of a Samurai, Hirotada he killed in battle), Higen and Magojiro (Taka's son's), the silent samurai 'Bob' and Nobutada (Katsumoto's son). It is here the drama unfolds and we learn as Algren learns. He unwillingly becomes friend, confidant, leader, father and husband. It is an amazing journey, one skillfully brought to life by breathtaking direction.<br/><br/>The third act begins as Algren takes up the mantle of his destiny and together with Katsumoto takes a stand against the Emperor and helps the Samurai captain retain his honor, while regaining his own.<br/><br/>Having said that I know nothing about the technicalities of film-making, I have to mention that to my untrained eye, the direction of this movie seemed flawless. Using different effects - slow motion, sound, reflection, emotion, and silence  there seemed to be no scene where Zwick didn't use them to perfection. This is a movie of silent complexities. Props are used to give silent messages, characters use body language and communicative facial expressions with eyes that are filled with a story of their own to tell you exactly what you need to know. More than words ever could. A simple shrug by Katsumoto tells you this is a man under intense pressure, but the words are never uttered. The score I found particularly moving. It blended beautifully with this striking story.<br/><br/>This movie is beautiful. Simple, yet so complex at the same time. Friendships are at the core. Honor leads the way. And love is redeeming. I am not a Tom Cruise fan. In fact, I rebelled against seeing it initially because I didn't feel like seeing a movie about an American joining the natives, teaching them his ways and winning the hearts of the masses. This is, and was not, what The Last Samurai is about. I love the fact that Algren enters into the world of these amazing people and he learns from them. There are no American heroics. I also love the fact that the movie retains all the respect that these people deserved. There was no out-of-context love story where characters strip naked and go at it to make for more sizzling storytelling. In fact, one of the most beautiful scenes in the entire movie is the unconventional love scene between Algren and Taka, as she dresses him for battle. I love the fact that he movie makes you hunger to learn about this fascinating culture as it is told in a respectful and dignified manner.<br/><br/>A word on the acting then. I cannot point to a weak link. Tom Cruise was exceptional as the wounded captain. Just amazing. One of his best performances and may have turned me into a fan. Ken Watanabe. What an amazing actor. He embodied the soul of the Samurai in every gesture and that was breathtaking to see. Koyuki, what a beautiful and graceful performance. The children, especially the boy playing Higen had a depth that made it all seem so real.<br/><br/>I find myself able to watch and re-watch this movie from start to finish, and then start again. Its amazing and in my humble opinion, one of the finest ever. I am truly biased at this point. So I can do no more than recommend that you decide for yourself.<br/><br/>9/10 perhaps even 10"
"mOVIemAN56","8","1","2","22 March 2005"," Hollywood's Inaccuracy and Entertainment
","The Last Samurai (2003) I've watched numerous times. The last time (last night) I found the movie a lot better than I remembered. Set mostly in 1870's Japan during a time when Japan was beginning to modernize its country. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is hired along with other US soldiers to modernize the Japanese Army currently caught in civil war with the samurai. <br/><br/>Even though this movie is based on actual events the United States had nothing to do with the modernization of japan. It was mostly France, Britain, and Russia. Yet the movie is still good. The portrayal of the way of the samurai is fascinating and the idea of rifles against sword seems utterly insane. <br/><br/>This movie is the first movie for Ken Watanabe to speak English in and does a fine job as the Samurai leader Katsumoto. Even though I'm not exactly a fan of Tom Cruise I feel he did a good job with his troubled soldier character. The story isn't original (a soldier trying to find his honor and the right path) yet it's does fine. The action is wild: the first battle in the forest to the last battle with the fires all around. <br/><br/>The Last Samurai. Starring: Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe, Timothy Spall, and Shichinosuke Nakamura. 3 1/2 out of 5 Stars."
"jscontoyannis","8","1","2","17 March 2005"," A good Hollywood action epic...
","I have recently started getting into the Samurai genre, starting with the Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Hidden Fortress, Throne of Blood, and Ran as well as Shogun's Samurai(a great, mostly ignored flick) and Sword of Doom. So I finally sucked it up and picked up this movie, curious to see what a mega-sized Hollywood budget could do with the genre. I would have to say that this movie does not compare to any of those previously mentioned, but nonetheless it is an incredibly entertaining action epic, with outstanding costumes, great acting, some fine sword play, and some well-choreographed battle sequences. However, this movie's attempts at philosophy are definitely very simplistic and Western, while Ran, Throne of Blood, Sword of Doom et al examine deeper issues than simple honor and personal redemption.<br/><br/>But, I must digress. I am a sucker for action-epics, and this one is certainly that. There are plenty of tense battle scenes, involving everything from ninjas to brutal sparring sessions to daring rescue missions where samurai with bows and arrows and swords must contend with myriad gunmen. I must say, I found it mildly unrealistic that Cruise's Algren could master Bushido in 6 months, but I guess that's what suspension of disbelief is for.<br/><br/>Anyways, if you like action-epics, and you are curious about the Samurai film genre, I would highly recommend this movie. Then go see ""When the Last Sword is Drawn"", a Japanese production set in the same time period, which was released in the same year and is a cut above."

","Having the movie channel for the past five years I get to see all sorts of movies. Some good some bad. However, this one was very very good.<br/><br/>As per other comments, this was a great movie and worth the watch. If there is any ""typical Hollywood"", it is the last thirty seconds. But it's only a minor thing and does not really add or remove from the plot. What made this movie for me is that it put me on an incredible emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>The characters were extremely well played and Tom Cruise was incredible. Personally I am fifty-fifty on Tom Cruise as some of his acting was very lack luster and shallow. Not this movie though. I especially like the fact that the individual characters were stereo-typical, but yet not. You never really knew what was going to happen, and you are glued to the movie.<br/><br/>Great movie!!!"
"kaziqta","10","1","2","4 March 2005"," To create a great film, you should show what was lost, to never be found again
","You see, I think that the movie deserves at least 8,5. I saw how a soldier, fighting for money becomes a Samurai... Why not? You see nature all around you, you see people training, praying and only one goal... to be perfect, to live by the laws of life, to live. The last people putting honor above anything else, ""Isn't that worth fighting for, isn't that worth dieing for ?"", I think that it worths, and that the sacrifice proves that it ever worthed. They weren't fighting against Japan they were fighting to protect it, to protect the last real men, the last people that thought that living is a blessing and living is to be Honored. How can't you like this movie, it is about people who sacrifice their life for things that are to be lost, never to be revealed again, because no one is honorable enough to know them."

"ereinion","8","1","2","19 February 2005"," East meets West...and the East wins!
","This is something I've been waiting for for so long. To see a movie about Japanese culture and samurai tradition succeed in the West. Of course, the only way it could have been done was if it was made by the Americans. And I must say that Edward Zwick and the rest have done an admirable job. This movie is done in an authentic Japanese style and only thing that stands out as un-Japanese is Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>The movie is set in the late 19th century and talks about the so-called Meiji-restoration, a special chapter in Japan's history when Japan was made a modern state, partly modeled on Western countries. The error is that Meiji is supposedly impressed with USA and wants to create an army which is modeled on theirs. That was not the case because Americans never trained their army but the Prussians and it's more likely that Meiji and his government were closer connected to them than USA, as it was later shown in Japan's history when they allied themselves with Hitler's Germany. And it is not unlikely because the two countries share many similarities in the way their society and state is modeled.<br/><br/>But lets return to the movie itself. Ken Watanabe caught the eye of Hollywood here for the first time and deservedly so, for his performance is impressive at every turn and same can be said about his screen presence. Another pleasant surprise to me was Koyuki, the young Japanese actress who brings her breathtaking beauty and charisma into the film, like a breathe of fresh air in a movie elsewhere dominated by stern and grim-looking men. Hiroyuki Sanada is a pleasure to watch as always, although he gets too little screen time. His fencing scenes with Cruise are a joy to watch and both actors do a great job there. Shin Koyamada is also a pleasant surprise as Katsumoto's son who dies a heroic death ensuring the escape of his father and his warriors in a well shot scene. The ninja attack and the final battle are incredibly well choreographed and shot. Tom Cruise is credible as Algren and although his less-than-imposing presence makes it hard to picture him as a swashbuckling macho hero, he still serves his purpose.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is one of the most positive happenings in the 21st century Hollywood. It recreated a lost culture, a culture that was as admirable as it was cruel and stern. The cherry tree scene is among the most expressive and beautiful I have seen in an American film. Ken Watanabe's Oscar worthy performance, the beauty and charisma of Koyuki and the sweeping landscapes and battle scenes are more than enough to bring you pleasure. 8/10"
"Nxxtheflickchick","8","1","2","16 February 2005"," Beautifully crafted with strong performances all round
","A beautifully crafted film, even the gruesome battle scenes are handled with a delicate poise and elegance. The cinematography in particular grabs you from the very opening sequence.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives a solid yet standard performance. The real star of this feature is Ken Watanabe, with his subtle, passionate and stirring performance as the powerful leader and warrior, Katsumoto.<br/><br/>The film narrates in the general accepted layout of most epic battles, pitting protagonist against a rival. However while it avoids the theme of the futility of war, the film does display a healthy distaste for the rigid organisation and obedience of western military, favouring instead the beauty inherent in the notion of honour displayed by the samurai. Though a brutal and unforgiving force, the samurai are remembered for their discipline, integrity and honour as illustrated beautifully by this film."
"Chinaking-1","Null","1","2","12 February 2005"," A truly amazing movie.
","The last samurai was awesome. The acting, the story, the characters. They were all perfect. Everything had a nice flow and fitted well with the story. The characters all had a unique sense to them which made the movie even more intriguing.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man, Nathan Algren, who is a man who hates what he does. He takes out villages for a living. He is asked to eliminate Katsumoto's tribe and to terminate his command. Algren gets captured by the samurai and is a prisoner of war. He begins to adjust to the samurai's way of life. I won't say much more about the story so as to not spoil it for you.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent. Ken Watanabe was perfect as Katsumoto. He makes the character very believable and seems like a real-life samurai.<br/><br/>I have to admit, this wasn't the best Tom Cruise has ever done, but it was close. He acted very emotionally and powerfully as Nathan Algren. He helps the movie and its powerful sense.<br/><br/>Koyuki also was excellent as Taka. She, in my opinion was one of the best actors (actress) in the movie. She made you feel what most people would have felt at those times for the samurai.<br/><br/>Anyway, for those who just would like to watch this movie for action, this is not for you. For those who want a good, powerful look at the last days of the samurai and really have a good feel for it, I strongly recommend this movie. 9/10"
"Yagamei","10","1","2","15 January 2005"," A Brilliant Film
","It's easy to criticize many areas of this film - the fact that Cruise's character is heavily exaggerated, the fact that this film is not by any means 100% accurate to the historical satsuma rebellion, the fact that there is an unnecessary romance that doesn't do much to help the overall plot. It's Hollywood, guys - of COURSE there is going to be some mish-mash to reel in larger audiences.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is still, for a mainstream Hollywood picture, a fantastic film. It is filled with gorgeous imagery that will stick in your head for days upon seeing. The acting is superb, particularly that of Ken Watanabe, whose emotions are conveyed perfectly, and realistically. He plays a truly inspirational role of which all of us can learn from. <br/><br/>I could go on about how well done this film is, down to its rich musical score, and vibrant camera-work - but I feel it is important to understand the meaning of this film. Japan, for many years, was the only true nation-state in all of our World. Seeing western influences and the flow of time warping what was once a truly admirable and original culture is heartbreaking - and this film captures that painful transition wonderfully. If you open your mind and engage yourself in this film, you will without doubt enjoy it. It is a moving, important work of art that may just leave you reflecting upon your own culture, and how much it has changed over the years. <br/><br/>I may just be over-analyzing, but all the same, I will always have the utmost respect and love for The Last Samurai. Forget Cruise. It's all about Watanabe, and showcasing the strength and virtue of classic Japanese culture."
"juliankennedy23","8","1","2","9 January 2005"," Dances with Samurai
","The Last Samurai score 8/10: I admit I greeted this movie with low expectations. The idea of Tom Cruise as the last Samurai was laughable. The movie completely suspended this disbelief right until the horribly awful last scene. Tom Cruise plays a drunken Civil War hero who hired by the Japanese government to modernize their army is captured by the Samurai rebels and falls in love with their doomed way of life.<br/><br/>And what a life. Every shot of the Samurai village is postcard perfect almost to the point of unintended parody. Like Robert Redford's take on Montana in ""Legends of the Fall"", every view is spectacular, every sunset is orange, every leaf is colorful and falls just so and all the characters are freshly scrubbed and dressed in their Sunday best. You wouldn't be half surprised to see Hobbits pop out at any moment. Of course the old time Samurai are romanticized to the nth degree. Historically the Samurai at this point resembled Afghan warlords resisting a long overdue central government rather than the honorable colorfully armored knights that are depicted. (Samurai no more wore armor in the late 18th century than the British army did.) <br/><br/>Yet the picture despite one or two faults works. The acting, with one exception is uniformly excellent. The battle scenes are plentiful and full of surprise and the pacing is good. On the dark side newcomer Nakamura Shichinosuke plays the Japanese emperor like he was channeling Michael Jackson. The voice and mannerisms of the gloved one is as out of place for a Japanese emperor than it would be for the Pope. His strangely self effacing dialogue doesn't help his cause, yet it truly is his performance that is cringe worthy. In addition the last scene is an awful Hollywood copout. I still recommend The Last Samurai highly however as a thinking mans action movie."

Please don't get me wrong - I am of a very high opinion regarding Lord Of The Rings, but... The Last Samurai was much deeper movie, with one of the best acting, especially by Ken Watanabe. Tom Cruise in this movie is also magnificent. Emotions of it affected me much more then any other film I saw in 2003. Besides, the scenery and cinematography is just breathtaking. People who like movies for their emotions and feelings find plenty of those in this movie. People who line battle scenes and suspense will also be satisfied.

","Dare I say it, I feel I am becoming a cruiser (is that the term for a fan of Tom or have just made it up). Lately I'm beginning to see some real talent behind that Hollywood smile.<br/><br/>OK let's face it Mr. Cruise has made his share of 'look at me I'm the perfect looking hero in a kinda Jerry Bruckheimer type way' movies. But more and more he is beginning to bring some real talent to any venture to which he is attached. The Last Samurai is certainly no exception. Ed Zwick directs beautifully, especially in the middle segment where Captain Algren (Cruise) is won over by the simplicity and beauty of Samurai way of life. Superb support from the ever great Tim Spall and A fantastic turn by Ken Watenabe ensures a thespian delight.<br/><br/>Although at times a trifle drawn out and perhaps leaning towards sentiment rather than historical accuracy, this is nevertheless a hugely entertaining movie. The fight scenes are excellent, with Cruise apparently learning 30+ genuine samurai sword moves. This is most noticeable in a scene where he fights 5 armed swordsmen. Although played through in real time with the usual MTV editing, it is then replayed in slow motion in Algren's mind as we are treated to a great fight scene from an actor who is definitely not usually a martial artist.<br/><br/>Again I think that with a good script and great direction Cruise plies his trade more than adequately.

","Watch this film if you liked Dances with Wolves, Gladiator, or Braveheart. This film is done with more detail visually than any of them, more cultural depth than the latter 2, and a more solid storyline than the later 2. Samurai is also (at least after my group of viewings) missing the technical errors that plague Braveheart, and made it less appealing on repeated viewings. The MIT reviewer who leads up the comments is dead wrong. There are few American release movies as large in scale and scope as this that are better done than this. Had this movie come before the three aforementioned similar movies, it would have gotten the same if not more acclaim. Cruise is excellent, as is the story, visuals and audio. A great modern movie."

","This movie may have been cliché, it may have been a little corny sometimes but I would like to emphasize how good the movie was as well. <br/><br/>The fighting scenes were good. It is rare to see some real good sword fights on TV, other than the usual Matrix style or karate stuff we usually see. The Lord of the Rings had some good sword fights but this movie is bloodier. It has style too it but it stays realistic. Like the part with Tom Cruise slicing a guys neck and the head stays in place before it rolls off after the body drops. The director does a good job in letting the audience feel for Tom Cruises' character as we are taken inside his mind when flashbacks of war are shown and his cognitive process of memorizing his fights as he is in one.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise never dying after so many fights and battles and fighting 5 or sometimes even 100s against only him is a little on the fake side but nonetheless, the director gives us what we want! Who wants to see Tom Cruise die anyway, he is such a stud muffin! OK, just kidding, but it the movie gives us a good message in the end. When the last Japanese Samurai dies, he says something that you should think about for all peoples, whether they use guns or swords to fight.<br/><br/>It certainly is a teardropper if your a simple person that just needs a good hero's story for the Friday Night."

","Back in the 1970's, before the TV miniseries, Shogun...<br/><br/>Before sushi became popular with upper middle class folks in California...<br/><br/>Before Quality was spelled with a capital ""q"". <br/><br/>Geek culture in Silicon Valley began to assimilate Japanese culture and values. <br/><br/>After all, geek engineers in the Valley had way more in common with their Japanese counterparts than they did with the work force in most of Middle America. Japanese and Valley engineers both worked from early morning until 7PM then went out with their co-workers to meet up with friends, eat and drink beer. One almost universal geek activity in the Valley was to go see samurai flicks at that theater in Palo Alto, the one with tables you could sit at and guzzle beer while you watched the movie. <br/><br/>After seeing a couple hundred samurai flicks, you realized it was usually a morality play - good vs evil. Like Star Wars. Or Clint Eastwood Italian Westerns. Still, when you saw a really good samurai film you left the theatre feeling a little ""morally uplifted"" or some lesser emotion in that same direction, depending on how much beer you drank.<br/><br/>The ""Last Samurai"" film was able to induce a vivid flashback to that era (unlike LSD which never produce on that promise). I got that morally uplifted kinda buzz just like back in the 1970's!! So I liked this movie, big time. Even though Tom Cruise was in it. I was just glad he didn't try to play it like a strutting rooster as he did in ""Pop Gun"" or whatever it was called."
"senorita_belle","8","1","2","1 December 2004"," The Best Dramatic War Movie
","When the first time this movie promoted, I got lil' bit interest with it. Because I like epic and classic war movies, also there's one of the top actor, Tom Cruise, played there. But then I heard some comments from the movie critics, not good comments. They said that this movie has not too good story and Cruise's acted was bad. So, I scratched this movie from my A Must See Movie list. Suddenly, somehow I felt in love with Cruise after I watched his movie, Interview with the Vampire and Mission Impossible 2. Then I watched Collateral, Top Gun, and The Firm. I felt in love with his act, his cute face, and his beautiful green eyes. So, I borrowed The Last Samurai vcd from vcd rental shop. When I picked this movie, I scared that I've picked the wrong movie and I'll feel disappointed after I watch it. Then, I watched it and I cried. Really cried. Wow ! This movie was so damn great! The story, the setting, the war, the sacrifice, the costumes. It was great. I think the director knows how to make a dramatic war. It was so emotional and touching. This movie is the first one which its war scene made me cry. And Tom Cruise, he acted very very good. I truly touched with Captain Nathan Algren's personality. This character is the best Tom's dramatic character.<br/><br/>I felt lil' bit sad when I knew that this movie not really success in some awards, esp. Oscar and Golden Globe. But I think this movie has many big fans too. The Last Samurai is a must see movie."

","Here is a film that looks very good with its costumes, art direction, set design and cinematography, has some terrific performances, a beautiful score and a fine direction by Edward Zwick ('Glory', 'Legends of the Fall') and unfortunately an ending that could spoil things for a lot of people. If you forget the ending 'The Last Samurai' is a very good movie.<br/><br/>In short: Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) becomes a military adviser for Japanese soldiers to defeat some Samurai leftovers. He is captured by the Samurai and starts respecting these real warriors. He becomes a Samurai as well, sort of, and helps the Samurai for their next battle against the Japanese soldiers. Of course there is a women to make things a little more interesting.<br/><br/>Although the film is an action adventure it is not really about the action, which is its strength and its weakness. The film is more about honor and such things if you look at the story, but besides that it is all about the things I mentioned above; art direction, set design, costumes, cinematography. Although it is great too look at the entire time, even during the final sequences, the film is too long. It seems nobody wanted to erase some of the beautiful images. But when the action arrives, it is very well done. You can see Cruise trained for a long time for these scenes.

","Ken Watanabe sure knew what he was doing to play in his first American movie aside a big Hollywood star but 'Ouch'...it must have been painfully unfortunate that it was Tom Cruise! Cruise seems to diminish every serious story he's ever appeared in...with the possible exception of Artificial Intelligence...think how much better 'Interview With A Vampire' could have been with out him! <br/><br/>And oh my...perhaps it's my female prejudice...few white men look good in hakama pants...got to face it...Cruse looks like Tom Mix in chaps when he dawns this particular item of native costume. As for the Samurai garb...he almost falls over on the battle field a few times in the heavy armor. He looked just like a child in an overstuffed snow suit! Not at all convincing as a feudal warrior. Give me a Kurosawa flick any day! Mr. Kurosawa is the Shakespeare of making any Samurai story (historically accurate or not) a metaphor for life. <br/><br/>However, I admit to being a sucker for anything Japanese. Especially when there is ancient history an/or scenery involved. That said...the battle scenes were brilliant! So too was the cinematography. Rural Japan in winter is a spiritual experience...and praise all that is holy that the director allowed this movie to be subtitled and not dubbed! And last...too bad something could not have derailed the degrading ending. The juncture between tradition and modernism is a most difficult transition when it has to be done in such a short period of time. It's a monumental task and the Japanese have succeeded remarkably better than others at it...it must be their roots!"

","I am not sure I can add anything more to what John Ulmer has already said.<br/><br/>But I must say that this is probably my favourite film.

As for the ""tell me how he died"" part I don't think that this is overly corny because it is a very important part to Samurai life, how they lived and what sort of examples the set to others. I feel it was mainly done to give the Emperor some guidance on how he should run the country.<br/><br/>I am still not 100% sure what to make of the ending. It is a bit unreal but it is Simon Graham narrating at the start and end of the film and he does say "" As for the America Captain no one know what became of him, Some say he died of his wounds, others that he returned to his own country, but I like to think that he found a small measure of peace that all of us look for an few ever find.""<br/><br/>It might be corny if you believe that he lived after that battle and what happened to him but it does give you the three options and I would like to believe that he did find a small measure of peace."
"Moneymaker","10","1","2","12 October 2004"," A masterpiece
","The Last Samurai is arguably one of the best movies I have seen.<br/><br/>The story is pretty common and simple. A dillusioned American war hero gets captured by the Samurai and eventually transforms into one of them. The transformation is pretty realistic from drunken soldier to idealistic samurai. Edward Zwick plays puppeteer with all of the characters emotions and reveals only a little by little making them ever so real. The soundtrack is a marvel of music. Hans Zimmer has composed on of the best movie soundtracks ever. It truly draws you into the movie and adds a whole new dimension of depth and emotion to it (which Tom Cruise cannot).<br/><br/>The cinematography deserved an Oscar. Every shot seems that it has been painted and when explosions take place, they look like they were meant for the screen.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives an unusually remarkable performance as Capt. Nathan Algren. It seems that the part was tailor made for Cruise with all the shouting and selfishness. But he is not the best actor.<br/><br/>It is Ken watanabe as the Samurai head who gives the most amazing performance. His eyes alone show us what his character is feeling and then of course come the rest of the facial expressions. The rest of the Japanese cast act brilliantly, determined to show their American counterparts who the real bosses are.<br/><br/>It is a direct homage to Dances with the Wolves (right down to the voice over diary entries).<br/><br/>The fight scenes are masterly executed, providing a proper war experience (not like Troy) and the film rarely drags. It just slows down. The only reason it was not well received by the Americans is the fact that they cannot handle the fact that an American converts and chooses another culture over his. One of the best movies ever. 10/10"

","Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are an unlikely pair, but they are great together in this beautiful look at the Samurai's way of life. Tom Cruise performance is this film is brilliant, but for some reason the academy chose to ignore him. I think he at least deserved a nomination, but this role was not your average Tom Cruise role. It was risky and he pulled through. Ken Watanabe got the nomination instead of Tom, which I was very happy with. He was excellent and very convincing. In my opinion, he steals the show as Katsumoto. I love Samurai films, so I enjoyed it very much. Not a lot of people favor Samurai films, but it's not your average samurai movie. It's deeper and more emotional.

","To see The Last Samurai slip into oblivion is quite a joke. Hollywood's hatred toward Tom Cruise came to a head with this film. I'm not saying Tom Cruise is a great actor, but to deny him in a film where he certainly earned some accolades is a disgrace.<br/><br/>First of all, The Last Samurai is formulaic, which means all of the other elements involved in making a film must be tight and perfected. The music, the cinematography and the acting all fell into place, giving the film a certain richness that helped set it apart from the multitude of films that precluded it. The Last Samurai was much better than Cold Mountain or Master and Commander, which to say many people were turned off by the idea of Cruise leading a serious ensemble without explosions and car chases to back up his dialogue. Give the man some credit where it is due. Every dog has his day, and this was certainly it. <br/><br/>The first time I watched this film, I was surprised by the amount of talent that went into making this film. John Toll (director of photography), Ed Zwick, and Hans Zimmer all layed their signature groundwork, making this a memorable film. In the annals of remembrance, The Last Samurai will certainly have better staying power than Master and Commander or Cold Mountain, and it will just become another one of those ""should-of-beens."""

","*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>This film is probably the best, or at least the second best, of the big budget films to come out this year. Edward Zwick did a great job in direction (I hope he stays with the Talisman, King really needs some more good movies). The script is wonderful, reminiscent of James Clavell's wondrous opus Shogun, and perhaps was an inspiration for it. There really are no plot holes, as everything is very well thought out. But the best part of the movie is Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto, and his reasons for betraying his emperor, which really are not so heinous as we are lead to believe early in the film.

","Although most recent movies are generally a mile wide and an inch thick, this movie is not so bad so long as the viewer is ignorant of early 20th century Asian history (which, fortunately for movie makers, the lion's share of moviegoers are ignorant of most everything).<br/><br/>If you haven't figured it out yet, the movie revolves around the samurai and their struggle to keep the ""old ways"" in the face of modernization/Westernization.<br/><br/>Seems noble, doesn't it?<br/><br/>The movie, although not in an attempt to mislead, fails to tell the rest of the story. The idea of protecting the Emperor and worshipping him as god on Earth makes a resurgence and, in short, leads to the invasion of China and the bombing of Pearl Harbor. If a viewer cares to get a fuller picture of the ideals that Tom Cruise's character is fighting to protect, he must educate himself on such things as the Rape of Nanjing, the brutal ethnic-cleansing undertaken on the Korean peninsula, the Bataan Death March, Unit 731, Korean and Chinese comfort women and the island-hopping campaigns of the Pacific Theater in World War II. In short, the samurai ideal lead to the torture and death of thousands of Americans and millions of Chinese and Koreans, among others.<br/><br/>I would compare this movie to a film version of the early days of the Nazi party, perhaps detailing the struggles against the Trade Unions and the Communists. Probably entertaining if viewed in a vacuum, but when put into historical perspective, very ominous."

A great vision of a dissapering world, of different cultures and civilizations clashing and of retaining basic values that can never be destroyed regardless of anything. Wonderful music and scenery accompanies this almost perfect tale. Captain Nathan Algrens battlefield ending scene survival takes the edge of the movie but gives it back in the most last scene with the emperor. Almost a flawless movie worth seeing several times."

I watched it with my 23 year old son (I'm 53).  What a film!  What superb performances!  Tom cruise was excellent as was Ken Watanabe.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a US Cavalry officer haunted by the demons of the native Americans he killed while under orders from his superiors.  He is descending into drink when he is recruited to advise the Japanese on how to defeat some renegade Samurai warriors who are rebelling against the emperor. He is captured by them and finds as he lives with them, that he begins to like and respect their code of morals and their way of life. He begins to find peace in their way of life. <br/><br/>In the end, he ends up fighting with them against his own people and the westernised Japanese army.<br/><br/>The only thing that spoiled the film very slightly for me was the final battle, where the Samurai place their lines apparently just out of reach of the American field guns, but, with a small change of elevation, the guns reach them easily.  As an experienced cavalry officer, Cruise's character would have been well aware of the range of the guns and would have stayed back out of range.<br/><br/>The final battle, where the samurai ride directly into concentrated gatling gun fire was again nonsense, as, again, Cruise's character would have known better.<br/><br/>Those criticisms aside (which prevented me giving the film a 10) were still small.  The film is a grand epic: Beautiful, involving, haunting and extremely well filmed and played.  I would rate it as one of my all time great films.<br/><br/>9/10 from me!"

","Despite the fact that I am not a Tom Cruise fan,(never liked him in anything except Far And Away) I thoroughly enjoyed this movie which I just watched on DVD last night. I still don't think he has any great acting ability and feel that this movie is just sooo good that MANY actors could have carried his part. As an example- Warning Spoilers ahead: When the Japanese widow of the warrior he killed is dressing him in the samuri armor she shows great feeling for him in her movements and especially her eyes, while Tom Cruise's character seems totally unaffected, like a statue, and his eyes show no emotion what-so-ever. This, despite the fact that the movie has been leading you on with shots of their growing feelings to one another, but even in those, she is the one who gets the point across, much more so than anything Cruise gets across. I have always found Tom Cruise attractive, but his acting just doesn't impress me at all. He just doesn't have ""something"" for me. I don't know if it is the movies he has been in or exactly what it is. Yet this movie is excellent and his ability as an actor, I am still not convinced of. I actually think I would have been even more moved by another actor playing his character,but cannot think of who I would have chosen at this minute. I agree that he did not deserve an oscar for this part. This wonderful part carried itself, in this film. That said, I must say, I found the film beautiful to look at and very emotionally moving on several different levels. It was a wonderful movie-watching experience for me. I give it an 8 out of 10."

",". I don't know much about this period, but surely the whole point of the story was to point out that it is wrong to abandon the cultural and spiritual ideals of the past. By embracing the modern ways you loose far more than you gain. In real life, isn't this what happened? Indeed, you could argue that Japan's move to military expansionism would eventually lead to the Second World War.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) Well, not according to this film it doesn't. The Emperor sees the error of his ways and halts the plans of his ruthless government minister. <br/><br/>
Oh well. That's the trouble with historical epics; the need for accuracy is often compromised by the need to create a simplistic view that will maximize the box office potential. So, the courageous Samurai way of life was a perfect match of spirituality and discipline while the life style of the government was cowardly and empty. Ken Watanabe personified the noble leader while poor Masato Marada, who plays the venal Minister, is such a characture of evil I kept expecting him to twiddle with his waxy moustache and cackle sinisterly. (All in Japanese with subtitles, of course  you have to have some authenticity).<br/><br/>As a film, nevertheless, it's well made and entertaining, Edward Zwick is a fine director of epic films. And despite what the critics say, I think Tom Cruise is a fine and underrated actor. <br/><br/>What's moreNo, don't go this way, RobI sure he `fitted' in well with the Japanese cast. I mean he could quite easily wear the same clothes and armour as them, although....stop it, stop it.. they might have had to shrink them a little.. and, of course, he did keep tripping over his sword...And it must...this is not fair..it must have been nice for the Japanese women to have someone they could look down on for a change.<br/><br/>We love you really Tom.."

","Ken Watanabe was great. Cruise, slow in the beginning (but understandably) Realizes what honor and sacrifice finally means. Personally I think the movie touches your inner depths about service to your people or way of life. I especially enjoyed the Sumarais' appearance in town and the respect the elders displayed. (Too little of that nowadays). Of course in the last chapter after the gatlin guns fired, when Cruise and Watanabe embraced as friends for the final time, it actually choked me up. So I have to give the film an A+. Perhaps not for overall acting, but for the strong content of service and friendship. Well Done. Hans Zimmer puts out another score. Its getting so when I hear the soundtrack he has produced for any movie, I know right away. He has a certain recognizable flair with each scene. Its mood setting content is directly responsible for the emotion each scene is after. I think this movie overall is one of Cruises Finest. Kens character and acting stole the show however. This is a movie you can enjoy over and over."

","The story is epic. Tom Cruise is nearly perfect. The plot is thick, but not too complex. The one-liners, both humorous and thoughtful, are plentiful, but not overbearing. This epic film is not quite a true action film, but also not a true romance/drama. It is a moving depiction of a man torn inside who finds companionship and belonging. It goes deep beneath the surface of humanity to examine what makes life worth living. It is one of those rare films that made me think, in a way that I'm not even sure the filmmakers intended. It teaches the virtues of acceptance, tolerance, honesty, and loyalty. There are few films that create a sensation such as this. Beyond Cruise, the other actors may not be altogether noteworthy. The script is at times slightly cumbersome. Still, in a time when most movies have only time to for a good plot OR good acting OR a good script, this film finds a way to have all three in enough of a dose that they blend together to make a terrific film. Best of all, it is family-oriented (assuming teenagers or above)."

","Not really knowing what to expect, I popped this film into my DVD player earlier tonight. I sat down and watched the film quietly during the next two and a half hours, and I was pleasantly surprised. I actually didn't make the ""Dances with Wolves"" connection until I came to these message boards. But so what, if the plot of this film is somewhat similar to that off ""Dances with Wolves"", we can live with that, can't we? This one is differently pulled off and there are many elements in this film that weren't present in Kevin Kostners epic, such as the battle scenes and sword fighting. As well as the many conversations about honor and belief between the characters.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a former military hero Nathan Algren being offered a new job in the Empire of Japan. He is to train the Japanese army, so that they can successfully face off, and fight back against, the rebellious Samurai. The Samurai are against the treaty that the Japanese are about to make with the Americans, since it would ruin their great history. But Nathan is just there to train.<br/><br/>However, when Nathan is pitched in a battle against the Samurai, and his Japanese army of poorly trained soldiers are defeated, he is taken prisoner by the Samurai chieftain Katsumoto. Now, Nathan ends up spending a lot of time with the Samurai, learning their ways and how they fight.<br/><br/>The movie is beautiful. Everything about it. The production design, to the costumes, to the photography. There is not one aspect of this film that the filmmakers missed out on. The plot is entertaining and entangling, even though some people might be disappointed by the lack of action scenes in the middle part of the film. The ending battle should definitely please the action fans, however, as it is one of the best I have ever seen on the screen. Truly great. Unlike some recent war films, however, this film is not afraid to show how horrible battle really is. That is, the blood has not been cut out of the film...<br/><br/>Tom Cruise holds up his character well, and you can tell that the script has really succeeded when in the end you just want Tom Cruise to stand up and chop the head off the greedy businessman. Bravo, bravo. Ken Watanabe also deserves to be mentioned, as his portrayal of the Samurai chieftain Katsumoto is really good. He plays the role marvelously, and makes a believable Samurai. <br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable film. You should see it, regardless what kind of films you like. You'll find a beautiful film with a great script, and some really good action too. Everything about this film is really good.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I don't even have the right words to describe the excellence of this movie, The Last Samurai. I've never seen such a powerful and realistic movie like this one. The whole story is just amazing and there are no boring parts, no inappropriate scenes, no unnecessary things, it is just something nobody can miss. Edward Zwick did an unbelievable job and I consider it a masterpiece. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe did just an incredible, amazing, and a ""10 stars out of 10"" movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays as Captain Algren, a civil war hero who is paid to go to Japan and take out a rebellion (which were the Samurai) headed by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Without knowing what was to come, Capt. Algren faces a whole new adventure when he was captured by the Samurai. <br/><br/>This is a ""must-be-seen"" movie. I totally recommend it."

","Tom Cruise gives viewers a glimpse into the fascinating past, of Feudal Japan. Although not historically correct, it was aesthetically pleasing, and the story line was well conceived. Although the character of the American could never have actually been a Samurai, as it was a birthright. The movie did however keep true to the theory of Bushido, the Samurai Code. The Buddhist elements were correct, and the interaction between the Samurai, and the Commoners was as it should have been.<br/><br/>Where we see Katsumoto aid the defeated General Hasegawa in the act of Sepuku, was in fact a great honour for a Samurai, a charge not taken lightly. As Captain Algren is leaving the battlefield, and Katsumoto does his duty, we see Katsumoto bow after the strike, to honour his friend. All through the movie we are reminded that although considered outlaws by the Government the Samurai and the Government officials are in fact connected by ancestry, and friendship as evidenced by showing that the Emperor, and Katsumoto are student and teacher; and that the Emperor does not really wish Katsumoto's death. That was the point that Captain Algren realizes, when he is returned to Tokyo, and that knowledge is why he helps the Samurai. This is also why the Emperor does not ask Captain Algren to commit Sepuku at the end of the film, even when Captain Algren offers, the spirit of Bushido lived on, and that was honouring the past for the Emperor. <br/><br/>The words honour, duty, shame, and justice were served fairly, in spirit, and action of Bushido in this film, words that mean so much in our World today, but some taken more lightly than others.<br/><br/>A great movie, all should enjoy it."

","For me, one of the most outstanding films this past year was ""The Last Samurai"". Tom Cruise was excellent as the disillusioned civil war hero whose personal courage erupted so naturally on the battlefield despite his obvious hatred for the carnage that is always the result of such a desperate struggle. <br/><br/>Ken Wantanabe was simply majestic as the Samurai war lord and a worthy successor to the popularity of the late Toshiro Mifune. Shin Koyamada was very moving in his performance, particularly the sequence where he is humiliated by the government soldiers and his hair is cut off. And I couldn't help but find the young boy who came to love Algren as charming as my own grandson, who is half Japanese. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed the cinematography and CGI, especially the scene when Algren's ship is entering Tokyo bay of the late 19th century. I also empathized with the samurais' struggle to prevent the loss of their way of life. Omura's singleminded greed seemed to reflect the dark influence of capitalism on a culture emerging from centuries of social tradition. <br/><br/>Critics complained about the cheesy ending but at least it softened the conclusion of the film for those people, like my husband, a Vietnam Vet who suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, who find a ""downer"" ending depressing."
"mgaberel","Null","1","2","13 July 2004"," Samurai Redemption
","Loyalty, courage, and honor are words that are brought to mind when watching the film The Last Samurai by Director Edward Zwick. The story of troubled American Army Captain Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, who travels to Japan in the late 1870's to train the Japanese army to put down a Samurai rebellion. When Cruise is captured by the Samurai he is befriended by their leader, Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. Cruise soon learns the way of the Samurai while regaining the honor he once lost, and setting his soul on a path to redemption. Throughout the film Zwick illustrates this theme of redemption through the transformation of the main character in three main steps: recovery, rebirth, and acceptance. The first step to redemption starts with recovery. The scene opens with a close up shot of a prostrate Cruise held in captivity, as he battles his injuries, alcoholism, and inner demons. A blanket wrapped around Cruise takes on the appearance of a strait jacket while Cruise peers out of the darkness into the next room, where the wife and children of a recently slain Samurai sit eating. Cruise begs for Sake to wash away the visions of previous wars. His performance and the scene could be likened to Ewan McGregor's detoxification in Trainspotting, minus the ceiling crawling baby.<br/><br/> From recovery there is rebirth. At the end of the previously mentioned montage, Cruise arises from the shack refreshed and reborn, as the camera pulls back to a picturesque shot showing the serene Samurai village that surrounds him. He is no longer confined by his inner demons. Cruise begins a dialogue with his captor, Watanabe. The acceptance of fate is the pathway to redemption. As the Japanese army amasses in the valley below, Cruise and Watanabe stand atop the mountain surveying the enemy. Watanabe says to Cruise, 'Do you believe a man can change his destiny?' Cruise responds, 'I think a man does what he can until his destiny is revealed.' This exchange confirms Cruise's acceptance of fate and his redemption from the evil causes he once fought for. In battle scenes on a scale comparable to Braveheart, Cruise dons the Samurai armor to defend the Samurai way of life.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai was a stirring film with images and symbolism that conveyed the beauty of Japanese Samurai culture while telling a story of honor, loyalty, and redemption."
"Solo4114","Null","1","2","13 July 2004"," Pretty much what you'd expect
","You've read all this before, so I won't belabor the common themes in the reviews.<br/><br/>Beautiful cinematography, predictable plot, rehash of Dances with Wolves (which is, itself, in many ways a rehash of Little Big Man) with a dash of Last of the Mohicans (in terms of themes -- IE: ""our way of life is ending""), etc.  Just scroll down a bit and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>For me, the film was an entertaining diversion, and basically met my expectations.  <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is, well, Tom Cruise.  I'm beginning to understand why many directors like to go with unknowns rather than mega-stars in terms of casting.  The problem with someone of Cruise's stature in Hollywood is that when watching him, you can't completely forget that he's Tom Cruise.  I think his acting abilities are fine, but it may simply be a case of overexposure.  Honestly, I'd much rather watch a film with Ken Watanabe as the big-name star at this point.  <br/><br/>My main issue with this film is that it's just so...well...typically Hollywood.  It feels like you're watching charicatures, NOT characters.  The difference being that you never feel completely connected to the characters as people.  They're a little too shallow and not all that well developed.  I suspect that this is more the fault of the script and the editing.  Perhaps a four hour version of the film might develop the characters a bit more fully.  But even in this 2 1/2 hour film, I just didn't feel all that connected to the characters.  <br/><br/>**** WARNING!!!  SPOILERS AHEAD!!! *****<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Some of the characters even feel like walking plot devices.  Case in point: the leader of the Japanese peasant force at the start of the film and the ""gruff Irish sergeant"" (incidentally, has an Irishman -- Wellington excepted, of course -- EVER been shown as more than a sergeant in film history??  Sheesh.).  <br/><br/>These characters are your typical Hollywood cannon fodder.  They get the main character from point A to point B, or provide a convenient ""moment"" of some sort for the character.  In both cases, they get about ten to fifteen minutes of screen time before they're snuffed.  I can accept this in horror films and action films, and even SOME war drama films, but if you're going to bother to include a character or draw major attention to them (as opposed to, say, Platoon, which kills off fairly anonymous soldiers without really developing them, BUT also without giving them much screen time to begin with), give them a BIT more of a purpose than ""having witnessed the death of [character X], our hero feels compelled to [insert emotion/action Y here]."" I mean, come on guys.  Why even bother giving these guys names?  Why not just have the characters refer to these guys as Gruff Irish Sergeant and Noble Japanese General?  These, of course, being the short versions of the names, the long ones ending with ""Who Will Surely Be Dead in Ten Minutes.""<br/><br/><br/><br/>
***** END SPOILERS ******<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>If you do decide to see this movie, go into it with the same approach that I did: expect a big, dumb Hollywood flick that's basically rehashing many plots and themes you've seen before.  Expect lovely cinematography, lots of lush shots of landscapes, expect to walk away saying ""My, but Japan seems an interesting place...""  Expect Tom Cruise to be Tom Cruise, expect narrow character development, etc.  <br/><br/>If you go in with these expectations, the film is reasonably interesting. If you're looking for an historical epic with rich characters and a novel plot, look elsewhere."

","You can't really fault Tom Cruise's performance: once again he reveals that he can be more than adequate without being stellar. It's more the film as a whole; it's general lack of emotional impact.<br/><br/>Cruise plays a frontier hero of the American-Indian 'wars', cynical and filled with self-loathing over his part in the atrocities. A large salary lures him to Japan to modernise and train the Emperor's army, and to fight off an insurgent Samurai and his peasant army, who refuse to use firearms.<br/><br/>The most obvious parallel that springs to mind is 'Dances With Wolves', but 'Last Samurai' has little of the emotional clout of 'Wolves'. Instead it seems a transparent white liberal attempt to redeem the country from American Indian holocaust by personifying the nation in  Cruise's character. This may have worked if the film hadn't been so inexplicably flat and dull. It makes gestures at poignancy and intensity, but they fall curiously flat, and for much of the time it's simply too slow.<br/><br/>Not a bad movie, but falls short of its own goals.  6 out of 10."

"harliiwood","10","1","2","15 June 2004"," Excellent Action Movie!
","The Last Samurai was not what I expected. Not only is it an excellent action movie, but I feel the content is very good for history buffs. After watching this movie I felt I would enjoy doing some research on the history of Samurai and Japanese culture.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD...<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was excellent as Captain Algren, an alcoholic who finds himself as he resides in a Samurai village as a captive. As he watches the Samurai train, he rediscovers why he is a soldier. He finally joins in the training and as he's constantly defeated, he challenges himself to do better each time. His relationship with the rebel Samurai leader becomes strong and each man helps the other in some way. Although there is a woman in the picture, that storyline is thankfully not developed as I feared it might be. Thus, the action and historical parts of the movie are given center stage.<br/><br/>I now know why Ken Watanabe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. I think he's the new Chow Yun-Fat. His English was excellent in the movie. His demeanor as Katsumoto, the leader of the rebel Samurai, is somewhat conflicted, but in a good way. He's at once thoughtful and inquisitive and at another bold and dangerous. His relationship with the other Samurai, including his son, is strong and they are very respectful of him. It was good to see the respect the villagers showed the Samurai as they passed through, bowing low. It showed how much the Samurai once meant to this culture.<br/><br/>Tony Goldwyn and Masato Harada (Col. Bagley and Omura) are villains you love to hate. They're each excellent as the forces attempting to suppress and overcome the remaining Samurai. <br/><br/>The interesting thing about the movie is that much of what they show us, we know is true. For example, the way Japan (and possibly other Eastern cultures) tried to lose its identity by becoming more like the European West. That part of the movie was very sad to me, to see the Japanese Emperor and his ministers willing to give up their traditions and identity in favor of guns, armies, suits and ties.<br/><br/>This movie is very graphically violent and bloody, but I guess I'm nuts, I loved it. I wouldn't let a youngster (under 12) watch this. I had visions of blood and chopped off heads later and I'm an adult, so you might want to watch this first before allowing your child to see it, or if you're very squeamish, you might want to reconsider.<br/><br/>Lastly, the subtitles didn't bother me at all. Although I watched it on a large screen TV, the print was rather small and I had to read it out loud for people sitting farther away from the screen than I was. That is the only negative thing I have to say about the film. Please see this movie yourself and make up your own mind about its worth. You won't be sorry."
"rikkus","Null","1","2","13 June 2004"," A moving tribute to a lost culture
","I have read many of the negative reviews of this film, and felt I needed to come to its defense. <br/><br/>Many have commented that The Last Samurai is not original in concept, and point particularly to similarities with Dances With Wolves. I don't know about you, but I have seen VERY few movies that were entirely original. Almost all of them build at least somewhat on earlier concepts. Personally, I am not even looking for absolute originality in a film - if I find it, great! - but it's not necessary to me. All I reasonably expect from a film is that it tell its own particular story compellingly and allows my willing suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Those who demand true originality from every film are doomed to near-constant disappointment. As for using Dances With Wolves as a benchmark, while it was an excellent film, it was far from original (remember the far superior Little Big Man, anyone?) Another point to remember is that this is an quasi-historical subject, and when looking back through history, one does not have to look very hard to find many parallels between different events, people, and cultures. Cannot different films explore the same basic idea (e.g.: alien converted to different culture) without automatically drawing derision for lack of originality? Even if the basic stories are similar, the changes in character, plot and cultural context create new perspectives. Yes, there are similarities between Dances With Wolves and the Last Samurai. It would be pretty hard to make a movie about similar historical phenomena without exhibiting those very similarities in the movie, don't you think? Another criticism often leveled at The Last Samurai is lack of historicity. Perhaps I missed something here, but I certainly didn't get the impression that this film was intended to be a historical documentary. For that sort of thing, one is better off watching The History Channel. It is absolutely true that the Samurai culture, (and bushido, it's code of ethics) embodied much that was inequitable and downright oppressive. It was a rigid feudal society with the Daimyos and their Samurai retainers on top, and craftsmen and peasants definitely on the bottom - much like feudal England in that respect. Bushido itself has many similarities to the code of Chivalry. But where feudal Japan differs<br/><br/>most markedly from feudal England is in the fact that artistry was both respected and expected from Daimyo and Samurai, whereas Earl and Knight were generally respected only for their ferocity in battle. Kendo, the mastery of the Japanese swords, is an art-form in and of itself - a fact that is beautifully illustrated in this film. Zwick is not attempting to give us an overview of all that was bad and good in the Way of the Samurai, he is purposely setting up Katsumoto and his Samurai as embodiments of all that was good in their culture. This is a fable, folks, not a docudrama. Zwick is showing us some of the very good things Japan lost when the last Samurai died. That is the point here. It is not intended to be a balanced view, and it is not. It shows us movingly that there was great tragedy in the loss of bushido and the men who adhered to it. Why is it, do you think, that Samurai films continue to be so popular today? Could it be that the ideals of honor, loyalty, bravery, dutifulness and artistry these long-dead men adhered to cry out to us so loudly because we see so little of these virtues in the modern world? Why should we not look to the ideals the Samurai represented as our exemplars, and reject that which was oppressive and cruel, as long as we remember that they were all men, with human vices as well as virtues, and that their culture had huge downsides as well. Yes, the film has its flaws; but as a tragically beautiful fable about the passing of a way of life that will be remembered as long as humankind lives, it has few equals."
"jditlev","Null","1","2","12 June 2004"," Horrible Hollywood script
","This was Cruise's worst film in many years. As many have pointed out, it's just ""Dances with Wolves in Japan"", but instead of a good epic story we here get..... crap. Cruise is miscast and overacts badly in some scenes, especially in the beginning.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>The film is full of clichÃ©s and stereotypes. The two leading Samurais are both charismatic, but that's just about the only really good thing in the movie. Some things about the plot are just plain ridiculous. The emperor has full control over both sides of the fighters, we learn, so WHY doesn't he just stop the whole damn thing?<br/><br/>And the reason why the samurai are fighting is because of something related to a railroad. But it is never clear why they must fight it so much. They stand for a traditional way of living and the railroad signals more modern ways of living, yes, yes, but does the railroad really mean the absolute end to the samurai way of living? We don't ever get to know that. It seems they're just fighting and fighting and killing for no real reason other than to stop progress (sounds like terrorism to me). In the end Cruise goes back to live with the Japanese woman, and since that is possible, I guess the community wasn't really that threatened itself by the railroad, anyway.<br/><br/>The blending of epic melodrama with the 'understanding a different culture' theme and fullblown killing spree action is not really a good mix. It's just too much. Really. The killing and dying of dignified main samurais (and sons of samurais) also gets really exploitative.<br/><br/>A particular bad point; One scene has Cruise asking a bad soldier to shoot him at 20 feet distance, because he knows that the soldier will miss; thereby he can show his point to the generals AND his balls of brass....

The movie does have quite a lot historical atmosphere, but the strongly forced hollywoodian touches (believe me) in plot and scenes brings it down in quality. Typically, you will have a point where the movie is believable and fascinating, then suddenly, one of those Hollywood touches crushes the atmosphere.<br/><br/>*slight spoilers*<br/><br/>You will easily see what I'm talking about for yourself.. There are certain classic Hollywood-scenes, like the worried boy maturely exiting the room in distress, then being followed for fatherly comfort and philosophical conversation - or the woman doing her chores when she turns to see her hero returning.. (why, oh, why...) And, classic Hollywood-improbabilities: In a strong hierarchy, everyone who skips the ranks will *always* be considered a weasel (like people who cut in line are despised in daily life), and so when a western samurai-slayer becomes best friends and strategic guide of the leader, none of the conservative samurai protest? Really..<br/><br/>This movie also bugs me a bit like The Beach did; a movie set in a multicultural scenario - where the good-looking American is the center of every foreigner's attention - and after a while, admiration - surviving everything and getting accepted and respected by everyone. Yay. :)<br/><br/>Again: I don't hate the movie! But it was obviously a gem that fell into the wrong hands: A good story to begin with, good performances by Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto), Koyuki (Taka, the widow) and also the people setting up the historical surroundings and costumes. However; horrible, horrible work by the director and probably also producers, for forcing hollywoodian improbabilities on it.. because of that, this movie; a heavy, prestige-filled, atmospheric story, didn't stand lasting >140 minutes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really love movies with a good atmosphere, and there is after all more of that than there is Hollywood stupidity, so I'm going to have to have to give this 7/10."

The plot is excellent, direction was very good, writing was decent acting was hit and miss, I think based on the writing.  <br/><br/>Writing: The westerners (and western leaning Japanese) are demonized as one dimensional greed driven honourless (for lack of a better word) jerks.  I think this is intentional - the typical viewer has to be told from the outset who the bad guys are, but it weakens the overall quality of the movie.  Some of us can think for ourselves...! Tom Cruise as Nathan Algren starts as a drunk military hero with a conscience - nothing too deep here, but as he accepts and assimilates the way of the Samurai, he develops into a deeper, more interesting character. There are (very) few other deep characters, but the ones that are explored are written well.  The plot is good and the atmosphere is historically based.<br/><br/>Direction: In one word, great.  'nuff said.<br/><br/>Acting: Surprisingly good and bad.  Tom Cruise was at his best, I found myself forgetting that the actor was the normally annoying Cruise.

(Don't get me wrong, I have an advanced degree in the history of a sorely misunderstood part of the world, so I know better than most not to look to Hollyweird for any kind of historical or cultural accuracy.) But this movie sure makes the history look and sound good, and one does get caught up in the emotion of it all. <br/><br/>I think Cruise does an adequate job with his role, and eventually one does come to admire his character in the same way the Japanese do. But really, I never took Allgren as being focal point of the film. The movie gets off to a slow start, but the pace and emotion builds and stays almost to the end. The end was somewhat far-fetched, and disappointing in its way.<br/><br/>Overall, a movie worth seeing. I plan to add it to my collection for the battle scenes and armor alone."

","Wow, this film is really great. With a Hollywood budget and a quite anti-Hollywood ending. I mean, without wanting to spoil:<br/><br/>1. A truly unusual way of displaying a love story. It is not about the standard true love brouhaha. It's about devotion. No cheesy scenes, where you would somehow wish, they could finally get over with it.<br/><br/>2. A very metaphoric ending...especially Katsumotos words on the field when he sees the blossoms.<br/><br/>3. (SPOILER??) The fact, that they don't exactly tell you, what really happens.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but these are the most important ones, that I can think of right away."

He travels to Japan to train the imperial army but ends up getting captured by Samurais...and begins a new life.<br/><br/>This is a great film.  However, it is not spiritually redeeming since it does not include Biblical morals and the violence is in excess (""Lord of the Rings"" violence but more of it).  This film certainly gave ROTK a run for its money during the Oscars but I doubt this was good enough to win for best picture.  3.75 out of 5 stars"
"glentom1","8","1","2","30 May 2004"," Better than I thought it would be
","I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, other than A Few Good Men.  He was pretty good in this movie, although my choice for best actor in this movie would be Watanabe.<br/><br/>I generally liked the plot, in which Cruise as a war hero has painful misgivings about his role in senseless battles killing innocent American Indians.  His character goes through a coming of age sub-plot, when he finally has a chance to redeem himself by choosing a path of righteousness rather than blindly following orders.<br/><br/>I liked the first half of the movie better than the second half, which became a bit unglued (in my opinion).  For example, Cruise is escorted and given safe passage back into town.  Then both Katsumoto and his son (in separate scenes) come waltzing into town and, although not greeted warmly, are generally given the freedom to roam.  It seems that since they had both been hunted throughout the movie, that they would have been killed on sight. Just seemed odd to me given the violent encounters earlier in the film.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the film is Algren's stay with the Samurai's.  It overshadows almost everything before and after.  The closing battle is OK, but is pretty much a remake of the battle scenes in every epic movie (i.e., Braveheart, The Patriot, Spartacus, Gettysburg, on and on...), with the only thing left for the viewer is to guess who would come out on top.<br/><br/>The ending is fairly rewarding, showing that Katsumoto's sacrifice had meaning.  I did find it rather cheesy when in the end, the narrator said something like ""nobody ever knew what happened to Captain Algren"" then they proceeded to show an ending where Algren ended up with his love interest.  I would think they need to do one or the other, not both.<br/><br/>Given my peevish quibbles, I really liked the movie and recommend it highly. It has a thought provoking plot, great scenery, and good acting (especially the Japanese characters)."

(Yes, shoot me now - its that human defence mechanism thing kicking in)<br/><br/>I have however seen this movie about 5 times to date.  i love it!  I am NOT a Tom Cruise fan, and perhaps that was one of the reasons i was so anti it from the beginning.  the thought of Tom playing a wannabe Samurai just put me off.  Having said that, the movie was amazing.  I never got the impression he was trying to do any such thing.  His performance was real and sincerely done.  I find myself watching this movie again and again. <br/><br/>
The direction is beautiful, surrounded by locations that just enhance the serenity and emotional turmoil enbroiled in the story.<br/><br/>Having spoke about Tom's performance, i will say that the shiners come from Ken Watanabe and Koyoki.  Ken was BRILLIANT as Kutsimoto, just BRILLIANT. Every Expression, every gesture, from the shrugging of a shoulder to the wry smile, it was perfectly executed.<br/><br/>Koyoki, amazing.  She seemed to have gotten the spirit of what the character of Taka should have been like.  I really watch her performance critically to find a falw, yet i find none.  She too had this innertly graceful way of doing her scences.  She is beautiful and a definite job well done.<br/><br/>Everything else, the rest of the cast, crew...it gelled perfectly.<br/><br/>What a movie, and one that i have enjoyed emensely.

"jrfranklin01","7","1","2","17 May 2004"," A Dying Honor from the East
","Like that of Braveheart, The Patriot, and Dances with Wolves, The Last Samurai centers around the struggle a minority faces in standing up for its way of life.  <br/><br/>The year is 1876 and thanks to Commodore Perry, the island nation of Japan discovers the ""modern"" world.  The emperor of the great nation, in an effort to modernize his country and bring about an industrial revolution, brings in western influence. But this influence is comprised of self-interested greedy parties who care nothing for Japan's people.  As a result, the emperor is misguided into disbanding the devout Samurai, who have protected the country for a thousand years.  They are asked to give up their way of life and step aside to western influence so that a new unified militaristic army of Japan may be formed.<br/><br/>In charge of the task to train this army is Captain Algren (Tom Cruise).  We discover Algren to be a man suffering from horrible nightmares over his actions against the American indians.  He spends most of his time in the bottle to escape his self-torture and guilt. He agrees to be privately hired for the Japan assignment because he knows nothing else than war and that seems to be what he is fit for.<br/><br/>Algren begins training the rudimentary new army of Japan but soon finds himself prematurely ordered to march them into battle against the Samurai. The impending defeat of the untrained soldiers comes as no surprise as the Samurai sweep over them in a furious wave of violence.  But Algren's life is spared by the leader of the Samurai, Katsumoto, whose sees him as a remarkable warrior and the physical manifestation of a vision he encountered.<br/><br/>Algren begins to undergo a transformation as he is kept prisoner by the Samurai.  Living with them, he begins to see the tribal people for who they are and respects and admires their honor, kindness, discipline, and perfection as a way of life.  He eventually is welcomed into their confidence and begins training in their ways.<br/><br/>When the time arrives for Algren to choose whose side he is going to fight for, whether he is an man of the west or the east, Algren chooses that of the Samurai.  He does so as an act of redemption and because he realizes the importance in defending what you believe.   Despite the enormous odds against the tribal people, the Samurai are excited for the chance to make their stand and embrace their way of life to die with honor.<br/><br/>Algren and Katsumoto lead the Samurai into battle to die a glorious death, as all Samurai, save Algren, are defeated by the new army of Japan (hence the title).  The weapons of the old (swords, bows and arrows) are defeated by that of the new (cannons, rifles, machine guns).  And in one of the more dramatic and heartfelt sad endings, we see the bravery and dignity of a simple culture mowed down by the technological cowardice of the complex world.  The question this ending poses is whether it is more honorable or foolhardy to fight for a way of life, even in the face of an imminent and gruesome death.  I will let you decide."
"ACMcC24","10","1","2","16 May 2004"," This couldn't have gotten any better. Masterpiece.
","Considering Tom Cruise hasn't exactly been one of my more favorite actor in Hollywood, I was a little leery of watching this film in theaters simply because he was in it.  Probably one of the biggest mistakes I could've made. I rented it because a military history major I knew said that this movie was one of the more historically accurate depictions of the samurai's life he's seen (in Hollywood at least).  After watching it, I have to consider this movie to be in my top 10 favorites.  <br/><br/>   I didn't consider this movie to be an ""action"" flick when I saw it, and am rather surprised that it was categorized as such.  Yes, it has action in it, however there is just as much drama with a little bit of romance included.  This combined with Katsumoto's character representing to a certain extent an actual historical figure, Saigo  Takamori, with his legendary - if a tad bit mythical - death and the last stand of the samurai, truly makes this film beautiful and deeply moving on a grand scale.<br/><br/>   In terms of the samurai life depicted, I've never felt more moved at watching how they lived their life, their death, and what was lost to Japan within the context of the movie.  As for the acting, Ken Watanabe and Hiro Sanada couldn't have made a better entrance into the American movie industry, and I truly hope to see more of them.  As for Tom Cruise, I couldn't be more impressed with what he's done here.  Even though he's center on the poster with his name in large font above, it's obvious after you watch the film that he shared, if not was overlapped by the secondary plot concerning the samurai.  As for the length of the film, frankly it was perfect for it's detail.  I only wish I could've seen more of the daily life of the samurai depicted.  <br/><br/>   Not a boring moment, and for the one's who said this was rather dull, that's only if you are expecting a brainless, superficial flick that has no concept of what ""artfully done"" is.  10/10"

Tom Cruise, though he tried valliently to play this part, I think a lesser known actor would have excelled where he played only a mediocre role.

"Gary-J-Vidmar","Null","1","2","7 May 2004"," Lavish, expensive Samurai picture with a B-movie script and a miscast Cruise.
","It's amazing how much this film resembles one of those low-budget actioners about a Westerner going to the Orient and becoming a big hero.  We're talking ""Action Cinemax"" here, except that you have a multi-million dollar budget and Tom Cruise in the lead.  The picture is visually lush, although the CGI is very evident (unlike in, say, a movie like MASTER AND COMMANDER, where it's all but invisible).  As for Cruise, he's unconvincing as an alcoholic, world-weary American soldier, a role more suited to someone like Nick Nolte than a boyish, fresh face like Tom.  Everything is just as you expect it here, so there are no surprises of any kind, except that we don't, and quite surprisingly I might add, get a sex scene for Tom and his Japanese sex interest.  A drag, if you ask me.  It's not unenjoyable because there are big battles that are terrific to watch, and the cliches are played with charm by the Japanese cast, but it's humorless and unoriginal whenever the ""Westerners"" take to the forefront.  Far less than the David Lean or Kurosawa epics it tries too hard to pay tribute to."

However Capt Algren is captured by Samurai during battle and lives with them for nearly a year in which he learns how important the Samurai warrior code is and forces him to fight to defend a culture he was hired to help destroy. <br/><br/>This movie obviously contains a lot of fighting and killing but it does contain an interesting story of who the Samurai were and about the code of honor which<br/><br/>was so important.

","Edward Zwick's  The Last Samurai is one of those films worth seeing. <br/><br/>Regardless of how it sounds [that being ""Tom Cruise goes to Japan""], it is much better than I and other thought it would be.<br/><br/>Before I go any further I want to make one point:  The story is accurate to<br/><br/>Japanese culture on a superficial level.  That being said, it is very easy to criticise this film because of its accuracy to cultural matters.  Is it historically and culturally accurate?  Depends on how deep you look and how much you know. <br/><br/>Suffice it to say, the film's accuracy was sufficient for it to not be a significant [not even minor] problem.<br/><br/>Moving on:   As it has been said about many films in the past few years, it is unfortunate for Last Samurai that Lord of the Rings came out the same year. <br/><br/>This film would likely have swept Art Direction, Costume Design, and Sound. It also would have garnered nomination a nomination for Cinematography.  <br/><br/>Visually, the film has perfectly integrated and flowing imagery from beginning to end.  Ignoring minor issues there is really nothing to complain about in depth.  The Score is phenomenal.  Hans Zimmer should have been nominated for his<br/><br/>work in this film.<br/><br/>   Of the many things this film excelled at, the costume design was by far the best of it.  [In particular, the Samurai armor.]<br/><br/>Ken watanabe is another good point.  His work in this film will undoubtedly be the start of a prolific career in Hollywood filmmaking.<br/><br/>Problems: Well, quite simply, there is nothing that stands out.   Many have criticized Tom Cruise's performance.  Is it necessary?  Not really.  Could the role have been done better? Well, sure.  But that's true about most roles.  Cruise did a good job. Writer John Logan could have given the character a bit more depth and, in<br/><br/>doing so, given Tom Cruise more to do.  Then, criticism of Cruise could be<br/><br/>warranted.  <br/><br/>In short, the best criticism one can make of this film was that it could have done with another 30+ minutes of character exposition and study which would have<br/><br/>given the characters more depth and turned the roles of Cruise and others into Oscar-worthy endeavors.<br/><br/>8/10"

I've been a fan of Tom Cruise for years, and I would honestly say that this has been his best role to date.  Most believable character he's ever played by far.  Ken Watanabe was brilliant.

","I know this film has received much positive response, but the amount of negative feedback is almost overwhelming. I can't believe all these people griping about Tom Cruise's invincibility and how the movie fails to accurately depict the samurai and their way of life. They are fighting against a drastic change that is being forced on them too quickly for their own liking, so why not fight back? Cruise's character understands the way they feel, so he joins them in their cause. Maybe not a wise decision if one holds one's survival above all else, but it's a movie. For the love of all things sacred, it's A MOVIE. Enjoy it. Be entertained. If you don't like it because of such trivialities, too bad. They're there, and there's nothing you can do about it. Now, if there had been some truly glaring problems, such as a complete lack of explanation of Algren's sympathy for the samurai or the presence of an odious comic-relief character, I would complain about the movie as well.<br/><br/>However, I found it to be an excellent film. It had an interesting story, one of the best battles ever filmed, great performances by the entire cast (especially Watanabe), excellent cinematography, and an excellent script, among other nice qualities. I, for one, found the ending to be quite well-done. As a whole, I feel it was a thoroughly satisfying film and should have as least been nominated for Best Picture.

","Don't get me wrong, Galdiator is a great film. But this is better. The themes of honour, loyalty, redemption and responsibility are put forward with a force and certainty that I haven't seen for a long time in a film.<br/><br/><some spoilers ahead><br/><br/>The action pieces are well arranged and Cruise is convincing as a Samurai, albeit an American one. The rest of the cast are all excellent<br/><br/>But where this movie scores points (and for me elevated itself above the typical Hollywood nonsense we are used to) is in its subtlety. Two scenes stand out where, under a less caring scriptwriter or director, this film would have been a disappointment.<br/><br/>The first is when Cruise's character is learning to swordfight. With Stat Hollywood Director (SHD) in control, you just know that there would come a point in the training where the student defeats the master, to looks of shock and surprise from all onlookers. Here, however, we are treated not to the besting of the master, but Cruise managing a draw against his teacher, to looks of shock and surprise from all onlookers. It might sound a trivial thing, but it made the movie that little bit more believable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The second scene involved the love interest between Algren (Cruise) and Taka. With jolly old SHD in charge, I would have expected the obligatory sex scene, followed by wailing and gnashing of teeth the following morning when he goes off to battle. Here however we are treated instead to a gentle admission (unspoken mostly) of their love for one another, with nothing more sexual than a simple kiss. Less subtle than the first example, perhaps, but no less telling.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great film and, like Gladiator, one that I am sure will stand the test of time and be enjoyed again and again."

It's a classic well constructed epic a like movie, and i love epic, honestly, pretty much written after the classic style, but it's so damn nicely directed, clever directing supported by beautiful and engaging Cinematography and a, at times, dramatic, at other times, silent yet beautiful soundtrack.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it's well done too, Cruise and Watanobe is doing an amazing job, and another thing i like is that they are true to the language of the natives, they are realistic, talking japanese, combined by english, that also makes for some funny scenes that can make you smile a bit on top of the tragetic layout the movie has, Cruise is actually talking japanese well, i was so surprised, i liked him before as an actor, but now he has showed me and the whole world that he is also a good characteristic actor, maybe his actor is not to many years away.<br/><br/>Also i found that the movie had a lot of nice, and for once, obvious symbolic values, the movie was faithfull to the way it portrayed the samurais, as people who puts honor and discipline at a high status, especially honor was well displayed when the Samurai with the long hair (Don't remember his name), who gave Cruise a hard time in the start, got shot, when the other Samurai's wants to help him on his feets, he pushes them away and stands up for himself, i don't know what it was about this scene that was so engaging, but i just simply thought it was great, one of the characters who you maybe disliked a little because he was such a cruel guy, you suddenly have sympathy for.<br/><br/>I was constantly thinking that this movie had to be like Master And Commander (Which i gave 7 and found a tad confusing and meaningless), but but after watching this i was stunned and had no idea how i would describe it, i barely ever give 10 to a movie, but i think this one deserves it, even though it has taken a bit of critism from reviewers and other movie goers, i can't deny what i think is the proper solution hehe, stunning movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

"Ujio","Null","1","2","20 March 2004"," A Great Work of Art (Spoilers)
","ATTN: Please take notice that this review contains spoilers for the movie. You have been warned.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>When I first saw the trailer for `The Last Samurai,' I immediately wanted to see it. Why? Well, I'm a bit of a sucker for any movie which appears to contain large medieval-style sword battles. This also sparked my interest in Samurai culture, and I remain quite interested in it to this day. So I looked forward to the movie, and while I waited I looked up the history behind the story.<br/><br/>And finally, after much waiting, it came out. Although some movies get so much hype you're disappointed in the end, `The Last Samurai' certainly didn't let me down at all. It is definitely a great work of art, and I plan to buy it as soon as it's available on DVD.<br/><br/>Firstly, the storyline is interesting. Yes, it's potentially overdone a little, especially with Tom Cruise who often plays characters down on their luck. Nevertheless, it keeps you interesting, and the following plotline of Algren's interaction with the leader, Katsumoto, and his sister, Taka, really interests you. `The Last Samurai' isn't just a movie about fighting Samurai, it's also a romance story. I've actually heard it's a good date movie. Not something you'd expect.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting is superb. Tom Cruise plays a good a believable character whom we really feel for. Now, Cruise is good, but Ken Watanabe is simply amazing. I can't really say enough about this man's talent at acting. He is more than believable, he IS Katsumoto. His words of wisdom throughout the movie keep the whole plotline going. Koyuki is a beautiful and talented actress, and works well with Cruise.<br/><br/>In other supporting roles, there is Katsumoto's grim and solemn lieutenant, Ujio, played by Hiroyuki Sanada. Personally, I loved the guy. One of my favorite characters in the entire movie. There is also the Silent Samurai, played by Seizo Fukumoto, and Katsumoto's son Nobutada, played by Shin Koyamada. They all play their parts well and provide an excellent cast of minor supporting roles. Even Billy Connolly does a good job with his character.<br/><br/>The action is intense, fast-paced, and will leave you almost stunned and speechless the first time you see it. The last battle is one of the most memorable I have ever seen, and it almost made me come to tears (yeah, I can get pretty emotional). I'm also glad that they skipped the possibly obligatory intimate scene between Taka and Algren. The plot worked quite well without it, and was much more enjoyable for me that the romance was kept clean.<br/><br/>Overall, a 5 out of 5. A great movie and work of art that I would suggest to just about everyone. Now, it does have a substantial amount of blood, and the violence is heavy, but if you can handle it, it's a very enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>
(ATTN: SPOILERS! The following section of this review contains some spoilers.)<br/><br/>(Please do not read further if you do not wish to know them.)<br/><br/>I'd have to say the single most emotional part of the movie is when Nobutada dies. I really cried on that. You can really just read the emotion on Kotsumoto's face as he realizes he must leave his son behind, and at the same time trying to keep his composure.<br/><br/>The Ninja battle is probably the most fast-paced and intense fight of the movie. Really great scenes. The only minor nitpick here is that the Ninja would get trounced, because their swords aren't designed to take hard blows like that.<br/><br/>Another minor nitpick is that even after Ujio dies, you can just barely see him running around in the distance during part of the final charge. Ujio lives!  : )"

","TLS is one of those films that teach so much, about a people and an aspect of their culture, without having to come across as didactic. It does this almost effortlessly by demonstrating-- cinematography, the scenes' mood, production design, great acting, etc.  The viewer, if he is 'empty cup' (in the Zen sense), is simply engaged. Although Bushido can be controversial, TLS succeeds as a work of art in evoking sentiments and touching an audience's soul without needing to justify an ideology or give supporting arguments.  After all, it's a film-- not a philosophy book.  TLS is soft yet strong, gentle yet firm.  The battle scenes though violent aren't gory and sensationalized.  There is still that sense of humanity and tender feelings even in the killing field.  After all, this is not really a war film but a film about a people and a culture permeated by so much beauty, profound realization of impermanence, honor, pride, commitment, filial piety and sensitivity despite the presence of conflicts, imperfection, human frailty and 'birth pangs' that often accompany change.  It's one of the best introductions to Japanese culture.  I have seen the film 7 times (and intend to watch it again)."

The part of Algren demanded an actor with an edge to them. Imagine a Gary Oldman , Russel Crowe, Johnny Depp or Tim Roth in the part. The only two scenes that were not flat and lacking in imagination in Glory were the rifle reloading scene and the first battle through the mist. Both of these were shamelessly lifted into Samurai. I  teach Japanese history and taught English there for years, I think the culture was well represented but the extreme change that took place is almost unprecedented in human history.

","The Last Samurai (2003-D. Edward Zwick)  Tom Cruise is Nathan Algren, a disillusioned officer who fought in the civil war and later, in the Indian wars.  His last battle was at Little Big Horn with Custer.   Now he is drinking hard and giving talks in tent shows about his exploits.  He is asked to go to Japan and help modernize the military there and get rid of the Samurai's and their culture.   The biggest problem is he hates the officer who would be over him, Col. Bagley (played by Tony Goldwyn as a clueless bigot) but takes the job anyway.  <br/><br/>After training the raw recruits of the new Japanese army, who have never before held firearms and can't shoot straight, for just a few months he is ordered to take them against the Samurai.  He demonstrates that they are not ready in a great sequence standing in front of a target and ordering the terrified man to shoot at him.  Finally the man does and misses by a mile, but Bagley orders him and the rookies into battle anyway. <br/><br/>
Against the great Samurai these hapless recruits are annihilated, and Algren, wounded, is about to be killed, when the leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) orders him brought back to their home in the mountains.   Thus the story becomes about the ensuing friendship and understanding between two very different cultures. <br/><br/>For mature people who need a good story with their action/adventure films, this is the ticket.  By the last battle, I was in tears and wanted to shout 'hooray' when Bagley is finally downed, even though we know the battle has been lost.   This is a very good, thoughtful film and Watanabe and Cruise are wonderful.  9/10"

The story goes back to the 19th century when a war veteran (Tom Cruise) is hired by the Japanese to train their troops that fight the Samurai rebels. When he gets captured, he begins to admire the Samurai teachings and morals.<br/><br/>I am sure this one will be the hit of the year and will reap a bunch the Academy awards...

"jas_montreal","Null","1","2","8 March 2004"," The First Perfection
","I have to admit that I was very reluctant to watch this movie at first. (Spoiler) Just because I don't really like watching action or subtitled films. But everyone kept recommending me to watch it and said it was really better than I could ever imagine. And they were right!<br/><br/>I was really surprised at how acurate and real this movie was. I already knew how talented Tom Cruise is, but this has to be one of the best I've ever seen him in! (Spoiler) Not only did he do most of the stunt work, but I was especially impressed at how he spoke japanese. This movie could've easily been like any other hollywood movie where all the characters speak english and it doesn't seem odd that they know it so well. But that he took the time to learn the language and that the rest of the actors were allowed to speak their native tongue. I don't see how it would be otherwise because it would've been just as bad as that Bruce Willis movie Tears Of The Sun.<br/><br/>I also loved the sexual subtleties between Cruise and Koyuki's characters. She's not the typical beauty of mixed blood, but of demure and angelic beauty that represents the fragile asian nature. And I admire any woman who'd go on screen wearing very little make-up when acting next to Cruise. There was no nudity or sex, but the tension and desire they immitted was intense.<br/><br/>(Spoiler) It is a sad movie because it demonstrates the horrible side of humans by killing off one of the heroes that actor Ken Watanabe plays. But brings life into prespective and shows how some are willing to give up their lives for their principles.<br/><br/>My final words, I highly recommend this movie to everyone and hope every person gets a little something from this experience!!!"
"Sinnerman","Null","1","2","7 March 2004"," Nice Conversations
","The Last Samurai is a thinking guy flick. It celebrates the values men hold in codes and honour. It champions the virtues of stoicism and tenacity, especially in the face of losing battles. And of course, it attempted to exoticise Japanese culture, with some parts of its screenplay seemingly lifted out of back translated fortune cookies. But I am not bothered much by such pedantically imperialistic concerns. For its blood pumping war action and martial arts choreography more than capably distracts my critical faculties. So much so, that I'm thankful now I don't write reviews for a living. At once sweeping yet intimately rendered, The Last Samurai is a prized find alongside Master and Cummander. Its a movie made by men, for men. Its sexist chauvism is delicious beyond reckoning. Me like.<br/><br/>
Ok, enough gender trumpeting. Here's the review proper.<br/><br/>
A film, however blindingly epic, will never work without the essential conduit of effective performances. I hence liked the fact that the film attempted to articulate depths in the two central male characters (Cruise and Watanabe). Both men are at war with external forces, at war with each other and most intriguing of all, at war with themselves. It came out the better for it.<br/><br/>Though outwardly a courageous man, a brilliant war tactician and a very tenacious soldier, Cruise's voice-overs (transcribed words in his journals) reveal him to be an empathetic man wounded by his war experiences, jaded by past betrayals and haunted by his stricken conscience. He just couldn't let go. Since Magnolia, Cruise has not delivered a performance I can condemn conscionably, here is another....<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe, the fierce and fearsome chief of the renegade Samurai tribe, transcended his external persona. In the quieter moments, the man exuded an aura of collected calm and kingly air of dignity. He is also a man of profound love for his family, his honour, his people and his emperor. The lordly charisma emanating from this man increases his verisimilitude as an inspiring leader. His men will follow him to the very ends of battles, even to their certain deaths. But he is no Godly being, for here too is a man who feels the weight of his duties/ responsibilties, who bears the very human burden of gradually losing his fight, upholding his ancestral Japanese traditions in the face of his country's ravaging modernity. I concur with his well-deserved Globe nomination. A Oscar berth need too be given.<br/><br/>
Via their conversations and individual introspection, this film thus charted the respective emotional and spiritual journey embarked on by both men. Coursing through their respective gains and losses, the trust, friendship and collective experiences of the samurai and the warrior will put them both in good stead when their time comes.<br/><br/>But if I can have my way, I will vote for the stoic yet lovable ""Bob"" (heh). There is a point to this above jibe, of course. For The Last Samurai boasts of actors who are all round outstanding, from Cruise on down to the smallest soldier/ samurai. Every face with a close-up, big or small, delivered on their emotional cues, culminating into an ensemble resembling a well oiled machinery. There is an unforced honesty in the expressions of even them bit actors. I think this evocative Japanese-ness might have (by accident even) rubbed off on the film.<br/><br/>Both Cruise and Watanabe's characters are portrayed as ones well schooled (or interested) in the art of warfare and combat. This thus made TLS a very satisfying war movie for yours truly. There is a certain beauty in the orchestration of the battles. Very often, big scale cinematic war sequences are not well articulated enough to suck an audience into its core. To achieve this connection, a delicate balance need be struck within its ebb and flow. It needs to be skillfully alternating between the grandeur of the troop movements, the intimate nuances of the protagonists' characterisation while not losing sight of the intricacies of situational developments. The Last Samurai succeeded on all three counts. In fact. it's ingeniously rousing last stand with the enemies' meat grinding weaponries is one of the best rendered war action choreography I have the fortune of experiencing this millennium.<br/><br/>Goldwyn to Cruise: ""Why do you hate your people so much?...""<br/><br/>Cruise to boy(or woman) later on in the flick: ""..(Because) they have come to destroy the people I have come to love....""<br/><br/>Yes, this film reminded me of Dances with wolves (and similarly, Nowhere in Africa). I loved them all too. Cultural imperialists may have their field day with TLS, but I instinctively respond to such culture clashing films. Its not about which culture is more superior or more exoticised, it's about our mutual willingness to listen and learn from each other. For via these cross-pollination exercises, wisdom and insights are interchangeably imparted, along with other quaint and (maybe) useless customs. It's all about selective acceptance of the good and discarding the bad. Yes, I do opine that even films like TLS can teach us something in return. But it can only be learnt if one is open to its educational intent."
"niuhko","9","1","2","2 March 2004"," A brief opinion
","The film was great, but as a Feudal Japan-fan I would have changed a few minor details if given the opportunity to direct..=) Altogether it still was an impressive presentation of the clash between the Feudal culture and upcoming Industrialization.. Casting was quite successful, few of the post-filming effects stood out a bit too clearly but did not interfere with the film itself. At least not too much. War was depicted as a brutal, yet beautiful thing and the violence was quite graphic, but it was almost a necessity in this kind of movie. All of the battle-scenes were breath-taking and especially the first engagement between the samurai and the soon-to-be Imperial army was something that will stick in your mind for quite some time."

"jcanettis","9","1","2","22 February 2004"," A Wonderful Epic
","""The Last Samurai"" is a wonderful epic. The story is about the tale of American army captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is sent to Japan in the 18th century, in order to help the emperor train his army and crash a rebellion by disobedient Samurais who straggle to retain the country's cultural purity; Algren's experience in fighting native Indians is considered his ""asset"" for his task. Things begin to work out very differently however, when Algren gets captured by the Samurais, and begins to admire their mission, code of ethics, and way of life.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is astonishing in his touching and grandiose role as Captain Algren, whom we watch transform gradually from a wrecked, semi-alcoholic, and nihilistic person, into an honorable, energetic, and passionate Samurai. The parallels with Kevin Kostner in ""Dances With Wolves"" are inescapable, but the difference here is that the norms and customs of the tribe that Algren joins (the Japanese Samurai) are far less familiar to the Western public, and this gives an extra exotic ""plus"" to the film. The performance of the other actors is also superb, but for me the greatest impact was made by Ken Watanabe as legendary Katsumoto.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" has all the necessary ingredients of a great epic: Drama, emotion, action, war, heroism, and love. The high-class photography, scenery, and costumes, complete the perfection. 9/10."

","Others may disagree with me but I'm entitled to my own opinion so I'll say it.<br/><br/>Slightly a different pace from what I'm used to watching on the big screen, with the whole ""good guy vs. bad guy"" scenario. ""The Last Samurai"" is a bit more on the political problems of Japan in that time, as well finding oneself when you thought you lost it. With Algren as the person who had lost his soul for a cause he thought right, Cruise helps bring out the culture of Japan not seen often in the States. Also with Katsumoto (Watanabe) to play the opposite of Algren, he portrays how a traditional Japanese would have acted back then.<br/><br/>While many people are accustomed to things being spoken outright, the Japanese are more of the opposite; what isn't spoken, is the most important. This may confuse the younger members but for those who study Japan, they might get the bigger picture.<br/><br/>In short, it's quite difficult to say about ""Last Samurai"". One word from me: deep."
"gus120970","Null","1","2","9 February 2004"," Braveheart with chopsticks
","This must be the first Tom Cruise movie I've actually paid to see, and I went the day after watching the tediously pretentious Vanilla Sky. Tom has been guzzling the creatine since that, as he's back to his chunky self. He looks good, I grant him that, in Samurai armour and he does get into the physicality that this rather long film occasionally demands of him.<br/><br/>This film is not the story of the 'Real Japan' emerging from its over-extended period of feudalism to become the Pacific imperial power and industrial dynamo it did in the early 20th Century - but how could you examine the complexity of that story in 2 and 1/2 hours? Japan is still a contradictory nation, ritualised, archaic and misunderstood even by itself.<br/><br/>The Last Sumurai is a boy's own adventure, and a colourful and engaging one at that. But it at least attempts to hint at the socio-political context of change in Japan at that specific time and perhaps the way the Americans sowed the seeds of the horrific Pacific War by pandering to the most rapacious interests of Japan's emerging Capitalist class - and then hastily trying to suppress them after the Manchurian occupation of the 1930s that led inevitably to a battle over the mercantilist imperial spoils of the Pacific Rim.<br/><br/>It also makes a deeper point about the fundamentally changing nature of warfare brought about in the middle of the 19th century, a change which has left the tradition of Bushido largely incomprehensible and horrific to us: as all our feelings of war and conflict are filtered through the experience of mechanised, massed warfare.<br/><br/>It may have been a dangerous romanticism, but the spirit of Budo was about the honour involved in the conflict of excellence - where superior skill and spirit would overcome the enemy. The equivalent of our chivalric tradition.<br/><br/>The climax to the file shows the end of this cycle brought about by the machine gun - and the director chose a most potent symbol of that transition. A piece of machinery that an idiot can use to mow down dozens of people in seconds bring about the end of 1000 years of traditional warfare, in the same way the handgun and rifle 'Won the West'.<br/><br/>Where the film missed a trick was by not drawing its hero from the American Civil War which was a pivotal moment in the history of mechanised warfare: the losses sustained on civil war battlefields were proportionately much higher than those in contemporary conflicts like Crimea and brough about the end of the concept of the cavalry charge (used to great cinematic effect at the end of this picture).<br/><br/>Like any good boy's own adventure, the brush is broad, the canvas wide and the cliche employed unapologetically, usually with a sweeping background score. The samurai warlord's eye is caught by the trapped tiger spirit of the captured American....the warrior 'poet' reveals his love of the perfect blossom...the widow falls in love with her husband's killer....the captive refuses to be bowed and holds onto his Jo stick despite being pummelled into the mud.<br/><br/>It's inevitable then that he goes native, conquers his drink problem, starts wearing hakamas and practising his Katana Kata in the soft morning light. And of course, there has to be the moment of epiphany where he risks his own life to save that of his erstwhile captor.<br/><br/>The lure of exotic Japanese culture and the appeal of Bushido to an American officer is supportable: millions around the globe continue to respond to the echoes of its charms through modern martial arts. The reality is that the Japanese would be rather less interested in his Gaijin ways.<br/><br/>I am not a martial arts movie fan, so can make no comparisons. However, I was looking for examples of my own art Jiu Jitsu, and there was a bit of realistic choreographed grappling. More kata with different weapons would have been good. However, capturing the essence of the zen way of fighting with 'no mind' was a good point to make and remake through the movie, rather than just convey the idea that Cruise sharpens up his sowrd-swinging skills by practise alone.<br/><br/>The fight scene climax bears inevitable comparison with Gibson's Braveheart, not least as they both employ a slightly dubious fire-trap mechanism to even seemingly impossible odds. Last Samurai, I would say, is an inferior rendition in cinematography terms, as although the numbers involved were comparable, the Scots movie seems heartier in its violence and more imaginative in its shots. Gallons of ketchup in each though, and the armour is very nice.<br/><br/>It might have been more honourable film-making had Cruise taken a few bullets in the final reel rather than be the only guy on horseback to apparently make it through the hail of fire with nothing more than a gamey leg, but there was a final scene to think of. 'Maybe his died of his injuries' was about as vague as his contract probably allows."

","The Motion Picture Academy's integrity has taken a nosedive. In my opinion they have either become so ensconced in their lofty position that they have grown out of touch with reality or they are automatons to the special interest of those who can afford the most promotional dollars. Either way, that The Last Samurai was not voted Best Picture or Tom Cruise Best Actor is a gross injustice.Jude Law was better in Road to Perdition, The Lord of the Rings should not be on this list. The Last Samurai had something that is inescapable: It was a masterpiece the Cinematography was excellent, the writing and acting sublime.This film was intelligent, heartfelt and historically significant.Amazingly although the movie was over 2 hours long, there was not one scene that was gratuitous or wasted.Each scene was powerful and insightful each fight sequence was perfectly choreographed and perfectly placed in the movie. This movie was a masterpiece from beginning to end. Seabiscuit Master and commander and Lord of the rings together just equal the spirit and intensity in the Last Samurai. This years telecast I will definitely boycott. I am not going to watch this years farce.The motion picture academy seriously dropped the ball.Sometimes all of the planets align, Sometimes you have a good actor in a bad film sometimes you have a bad actor in a well written film mostly you have neither but finally sometimes you have a Good Actor in a well written, well directed film.That is Tom Cruise, Ken Watanabe and The Last Samurai.<br/><br/>Shame on you Motion Picture Academy!

","So I won't make comparisons with that movie. I thought this is a well-done film. Sympathetic, and respectful of our culture. Thank you Hollywood and Zwick  and Logan from a 'nihonjin.' I thought Cruise did a great job. I didn't see any of the reckless grinning that he known for, and he did a great portrayal of a disillusioned but fierce and loyal soldier. And this was exactly how many of the samurai felt in that era. This was a great fantasy film about a time of great change in Japan. You have to remember this is a fairy tale, but the Meiji Restoration was a turning point in Japan's history that I am happy that Americans can be better aquainted with. And the love scenes were well crafted, no obligatory sex scene (thats absolutely impossible for a gaijin and nihonjin in that time period!!!) It was a stretch to see Cruise handle a katana so well, and I was prepared to laugh going into the movie, but the story really turned me around, it was so well done that it felt natural. I highly recommend you see it in the theatre, don't waste your experience on TV."
"US_Ken_Fan","10","1","2","2 February 2004"," breath-stealing, enthralling, humorous at times, well-drawn characters
","KEN WATANABE AS ""KATSUMOTO"" Ken Watanabe's fierce, brilliant portrayal of ""Katsumoto"" in the Last Samurai took my breath away! Characterization was this film's strongest point--the many verbal parries and silent communications between these very real characters made me feel awe, sadness, smirking amusement, loss, and heartbreak. All by itself, that would be a terrific acomplishment and my review would be written and done with.<br/><br/>But I really didn't know anything about this ""Ken Watanabe"" guy, did I? Not that he's actually rather easy-going...and not that in real life he looks more like a huggable chipmunk than a slashing Samurai!<br/><br/>To be sure, this is silly, but I actually got so obsessed by this that I was downloading pictures of Ken as Katsumoto to my desktop just so I could switch back-and-forth between each picture and a video interview I found online. I just could NOT rectify the guy in the video with this vitallically fierce character, especially when at the movies it seems ""Katsumoto"" might get in your face instead of Nathan's (Tom Cruise).<br/><br/>Yesiree, pretty amazing stuff this Watanabe-san is, hmmm? Oh, but wait, that's nothing yet...there's a reason I'm calling him Watanabe-san...he is 100% Japanese, has always lived in Japan, and this is his first English-speaking role. He had to apologize ahead of time when he walked into a press conference because his English isn't that good yet...and this is AFTER he made the movie!<br/><br/>So now that you KNOW, go back and see the movie a second time. During EVERY one of his quotes of wisdom given in that musically poetic voice, or EVERY razor-sharp taunt at Nathan Algren, you sit there and try to convince yourself that the Ken in these videos is the same guy that delivers those important lines with such perflect inflection--in English!<br/><br/>Of course acting is so much more than speaking...it's the precise raising of an eyebrow, the sharp and skeptic gaze, the royal carriage, the small gesture, the smirk that almost but never quite appears. Ken Watanabe is the master at all of these, and then some. He's simply larger-than-life, and how he does it is a mystery. I am sure he will be considered a master of the art, in both theatre and film, for decades and decades.<br/><br/>
THE MOVIE ""The Last Samurai"" is a breath-stealing, enthralling epic, humorous at times and deft in the sensitive portrayals of its well-drawn characters--often without the aid of dialogue. Set mostly in rural Japan during the Meiji Restoration, it attempts, and mostly succeeds, to pack the stories of several complex, historical figures into one unified drama through fictional characters inspired by real Japanese people.<br/><br/>The story opens with a landscape of etheral beauty, where a Samurai meditates next to a mountiain-top temple. He has a vision of a battle in the fog-shrouded forest, with a roaring white tiger surrounded by his band of warriors. Then we are shifted to post-Revolutionary America, where retired, decorated Army captain Nathan Algren drowns away his guilt in booze, making a profitable but pathetic living as a side-show attraction at Winchester gun sales events.<br/><br/>Nathan is tormented by flashbacks of attacks in which his army killed innocent Indian women and children. A former comrade seeks him out as he has recieved a proposal to work in Japan. They and their former commander are offered an outrageous sum for training new, modern warriors for the routing of some tenacious bands of Samurai who refuse to give up their traditional way of the warrior, especially the feared and crafty Katsumoto. He is loyal to the emperor but believes the man-child is being manipulated by greedy Japanese and foreign businessmen. Nathan allows himself to be talked into the get-rich scheme and off he sails.<br/><br/>Responsible for transforming an army of conscripts, mostly farmers and some former Samurai, into modern-day gun-toting soldiers, Nathan hardly has time to catch a breath before his arrogant superior officer orders the regiment detached to the forest to stop Katsumoto from attacking trains in the countryside. As expected (no spoiler here), the result is a pathetic flaying.<br/><br/>
** SPOILER ALERT! ** Knocked off his horse in battle, Nathan is surrounded by fearsome swordsmen trying to get his life over with for him. He valiantly tries to hold off a whole clutch while they are gaining the advantage. Down from his white steed drops the legendary Katsumoto. He yanks off his mask, openly gaping in amazement at this overwhelmed and outnumbered man who refuses to give up when he is beat. The man is sweeping a sword he ripped from one of the Samurai in wide, defensive arcs. In slow-mo, we see hanging from the sword the flag of the white tiger! At the moment of certain death, Katsumoto orders, ""Stop!"" and the action comes to a grinding halt.<br/><br/>
While witnessing the death of one of the army officers, Nathan the prisoner of war is led away on horseback to be held in a mountain village. Openly hostile and hateful at first, Nathan soon learns not to pre-judge his enemy and that he and Katsumoto have more in common than not. Brief passages of witty dialogue alternate with demoralizing defeats and silent emotional moments as Nathan parries with and learns from the wise Katsumoto, struggles to uphold his pride amongst the exclusionist warriors, learns to speak Japanese and to love the simple way of life, and<br/><br/>
** SPOILER ALERT! ** discovers that his caretaker, Katsumoto's sister Taka, who was widowed by his own hand, deeply resents her swiftly-growing feelings for him. He even valiantly defends Katsumoto, Katsumoto's brave little nephew, and the rest of the family from a deadly Ninja assassination plot!<br/><br/>
Eventually the emperor guarantees safe passage for Katsumoto to return the prisoner to his American comrades, and so they set off for Tokyo. Everything is changing...Samurai are stripped of their titles, police officers cut off boys' top-knots, and the wearing of swords is forbidden. After Nathan takes his leave, Katsumoto stubbornly walks in to attend a council meeting with the emperor. The council demands he give up his sword.<br/><br/>
** SPOILER ALERT! ** Katsumoto offers to take his own life, but the emperor won't speak directly to him. Refusing to lay down his sword, he is placed under house arrest at his Tokyo home, led to a special ritual room, and offered a knife for ritual suicide in order to regain his honor, because he has refused to follow the emperor's mandates.<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, Algren is preparing for his journey home, refusing to stay and ""kill japos"" to make more money. He resolutely refuses to be drawn into an argument with his former officer about his supposed ""hate"" of his own kind.<br/><br/>
** SPOILER ALERT! ** But then Nathan seems to have a sudden inuition that something terrible is going to happen, or he mentally yanks himself up, and determines to spring Katsumoto. Goverment spies have been keeping an eye on him, however, and he is cornered by a troupe of Ninja assassins. He puts himself in the state of ""no mind"" and visualization, armed only with his fists, and manages to steal two swords and efficiently dispenses with the enemy. With the help of the goofy foreign photographer, an expert in all things Japanese who had accompanied the Americans in Tokyo and the emperor's palace upon their initial arrival, and several other men, he hatches and carries out a crazy plot to gain entrance to Katsumoto's Tokyo estate and spring him from containment. Katsumoto's brave young son dies in the battle, but the rescue is a success. They retreat back to the village, but Katsomoto has no heir of his own or of his son's to pass the village on to (land is passed through ranks of Samurai only).<br/><br/>
During their dejected retreat, Katsumoto considers taking his own life to avoid dishonor in defeat in his quest to preserve the old way of life, but Nathan talks him out of it. For once, he teaches Katsumoto his own philosophy about destiny and death. ""We will make the emperor hear you,"" he says.<br/><br/>Back at the village, as vast army regiments gather below in preparation for the rout of the last Samurai, Katsumoto and Nathan work out their strategy. Though the future of the Samurai is, in this movie as in real life, easy to portend, they vow to make it as difficult as they possibly can and not give up until the end.<br/><br/>The ONLY ""weakness"" in the movie, and it is MINOR (hey, we already knew the fate of the Samurai before we ever stepped foot in the theater) is the screenwriter's soft attempt to give the outcome some meaning above and beyond the tragic understanding which we have already accepted, and which he thinks we are not mature enough to handle and still find the many truths. I will not post any ""spoiler"" details on this.<br/><br/>But along with the admirable values of honor, duty, loyalty, compassion and service to family, there is a deeper tenet not associated with the Samurai ""Bushido"". We capture it fully only when faced with grim reality. A man said to me, when I was leaving the movie for the first time, ""It sure renews your belief in faith, doesn't it?"" Yes, it does, and the tragedy of the Samurai does not have to be candy-coated for me to come away with a great sense of faith. In truth, people walk out of this film with an uplifting of spirits in the face of death, which was exactly Ken Watanabe's hope for lucky moviegoers around the world."

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>The year is 1876.Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a disillusioned confederate soldier who's taken to the bottle and is haunted by nightmarish flashbacks of the atrocities he was forced to commit under the command of the ruthless Colnell Bagley (Tony Goldwyn).However,Bagley has a new proposition.Unscrupulous Japanese railroad contractor Omura (Masato Harada) wants him to train the army of Emporor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) to lead a rebellion against the army of the samurai who are opposing the development of his latest contract.However,time is money and,with the army unproperly trained,Omura orders them in to battle where they unsurprisingly lose their confidence and are effortlessly defeated by the well-trained,hardened samurai warriors.Nathan,however,is spared,the commanding samurai officer obviously impressed with his fighting ability,and taken to the land of the samurai,under the command of Emporor Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe).Over the course of the next year,he discovers them to be the more fair-practicing group of people and,after becoming accustomed to their mannerisms and practices,the westerner gradually blends in with them and leads them to victory against the real oppressors.<br/><br/>I had the same reservations with The Last Samurai that I seem to have with any film headbilling Tom Cruise.My cousin's rather fond of him,but I always seemed to regard him as more of a 'movie star' as opposed to a totally convincing 'actor.'In this instance,however,my reservations proved to be rather unfounded,as he carries the film fairly well.True,he gets a little carried away with himself here and there,but generally speaking,he does the business and does it well.Of the supporting cast,it's as encouraging as ever to see two British players in a major Hollywood production,in the shape of Billy Connolly as Zebulon Gant,a former comrade of Nathan's who encourages him to take up on Omura's offer and Timothy Spall,as his eccentric contact in Japan,my namesake,Mr Graham.All the Japanese actors,Watanabe,Harada,Nakamura,are perfectly fine too.<br/><br/>I noticed that the first half of the film seemed to take itself rather too seriously,however,it seemed to telepathically sense this and threw in plenty of humour and light relief in the middle and the second part.The story is well developed and covers all the aspects it is attempting to explore,however,it was billed as an action movie,and spends considerably more time delving around in sappy melo-drama as opposed to satisfying the expectations of what the vast majority of the audience payed for.The action/battle scenes,spectacular though they are,are rather few and far between.Perhaps the movie was about quarter-of-an-hour too long,but all the same...<br/><br/>Speaking of the battle scenes,this is where the movie really comes alive,in every sense of the word.It's not just how epic and exciting they themselves are,it's all the scenes associated with them as well,adding untold depth to men we only expected to see being trained and fighting in the fields.To wit,a scene where Nathan orders a young Japanese soldier to shoot him before he shoots him,in order to give him an impression of what a merciless killer he will need to be in order to survive the battlefield.Or how the soldiers,former peasants who've never fought in a battle before in their lives,lose their nerve as the samurai army emerge in to battle.<br/><br/>There's some fine dialogue on offer too,evenly distributed throughout the film from beginning to end,and carrying the script wonderfully,only to wind up with a sappy,Hollywood-ised ending that will have you doing a little bit of laughing and a little bit of chringing with it's underlying corniness.Still,if you're looking for a fun night out,it's great fun and a film you can only truly appreciate at the cinema anyway.***"

","I loved this movie because it shows what we've lost.  I'm not of any asian descent, purely mutt American, but I can relate to this movie.  It calls to something within me that is so basic, so simple.  We've lost the idea of Honor and how to simply live with one another as human beings.  I watched an episode of the History channel yesterday about The Last Samurai and Tom Cruise said this or something cose to it...so it's not a verbatum quote, ""The Samurai, the lifestyle, begged us to remember that man was more than just a body, he was a spiritual creature too.""  There is such simplicity in that way of life and yet it was complicated too.  It's so hard to describe the feeling within thinking about how this movie effected me.  It gave birth to a craving, a yearning for what was embodied within the movie.  Honor, Loyalty, Duty, Purpose, Harmony, Respect.  I admit that both times I saw the movie...I cried.  I can even cry now for what was lost.  To see such courageous men knowingly give up their lives for something they believed in, something that was good and should not have left this world.  So many times we like to say that we have honor.  Personally, I feel that we delude ourselves.  The ideal of Honor has become twisted and self-serving.  It's not an easy thing, but with it, true honor, life become simpler.  One other thing that stayed with me from this movie...""Life in every breath.""  Too often we become drowned in simply trying to survive in this world.  We should all remember this, ""A life spent looking for the perfect blossom...is not a life wasted."""

","Although I may appear biased, I am a sucker for a film which talks about a certain code of ethics -especially if its a japanese one! This film is not the best of its kind, and neither the writer nor the director could fully convey the way of the japanese people. I'm not an expert but I've seen my share of japanese films (and some chinese and korean and I don't mean action movies). I would say that this film is probably one of the closest American films that could grasp -if any at all, the culture of a foreign nation. I would also like to state for the record that the american cinema has been pretty weak for about 5 years now and this is probably one of the few films that I liked since that time (I don't even have to start and mention the awfull fashions of sequels and remakes of old films).<br/><br/>I couldn't find a better or worse person than Tom Cruize to take the role of Captain Nathan Algren. His facial feature are excellent for the role but his integrity as an actor I find low (except for his roles in ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Rain Man""). This made me lose some of the seriousness I would have found in his role were it not him playing it. Still, I have to salute Tom for his decision in taking this role -its a good one. People might say that this film tried to convey more than its worth and some may even say that tries to force out a tear or two but I would have to say that although part of that is correct, I couldn't help but think that this film is the first I've seen which could touch the japanese people so close and that is the truth. Any way I really liked the film and i would recommend it to anyone who loves war movies that are filled with sacrifce and honor."
"jaywolfenstien","Null","1","2","2 February 2004"," Zwick, Cinematic master of Warfare
","Admittingly, I've never followed Edward Zwick's career too closely despite the fact that I adore one of his previous films, Glory, and found the Siege, while a lesser result, still worth the rental price.<br/><br/>I had my doubts about this film.  From the previews, I really didn't care to see it.  I mean, Tom Cruise in a world with Samurai?  Yeah, right.  I went into this expecting to not like it solely for that, and as the movie started it got worse Â– the beginning felt so prepackaged, so typical, so not-like what I'd expect from Zwick.  <br/><br/>Maybe Zwick wanted to get the obligatory setup out of the way, because the beginning does feel obligatory; however, fifteen minutes into the film, I felt I was getting to the story Zwick wanted me to see.  From then on, the film was a complete delight, and I came out with a new favorite performance for Cruise.  And now I'm convinced that even after a decade, Edward Zwick can still topple the efforts of Terrence Malick, John Woo, Michael Bay, and rival those of Spielberg in making a great war film.  I can't say that I'd quite place him in league with Schaffner, though . . . the tiny nit-picky details prevent that, but Zwick's pretty damn close.<br/><br/>Like Schaffner's Patton, Last Samurai is about men and not their wars (definite plus).  It explores these people--their strengths, weaknesses, their problems--and it does not just `tell us about it' (ie, Thin Red Line.) All the psychological and philosophical points Malick's film tried to get at, Zwick nails.  Thin Red Line spent enough time with each character to let them ask stupid redundant questions that are so primitive we stop caring about the question and the guy asking or we just assume it's tapping into a deep metaphorical basis to give meaning to our lowly lives.  Zwick is better than that.  Zwick not only asks superior, more meaningful, questions, but he sticks around so we know these are genuine issues the characters face, then Zwick is bold enough to answer those proposed questions.  When the film closes he leaves the audience to ponder those answers.  My only gripe in this regard is that towards the end of the film Zwick goes a little overboard answering.  Like I've said in many reviews - Zwick, you know you have an intelligent audience.  You're better than this over-explanatory Hollywood stuff.    <br/><br/>In my mind, the real strength of Last Samurai lay in its masterful on-screen direction compliments of Zwick, the beautiful lighting and cinematography provided by John Toll, and seamless editing by Rosenblum & Dubois . . . and of course, Zimmer combining Eastern and Western instrumentation to create a very intriguing, and in many instances, very original score.  Zwick has a style all of its own in directing large scale action, and I can't quite place my finger on how to describe it.  It's kind of a step back to old-school filmmaking, a step away from the Wachowski brothers and Michael Bay's MTV music-video epileptic cuts.  And somehow, Zwick's style maintains a high level of freshness, ingenuity, and artistic flair . . . his action is crisp and clear, communicates actions and relative geometry as to lose the audience and it does more than that.  In other words, it's pure Edward Zwick magic.    <br/><br/>Watching Zwick's masterfully-composed imagery unfold under the orchestral fanfare of Hans Zimmer on the big screen made me long to experienced the Zwick/Horner film Glory and its magnificent charging Fort Wagner scene this same way."

For me an very good film 8.5/10 with an excellent performance, Cruise 10/10.<br/><br/>This film exceeded my expectations big time! I thought Tom Cruise, hmm, 'mission impossible' & 'topgun'. Not my type of film. However in this film you will see Tom Cruise turn from a 'big name pretty boy movie star' to an excellent actor."

"playingkarrde","Null","1","2","14 January 2004"," An uninspired Tom Cruise vehicle
","Having looked forward to The Last Samurai for over a year I can't help feeling a little disappointed with a film that essentially allowed Cruise to do his usual character just in a period setting.<br/><br/>I have to say, I am really finding it hard to watch Tom Cruise these days. His range of characters has been extremely poor, especially when you compare him to other current Hollywood giants such as Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>The story is as cliched as one could expect from a Hollywood adaption of an historical moment in Japanese history and the script follows suit. For anyone who has any interest in Japanese history and indeed Samurai, they will have probably read Shogun by James Clavell and will no doubt see all the similarities that are evidently present. I mean, lets face it, there was really no need to have the ninja attack on the village.<br/><br/>
The shining star of the movie was no doubt brooding Ken Watanabe who truly made the movie what it is. Without his performance it really could have been a whole lot worse. Cruise gives way his screentime admirably here and allows Watanabe to really give his best performance.<br/><br/>Costume design and cinematography were both equally stunning and despite being a Hollywood film, a lot of respect was given to the ideals of the Samurai, which is reassuring.<br/><br/>For anyone who finds this as their first taste of Samurai entertainment I emplore you to seek out real quality movies, especially Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Sanjuro, Ran and Kagemusha to name but a few.<br/><br/>
Still, an enjoyable film for all and gives Samurai lovers such as myself enough to feast on, but unfortunately gives us Tom Cruise as well. Still well worth watching though."

"marzolian","8","1","2","24 January 2004"," Very well done, enjoyable despite echoing scenes and characters from other films
","I really enjoyed this movie. It's one of Tom Cruise's best, my favorite since Magnolia and Rainman. Its original setting (for us in the USA, that is) makes me wonder more about the history of Japan, and how it changed from a rural to a modern industrial society.<br/><br/>I didn't quite get lost in it, hoping that it wouldn't end as I have done while seeing other epic films. At times, the story strains at my willingness to suspend my disbelief, but each time it backed off just before it ""jumped the shark"". I'm very curious to learn what Japanese audiences will think of it and several unrealistic scenes.<br/><br/>The actors complement each other and there are very few scenes where the camera lingers too long on them. Most of the time, I want to see and hear more from these characters.<br/><br/>But so many parts of it reminded me of other films, books, even TV shows. Can you say ""derivative""? Maybe I'm just confused because I'm getting older but here's how I remember the story:<br/><br/>(a few spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Our hero Lt. John Dunbar (""Dances with Wolves"") / Capt. Nathan Algren goes west, accompanied by an irreverent companion who doesn't last long enough in the film. Rhett Butler (""Gone With the Wind"") / Algren plans to get rich as a mercenary in the Civil War, paid by modern-thinking Japanese business interests (""Rising Sun""), to fight Indians / Japanese rebels. During a battle, Inman (""Cold Mountain"") / Algren suffers multiple injuries that should have killed him, but keeps on going through the winter snow and is eventually nursed back to health by a woman.<br/><br/>As Blackthorne (""Shogun"") / Anjin-san (""Shogun"") / Algren recovers, he is held prisoner in a house with a Japanese family who thinks that he is a stinking unmannered barbarian. But Jack Elliot (""Mr. Baseball"") / Algren learns to appreciate Japanese culture, as he wisecracks about guys in dresses (""Tootsie""). Then Danny Larusso (""Karate Kid"") / Algren learns Asian fighting techniques and becomes an adviser to the honorable Indian / Samurai leader in a civil war in Japan, while having flashbacks to his Vietnam / Indian fighting days when he killed civilians (""Blue Thunder"") alongside the arrogant Gen. Custer (""Little Big Man""). He fights against black-suited Ninjas (Tekken, the martial arts video game, and ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"").<br/><br/>Finally, in the climactic battle, William Wallace (""Braveheart"") / Algren helps lead the Indians / Scottish / Samurai into battle against the U.S. Cavalry / English / Japanese army, against impossible odds, arrows raining down upon the bad guys. (""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Braveheart"" again, probably a few dozen guys in costume and the rest added using computer effects.)<br/><br/>Other viewers can probably pick out even more films that ""echo"" or reverberate in this one. There is even an allusion to a movie that should be made one day; about the military advisers who are supposed to be non-combatants, sent by the USA to Vietnam and other locations around the world to put down the rebels.<br/><br/>Even while distracted by all these other movies, I really did enjoy the film, and I look forward to watching it again in a few years.<br/><br/>Steven"

"lanrock","Null","1","2","13 January 2004"," Tom Cruise Vanity Project -- ouch!
","'The Last Samurai' I found to be a very distasteful experience.  Somehow I thought it was based on a bestseller.  So I was expecting the bestseller's author to have done the historical research and, by turn, this would have been transferred to the movie.  No such luck.  News flash!  This movie makes up its own history.  This movie is all about creating a vanity project for Tom Cruise.  The cinematography is fantastic, the costume design is gorgeous, the battle scenes brilliantly staged.  But, all of this is what makes the film so frustrating.  It's just all so unbelievable!  Possible spoiler:  The final battle sequences especially are just so over the top, it's embarrassing.  Also, I find this movie inherently racist.  The idea that the Tom Cruise character, a Western white man, could have been such a catalyst in a samurai's life in such a short time - `the white man comes to save the day', oh, yeccch!  The Japanese are a uniquely xenophobic culture and quite convinced of their own superiority, thank you very much! Excuse me, but GM is getting its ass kicked by Toyota!  'The Last Samurai' I find to be such repugnant trash.  With the cast and crew and high production values, I was expecting just so much more.  (Aside:  the next time you see a movie produced by Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner - run in the opposite direction!)"

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","2","11 January 2004"," Honor in Life and Death
","In a pivotal scene in ""The Last Samurai"" a key character says ""It's my time..."". That captures Bushido (The Way of the Samurai) in Edward Zwick and Tom Cruise's ""The Last Samurai"": About honor and choosing the path of one's life. Rarely has a major motion picture done so, in such a moving and inspiring way. Edward Zwick directs a wonderful screenplay by John Logan, Zwick, and Marshall Herskovitz. Zwick masterfully weaves a story about a culture, Bushido that values honor, courage, compassion, and a man's life being complete and at peace. Regarding destiny, Tom Cruise's Captain Nate Algren says ""...No... But I think a man cannot know his destiny. He can only do what he can, until his destiny is revealed."" Zwick balances Bushido as ""Life in every breath..."" with LIVING with honor. Tom Cruise gives perhaps his best performance as Nate Algren, the U.S. Captain who becomes samurai.<br/><br/>It is 1876, and Capt. Algren (Cruise) is a drunk, burnt out calvary war hero who is a spokesman for Winchester rifles at amusement shows. He is recruited by his former commander Col. Bagley (a very slick Tony Goldwyn) and a Japanese businessman Omura (played with great duplicity by Masato Harada) to train the Japan Emperor's Army in modern warfare to defeat the Emperor's former adviser and Sensei, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), who is samurai. Though Bagley betrayed Algren in the past, he accepts the post. According Algren (Cruise) killing ""tribal"" leaders is his only gift. Algren though broken, demonstrates the samurai spirit. Contrary to Algren's advice an unprepared Imperial Army engages Katsumoto's army, and are defeated. Algren fights valiantly, but is captured.<br/><br/>This is where the amazing story telling begins. Katsumoto wishes to learn about his enemy, Algren. In a strange twist of fate, he has his sister, Taka (Koyuki), care for Algren-- her ""karma"". There is more to this (see the movie). In Katsmoto's village Algren trains in the way of the samurai. Zwick illustrates this eloquently. He does not romanticize the samurai, rather paints a complete picture. The samurai would kill his enemy or take his own life in dishonor when commanded. Along with the rigorous martial arts training, Zwick shows the samurai meditating (Shinto and Zen), composing poetry (haiku), in tea ceremony, and practicing calligraphy. Bushido is a dichotomy. I also got an insight into my own Japanese culture that everything is below the surface. During a bokken (wooden sword) training scene with Algren and Katsmoto's second Ujio ( masterful martial artist, Hiroyuki Sanada), he learns one of the keys of mastery-- mu-shin (""no mind""). Cruise performs the martial arts sequences expertly. He intensely trained in Aikido and Iaido-- signatured in his posture and gate wearing the hakama and kimono. All the fight scenes are exquisite. World class martial artists are involved in ""Samurai"".<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe is a noble and commanding presence as Katsumoto. He is truly Samurai. He is a great actor-- he is just being. His transformation from Algren's enemy to partner is key to the story. Whether Cruise's Algren fights beside Watanabe's Katsumoto in an assassination attempt or in their personal conversations, their bond embodies the respect of two strong, smart men, who have seen too much war and death. Their relationship is poignant and inspiring. After the winter Algren returns to Kyoto and to the Emperor's Army, but his heart and soul are samurai. Soon he must choose his loyalty as a matter of honor. In a great scene Taka explains to Algren that her son, Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu), is a child who does not understand Bushido, and is afraid of losing Algren. Speaking in Japanese Algren tells Higen that his always afraid in war. It is the paradox of the honor conversation: living honorably is as important as dying honorably.<br/><br/>The Japanese cast is incredible. Koyuki as Taka is amazing and stunningly beautiful. She is the traditional Japanese woman who downplays her strength and wisdom. Yet, she is the emotional anchor of ""Samurai"". Shin Koyamada as Nobutada (Katsumoto's son) is brash with a great warrior spirit. Sosuke Ikematsu is touching as Taka's young son growing up samurai.<br/><br/>This is Tom Cruise's best performance. Aside from mastering the peripheral elements like martial arts and speaking Japanese, his performance as Nate Algren is captivating. It is not formula. The transformation from burn out war hero to the honorable leader of men is moving. You see it in the actor's eyes, and hear it in his voice as Algren begins to care about and honor people, and himself. Algren's path to be a peace with himself is the most human and noble of all endeavors. Cruise does it right.<br/><br/>Katsumoto says at one point in the movie that the Samurai are no longer necessary. Algren says what could be more necessary than honor, courage, and compassion? Zwick and Cruise remind us of this, from a culture long gone, in a very special movie. We honor them for doing so."

I look at pictures and watch online video interviews and cannot reconcile his demeanor with the fierce vitality of the character he portrays. Tom Cruise also does a terrific job (his best role), but he is not afraid of being cast alongside the best.<br/><br/>If there is a bit of historical background to the demise of the Shogun and the Samurai that is missing and would make the major theme of the movie stand out even clearer, this weakness is hugely overcome by the devotion of all the principals (the actors, director, cast and others) to the importance of the Menji reformation and the doom it spelled for tragic hereos such as Saigo Takamori (the inspiration for ""Katsumodo"").<br/><br/>The authenticity of the life and culture of the Samurai is breathtaking. Most astounding is the ability of all the actors in filling every moment, every word, every silent look with the exact meaning contributing to their characters and the immensely important times in which their characters lived. It is quite telling when you can see a movie on different nights, and every giggle and titter from the audience comes at the same place, no matter how subtle the nuance of humor the characters are portraying.<br/><br/>Support the professionals who have brought you this galvanizing story of epic proportions...GO OUT AND SEE THE MOVIE!

"kwongers","10","1","2","19 January 2004"," one of the most moving movies of 2003
","I love this movie.  It's a brilliant, well-made, moving epic.  The movie focuses on a disgraced man, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who has nightmares about being ordered to kill innocent American Indians.  He is enlisted to help train the `modern' Japanese army to fight against the samurai, who are in rebellion.  In the time he spends with the samurai, learning from them, he learns something about honor and ultimately, about himself. <br/><br/>
The storyline is fantastic, merging great action scenes with a moving story about a man's journey to find his honor.  The battle scenes are convincing and exciting; one battle scene involving a surprise attack on the samurai had my heart going.  Hans Zimmer's music is bold and original; sometimes the music alone brought me to tears.  I haven't heard too much of his work before (it's a travesty, I know!) but I love his work here. <br/><br/>
The acting is top-rate.  Tom Cruise is superb as Nathan Algren, embodying the conflict, pain, anguish, and honor of his character.  We feel his pain and understand why he eventually decides to fight with the samurai.  (His performance is one of my favorites all yearÂ…he's a deserving contender for that Golden Globe.)  And Ken Watanabe is phenomenal as Katsumoto, the leader of the samurai.  He plays Katsumoto with a lot of grace and nobility, and I appreciated that.  Watanabe is nominated for a supporting actor Golden Globe and SAG award and he totally deserves both of them.  His portrayal of Katsumoto is bold, funny, and heartbreaking.   Undeniably one of my favorite movies of the year and the one that touched my heart the most, `The Last Samurai' deserves many, many awards.  It made me laugh, cry (a lot), and truly understand honor.  (Props also to Tom Cruise and Koyuki (Taka) for creating one of the sexiest moments in the movies this year - without the actual sex.)  10/10"

While 'The Last Samurai' is well photographed and contains good performances. Kurosawa's film deals with simular themes and issues in a more dramatic way. The final moments of 'Seven Samurai' make the pretty much the same statement I think 'The Last Samurai' was attempting to make through-out the entire movie. I was involved and intrigued by Kurosawa's film and simply wasn't by Mr. Cruise's.

"Okonh0wp","Null","1","2","15 January 2004"," very underrated movie, go watch
","Being released alongside so many other great war epics, The Last Samurai probably won't get the recognition it deserves, but that should not detract from its achievements. Set in 1870s Japan, this is an epic set around a washed-up Civil War veteran played by Tom Cruise. Whether you think he's too much of a pretty-boy or not, Cruise can still create magic on screen, even if he plays the same kind of guy over and over. To refresh your memory, Cruise starts his films (Rain Man, Jerry MaGuire, etc) as an arrogant jerk before meeting an inspirational figure, that leads him to a journey of self-discovery where he changes himself and turns into a true hero. This movie is the same, but within the context of a war epic, Cruise is just what the doctor ordered, and just as Hoffman and Cuba Gooding Jr did exemplary work alongside him, Cruise's brings out the best in costar Ken Wattanbe, who had an extroadinary presence, in an already emotionally stirring relationship. The story is beautifully told and visually beautifully portrayed."
"clydestuff","10","1","2","13 January 2004"," Zwick, Cruise, Ken Watanabe and John Toll Give us an incredible experience
","Edward Zwick, the director who gave us the film Glory back in 1989, has in my opinion not quite been able to live up to his capabilities since  that film.  Films like Courage Under Fire and Legends of the Fall were good films but severely flawed at times.  Finally, as director of The Last Samurai, he has given us the film we've been waiting for from him for over ten long years.  <br/><br/>Zwick along with writers John Logan and Marshall Herkovitz, have given us two extremely complex characters. Tom Cruise portrays Nathan Algren and Ken Watanabe portrays his adversary Katsumoto.  Cruise is one of those actors that seems never to get the credit that he deserves.  It is the same bit of silly business applied to Paul Newman for many years. His looks and stardom seemed to have deterred and distracted some film goers and critics from understanding the depth of his acting prowess for years. Much of the same can be said when some critics write now about Cruise.  With films on his resume such as Minority Reports, Vanilla Sky, Jerry Maguire and Born on the Fourth of July, Cruise has shown himself to be consistently an actor who is willing to not only take chances but to bring depth to all his roles.  As Nathan Algren he continues in that mold.  Algren is a man tormented by yet resigned to his profession.  He is continually haunted by visions of Indian women and children being slaughtered, yet we are never sure if he feels any particular remorse.  He uses alcohol to numb himself against the demons he is carrying yet he again sells his services as a mercenary to a Japanese country that is quickly modernizing itself.  His job is to help arm and train a Japanese army and assist them in wiping out a Samurai uprising.  In essence, the same thing he has always done and seems resigned to do till he meets his end.<br/><br/>The leader of the Samurai is Katsumoto.  He is willing to fight to the death to uphold the traditions of the life he knows much in the same way the American Indians fought.  He fights for the emperor yet it is the emperor who will send an army out to destroy Katsumoto and his warriors.  When Algren is forced to lead his rag tag army into battle against the Samurai before they are obviously ready, his men are quickly defeated.  Algren, however, continues to battle to the very end.  Just before Algren is ready to be killed, Katsumoto impressed by the fierceness with which Algren fights, instead takes him prisoner so that he may understand his enemy.<br/><br/>As they learn about each other, we too begin to understand the complexity of these two men and the paths they have chosen.   Ken Watanabe brings Katsumoto to life with such precision and depth, he is able to give us not only an understanding of the Samurai, but makes us admire a world totally different from our own and to sympathize with his cause. <br/><br/>
There is a love story in this film, but unlike most films it is played out beneath the surface.  We know it is there but it is never directly spoken of and simmers continually beneath the surface. Many a director would not have been able to resist the temptation to play this out as a full blown romance, but Zwick admirably keeps things in check thanks in large part to Koyuki. Koyuki plays Taka, in such a reserved quiet performance that we at no time can doubt her sincerity.  There are issues between Algren and Taka, but you'll have to see the film as I'm not one to give away every little plot development.<br/><br/>If one wanted to take a lesson in how to stage and film a battle sequence Zwick gives it here.  Many battles in film today are stage and film with the emphasis being on confusion.  Zwick goes in the other direction and it pays great dividends.  John Toll, above all else, with New Zealand passing for Japan, has photographed a world of richness, beauty and grace that alone is worth the price of a movie ticket.<br/><br/>If you are one of the many film goers who found it necessary to rush out to see Return of the King and having done that are looking for something else to view during the rest of the winter, you can't go wrong with this film.  I highly highly recommend it.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","Many the raters I would guess are either a bit young or American, possibly giving this movie a lower grade than it deserves.

The aggressive American imperialist approach is well depicted and, despite the fact that the movie takes places a 150 years ago, the resemblence to a modern day leaders of some Western or so called ""civilized"" nations is stunning and offers an interesting spin on modern political affairs that we are all too aware of.<br/><br/>The actors, music, direction and production in general will most likely harvest a great deal of the Oscars this year.

"amymarie1967","Null","1","2","30 December 2003"," One must look deeper into this film
","I saw THE LAST SAMURAI Christmas day, after debating whether it was worth going to see, or waiting for it to come on video. I was amazed to see a full theater.  The audience was varied, from young teens to grandparents. Interesting to note, I was sitting by the aisle and did not see one person get up during this entire film.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I went in expecting to see a ""war"" film.  What shocked me though, was the depth of the character development.  Yes, the fight scenes were amazingly well choreographed.  And as someone who doesn't usually like fight/battle scenes,  often because of the jumpy camera work, I was thrilled to find these easy to follow with clean camera work, and old fashioned acting.<br/><br/>However, the deeper parts of this film, which have made this one of the best films of the year, are the metaphors.  Throughout the movie, there are many deeper themes than fighting or honor.  The metaphor of finding the perfect blossom, then actually seeing it.  The purging of ones demons by finding something to believe in again.  The simple pleasure of a child's smile. Or the simple ""push yourself harder, find it within"" theme running through this movie.<br/><br/>One scene which I must comment on, as it is a credit to director Zwick is the scene where Cruise has the battle armor put on by Taka (played by Koyuki).  I found this scene to be very erotic, but in a subtle, classy way. Not often is this kind of scene pulled off in the movies with such taste, and  with the certainity that something deeper is happening here. Definately one of the most memorable scenes I have seen recently.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, while THE LAST SAMURAI may not be historically accurate, but there is a depth to the characters, and many deeper meanings that can be appreciated.  If you can focus on them, this movie will certainly rank up there as one of the best you have seen.  If you are looking for a war movie, it will be good, but a little on the slow side.<br/><br/>I rated this a 9.2 out of 10"

However, it's also hard to dismiss this movie because of this Hollywood fluff.  The costumes, music, acting, etc. are simply awesome and breathtaking.

"Iggybone","10","1","2","28 December 2003"," Epic Masterpiece
","There is a concept floating around that ""The Last Samurai"" is simplistic and formulaic. Could there be more of a grotesque distortion of the truth? This movie is, in every way, flawless. Note Tom Cruise's acting performance. He fits the role perfectly, and the two years he spent in preparation show in his skill with the sword, ease in Japanese speech, and feel of character. He, along with Ken Watanabe, form a one-two punch that, in my humble opinion, are prime for Academy Awards.<br/><br/>The Cinematography in the movie is simply breathtaking. The camera work managed to capture some of the most eye-appealing scenes in recent movie history. Even if one is not a fan of the acting, or the plot, for that matter, it is a heinous injustice to deride the movie completely. Hans Zimmer comes in and delivers a fantastic performance in musical score, which only serves to augment the tone of the movie. Now, onto the plot Note: Some MILD SPOILERS may follow. For those who disagree with the fact that Cruise has decided to fight for the samurai, I pose this question: What do you truly expect? Cruise plays a disgruntled AMERICAN civil war hero. Yes. American. He makes this point a few times in the movie, therefore, he is not TRYING to be Japanese. He is merely an onlooker who finds beauty in an otherwise snubbed environment. The progression of story follows an ideal pattern. That does not qualify for the slander of ""formulaic."" It simply progresses the way a movie OUGHT to progress, and is, therefore, almost too perfect for its own good.<br/><br/>Granted, some of the lines may be hackneyed, but it was nothing that truly detracted from the enjoyability of the movie. For those who carp and nitpick the inaccuracies of this movie, realize that it is Fictional Drama...and in that realm, ""The Last Samurai"" has no superior, or equal for that matter.<br/><br/>Practically Flawless<br/><br/>10/10"

"mjl1966","8","1","2","26 December 2003"," Epic fable
","The Last Samurai is a poetic story about redemption, honor, love and the inevitable death of all things.  Ed Zwick weaves a simple tale against the romanticized backdrop of late 19th century Japan when the last vestiges of feudal Japan, and its ancient culture, slip away in the face of Western modernization.<br/><br/>The story begins with Capt. Nathan Algren, a cynical whiskey-soaked veteran of the plains wars hawking Winchester rifles to an ignorant audience. The depiction of Western society is vilified to the point of caricature in this film, which I'm not sure was necessary, as the prose of the Samurai culture sings well enough on its own.<br/><br/>We soon learn through various flashbacks that Algren is a soldier who has lost faith in himself and his country but still retains the passionate spirit of a formidable warrior.  Spiritually, he is quite dressed up with no place to go.<br/><br/>When he is offered a job as a mercenary to train Japanese Imperial troops, he is thrust into circumstances which forge a destiny that finally fulfills who he really is: a warrior who needs something worthy of fighting for. Though duty may call us to sell our soul, we may yet redeem ourselves if but we find the good fight.  Honor best serves that which is honorable, or, perhaps, that which we genuinely love.  These things may be enough to define a life of purpose.<br/><br/>The storyline here is not all that clever and is in most respects, quite predictable.  It is the journey of Algren's character within the framework of this yarn that is most compelling and is played to a T by Cruise.<br/><br/>
This is a film that is definitely worth seeing.  Though the plot is a touch thin on the ground, the writing is superb, with moral and spiritual questions explored in a thoughtful manner.  The production is mesmerizing and Cruise is well supported by a solid ensemble well directed by Ed Zwick."

This movie is Tom Cruises' Ying for his Yang.  I loved this movie because of its depth and complexity during selected scenes.  For example, the scenes where no lines were spoken but so much is implied by just the right eye contact between actors.  It's revolutionary in a comparable way as to the movie ""Castaway"" when it had no spoken lines for that 15 min stretch (but without the 15 min wait.)  This movie is so good that I'll pay for you to view it and I'll pay you another $20 if you don't like it completely!

"imxo","Null","1","2","1 January 2004"," Cowboys and Indians a la Japonnaise
","I had earlier decided to give The Last Samurai a pass, inasmuch as I just couldn't imagine baby-faced Tom Cruise as a Samurai.  However, after reading some reviews on these pages which indicated that the movie was not at all bad, I changed my mind and went to see it.  I should have stuck with my original plan.<br/><br/>For all the beauty of the scenery, this movie is nothing but a rehash of the old cowboys and Indians formula:  Enlightened blue-eyed white man savem backward brown-skinned - but noble - natives.  Apparently this movie's makers had seen, and were impressed by, both ""A Man Called Horse"" with Richard Harris and ""Little Big Man"" with Dustin Hoffman.  Unfortunately, this film is not in any way in the same league with those earlier films.  To be more specific:  the dialog was puerile, the characterizations were stereotypical, and the casting was bizarre.  Oh, well, at least none of the Japanese were made to say, ""rots of ruck.""  <br/><br/>I've always like British actor Timothy Spall, especially in the wonderful ""Auf Wiedersehn, Pet"" series, but he's horribly miscast as the British trade representative to Japan.   When he refers to an idea as ""capital"" his pronunciation is enough to make one laugh - but this isn't a comedy.  And speaking of comedy, the great comedian Billy Connolly has a smallish role in this film, but rather than being a Scot he plays an Irishman in the U.S. Cavalry.  So, instead of hearing his delightful Glaswegian accent we are given him putting on an Irish brogue.  Perhaps the director thought that if Billy were to speak with his natural voice he'd steal the whole movie right there and then.  And, despite the good words on these pages, I found actor Ken Watanabe's portrayal of the Last Samurai as believable as I did that of David Carradine playing the monk on the ""Kung Fu"" television series. <br/><br/>
Anyway, not everyone will share my opinion of this film.  I actually heard someone sniffling and blowing her teary nose behind me in the theater, so I guess she was somehow moved by the film.  I was a bit moved, too, so just before they rolled the credits I left my seat in order to be first in line at the loo."
"caspian1978","6","1","2","1 January 2004"," Dances with Samurai
","Even though this is a good movie, it is far from a great movie. An interesting look into another film where a man (from the West) falls into a world (the East) and evolves as the man he once was. A Man Called Horse, Tarzan (to a degree), Dances with Wolves, and now The Last Samurai holds these comparisons. Still, the movie stands on its own. With the relationship between Cruise and his female lead, the movie ends more powerful than other Hollywood endings where Tom Cruise would pick up his woman into his arms and carry her into the sunset. Here, we get the powerful close up of the two characters as we fade to black. Great action sequences and character development. The movie may fall short to some members in the audience. The reason? Not your typical action film and it is not your typical drama neither. Unique and worth a watch, the Last Samurai is one of Tom Crusies better movies in the past few years."
"kgprophet","6","1","2","28 December 2003"," Postcard Fairy tale
","When Edward Zwick made ""Glory"", it was remembered at Oscar time because there were realistic performances that caused the movie to transcend from being merely a period drama or other typical war film.  His latest war drama uses broad brush strokes to depict this era.  Major characters in this film are drawn in a simplistic manner.  While this makes it easy to catch on whom everybody is, it leaves little intrigue.  Most of this film is predictable. However, I have a fascination with Japan, and this film presents many postcard shots of what we would expect Old Japan to look like. Too bad that the film was mostly shot in California, and relies heavily on computer effects.  Some of the effects were not quite there, (a formation of soldiers standing in a field ""jump"" out of place, but nothing that I would complain about).  My biggest problem with this film is the convenient plot points that come about near the end of the movie.  No spoilers, but reality seems to be chucked out the window when it comes to some implausible heroics and romantic notions of political changes of heart.<br/><br/>That being said, I enjoyed this movie, as if it were a classic stage production. Cinematography, production design, costumes, and makeup were very well done.  The cast does a great job portraying their symbolic characters.  The story moves along without plodding, although there were a couple moments near the end that I felt weren't worth the time. <br/><br/>
This movie is not as good as Zwick's ""Glory"".  In fact, it seems as though he needed to borrow one of the most powerful scenes from ""Glory"" to add some spark to this movie.  He plagiarizes himself with a scene where a new recruit tries to load his gun while Cruise fires bullets at him.  Effective as that scene was, it was ""Glory 2"".  The music was superficial, with little ethnic influence.  As good as this film is, it isn't Oscar worthy.<br/><br/>I give this film a 6.5 out of 10."

"TPalmerboys","10","1","2","22 December 2003"," An epic masterpiece?
","The Last Samurai is one of the best constructed epics that I have seen, and the direction was wonderful.<br/><br/>First let's talk about Tom Cruise, a movie with Cruise is an instant box office success but critically Cruise tends to overact.. so how do you combat this?  Carefully prune over the script... overacting is OK when Cruise is drunk, but it is not OK in a touching scene so don't let him speak much... Cruise doesn't have to talk much during action so that is good too; however, people like to see Cruise on camera so show a lot of him BUT use this discretion to keep him from showing off his penchant for overacting and watch the sound because he breathes really loud which can get annoying... in this movie the director knew all this and was able to combat the flaws in Cruise's acting.<br/><br/>Now there were some great actors in this movie like Ken Watanabe (Katsumoto) who was simply stunning (he should be nominated for best Supporting Actor)<br/><br/>So good acting is important to this type of film but the two other important aspects are script and action sequences.<br/><br/>Action sequences are very important because this is a samurai movie but the sequences must be tasteful and endearing because there are in the context of the movie.  Watch a Van Dam movie and its like ""oh ok time for senseless fighting"" just like in a porno its like ""what's your name?  Lets have sex."" In Last Samurai the beautifully choreographed action scenes are always meaningful, for they are meant to reveal the true essence of characters, and in this aspect I don't think I've ever seen a movie in which action so aptly revealed a character.<br/><br/>The script in an epic is very important because it dictates the pace of a movie.  If the script is too fast between action scenes, then the action scenes lose meaning and the movie becomes another crappy film whose sole purpose is to make a profit (i.e. Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Reindeer Gamers, any Van Dam, Seagal, Stallone, or Schwarzenegger movie).  If the script is too slow you may be watching the English Patient or some other god-awful overdone movie that is painful to bear because of tediously long periods of complete inaction. Dialogue and plot is important too because a movie like Legends of the Fall actually manages to pass the previous test but still finds wanting because of well.. a corny plot and some stupid dialogue.. I was cheering with the next guy when Aiden Quinn shot Brad Pitt's would be killers, but it was not a great movie because the plot was way too sweeping.  The Last Samurai is not in a rush to finish but never lingers too long on any scene or any subject and this is the movie's true accomplishment.. you feel fulfilled when the movie ends... good has not completely triumphed (which I am glad for) and somehow you feel like a part of you can walk out of the movie a little better, whether it be braver or with a greater appreciation for life.<br/><br/>This being said there are couple of imperfections, as there are with any movie. 1) the search for the perfect blossom was a metaphysical search the point was not literally finding one 2) there a couple too many long looks between Cruise and Katsumoto;s sister 3) while it treated itself as original, the white man ALWAYS wins.. although in this case it was pretty clear that had to happen.<br/><br/>Unless you truly cannot stand Tom Cruise do not hesitate to see this near masterpiece... for those of you who hate Cruise.. give it a try because there is a remarkably talented surrounding cast"

"wingchild","10","1","2","19 December 2003"," A top notch heroic epic set in Meiji-era Japan
","The story for this film is set just after our Civil War. At the time, Japan had just overthrown the Shogunate and gone back to Imperial rule in a process known as the Meiji Restoration. The Emperor, Meiji, had a vision to bring Japan into modern times; to achieve this he began hiring experts from the world over to give Japan heavy industries, modern architecture, and a current, up-to-date Army. This movie chronicles the fictional events surrounding an American Army Captain, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), and what happens to him on the ancient isles; also what happens to the Samurai as they are rendered classless, and pointless, in the new Meiji Era. (For more details, look up the battles of Chosou and Satsuma sometime.)<br/><br/>
The storyline is fantastic and historically accurate; armor and weapons were up to par with what they had for that era. This movie has *the best swordfighting choreography* I've ever seen anywhere -- ever -- and I look for that kind of thing. Tom Cruise gives a solid performance and is very believable, even if his screen presence feels diminished standing next to someone like Ken Wantanabe, who steals the show with his carefully calculated manner.<br/><br/>The acting is great, the scenes are beautiful, the swordplay fantastic and realistic; this movie is totally worth anyone's time. There is a lot of care taken with respect to historical and cultural accuracy, so if you're a bigtime anime fan or student of japanese culture, you'll pick up a *lot* of details that most people miss (the depth of people's bowing, the honor accorded by someone committing seppuku, or being asked to stand as one's second for the process, etc).<br/><br/>Probably not the best family film, but definitely worth seeing repeatedly."

","The Last Samurai is a beautiful film, and a good story well told.  It has a spiritual element that leaves one better for having seen it.  Mr. Cruise provides a gripping portrayal of Capt. Nathan Algren, a tortured Civil War Veteran who has to regain his honor by some means if he can.<br/><br/>
One may debate, as many have already, whether it is ""History or Hollywood""; I see both.  Whether there be minor points of divergence historically, what do I care?  It is, after all, a work of fiction, and is built on the strength of a cultural context that is well-founded and very well depicted. And while it does not address every side of every issue (a point it has in common with every story ever told), what it does address, it addresses very, very well: the collision between the traditional Samurai ways and the developing Western ways of warfare; and more to the point, the impact of this collision on two diverse military men, their lives and their personal honor.<br/><br/>It shows, of course, a collision between East and West, but really, the underlying split is between materialism and spirituality, between a code of honor and no code, and of technology vs. tradition on the battle-field, and the resulting impact on the characters and societies depicted.<br/><br/>
The characters drew me in and never let me go; the story held together from beginning to end; no holes, no contrivance of dialogue, no falsity of character. Every aspect of the story was tied up well so that I felt very satisfied with the ending.<br/><br/>The scenery was just beautiful. It is obvious that great care was taken with the creation of the settings, so that they were both realistic and aesthetic.<br/><br/>It was, for me, an uplifting tale, and I think in the end, it is a happy one, at least for anyone who has ever had a fall from grace and seeks hope for his own redemption.  And who among us cannot be counted so?<br/><br/>I liked also the balance between action and adventure, on the one hand, and the message of honor and hope on the other.

After finding work training the troops<br/><br/>of Japan he finds himself living among the ranks of the samurai. <br/><br/>The samurai live by a code and their honor and dignity takes<br/><br/>priority over everything else.    Algren comes to respect their ways<br/><br/>and soon starts to see their ideals as a more plausible cause<br/><br/>then the side he has been fighting with since the start.<br/><br/>Now I must admit how skeptical I was entering the movie theatre. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise has not been very impressive lately and Zwick had not<br/><br/>been behind the camera since his fiasco with the awful film ""The<br/><br/>Siege"".  However this was familiar ground for Zwick with such<br/><br/>films as Glory and Courage Under Fire.  So i gave him the benefit<br/><br/>of the doubt and I sat down.<br/><br/>I must say Mr. Cruise did not dissapoint.  He turns in the most<br/><br/>intense and emotional performance he has given since, in my<br/><br/>opinion, Born on the Fourth of July.  He molds a character who we<br/><br/>come to respect and understand despite his crude and often<br/><br/>obnoxious actions.  He slowly transforms from a drunken and<br/><br/>scarred man, into the powerful and charismatic warrior who can<br/><br/>unite the honorable samurai.  The romance between Taka and<br/><br/>Algren is done quite tastefully and we see her slowly come to<br/><br/>realize Algren's remorse for the life he took from her.   Prior to his<br/><br/>capture  he had been in a conflict with the samurai and had killed<br/><br/>her husband just before his capture.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai does what few epics can do.  It stands alone. <br/><br/>The film is intelligent, witty and powerful.  It has relationships<br/><br/>worth watching and battles worth seeing.  Algren and the<br/><br/>charismatic leader of the samurai, Katsumoto, develop a<br/><br/>friendship of respect and understanding.  All i can say about Ken<br/><br/>Watanabe is that hes incredible and he deserves fame near and<br/><br/>far.<br/><br/>Overall the Last Samurai develops a feeling of care and beauty<br/><br/>amidst the gorgeous scenery of Ancient Japan.   I loved the film<br/><br/>and almost everything about, besides the miscast Mr. Connoly,<br/><br/>who did fine anyway.  9/10"
"kurtcallaghan","10","1","2","14 December 2003"," The best picture of the past 5 years!
","I had a pretty good idea of what to expect from this movie, but every scene is done to perfection. I was literally stunned walking out of the theater. Even the romantic subplot, the bane of any decent movie, was in this case spectacular. I would say that I was a mild Cruise fan before this, and a much bigger one afterwards. This is by far his best movie. I would rate Top Gun as his previous best, but don't let that or the military theme confuse you. This movie is nothing at all like Top Gun in any way. It seems to me that the ""cocky, fall, humility, redemption"" theme that was the centerpiece of virtually all Cruise's movie's up to Jerry Maguire has been put out to pasture.<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe was better than magnificent.<br/><br/>I have refused to buy a DVD player, as DVD's are more expensive than VHS, and I resent that given that I believe the manufacturing costs are about the same. When this movie comes out on DVD, I think I will be forced to end my resistance.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"jmama10","10","1","2","14 December 2003"," One of the best movies I've seen in a while
","This was a great movie.  The acting was outstanding, the direction was top of the line, what else is there.  This was a great story, with honor and tradition galore.  Definitely didn't have a Hollywood feel, which is hard to believe in today's day and age.  The cinematography was unmatched.  Just another days work for John Toll...Vanilla Sky, Legends of the Fall, Braveheart, The Thin Red Line, etc etc.  All those have excellent imagery as well.  I give this one a 10/10."
"wil327","10","1","2","15 December 2003"," A thoroughly enjoyable epic.
","The Last Samurai can best be described by the word EPIC. This film follows the journey of a former frontier military hero from the United States from a 'shell shocked' alcoholic, to an honorable Samurai in Japan.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives, what can easily be described as his best performance in recent years, as Captain Nathan Algren, the protagonist of this story.<br/><br/>This film can easily and proudly be placed with the likes of Braveheart, Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, and Master and Commander as an epic, with characters that you truly care about.<br/><br/>Go out and see this film...you will not regret it."
"warnut","10","1","2","14 December 2003"," The best movie I've seen in years
","When I walked into the theatre to see The Last Samurai I was expecting nothing more then a good action story, however what I saw was un expected....Much more. Tom Cruise gives an astounding performace on screen, some people think not for some reason, but trust me there would be no other actor who could pull it off the way Tom did. The storyline is excellent, and gives a genuine sence of honor that isn't ""Americanized"", like in most every other military film. The effects on the other hand are some of the best i have seen to date in a film of this genre. The katana scene's are nothing short of genius. Also the performance given by Masato Harada was nothing short of excellent. To conclude this movie struck an emotional string that a movie hasnt accomplished to do for me in a very long time. The directing, cinemetography, and the movie itself are all oscar worthy up and above any movie this year, save for ROTK.. This movie is fantastic, and dont listen to the put downs people have been giving it, especially Cruises performance. Go see it yourself you will not be disappointed..."
"ghostface18","10","1","2","15 December 2003"," The best movie of the year
","Anyone who doesn't agree that this movie is at least a great movie, let alone one of the best movies of the year, needs to understand the concept of good movies.  Usually, when I go to movies, when the end credits come up, I get up right away.  That was not the case for this one.  For about five minutes after the movie ended, I was bolted down to my seat in awe. Everything about this movie was breathtaking: the acting, the story, the action, the set designs, direction, re-view value.  This movie is a MUST SEE for historical epic movie buffs, a must see for story-buffs, and a must see for action buffs.  Also for drama buffs.  If you can't find anything in this movie that you like, you need to get your head examined.  Some parts are brutal, but the whole movie is exciting and...just...wow!!!!!!!!!!  If this doesn't win some award or is nominated, then no movie will be.  I'm sure Lord of the Rings will be excellent, but this movie is just utterly spectacular.  SEE IT, spend the extra money!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Iverson2001","10","1","2","15 December 2003"," Amazing, something enjoyable and most interesting.
","What could I say about The Last Samurai...an amazing movie with great directing and surprising I could say with most confidence that Tom Cruise was meant for that role. Deserves a 8 1/2 stars and should be in the top 100 for such a great and powerful storyline. Also there is great cinematography, along with great acting from other co-actors."
"sparkysparks69","10","1","2","14 December 2003"," The best movie of the year.
","The Last Samurai barely tops Pirates of the Caribbean as the best film of 2003. The story, the acting, the battles, and the overall presence of this film are just slightly below Braveheart. When I say barely I mean by an amount so small it's hard to notice. The battle scenes were very well played out and the plot had you captivated as soon as the movie started. This may be the best Tom Cruise movie yet. The only problem I can see with this movie is the fact that you have to read a lot of subtitles but to a true movie fan it is not that big of deal. The Japanese co-stars did a remarkable job as well. This is a story that truly makes you appreciate the historical culture that once ruled Japan. I recommend this movie to everyone who liked Braveheart for they will not be disappointed. I also recommend this to any true movie fan who appreciates a good movie."
"goodm0urning","10","1","2","13 December 2003"," Awe-Inspiring
","To cut to the chase, there is one very noticeable flaw in this film. There is a scene when a single teardrop falls from the corner of a little boy's eye... the wrong corner.  Teardrops always fall from the inside corner, and this tear fell from the outside corner.  Absolutely unforgivable, the biggest flaw of the film.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, here's the good stuff:  Seemingly paradoxically, director Edward Zwick (he of the acclaimed civil war film ""Glory"") successfully melds an epic scope of panoramic battle sequences and lush settings with a character-driven storyline that is deeply affecting, yet charged with energy.  This is like Dances With Wolves, minus the crap, plus some absolutely amazing (yet realistic and never fantastical) battle sequences that are picturesque and intense, without resorting to the dancelike choreography and CGI/wire effects that are popular nowadays.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest question concerns Tom Cruise.  The epitome of the phrase ""star actor,"" there is sufficient cause to doubt his ability to assume a character-driven role... but there is no need to worry.  Cruise has delivered a knockout punch of a performance, perhaps the best of his career--only overshadowed by the virtuosic job done by his co-star, Ken Watanabe, who seems to have stepped into the role straight out of one of Kurosawa's film (compare Watanabe's work as Samurai leader Katsumoto with any of Toshiro Mifune's roles to see what I mean).<br/><br/>To sum it up... if you haven't seen it, then what the hell are you waiting for?"
"kdtipa","Null","1","2","13 December 2003"," It is the most absorbing movie I've seen in years
","Having just returned from seeing the movie, I feel the need to write about it quickly before the thoughts fade.  The Last Samurai (2003) brought me into it, and made everything feel right in the world.  But it is just a movie, and like all movies, it ends.  Which means I want to see it again.<br/><br/>I am certain that I don't know everything about the historical period that was the setting for this movie, but I do have some familiarity with the legends of the samurai.  I hold in awe the beliefs that they supposedly held.  I love the tragic nature of the samurai.  I love that the legendary samurai were so perfectly bent on doing what was right, never compromising their morals and honor.  And this movie portrayed that heroic and tragic philosophy so beautifully.  I was literally moved to tears.<br/><br/>Though the setting, characters, and plot points are different, the sensation of seeing this movie is something I would describe as being like the sensation you would get from seeing the movie Glory (another excellent film).  It is well worth seeing, and well deserving of much praise."

"wrytir","Null","1","2","12 December 2003"," Appallingly trite
","12/06/03<br/><br/>Warning!! Full of spoilers!!!<br/><br/>So, I just returned from watching Dances with Wolves on the big screen again. Danc ... er, I mean, The Last Samurai, tells the familiar post-Civil War story of Heroic White Soldier Man placing himself unwittingly in the midst of noble, yet oppressed, adversaries perceived by him and his as savages with the intent to protect his way of life from these savages at whatever cost. Yet somehow, while those about him have moved on from fighting the Johnny Rebs to fighting the noble, dying breed, Heroic White Soldier Man becomes enamored of the savages' way of life. This, naturally, leads to three predictable outcomes.<br/><br/>1.) Heroic White Soldier Man forsakes his upbringing. 2.) Heroic White Soldier Man becomes reciprocally endeared to the wife of the savage man he (or his kind) killed. 3.) Heroic White Soldier Man uses all that he learned as young pre-Heroic White Soldier Man against other White Soldier Men. And fails ... yet lives.<br/><br/>In this ""epic"", Cruise's reforming drunk Nathan Algren uses Thermopoly (look it up) to describe how 300 Spartans hold off an army of 10,000+ Persians. That is true. An amazing story, really. But the requisite imitation of this famous conflict leads to a woefully-shot battle scene, a Custer's last stand, for which there is so much foreboding earlier in the film, with sides reversed. Subtle as a blunt-force trauma to the head. If that is lost on anyone, please let me know.<br/><br/>One would think that, given Cruise's star power at this point in his career, he could command the services of a more profound and glamorous cinematographer, visual production staff and site scouts. Instead, You are left  feeling like you are surveying a rich farmer's hillside backyard. The first 30 seconds of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers massively outshadows any effort of majesty here, in all of Samurai's close-to-2.5 hours of supposed ""wow"".<br/><br/>Despite his warrior inclination, that Algren (a.k.a. Cruise, a.k.a Heroic White Soldier Man) could master the art of Bushido so proficiently after just a few months of FIRST detoxifying and THEN leaving muddy footprints on his host's floor only to then follow in the footsteps of Kevin Cos ... er, I mean Lt. John Dunbar, and to realize the beauty (and being mastered ... that is, beaten easily, painfully and repeatedly by his early-on, barbarian-hating-but-later-honor-respecting nemesis whose name is not sufficiently identified in the credits ... guessing it's Seizo Fukumoto) is so profoundly believable ... groan. In short, Cruise could have commanded Costner's ""Waterworld"" budget and Ed Zwick could have done a much better job. Instead, he got less, and the moviegoer is the noble, and shortchanged, savaged victim.<br/><br/>NEXT UP: Russell Crowe plays disenchanted ex-Civil War General Ambrose Burnside, afflicted with Oliver-Stone-like flashbacks after the Battle of Antietam, who travels to far off New Zealand (so as not to stretch Crowe's acting abilities too far beyond rational belief) to fight off a Maori insurgency. En route to decisive success, he will fall for a Maori princess, played, in authentic black-face, by a strung-out Meg Ryan. In the climactic scene, Crowe's desperate forces will brilliantly route the right flank (isn't it always the right flank?) of the numerically superior British forces, under superb cover of Ryan and her enlisted help (cameos by Martha Stewart, Halle Berry, Tonya Harding and LaToya Jackson) flinging Teflon-coated cookware, entire sets of Revereware cutlery and subtle, yet masterfully crafted, pot pourri baskets packing a C-4 punch at the main Brit force. Consider the inherent anachronism of this soon-to-be-released film as suspension of disbelief. And be sure to have your suspension checked out by a certified mechanic before you enter the theater. In short, Crowe triumphs, valiantly, defying all odds (imaginable ... even for a South Park episode). He and Ryan wed, and she divorces him just as quickly in hopes of adding his ""half"" to her fortune. No longer in the movie here, folks. And she commits herself to Betty Ford for 30 days after learning that he has invested his entire amassed wealth in Martha Stewart Enterprises."
"synthetic tom","6","1","2","12 December 2003"," What's up with the Western score in a Samurai flick?
","The trailer for this movie got me all pumped up.  Set to some Japanese percussion, and wonderfully edited, the trailer sold me on the film.  Too bad the trailer was better than the movie.<br/><br/>Not that the inclusion of a westernized musical score should doom the movie on its own, but I think that this decision is very representative of the huge number of poor choices that cause ""The Last Samurai"" to fail.  Funny that the theme of the film is Western civilization's encroachment on the purity of Japanese culture, because the film itself also manages to impose its Western views and Hollywood morals on the world of 1800's Japan, making it laughable in more than one instance.<br/><br/>But I'm not going to get all bitter about it.  I still had fun watching the movie.  The locations are beautiful, the fight choreography is pretty good, and the costumes are awesome.  Although it runs a little long, it's not unbearable to sit through, and it's easy to take an interest in the main characters despite the formulaic script.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a summer blockbuster-type movie that was released during Oscar season. If you don't go to many movies, don't waste your time with this one, go out and rent Seven Samurai instead.  And if you're a film nerd like me, well you'll find something to like about it (probably.)  6/10"
"JNM_Fearless","10","1","2","12 December 2003"," This movie will touch your soul...
","I have followed this film since pre-production and have been waiting for it with great anticipation. I feared that with all of the build up, it would be a disappointment, but it was far from that. The film was shot extremely well. It was casted extremely well. Tom Cruise and Ken Watanabe are amazing in and of themselves, but even more so as their characters evolve together. This is a truly beautiful film all the way down to the score, done by none other than the great Hans Zimmer. This is the sort of film that forces you to look at your own lifestyle and question it. I was deeply touched many times throughout the film. Cruise does a great job in pulling you in and you feel as though you are right there with his character as he tries to find himself amongst all of the rubble of  past wars, both across the world, and more importantly, in his mind. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It will affect you and touch your soul in a beautiful way, leaving you wanting to be a better person."
"jimreasor","9","1","2","12 December 2003"," Outstanding....
","This movie far exceeded my expectations. I wanted to see it and was interested after seeing the previews and reading articles earlier in the year. I am admittedly not a big Tom Cruise fan so I went expecting to hopefully see a ""good"" movie. I thought it was much greater than that. It was definately one of the best I've seen in a while. As it was when I first saw Gladiator, I wanted to see this again right after I walked out of the theater. As usual, Hans Zimmer makes a great movie even greater with a wonderful score. I highly recommend this if you're a big fan of historical epics like I am."
"stedrazed","6","1","2","15 December 2003"," Meh.
","I remember the first time I saw the trailer for this film, at a midnight screening of THE MATRIX RELOADED (which, I must admit was far more disappointing). I happily took in the beautiful Japanese landscapes and Samurai action in the beginning of the trailer, then became disappointed, and even mildly outraged, at the appearance of Tom Cruise onscreen. Seeing the film tonight was much the same experience. I found myself really enjoying the first act of the film, then my enthusiasm kind of dropped off steadily from there on in. I guess it was because I already knew from the trailer where this portion of the film was leading, so predictability was no complaint. The sequence in which Cruise remorsefully ponders his so-called heroism is honestly moving. Also, I really liked Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader. But the dialogue and denouement are too typically cliched and predictable, much like John Logan's most well-known screenplay, GLADIATOR, and the score is awful. The main problem with the film, though, is its triteness, trading heavy orchestral chords by Hans Zimmer for real emotional moments of magnitude, and nicely choreographed battle scenes for an original story. I mean, come on, this is basically just DANCES WITH WOLVES in Japan, complete with voice-over diary entries. Oh, and also not as good. Sure does look pretty though."
"profocy-2","10","1","2","14 December 2003"," What a Wonderful Film...
","I cannot express enough how fantastic I thought this film was, and I haven't seen such heart and passion since Braveheart.  Tom Cruise proves yet again that he is completely comfortable being the star in an action epic as he flawlessly moves through the film like it was made for him.<br/><br/>There are so many points I could focus on as perfect in this movie:  The action, the wonderful direction, the costuming, acting, setting, etc.  But I would be writing for quite some time, and I don't want to bore you. <br/><br/>
Let me just say this, however.  I adored this film, and it easily is the best movie of the year so far.  <br/><br/>Wow."
"ferguson-6","6","1","2","14 December 2003"," Neither the perfect bloom nor great conversation
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I believe this movie is getting such rave reviews because it has the look and feel of a great movie.  Definitely even ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The mysticism is missing.  I did see this in digital projection, rather than film, and the colors seemed to leap off the screen - especially the sky and landscape.  The one thing that prevented this from being a great movie is Tom Cruise.  He is the only out-of-place thing in the film.  Ken Watanabe is wonderful and the stunning Koyuki (as Taka) leaves the audience breathless in numerous scenes.  Even Tony Goldwyn smirks his way to the desired level of arrogance.  Cruise, on the other hand, is soul-less in his role as a drunken war hero/samurai-wannabe.  One of the most absurd moments I have ever seen on screen is when he appears in the doorway wearing the samurai armour.  Yes I understand the poignancy of the moment ... it just doesn't work.  Cruise's performance reminds me of another over-hyped performance from this season's crop of blockbusters.  Russell Crowe in ""Master and Commander"" is equal to Cruise in his desire to be a movie star, rather than an actor.  The story and character should make the movie - not the celebrity.  I am not sure how much fault to lay on director Edward Zwick.  He seems to have peaked with ""About Last Night"" and TV's ""thirtysomething"", but this movie is just beautiful and might have worked, if not for Cruise.  Very interesting to see an almost unrecognizable Scott Wilson (""The Right Stuff"") as a U.S. ambassador.  Anyway, I am always disappointed when a movie doesn't reach its potential, and ""The Last Samurai"" left me feeling empty, not fulfilled."
"rosscinema","7","1","2","14 December 2003"," Film has a Samurai heart and spirit
","This is a film that takes a good hard look at how Japan was starting to change with its business deals with western civilization but the Samurai were still committed to the old ways of Japanese culture. This story is about a former Civil War captain named Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) who is an alcoholic and haunted by the memories of all the killing that was done during his tour of duty. Algren is offered a job in Japan to help train Japanese soldiers how to fight with modern weapons like guns and cannons. He arrives in Japan and starts to help train the soldiers but they are eons away from being ready to go into battle with the Samurai. Algren is told to lead them into a fight even though he knows they are not ready and after a very bloody fight where his army is nearly wiped out Algren is wounded and when a Samurai warrior is about to finish him off Algren kills him. Algren's life is spared when the leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) decides to bring him back to their village so that he can learn more about his enemy. Katsumoto and the Samurai are at war with the Japanese that want to change Japan into a more modern country that has trade deals with the Western culture. Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is young and envies the pride and traditions of the Samurai but he also wants to do what is best for his people so he is in the middle between the two armies. <br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Algren spends months living in the village among the Samurai and at first he is quiet but slowly he learns to respect them and their way of life. He is forced to live with Taka (Koyuki) who is the widow of the warrior that he killed and this makes him reflect on his own actions as a soldier. Algren learns to speak Japanese and how to fight with a Samurai sword. During the course of time there is mutual respect between the two and after Katsumoto is taken prisoner by the other side and about to be killed Algren decides to help him escape and fight with him in a final bloody battle.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Edward Zwick who also made the very good ""Glory"" and he knows about making films about characters that are questioning their own motives with war as a backdrop. The cinematography is important when your making a film as epic looking as this and Zwick hired the great John Toll who also shot ""Braveheart"" and ""The Thin Red Line"". There are several glorious shots and the battle scenes are extremely well angled with shots from the more fierce infighting to the long shots of a whole landscape of warriors. Cruise is good as Algren but not for a moment did I forget that I was watching one of the biggest movie stars in the world. His conviction to the role is admirable but this is nowhere near as good a performance as ""Born on the Fourth of July"". The best performance in the film comes from Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto and he shows both martial arts skill in the action scenes and screen charisma in the quieter moments. Koyuki as Cruise's love interest is a real beauty and she has natural screen appeal. She shows grace and poise and her understated role is effective. The script does a good job of showing how the Japanese were at odds with themselves as times were changing and the Samurai ideals were looked at as being antiquated. After a very bloody battle the film has a more Hollywood style ending and I do believe that this hurts the impact of the film. It has to do with the character by Cruise and with a more independent minded script this would have been even better I believe. This film still is very impressive looking and it does possess a lot of heart and spirit."

Like in Dances With Wolves I came away with what I felt was a better understanding of an ancient dying way of life and feel happy to of been given a glance into these honored cultures and sad that they are no more."
"lawrenqj","9","1","2","11 December 2003"," Amaising... Above and beyond Tom Cruise
","This looked exciting in the previews, and it did have a large amount of actions including some of the greatest fighting scenes I've seen, but this in a minute part of this film.  The greatest achievement is the quiet surentity that Edward Zwick is able to instill in Nathan Algren a character played by the seemingly un-apt Tom Cuise.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is meirly a conduit by which an amaising story unfolds.  It is in fact the lack of Tom Cuise' character that makes his role work so well with the story.  It is with much effort, I'd imagine, that Cruise under plays his character and allows the audience to fall in love with the dogma of Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto and the magical community that are the samurai."
"Ronin47","10","1","2","12 December 2003"," Awesome (****)
","Akira Kurosawa's 1954 masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" is one of my favorite films of all time. The word ""samurai"" is in my e-mail address. So I like this kind of movie. Still, for some reason I wasn't expecting much from this film. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that Tom Cruise playing a samurai, much as I like him, struck me as less-than-promising. Whatever the case, I'm glad I went, because not only is it good, it is one HELL of an amazing film. <br/><br/>Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a Civil War veteran who is known publicly as a ""war hero"", but he is not proud of it. He is an alcoholic and is haunted by the memory of the war, particularly being ordered to slaughter innocent Native Americans. <br/><br/>His new job is to go to Japan and train the Emperor's troops to wipe out the last of the country's samurai culture. In the first battle, though, he is taken prisoner by the samurai troops, led by Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Over a period of several months being their prisoner, Nathan gradually begins to understand their way of life and respect their dedication to honor and nature, and for probably the first time since before the war, he feels like he belongs somewhere. <br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" is, without a doubt, one of the most visually impressive films of the year. There are many shots that are simply stunning in their beauty, and even if some of them were computer generated, I didn't care. Even in the indoor scenes, the cinematography is perfect. The battle sequences are thrilling and terrifying, and the mournful, emotive score by Hans Zimmer evokes memories of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".<br/><br/>
So on the surface, the film is pretty much perfect. Which would be pretty cool on its own, but thankfully the film goes deeper. It takes its time detailing Algren's slow change of mind. It feels realistic because we know that this man had literally nothing but pain in his life, and found something new to live for in samurai culture. <br/><br/>Another one of the film's main assets is the moving friendship that slowly evolves between Cruise's and Watanabe's characters. Cruise is very good as usual, but it's Watanabe's breathtakingly passionate performance that gives the film its heart and soul. When these two characters, who began the film diametrically opposed, work together and understand each other, it made me think of the great friendships in the action films John Woo used to make before he became just another Hollywood director. <br/><br/>So is there anything in ""The Last Samurai"" that you haven't seen before? Probably not. But I can tell you that this is about as good as epic, mainstream Hollywood filmmaking gets. It's enormously exciting, suspenseful, fast-paced, it has a number of great characters, and it engages all the right emotions at all the right moments without being too manipulative.<br/><br/>
You could argue that it's not all that deep (and I might even agree), but there are certainly resonant themes of honor, self-discovery, the death of unfairly outmoded cultures, and the absurdity of war. It's about all those things, but mainly it's about serving you up a great, involving story, and there it definitely succeeds."

In the wake of such bubble gummy let downs as the Matrix films, it is very refreshing to have a movie that speaks highly and sincerely about honor, something that hollywood itself is trying to forget in place of poor storylines and special effects.  Kudos to Tom Cruise and Ed Zwick, two of the finest professionals working in the business today.  Very impressive."
"mfu-1","10","1","2","10 December 2003"," Very very impressive
","As a Japanese, I could not help being suspicious about how far Hollywood might mislead the viewers this time.  But, thinking of Tom Cruise being an honest person, who respects other cultures, I was hoping for the change, and got what I hoped for.<br/><br/>Though the forest was obviously not Japanese, historically the story is not too convincing, etc., there could be a list of things I could complain; but, after all, the main thing is I could see their honest effort for authenticity down to the details, which I have never (I repeat 'never') seen in any other Western made movies.<br/><br/>Watching the mountains in the rain, I felt I was at home, home which was lost in modernization long time ago.  The battle scene was just excellent. Ok, it might not be as good as Kurosawa's or other old masterpieces. But, for me, in a different category, it was better even.  I think Ken did a great job, too.<br/><br/>Over all, I am overwhelmed.  I do not say it is a perfect masterpiece; but, I loved it anyway.<br/><br/>(By the way, someone said the sword lecture is like the one in the ""Star Wars.""  But, come on, it is obvious which came first, by the hundreds of years difference.)"
"Phoenix_Flight","10","1","2","10 December 2003"," Go see it! (Especially if you liked Braveheart.)
","This is a wonderful movie, but if gore bothers you, don't watch it, because there  is quite a bit of that in it. (Gore is the sole reason it is rated R.)<br/><br/> However, despite the gore and considerable action and battle, the Last Samurai  is very much a philosophical movie. It is not your typical shoot 'em up; the battle  and action are instead a necessary but balanced part of the story. Don't expect  to go see it and come away mindlessly entertained. You will instead come away  with much to think about. The battles provide the backdrop for the story of a man  who must choose what principles he will stand on and what side he will take with life, death, and his own honor hanging in the balance. Because this movie  is about principles as much as-or even more than-the action side of it, Algren's eventual decision it not surprising. But it is a simpleton indeed who  thinks that predictability automatically condemns a movie.<br/><br/> If you happen to be one of those people who are bothered by bad language or sexual immorality, rest assured. This movie is clean, except for a rare mild swearword or two.<br/><br/> The bottom line? Great Action, thought provoking issues, and wonderful historical and cultural attention to detail. This movie is well worth seeing."
"Diss","10","1","2","9 December 2003"," Great modern epic
","This movie is fantastic. I really am surprised there are so many complaints about it. I suspect they are stereotyping Tom Cruise from the many bad movies he's done. Don't give this movie a negative review just because Cruise is in it! I changed my opinion of Cruise after Born on the Fourth of July; I suggest watching that movie.<br/><br/>Granted, he's not a great actor. His performance in this movie isn't oscar-worthy. But he holds his own and moves the story along believably. I'd say he's done his job. But I liked him a little better in Born on the Fourth of July.<br/><br/>But what makes this film really shine is the lack of annoying american actors. Ken Watanabe is unbelievably amazing! I found myself so drawn to his character at the end of the movie. It is impossible not to be moved during the gatling gun scene and when Katsumoto meets his destiny. It takes good acting for me to care about a character, and a whole culture even, like that. There have been complaints about the acting of the widowed wife. You have to understand Japanese culture to understand why the women act like that. It was intended she act that way.<br/><br/>As for the story, it is fantastic. Maybe you could say it was scewed a certain direction. I wouldn't call it PC nonsense though. Perhaps I am biased though. I love the Samurai culture and everything about it. So I couldn't find any problems with the story.<br/><br/>Cinematography, costumes, and sets were excellent. My only complaint might be one shot in a battle scene that looked like CGI graphics. It looked out of place in this film. But it was only a 1 second shot.<br/><br/>And then we come to the ending. While the ending is a bit ""hollywoodish"", it wasn't as bad as I feared from a hollywood movie. I would say that is a good thing. Though perhaps they could have ended the movie after Katsumoto met his fate. That might have worked a little better.<br/><br/>Often when I watch a movie and like it I go to IMDB and see negative comments and find myself agreeing with them and myself liking the movie less because of it. But that is not the case with this movie. I have read the negative comments, and could not agree with any of them. Though I can sort of understand complaints about the ending, but at least it wasn't as bad as hollywood normally makes endings- think about it.<br/><br/>In summary this is one of the best modern epics I have seen. Many of the complaints from the so called ""purists"" will cite better movies made in Japan, or the old epic movies. I cannot comment on those, I haven't seen enough of those for comparison. But for a modern hollywood movie, this is one of the best."
"dan_wood","10","1","2","9 December 2003"," Excellent

"DigitalPhreaker","8","1","2","10 December 2003"," A True Epic
","Nowadays, with these cheap films (and when I say cheap, I mean plot wise, acting wise and so on) coming out, like Bad Boys II, 2 Fast 2 Furious, and so on, it's great to know that there are still filmmakers out there who know how to create a masterpiece of a film.<br/><br/>In the early parts of this year, I was drawn into this film through the teaser trailers and posters they would have at the theaters. I just knew from watching the trailers that this movie was going to be big. And was I right.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is amazing. Gone are his days of the cocky teenage roles and stereotypical movies. Tom has grown up and realized that since he is a super star, he can do something more than those kinds of movies, and he has in the recent years. For example: Magnolia and Jerry Maguire, both earning him an Oscar nod. I know for sure that this year is Tom's year. After watching Jerry Maguire again after watching the Last Samurai, I know that the Academy will at least give Tom Best Actor.<br/><br/>And Mr. Cruise isn't the only one who's going to be getting some Oscar nods. Ken Watanabe will probably get nominated for best supporting and possibly Ed Zwick as director. However, I doubt that the film will win for Best Picture. Not because it doesn't deserve it, but because it had to be released the same year as Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. It's going to be next to impossible to beat Jackson's film, and I think that that's too bad, because The Last Samurai has Best Picture written all over it.<br/><br/>I was drawn into this film immediately when we saw Col. Algren's past come back to haunt him, and I knew that his mission in this film was going to be to silence his lambs, so to speak. Although it was somewhat Dances With Wolves at parts, I felt this to be original, visually stunning, and heartbreaking at the same time. Tom Cruise and everyone involved in this film have done an amazing job and they deserve all the praise they are receiving.<br/><br/>10/10. Go and see this movie if you have not already. And if you have, see it again. Because they deserve a lot of money since they won't be taking the Best Picture Oscar home."

"snowraven-1","10","1","2","9 December 2003"," Absolutely Epic
","I loved this movie. Usually, I'd walk out of a Tom Cruise film and say ""oh, he was soooo cute!"", but this time, I can say, with a completely clear and clean conscience that he was *amazing*. Absolutely incredible. The Last Samurai wasn't your typical ""West meets East"" movie. Nathan Algren doesn't try to ""reform the savages"" or Americanize the poor Japanese people. Instead, as would happen if any one stranger lands in a village, he changes. He comes to understand and respect their ways and if he doesn't necessarily become one of them, he does become a friend.<br/><br/>This is probably the only two-and-a-half hour film that I could imagine sitting through again. And again. And again.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai, in my opinion, is bigger than a ""Tom Cruise movie"". It rises above that stigma to become an epic tale that just happens to have Tom Cruise in it, doing an astounding job."

","Amazing.  Absolutely astounding.  Tom Cruise is, for once, not the only main focal point of this film, and it does nothing but benefit from that.  Ken Watanabe has moved to my A-List of actors.  The dialogue is moving, and incredibly well-written.  The acting is phenomenal.  I have not been so moved by a movie in a very, very long time.  The relationships between characters are extremely well-constructed, and it's one of the movies of its kind (Dances with Wolves, Glory) that does NOT make the ""white man"" of the group the hero, saviour, and victor.  There is a great amount of respect for Japanese culture evident in this script.  I am so very impressed."

"Corpin","Null","1","2","7 December 2003"," Surprisingly Entertaining
","I had my doubts when I went to see this film. Tom Cruise is a fantastic actor, but he hasn't been that good as of late. ""Mission Impossible 2"" had a bad effect on my view of him as an actor, to say the least. However, when I saw this film, I was blown away.<br/><br/>I was impressed with Cruise's acting abilities -- he definitely goes through a transformation in thos movie, and if you pay close attention to his face you'll see what I mean. Of course, at certain points it's hard not to pay close attention to his face. I think the director is in love with it; there are many close-ups.<br/><br/>But I digress. The film was, as many have pointed out, Dances with Wolves combined with Braveheart. And it worked quite well. It was not only entertaining but somewhat spiritual.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, so go and see the movie. I personally think it's worth a try. I've read a lot of bad comments on this site and I find many of them stating that they were bothered by its historical inaccuricies. With all due respect, it's a movie. When you read a book, you suspend your disbelief. You should do the same for a film.<br/><br/>The bottom line: 8/10 Better than great."

"joshrogers","10","1","2","7 December 2003"," Art, Beauty, and Emotion
","Art. If I had to say one thing about this movie, this would be it. Art. When the movie started, I have to say that I expected something completely different. I have always had a profound respect for Japanese culture and the idea of mainstream producers trying to handle it scared me. So many times, I've seen the Japanese culture shown from either the perspective of World War II, where they are crazed killers, or from different but still americanized perspectives.<br/><br/>
The Last Samurai completely breaks from this paradigm and goes on to offer so much more. From the time that Japan is first shown in a sweeping panorama, the verisimilitude to the real Japan is truly wonderful. My Japanese foreign exchange student was shocked that Americans could make something so accurate and beautiful. The scenery and cinematography cannot be described, and the attention to detail is exquisite.<br/><br/>
But perhaps the greatest innovation of this movie is its depiction of Japanese culture, especially way of the warrior, or bushido. Through marvelous directing and a wonderful script of subtitled Japanese and English, The Last Samurai succeeds in conveying and truly imprinting the deep emotion and tradition behind Japanese culture.<br/><br/>
As a whole, the movie depicted beautifully both peaceful Japanese life and the insanity of the battlefield. For me, finding beauty in killing was a paradox but this movie proved my conceptions wrong. Watching this movie was an emotional roller coaster, an eye-opening experience, and an insight into the true Japanese culture. I will defiantly see it again."

","I did myself the favor of reading the screenplay before seeing the movie and I have to say that the screenplay was ten times better than the finished product and now I know why.  <br/><br/>The screenplay had more character development than the movie because the director couldn't fit everything within 2 1/2 hours, which is a shame.<br/><br/>The screenplay made this movie resemble ""Dances with Wolves"" and the action was littly bloodier and more thought out than the finished product.<br/><br/>The movie is good but now I can see why screenplay writers get irritated with Hollywood politics."

The touching tale spoke to the audience about the courage of war all the while telling of a unique love story as well.  This could perhaps be Tom Cruise's best role ever.  As I left the theatre I heard not a single negative comment.  In fact, I only overheard comments such as `that was the best movie I have ever seen' or `it's almost a Japanese Braveheart only much more touching.'  I left wanting to see it again and again and again.  The Last Samurai is definitely an Oscar worthy film that I would recommend to anyone and everyone."
"AEBarschall","Null","1","2","8 December 2003"," Magnificent
","This was the first film I ever saw that was rated R for violence alone. There was absolutely no sex and the most nudity we saw was Tom's chest with some scars added, his legs, and the female lead's shoulder.  I was a bit disappointed with this lack of titillation, but also surprised that I enjoyed watching the movie without it.  Normally, I hate violent movies. For instance, I detested the violent scenes in Mission Impossible II, also a Cruise movie, where violence was really glorified and seemed to be presented for entertainment value alone.  I think the difference here was that violence was not glorified.  Cruise's character is haunted by the violence he has committed.  He fights because he knows no other life, because he can see no way out.  This view of violence is one that I can tolerate to watch, despite the almost non-stop fountains of blood erupting from the unfortunate departed.  I suppose those fountains are what made the thing R.  It's really curious how those rating people think.  <br/><br/>You could tell it was a really good movie, because there were a number of us riveted to our seats during the credits, watching the names of very minor participants roll by against a black screen in the vain hope that maybe some picture would reappear.<br/><br/>The photography, costumes, scenery, and music were all just magnificent. <br/><br/>
The people who say that this is some kind of knock off of ""Dancing With Wolves"" are just harping on a superficial similarity. Anything can remind you of anything else if you think hard enough.<br/><br/>There were a couple of weak points.  For instance, there seemed to be only one female character, other than extras, that is.  That one was the woman who takes care of the hero after he is wounded.  She is very beautiful and acted very well, but, gee, Tom, don't you know that a lot of your fans are women?  I mean you could have managed to put a few more of us in the movie.<br/><br/>The other weak point was at the beginning.  Tom, at that point, is supposed to be playing a moldering, defeated alcoholic.  Somehow Tom  doesn't ever manage to look defeated.  He just has too much strength and vibrancy.  It always comes through.  Maybe it's supposed to, but somehow I think not.  He does manage to look really sick when he is wounded and recovering in the Samurai village, though.  Maybe, it's because we get to see his bare legs then.  There's something about Tom's legs and feet.  They're just so small next to his enormously muscular torso.  They really make him look vulnerable.<br/><br/>Still, most of the movie showcases what Tom is best at: movement, energy, piercing looks of deep concern, anger, and tears when appropriate.  This is what keeps me coming back to his movies, just being glued to those amazing images of him.  I hope he keeps going strong for a long time."

","*A few spoilers ahead.* The martial arts fight choreography looked plenty authentic to me.  And, so did the regret shown by Tom Cruise's character over a needless massacre of innocent Cheyenne women and children (a la Sand Creek, Colorado, circa 1864).   I also loved the way he gradually bonded with the family of the masked samurai he killed.  *Miss Koyuki might be giving Lucy Liu a run for her money, in future Asian/American co-productions.* I think the only complaint I have with this movie is the historical liberties taken with the Meiji Rebellion.  To my knowledge, that lasted less than a year...back in 1868!"

","Walking into the movie i was skeptical, Tom Cruise pulling crazy moves with a sword without making a fool out of himself, not possible.  I was however completely blown away by this movie.  With scenery that compared to Kurosawas action comparing to bravehearts and one of Tom Cruises best performances it is by far one of my favorite movies of all time.  Although the Hollywood aspect is still there and very blatant it is overshadowed by the other elements of the movie.  The companionship, honor, compassion and beliefs displayed by the characters is very moving.  I am 16 and although the opinion of a 16 year old boy may not seem like much to you, let me say this.  I have never cried or even teared during a movie nor have i ever felt much of a twinge of sadness but during a number of scenes in this movie, whether from the beauty of some things or the death of others i felt water building in my eyes.  If you enjoyed the movie Shichinin no samurai (The Seven Samurai) you will like this movie.  Zwick does not let Kurosawa down, using some of his elements and creating some knew ones of his own.<br/><br/>
--Spoiler Below--<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
One of the characters in this movie so strongly reminded me of The Seven Samurai that i had to comment on it.  Its like Zwick used an allusion to this legendary movie and it came out at me with startling effects.  The quiet old man known affectionately as Bob, although a quiet character throughout the movie, was striking at the end.  Throwing himself infront of a bullet, getting shot, and then standing up once again to strike down the one that shot him.  Just as the quiet samurai did in The Seven Samurai. Because of this and many other elements of the movie that seem taken directly from greater movies, with (although somewhat historically incorrect) a great plot line i give this movie a 10/10... if you go see this i guarantee you will not leave feeling ripped off."

","As a Japanese, I was apprehensive about watching a movie made by Americans about a tradition that not even the Japanese fully understand.  The movie did however capture the pride, and honor of the people in Japan during the Meiji-Era.  My Grandfather has told me many stories of the time that was Meiji.  That Cruise's character was accepted by the Samurai seems a little unrealistic.  Especially when Algren symbolized the demise of the Samurai. Futhermore, that a Samurai would speak English adds to the dramatization.<br/><br/>
All things considered though, the Last Samurai was a great picture, and respectful of both countries cultures.  All Japanese should watch this film, and rekindle the spirit of being Japanese.  Maybe then, the youth of Japan will have an increased awareness of our history, and Culture!"
"TommyTwista","8","1","2","8 December 2003"," Showcase of Tom Cruise's strengths
","I found this film surprisingly good, despite the luke-warm reviews (e.g. Variety). The storyline was fairly predictable, but that's fine for this type of genre piece. Tom Cruise is, in my opinion, a fantastic one-trick-pony actor. He portrays the testosterone filled American Alpha-male in all his films, and does it superbly in this one. And yet, it is not pro-American. In fact, it is distinctly anti-American in terms of foreign policy commentary. Only an actor such as Cruise could be capable of pulling this off while still being considered a good American.<br/><br/>
The similarities with Dances with Wolves are clearly there, but does this really matter? It's been a long time since Dances and this was a fun story anyway. <br/><br/>The only negative comment that I have on this picture is that Cruise could have let this be more about Katsumoto, who represented the real-life Saigo Takamori, rather than about a completely fictional American military advisor turned rebel. It was only a 1/3 of the way into the film before I realised that Cruise wasn't the Last Samurai and that led me to research the history of the true Last Samurai afterward."

","Just saw the movie last night ,i didn't even realize how long it was until i looked at my watch and realized it was one in the morning . Thats becasue i was hooked from the first scene , i swear i never even blinked.<br/><br/>First off the only film that could possibly have a chance to top the cinamatography of this one would be LOTR return of the king . The camera work presenting scenery is absolutely stunning it truly sells the landscape of Japan( amazingly enough it was filmed in New Zealand). The battle sequences were also out of this world , unlike master and commander , where it was hard to tell who was hitting who , and moving to fast for your eyes to follow. No these battles are crisp , clear , and beautifully done . ( whats most impressive is that Tom Cruise and Ken Watabe do all their own stunts) Now as far as the story goes, don't listen to those idiots who judge a film before seeing it, this is nothing like Dances with wolves ,yea sure both films feauture a white man assimilating to a different culture , but thats as far as it goes ..anyone who thinks ""Last Samurai "" copied off Dances with wolves is mistaken.(no hating on kevin costner i love his movies to) The film transitions very smoothly from scene to scene , full of morality, its defeinatley one of those movies that will change you in someway spiritually. Not to give away anything but the love story is definately not the cliche everyone predicted its very complex. The acting is out of this world ( To hell with all of you that hate on Cruise) he 's awesome and he proves it once again in this film. This is my personal favorite of his performances second only to Jerry Maguire. Cruise perfectly portray's a man who has lost it all and has no reason to live , then expiereinces a spiritual rejouvination and finds a purpose to exist again. As always he does excellent , working off other people but it when the camera sits on him alone that he shines . The Music fits the mood of the film nicely ,and adds to the emotion . THere's also a light touch of humor in a couple of scenes which does justice to the film. THe samurai culrutre presented in this film can is one of the  coolest elements , the movie offered. (THERE ARE NINJAS!!! awesome badass!)  In closing i give this film 8.5/10 , look for cruise to be in the hunt for his first oscar , and for this movie to be in line for several other awards , including best director , cinamotography and Picture.<br/><br/>""that was an order , did you not hear me?

","Beautifully made and epic in stature. I was blown away by the scenes and philosophies presented here (a lot of parallels to what's happening in the world right now), but then the film sold out with the ending. SPOILER ALERT - since this is a $100m+ Tom Cruise production, I don't think the investors in this film would want a dark ending.  They probably felt they could make a higher profit with a feel-good Hollywood ending that caters to a different (and wider) segment of the audience.  Unfortunate and ironic since the movie spends a majority of its time debunking a lot of Western archetypes and culture, but then shows the standard Western optimistic ""hero always wins"" ending. Nevertheless, this movie probably couldn't be made without Cruise, and the ideas presented in the first part of the film probably wouldn't have reached such a wide audience without Cruise attached. I give it a grudging but well-earned 10 stars."

"Shandara","10","1","2","5 December 2003"," Eastern Braveheart - possible spoilers
","Like many others have already said, this film is akin to Braveheart in its sweeping vistas, rousing fight scenes, and emotional impact.  I attended a sneak preview of Last Samurai with a large group of people and the reaction of probably 90% of us was what an incredible movie this was.  I'll be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for Best Picture, because it definitely should.  Rather than sing this great movie's praises like dozens of others have, though, I'd like to address some of the criticisms I've seen.<br/><br/>First, yeah, Tom Cruise does tend to stick with roles that are very similar. He obviously likes playing the hero type.  But ya know what, he does it well, so as far as I'm concerned he can keep doing it.  Where do people get off saying he only plays one kind of role anyway?  I saw Vanilla Sky and I wouldn't equate that character to Algren.  Okay, so it's not De Niro in Untouchables versus De Niro in Men of Honor.  But Cruise kept me enthralled in Samurai, so who cares?<br/><br/>And what's with people saying Samurai is humorless?  What about Bob? Or the scene where he's mimicking the samurai and the kid walks in?  My friends and I were loving it!  Okay, so they chose subtle humor over Jim Carrey--big deal.  I'm sorry the humor went over their heads, but geez...!<br/><br/>And as to those people who felt that gratuitous sex/romance was lacking, go back to the eighties.  I'm just happy that Hollywood has finally grown up and realized that sex isn't necessary to the success of a movie. Frankly, overt sex/romance would've been terribly out of place in a movie about a culture that prides itself on its restraint.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to for me is that I sat in that theater for 2 and a half hours and was disappointed when the credits rolled because I didn't want it to end.  I laughed, I cried, I marveled at the beautiful landscape and the very cool fight scenes, and I will be paying full price at the theater to see it again, as well as buying it on DVD in six months."
"chadrbailey","10","1","2","5 December 2003"," A masterpiece
","A sorely needed commentary on how to live well.  The samurai provide a model for living deliberately, and cherishing each moment.  I think this is Tom Cruise's best work yet, and his on-screen link with Ken Watanabe makes for a truly moving feature.  A story of life, love (without objectifying either party), and truth of what it means to live as humanly as possible."

It had everything a movie needed: Awesome soundtrack, best fight scenes I've ever seen, amazing story, and great actors make this the best movie I have ever seen.  I went to go see the movie two times, and both times the movie made me cry and gave me rushes of Adrenalin.  I have never watched a movie were it had people in the theatre at as emotional as this movie.

Cruise did a magnificent job in this beautiful epic story.  From his drunken entrance into the movie, to his alcohol dt's to his final fight scene and presentation of Katsumoto's sword to Emperor Meiji. Cruise's performance moved me like none of his other films every did.  Kudos to Ken Watanabe for a very strong performance as Samurai leader Katsumoto. Edward Zwick thanks for this tribute to the Samurai warriors."
"sur4dude03","10","1","2","7 December 2003"," Brilliant.
","Ed Zwick's latest film is astonishing.  The story was powerful, the acting was majestic, and the battles were intense.  This film is simply spectacular.  The characters were real enough to the point where you cared for them, the dialogue was believable and intriguing, and the directing was allusive and ingenious.  There are many levels this movie takes and does them all justice.  A hands down nominee for Best Picture for 2003.  Although the feeling still haunts that it, like all the others, will soon hail to the 'King.'"
"WalterFrith","Null","1","2","7 December 2003"," Traditional and accurate from a historical point of view.
","There is a scene in 'The Last Samurai' where the son of a samurai warrior says that his father taught him that it is glorious to die in battle.  A lot of films have taken criticism for glorifying war and one of them is 1989's 'Glory'.  'The Last Samurai', like 'Glory', was directed by Edward Zwick and the issue of war glorification is neither right or wrong.  It's what the individual fighting for what he or she believes in is right or wrong.  It is left up to individual interpretation and allowing a person to think for themselves.<br/><br/>Set in 1876, it appears that in 'The Last Samurai', the story revolves around the Japanese government's wish that like the United States, commerce and building a nation is worth killing its traditional people for. Traditional people in America being the Indians, who were slaughtered and driven off their land between 1850 and 1900 for the exploitation of railroad construction, gold mining and oil drilling.  The Japanese emperor in this film is obsessed with Western ideology so much so, that he hires an American civil war hero (Tom Cruise) to use this methodology to take out the last batch of samurai warriors whose traditional methods that have protected their country for centuries are now slowing down the exploitation of the Japanese country for profit.<br/><br/>Cruise's character is Captain Nathan Algren, a man who participated in the American Indian wars and is haunted by his conscience for the slaughter of innocent people while his superiors believe it is the right thing to do. Algren is captured in battle and forced to learn the samurai way of life. Upon doing so, he becomes embodied in their way of life and embraces it against his own people in the name of justice.  <br/><br/>Director Edward Zwick has made a film from a different time where beliefs were very different than they are today and because of this, those who believe in political correctness will attack this film and misunderstand it like they did 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart'.  Learning something about a different time and place is beneficial in light of all of the Hollywood down sizing in terms of quality film making in recent years and this film is going to be a sensational Oscar contender for many awards including picture, director and actor and Cruise could win an Oscar after three previous tries. This is going to be his best shot to date.  And Ken Watanabe, who plays the samurai leader, is sensational in his own way and I hope he is not forgotten when the Oscar nominations are announced for supporting actor."
"Sfpsycho415","8","1","2","7 December 2003"," Great Samurai Movie--- 8/10
","I am probably gonna have dreams of being in Japan's beautiful countryside, practicing sword skills and drinking sake after watching this movie. It is a very interesting film, not only because of it's incredible battle scenes, but it's look into old Japanese culture and it's focus on the violent civil war between a modernizing government and rebellious samurai. I don't know too much about that time, but the writers didn't seem to put anything in the movie that was historically inaccurate or too ""Hollywood"". The cast did an amazing job as well. Tom Cruise gives the best performance i have seen him in, but in my opinion, Ken Watanabe steals the show. He is the lead samurai who takes Algren (Cruise) prisoner in a samurai village. I think he deserves the Best Supporting Oscar, or, at the very least, a nomination. Koyuki is a beautiful woman who hosts Algren in her home at the asking of Wanatabe. She brings a peace and beauty to a place that is ravaged by war. The pace sags here and there, but the action and performances more then make up for it. 8/10"

","I was so skeptical because I have a very hit and miss record with Tom Cruise's roles in movies... hate him in this one, love him in that one, hate him again, loved him again.   So I had hopes since I did like the premise behind the film, but I also liked the premise behind Eyes Wide Shut.  So I had to see for myself.<br/><br/>The movie opened, and I love it.<br/><br/>I got to the first fight scene in the fog, and I fell in love again.<br/><br/>I sat through the fall and winter in the village, and I loved it all.<br/><br/>During the end of the final battle scene, I was visibly fighting back tears I was so in love with it (which is why I was happy that I went alone).<br/><br/>This movie brings forth all the honor and tradition that the samurai deserve.

"jericho31","9","1","2","5 December 2003"," Epic movie, great production, Cruise superbly confident
","Tom Cruise as a samurai? I had my doubts. But, since I love  Legends of the Fall and Glory, I had faith in Edward Zwick's epic storytelling ability and I was not disappointed. This movie is fantastic in almost every way - Zwick was a touch sappy and melodramatic at times, but not enough to be distracting.<br/><br/>
Cruise was at the top of his game, wtih a confidence that seems to only increase with age. When I first heard of this movie I was very skeptical one would be able to get past the persona of Tom Cruise and believe he was a samurai. Thankfully the performance left no doubts. Cruise was helped by an extremely strong (and almost assuredly ignored) performance from Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto, the<br/><br/>leader of the remaining samurai. The scenes between the two of them as Cruise is beginning to discover the samurai culture are among the best in the movie. <br/><br/>Lastly, one cannot say enough about John Toll as a director of photography.<br/><br/>This movie is so strikingly beautiful the cinematography is as important a<br/><br/>character as any.  From the quiet, contemplative scenes while Cruise is a<br/><br/>prisoner among the samurai to the unbelievable action sequences which are<br/><br/>very reminiscent of Bravelheart, Toll does a remarkable job. The<br/><br/>cinematography is enough to make you cry, and you add in the great cast and<br/><br/>wonderful directing by Zwick, and you've got a great movie.<br/><br/>
Do yourself a favor and see this movie on the big screen as epics are intended to be seen. Highly recommended. **** out of  *****"

","Having seen the sneak preview two days ago I am still in awe of The Last Samurai.  This is by far the best movie I have seen this year.  I believe this to be Tom Cruise at his best.  The foreign actors are superb down to the last child.  The script and concept is great.  I would not be surprised if The Last Samurai will be up for an Oscar or 10.  As the Asian presence in mass media is slowly growing, this is by far the truest to Asian culture yet.  The actors all carry on an air of importance and regality that is admirable in film today.  I recommend this film to any lover of epic movies. The message is clear but still makes you think.  Each battle scene, whether it is one-on-one or clash of the cultures, is choreographed superbly.  The script is written just as elegantly.  Indeed a movie for the lovers of real cinematic art."
"BWBaseball","10","1","2","3 December 2003"," The Best Movie of All Time!
","I saw the sneak preview of this movie on November 30. I was emotionally exhausted as I walked out of the theater.  This movie had changed me. The movie emphasis on honor was enlightening.  The most exhilerating movie of the year. The Last Samurai was Kill Bill but with a real story behind the outrageous fight scenes. This movie replaced the faith that I lost in the movie buissiness after seeing Matrix: Revolutinos. This movie gets a 10 in my book."
"jheriko","10","1","2","3 December 2003"," Touching.
","(Possible spoilers...haven't started writing yet.)<br/><br/>If you've seen The Fellowship of the Ring and was touched by how Boromir(the dude who was shot with arrows) kept on fighting as he was dying then you're guaranteed to be touched by The Last Samurai.  And there are many other reasons why anyone would like this movie, but I don't want to over-hype it.<br/><br/>If you hate Tom Cruise then I plead that you imagine it's someone else in his place because this movie shouldn't be knocked just because he starred in it.  If you're one of those people who like to just get lost in a movie, or feel like a part of the movie(if you know what I mean) then this is one of those movies.  I ask you to put yourself in Tom's place and see what seeing, feel what he's feeling and this will truly be an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>
The visuals during the fight scenes are utterly amazing.  Yes this is a movie about an American who becomes a Samurai within 4 months or so, but it's just a movie, SO WHAT!  And yes the title gives it away, but he makes up for it in the end.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best movies to see are the ones you have zero expectations or knowledge of.  For example, I was told by numerous friends that Pirates of the Carribean was the best movie they've ever seen, so that's what I expected.  And of course I didn't like it as much as everyone else.  I saw very little of this movie before I watched the sneak peek and I'm very glad.<br/><br/>
To conclude my strayings of thoughts.  I love to cry in movies(the touching parts) and yes I'm a guy and I admit it.  I've cried in A Beautiful Mind, Finding Nemo, Cool Runnings, Lord of the Rings, etc. I know that might sound amusing of the range of movies that touch me, but I can't help it, they just do!  So let me just say this, during the last 15 minutes of the film, I had to hold back some of the tears to keep from balling(pardon the corniness of how that sounds).  And you know that feeling you get in your throat when you're kind of holding back tears, that kept going for 10 minutes after the movie ended.  Go see this movie, have an open mind, have no expectations, and don't have any pre-dislikes for Tom Cruise. If you do this, this movie should really touch you or come close to it."

"jeev7882","8","1","2","1 December 2003"," The Best Film of the Year
","Where to start? Well, lets scratch the surface by talking about the obvious commercial draw of the film: Tom Cruise. This is Cruise's best film in a long career filled with great films. Here, Cruise is able to utilize his unparalleled action skills and showcase his underappreciated acting talent as Captain Nathan Algren. I have always believed Cruise to be one of the best actors in Hollywood; he is the only action star to put so much effort into each and every scene he does. In Samurai, he is surrounded by an equally talented cast headlined by Asian cinema star Ken Watanabe. Watanabe's performance as Katsumoto is one of the best this year and his chemistry with Cruise is incredible. Katsumoto is a man who demands respect with his looks, but obtains it through his actions. Lets put the performances aside for just a second. The overall look of the film is beautiful. Granted, to most western audiences any movie set in the Orient has beautiful scenery, but Samurai doesn't try to just showcase Japan's grand landscapes. Instead, the scenery flows effortlessly into each and every scene and compliments it. Even further complimenting the look of the movie are the simple yet beautiful sets. I cannot comment on the historical authenticity of the sets having only been to Japan once, but regardless the small, simple Japanese homes are adorned with vastly different personalities in each individual room. The transition between the simple Samurai life and the hectic battle scenes is perfect. Some will complain about the shakiness of the camera at times and that the shots are cut to quickly. Even I had that complaint at small parts here and there, but that's how a battle is: hectic, random, and unpredictable. The battles are among the most epic ever filmed, paralleled only perhaps by those in Braveheart. There are a few fight sequences that had the audience, including myself, applauding afterwards. The most well choreographed in terms of swordplay is one that will have the nerds inside many of us bubbling with joy. Just know this: Ninjas vs. Samurai. Usually when you have a western actor in a role that requires eastern skill (ala Keanu Reeves as Neo), there is huge disappointment among the masses. In this case a man like Cruise has worked his ass off so much that his mastery of a katana blade is as good as Watanabe's or anyone else's. Granted, I'd still put my money on someone like Watanabe in an off screen skirmish, but onscreen the two are equals as warriors. Reverting back to the Ninja vs. Samurai scene, the music is similar to the fast drum beats of Yo-Yo Ma in the first fight sequence of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. At the end of the scene my pulse was as high as ever and my jaw was wide open. The quickness and ferocity of the show that Zwick and the fight choreographers will not back down just because this movie is meant primarily for mainstream America. Almost as if to poke fun at that, there is a short but equally heart-pounding sequence where Algren kills a number of Japanese agents with swords. Initially, the scene is showed in real time, but it pauses after, goes back to the beginning of the sequence, and shows everything in slow motion. It actually means to show Algren's reflection or recollection of the fight that just occurred, but the fact that it works on the two aforementioned levels is even more inspiring. The inevitable final battle sequence is just as good mainly because it doesn't follow any of the common clichés found in other epic war films. Enough about the battles, the real brilliance of this film comes from its short and sharp dialogue and its patient but captivating pacing. The biggest surprise I found was that there were not corny dialogues or lines in the entire movie. Usually movies that showcase words like ""honor"" in their trailers have a cheesy scene somewhere in the movie. In Samurai, ideas and themes like honor and courage are practiced, not talked about. There are no speeches, only dialogues. Characters we don't like strike a chord as much as the protagonists. There is a point in the movie when Algren is leaving to go back to the Samurai when his commanding officer (Col. Bagley) asks him ""what is it about your own people that you hate so much?"" There is no answer from Algren, which makes the question and the point it tries to make all the more chilling. The most impressive dialogue is that written for the Japanese characters, particularly the samurai. Japanese characters consistently talk to each other in Japanese, and Algren eventually learns Japanese instead of vice-versa. The samurai dialogue never lapses into the typical ""dumb foreigner"" dialogue that just about every Hollywood movie showcases these days. Instead, the script, penned by John Logan and Marshall Herskovitz, treats Japanese just as importantly as English, and the Japanese just as important as the Americans. A few things both in and out of the screenplay that I appreciated about the film were the realism of injury and the patience and confidence to let the story unfold by itself. At about an hour-and-a-half, Samurai isn't a second too long or a second too short. It owes this to gorgeous editing and directing which allows the movie to start slowly and then take off when Algren reaches Japan. I mention the realism of injury because our main characters are constantly stabbed or shot and actually take time to heal. Algren himself is nearly killed in the initial encounter with the Samurai, and he is shot and stabbed numerous times in the final scene. A substantial part of the movie deals with his rehabilitation at the Samurai town. So, do I have any complaints at all? No. Upon second viewing maybe I'll find something that could have been a little better. Maybe the beginning could have been a little more interesting. Maybe the action could have been just a little less choppy. I don't know, but for now The Last Samurai is as great as epic filmmaking gets. It represents everyone at the top of their game with the utmost confidence in their artistic abilities. Cruise shows why he has consistently been Hollywood's leading man over the past two decades, and the cast of Asian stars and unknowns doesn't flinch for a second. Most people cringe to mention any movie as comparable in brilliance to Kurosawa, but Samurai places itself in those lofty ranks. This isn't just the best movie I've seen this year, it is one of the best movies I have seen from the past decade.<br/><br/>

"reviewsbyjeff","10","1","2","30 November 2003"," The best of the best for 2003
","Having piled maximum superlatives on `Master and Commander', now wish I had not done so.  Hindsight is a beautiful view when comparing two films side by side.  After viewing the Russell Crowe effort, I anointed `Master and Commander' the best film of the year.  I did however leave myself some wiggle room by mentioning two other films in the distant landscape. Those films are `Cold Mountain' the Jude Law and Nicole Kidman Civil War epic to be released on Christmas day.  The other title is the `Last Samurai' the Tom Cruise epic about honor, duty, and commitment.  We decided to see the public Sneak Preview and forgo the usual Tuesday night Cinema Society premiere viewing.<br/><br/>This film is so rich, so moving, and so meaningful, it is an instant classic. The fine cinematic giant `Braveheart' comes to mind as a comparable title.  These two films depict the battle against tyranny and the honor of ones' history.  The obvious comparison of story line might appear to be with 'Dances with Wolves' as it also had an American Solider turn against his own country.  This film had a bit different twist than the Cosner effort.<br/><br/>Voice over work done by Cruise and others give you historical reference with the time and timeline.   There is quite a bit of underlining meaning here to tug at your heart. I especially liked the use of humor in his film to humanize Cruise and make us laugh at the struggle.<br/><br/>I could never have imagined Tom Cruise having the screen presence to own a role such as this one.  I found him a modern man and not transitional like Crowe or Gibson.  After a short battle with my own perspective, Cruise melts those miscast fears aside.  His ability to sell this character, a man whom had been so conflicted about his life, so disappointed in his path, creating a man who discovered what the human spirit is about and how honor and family in this far away culture had become something to fight and possibly die for. The transformation of his Captain Algren's spirit takes some time but is well done.  We are spoon fed this new culture not forced fed.    The background and splendor of Japan add to your viewing pleasure and enhanced by the wonderful score created by Hans Zimmer whose credits include `Black Hawk Down' and 'Crimson Tide'.  The fight scenes have a magical feel of realism and enhanced by the choreographed musical connection.  John Toll does a masterful job with the cinematography; his ability to exact perfect lens placement and not rushing us through the fight scenes is remarkable. John Toll's past accomplishments include `Legends of the fall' and `Vanilla Sky'.  This film will certainly garner an Art Direction Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The finest acting job and a certain supporting Oscar nominee is Ken Watanabe.  His past credits are nothing of notable stature but his character is so powerful, so prefect, you truly believe he is the warrior who exhibits honor and the respect of the culture.<br/><br/>Another finely placed actor is Billy Connolly who I remember for his unforgettable role in `Boondock Saints', he plays the likeable and affable sidekick to Cruise.<br/><br/>Each of the acting players is well cast.  Director Zwick steals a page out of the Spielberg playbook by utilizing children as the heart and soul of the conflict.  Their smiles, laugher and facial expressions humanize what could be seen as an epic war movie. None of the actors was more effective in their role than the young Japanese woman who helps Captain Algren's heal from his battle wounds.<br/><br/>Edward Zwick utilizes his incredible vision here like other great films which we have seen from his past films such as `Glory', `Shakespeare in Love', and `Traffic' to lead this cast and crew to excellence in every scene.  The 'Last Samurai' was written by John Logan who penned the Oscar winner `Gladiator'.<br/><br/>The `Last Samurai' is the best story of the year and is done with all the richness of other classic epics from year's past.  I feverishly kept writing down notes like human spirit, honor, family, love, respect, spirit and commitment.   It also has the underlining love story that glues the honor and sprit together.   I regret giving `Master and Commander' ten of ten at this point.  In hindsight `Last Samurai' is a bigger more full film, one with more action, more heart, and more emotional connection.<br/><br/>This film is the best of the best for 2003."

","I had been looking forward to this movie for sometime, having been a former resident of Japan and relatively familiar with this chapter of Japanese history. We all have similar experiences of going into a movie with high expectations, either because of the hype, the word of mouth or some other reason only to come away disappointed and wondering really what the fuss was all about.  It did not disappoint me despite my high expectations. Leading up to it, I've heard comparisons to Dances With Wolves and there are some similarities in the story, but another comparison I overheard was that it was similar to Braveheart.  A fitting comparison, however, the supporting characters in Samurai are developed well enough to make for a much deeper and richer movie than Braveheart was in my opinion.  The action scenes, whether hand-to-hand combat or the larger scale battles were vivid and there were a few homages to Kurosawa and his<br/><br/>cinematographer throughout the movie as well.  Brilliant."
"TypicalJeff","10","1","2","29 November 2003"," Epic Excellence
","I came into this film with high hopes. The trailer left me with a fluttery feeling in my chest. I am a big fan of any and ALL movies involving Samurai. So, when I got wind of this movie I immediately started anticipating it. Disappointment is the last thing this film gave me. If anything this is definitely one of the best films of the year, if not THE best. This is certainly a movie that will get a few nods from the Academy.<br/><br/>So, what made it so good? Three parts: Cruise, Plot, Battle. Cruise: I've always been a fan of Tom Cruise, though I've never been one to say his acting is top-notch. However, with his last few films I've been impressed with him. After seeing him taking on this role as he did I am now convinced he is a very credible and wonderful actor. He was believable as an alcoholic Civil War veteran, but also fell into the character of a newly converted samurai so very well. Intensity was one of the key factors to Cruise's character, but also the introspective moments.. the moments of growth were pulled off skillfully. I would NOT be surprised at ALL if Cruise gets a nomination for ""Best Actor"" on this one, folks. Plot: As always one of the most important elements of a film is the plot. No story, no enjoyment. This movie has a great plot, and I give a round of applause to John Logan for writing it. From the beginnings of introducing Algren to the samurai encampment to the blood-soaked battlefields nearer the end of the film. With each new event .. Logan managed to craft good transitions and good dialogue. What I REALLY loved though, was his use of both English and Japanese. It wasn't forced, but natural. Love to see that. Overall the plot was great and really had no slow points in it. I never got bored, that's for sure. Battle: Going into this film I knew there would be some excellent battle scenes. After hearing of the film's budget this was an absolute certainty. I was not wrong either. I found the last battle to be quite a stunning visual display. Kudos to Zwick and the cinematographer for painting the picture so well. Not only were the battle scenes gripping, but scored well too! Hot damn! I was on the edge of my seat. Also of note were the other characters in this movie. As good as Cruise was.. this movie would have been lacking if it had not been for the wonderful Japanese/American cast supporting it. Katsumoto's actor( I forget his name) was perfect. PERFECT! This movie is a must-see. That's all there is to it."

","I Have just returned from a sneak preview of this film. I must at first say to the movie ""lover"", those of us, who look forward to riding the celuloid magic carpet to where ever it takes us...you won't be disappointed. When you combine the magnificent beauty of John Toll's cinematography, the pure rapture of Hans Zimmer's score and finally the fierce/yet serene/antagonistic/yet understanding relationship between Cruise and Wantanabe...you have the mysteriously paradoxical beauty that is the Far East. We have much to be ashamed for in our forced militaristic intervention into this civilized culture...one that existed for thousands of years before our own. For more insight into how we corrupted the Japanese way of life, please READ the hot best seller by James Bradley...Flyboys. You will better appreciate what American imperialism has done and continues to do. Tom Cruise gives a stellar, underplayed potrayal of the American soldier who has ""obeyed orders"" one too many times. Through his capture by the ""enemy"", he is given the chance to learn the purity/ dedication/ power and loyalty of the samurai. Wantanabe also teaches us, in an equally underplayed non-preaching portrayal. The movie does have tones of ""Dances With Wolves"" and the riveting climatic battle scene, reminescent of ""Little Big Man"" will have many of you squirming in your seats. But the final homage paid to a great and loyal leader will show that the mind can conquer matter."

","I'm going to make my comments short about this movie.  It's just so good that I could sit here and type too many things about it.  Basically this is definitely one of the must see movies that should be seen this year.  I waited for about a year and a half for this movie and was not the least bit disappointed, in fact, I was very impressed.  This definitely tops the two Matrix movies and Kill Bill for 2003 and quite possibly could and should contend ROTK.  Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as he always usually does in his more serious sided movies, but the real spotlight here is on Ken Watanabe.  He plays the leader of the samauri.  He should and probably will be nominated for best supporting actor in the Oscars.  In fact, I'm going to go ahead and say that he will probably win it.  The academy loves situations like this: a foreigner who just surprises eveyrone.  Not only do I think he will win I hope he does.  Definitely go see this.

When I first saw the trailer, I thought to myself, ""I have to see this movie"". I saw a sneak preview last night, and I have to say, it completely blew me away.<br/><br/>The drama of this movie was more than I could handle. The way the samurai fought, the way they would never give up until the very death, and the way they loved life. This movie amazed me from start to finish. It starts off a little slow, but this allows you to see the development of Tom Cruise's and Ken Watanabe's characters.<br/><br/>The action sequences were very well done. Since there was little CGI involved in this picture, it gave you a very real feel to the battles. They were very gritty, brutal scenes. It really hit you hard when the samurai were being shot with those weapons.<br/><br/>In closing, The Last Samurai should be an Oscar contender for next year, and I will remember it as one of the greatest movies I have ever seen."

"janyeap","Null","1","2","24 November 2003"," It's capturing the dramatic human emotions with the fading of traditions
","An enchanting epic of immense proportions! - to stun  the audience with cinematic wonder!  The scenes flip-flop in our eyes with not only very intense, but phenomenally sensual and breathless moments. The silent passions' between Tom Cruise's Capt. Algren and Koyuki's Taka is the sweetest cinematic moments I've seen this year  for this alone, I'd see this film several times! <br/><br/>Through the narration of Tom Cruise's Captain Algren, a Civil War hero, the audience is given to understand how economic interests had paved the way for the Meiji Emperor's administration to destroy the Samurai cultures. Through his story, the consequences of Japan's forcible modernization, in the 1870s, are devastatingly painful to watch. The Captain's story also offers an insight into Japan's revamping of war tactics with the help of the U.S. Government. This seemingly must be the era when the stocks of Civil War artillery, including the Winchester repeating rifles and the Gatling guns, started to cross over the oceans from America to foreign soils. The audience watches as pragmatism replaces courage, self-interest steals the place of sacrifice and honor becomes an ancient phenomenon. Kudos to Director Zwick - the battle between the Samurais and the Imperial Army is extraordinarily STUNNING!  He succeeds in allowing the audience to capture the facial emotions of men in the battlefield without letting the scenes ramble in chaotic mess with the over-kill of CGI special effects.<br/><br/>Cruise brings a mesmerizing exhibit to his Algren character. From the expressions of a man disillusioned by his shamefully cynical with his American Civil War experiences, to the impressions of a men where nothing else matters safe for the alcohol and financial gains, and then gradually succumbing to his spiritual discipline before he flouts against the ideals of imperialism and takes command at the warfront Cruise's performance is astounding.  Hey, Cruise will even heave up some unsuspected laughter from the audience with one beautifully crafted scene. Koyuki in her role as Taka brings unforgettable delight and aesthetic beauty to the screen.  The onscreen chemistry between them is deliciously portrayed  I'd be surprised if watching the pair together doesn't set every viewer's heart pounding! Cruise offers a credible performance of a man whose facial countenance and features changes with his moods, temperament and sensitivity. I felt I was watching a Shakespearean drama encompassed with the depth and breath of rich elegance and imagery as in Matsuo Basho and Masaoka Shiki's haiku. <br/><br/>
Every camera exposure of the scenes in this film, and of characters and their interactions is magnificent treated.  The characters may be fictionalized, but the story is quilted with the interesting historical and cultural aspects of that Japanese era. Ken Watanabe offers a striking performance with his tall and stately, yet so graciously portrayed Katsumoto, the Last Samurai.'  He looks so immaculate on screen!  His character is based on Takamori Saigo, the 19th Century heroic figure known for his patriotism and services. Every member in this film beautifully fits into his/her role. The cinematography is fantastic.  The music score and soundtracks are simply astounding streaming in and out of scenes to create a riveting experience for the audience.   <br/><br/>This is a film definitely is worth seeing.  Oscar nominations? Absolutely! A+"
"merrywood","8","1","2","17 December 2003"," A moving celebration of life.
","Overall The Last Samurai is a beautifully written document visualized by some of the top professionals of the film trade. It is a fiction; however, an overlay nesting over a historical period of transition in Japan as it begins to embrace the West after centuries of isolation.<br/><br/>
All of the finest production values are in place. My most ardent complaint is the selection of Tom Cruise as the protagonist. At no point in the picture did I or could I forget that I was looking at Tom Cruise playing a part. This single quirk withheld the moviegoing experience from its promise of sufficiency for me.<br/><br/>Still, I must recommend the film. It is powerfully moving and produced with the artistry that only the top professionals in the pixbiz can accomplish. More than likely we all know the film's Logline: A man who loses his soul on the killing fields of the late 19th Century Indian Wars of the American West finds it again in the far Eastern spiritual vortex of a Japan also in transition. <br/><br/>The movie suggests that those who embraced Samurai and its Bushido Code were all noble, decent men, which is of course not true. Yet embedded within the concept of Samurai (which most us know means ""to serve"") is the idea of honor. In this idea we see that there was never really a ""last Samurai"" in Japan but that Samurai underwent spiritual transition to a work and production ethic. This ethic today leads the entire world in peerless industrial achievement and products that are generally unmatched in quality by any other nation."
"dworldeater","9","3","12","6 January 2020"," Tom Cruise is The Last Samurai? Yeah sure, why not?
","Before I sat down to watch the film, thought the premise of Tom Cruise as The Last Samurai was completely ridiculous. But in the context of the film it makes sense and The Last Samurai is a great movie indeed. Tom Cruise is an a self loathing alcoholic soldier that gets a job abroad in a rapidly modernized Japan to train Japanese soldiers. In a battle with their enemy, the last remaining clan of samurai he ends up in captivity. In the months that follow after living with the samurai, he ends up embracing the traditional Japanese culture and changing his ways. This is easily my favorite movie that Tom Cruise has made and he delivers a great performance as the lead. Ken Wantanabe gives a extremely powerful performance in his English language debut as the leader of the samurai clan. The film itself is really well put together and beautifully shot and scored. The battle scenes look fantastic as well. This is really well done epic film making and great entertainment. This is mostly a good story about a man and his personal journey of redemption. But also brings to light western imperialism and racism that runs deep in our culture and how it has effected the world at large. Great movie, really well done."
"Raptorclaw155","7","2","7","5 April 2020"," Still an Enjoyable Film and even Impressive in Some Parts
","There are many films with similar similar stories to this one, both older and newer. Despite that, however, this film remains to be my favorite of them. My first exposure to this film was in high school when, during our global history class, we watched this as a way to introduce the Japan unit. Of course, there are a myriad of historical inaccuracies which numerous people have already pointed out but there are some aspects and themes brought up by the film which do touch on some very important historical and cultural themes which can't go ignored.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I have with this film is how Omura is kind of an evil guy who distorts the wishes of the Emperor and acts on them. In making a historical film I believe that introducing greater nuance in the motivations of the villain might help us understand the scope of the division between the two factions. Katsumoto is afraid that Japan is changing too quickly, but why? There's no explanation about why the Japanese government wants to push for modernization so quickly. The only real explanation- which is all implied- is that the Japanese government and Japanese society as a whole believes the Samurai to be relics of an less-civilized past and should, therefore, be eradicated at any cost. Samurai are treated more like an ethnicity in this film than a class of people and as a result, Japan's move towards modernization appears more to be something to push back from because it is inherently evil with evil intentions. Again, not to criticize this film for historical inaccuracy, but, this missing bit of information could help broaden the film thematically and give a greater impact to the Meiji Emperor's refusal to sign the trade agreement with the American ambassador at the end.<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the film goes, on an emotional level, it is quite effective. You feel attached to nearly all the characters Algren meets while in captivity and watching them be slain at the end of the film is surprisingly more impactful than one might expect. For me, this was especially so with ""Bob.""<br/><br/>I really enjoy this movie and I can't help but feel that its extensive use of the Japanese language as well as English, for a big budget Hollywood blockbuster in 2003 makes it feel quite progressive in many ways, as we all know multilingual (or non-English) films still have a hard time enticing American audiences in 2020. It's not necessarily the most educational film ever produced, and there is a little bit too much of the glorification of the Samurai and Bushido which would cause trouble (historically speaking- especially during the Second World War) for my liking, but I do still think it offers a close-enough broad overview of what things were kind of like back then. If the history doesn't entice you, then it is still quite a well-made film which is enjoyable to watch simply for the entertainment value or the immersion in this alternate universe of sorts."
"LemonLadyR","4","2","7","11 November 2017"," Nothing Original, Wooden Cruise
","It's a good thing that Lawrence of Arabia and Dances with Wolves ('Lawrence of the plains') had already been done, else the writers would not have had a ready made script for this movie. And thus there is little that is original here. This too is a ""white savior movie"", with Cruise the savior. But Cruise is just terrible in this movie. He is a one note actor and relies on a few expressions and drama school techniques which all great actors rise above and develop into their own styles, but Cruise never has elevated himself to. He lacks sensitivity and what makes women (and men) fall in love with an actor, so that, in the end, he has no depth, no charisma, no power, and this role demands quiet power. And now, in the 21st century, all I see when I look at him is what he has become, a rabid cult leader (Scientology).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast save this movie from a 1-star debacle. Superb ensemble. Ken Watanabe is a powerful treasure. His amazing transformation from this role to his delicate performance in Memoirs of a Geisha shows an amazing range. I think he is why Cruise's deficits are so apparent here. And I would watch Timothy Spall in anything. He may be a poor man's Philip Seymour Hoffman, but for me, he is all his own. It is hard to imagine this is the same actor who played a rock band's lovable road manager in Rock Star, but he finely crafts each role.<br/><br/>While I am no fan of white savior movies, I don't mind the implied white apology of some of them. And we Americans do have some apologizing to do, for our extreme hubris and various crimes against humanity. Too bad we can't just get up and say it out loud, apologize, and get it over with, without the racial overtones of movies like this (oh my, the natives/foreigners are really nice and even *funny*, wow!). But until then, our conscience is played out in movies like this. Although hopefully, with less pathos and white dominance than The Last Samurai. Will we ever 'get' it?"

","Why is it that any film made since ""Dances with Wolves"" portrays the U.S. Cavalry as ruthless baby-killers? That's the premise of Tom Cruises character and his hatred of the U.S. is blatant. That premise is utterly ridiculous and ignores the reality of how brutal the American Indian tribes were not only against women and children of Western settlers but also against each other as tribe fought tribe.<br/><br/>The film displays some fine acting and a very good foundation of Samurai life and death. There are two battle scenes in the film, both of which are well done. Unfortunately, some of the plot makes no sense and appears to exist merely to display a forum for the characters to display their abilities. **Spoiler: What exactly is wrong with the American proposal?** We don't know because it's not important to the writers to tell us. Well, in the whole context of the film, it is important that we know. Otherwise, what really is the point of this film?<br/><br/>While I did not appreciate the anti-Americanism that was displayed through Tom Cruise's character, I do recommend the film on a semi-historical level and some very fine acting. But, please, take the hatred that Cruise's character bears against the U.S. Cavalry with a grain of salt because it's just more anti-American garbage coming out of Hollywood."

To his surprise, it was that barbarian who he and his friends at the army labeled that showed him the right way and helped him get over his nightmares as he started learning the way of the sword and managed to conceal his old sense of what it meant to be a warrior.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" was more than a warring state between the traditional side of Japan and the wanna-be-modern side of it, it was a journey of self-redemption that ended up affecting the ties of that war on a larger scale by the hands of a man that never feared death, but sometimes wished for it.<br/><br/>The historical setting of the movie isn't 100% accurate with some tweaks to help carry on the emotion you'd expect from a movie, with a bit cliché tropes here and there but it was all just to enhance the experience and make it closer for even non-Japanese to get all of those references they throw at you."

","There is an argument, that the ways generally Samurais are portrayed in the pop-culture is not truly accurate and many of them were corrupt. They resisted the modernization of Japan in 19th century under the Emperor Meiji, because it was going to take away their privileges as a warrior class. But Meiji's step (somewhat reluctant) was a visionary one and he brought the modern ideas into his country and started the industrialization, so that the Europeans couldn't get opportunity to fully dominate the land of a rising Sun. And till now, it is appreciated how Japan formed a perfect balance between the modern state and a state which values it's cultural identity. That's where India failed, due to lack of centralization of political power in 19th century.<br/><br/>This epic scale movie doesn't address that complex situation of that era; however it communicates the idea of the importance of one's own culture and its values. There is something beautiful about the previous generation war movies. They feel more real than today's movies made with the excessive use of visual effects."

This is one of my all-time favorite films. The first time I saw this movie I was deeply affected by it. The thing that surprised me the most is that while the battle scenes are epic and very well done, not these were the focus of this film. The focus of this film is a heartfelt friendship that blossoms between the main characters (Nathan Algren & Katsumoto) who both come from very different cultures.
Also not to be overlooked is Hans Zimmer's beautiful score that I listen almost every day.
The Last Samurai to me is a very underrated film with great performances, beautiful soundtracks and wonderful storyline."

","I almost feel guilty making a review of this movie but I feel that one should be made after all this time. I had always kind of been a fan of Tom Cruise like many others and when I found out his religious Scientology background it kind of threw me off as I'm sure many of you felt the same way. I just wanted to tell the majority that this movie is more than Tom Cruise it's fabulous it has something that everyone wishes to achieve maybe it's Harmony I'm not sure but it definitely conveys a great message. With all the different things that are going on in our world it's nice to kind of go back to the beginning of simpler things."

","Last Samurai is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Tom Cruise as Nathan Algren is brilliant.<br/><br/>The development of the relationship between Algren and Taka and her sons was beautiful to see.

"crberme","7","1","3","7 September 2017"," Lot's of Japanese culture and self-improvement, but that's not a bad thing
","I wasn't expecting much from this film, but something cached my attention when I knew about it and I'm glad it did. The Last Samurai is a great package of Japanese culture, action scenes and self improvement.<br/><br/>The plot is very typical of this genre: There's two sides at war and our main character gets involved in the middle of the conflict. However, there's a twist here that I really appreciated: This movie is not about good vs bad and a guy becomes a legend, this is more about the process, the meantime, and it's something that even thought is becoming a cliché. It adds value to a film that otherwise would be just a show to make people feel impressed.<br/><br/>Also, this film is stunning visually. There's a lot of beautiful landscapes although the action scenes are a little bit bland, and I think it's Tom Cruise's fault, who lacks movement in fight scenes. Talking about Tom Cruise, his presence looks kind of out of place in this role, but I could be possible that it was intentional. If the purpose was to make him look like an outsider, well done. Apart from that, the cast is great, and I wouldn't complain about their performances.<br/><br/>To wrap up my review, this is a great movie even thought is nothing transcendental. It also gives a good key message, which is a plus. And if you like long movies you'll be pleased to sit with this one for two and a half hours."
"Uriah43","8","1","3","12 April 2017"," A Very Entertaining Action Film
","This film begins in 1876 with a Samurai warlord by the name of ""Katsumoto"" (Ken Watanabe) meditating on a hill in Japan and having an eerie vision of a white tiger fighting for its life in an extremely fierce and desperate battle. The scene then shifts to a small town in America where a Medal-of-Honor winner named ""Captain Nathan Algren"" (Tom Cruise) is demonstrating to the crowd the capabilities of a brand new Winchester repeating rifle. Not long afterward he is recruited to come to Japan to teach Japanese soldiers how to fight using Western weapons and techniques to be used primarily against an internal rebellion of Samurai warriors led by none other than--Katsumoto. Accompanying him is a former commander he intensely dislikes by the name of ""Colonel Bagley"" (Tony Goldwyn) along with a respected comrade-in-arms named ""Sergeant Zebulon Gant"" (Billy Connolly). Yet, even though he is strictly a military adviser it is only a matter of time before Captain Algren and his raw recruits meet Katsumoto and his highly-skilled samurai on the field of battle-and neither of them will be the same afterward. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very entertaining action film which managed to capture the turmoil and anguish brought on by the Meiji Restoration in a superb manner. Likewise, the performances of Ken Watanable and Tom Cruise were also first-rate as well. In short, I enjoyed this film and I definitely recommend it to those who might be interested."
"Leofwine_draca","10","1","3","16 August 2016"," Stunning war action and a hard act to follow
","I was feeling a little disheartened about the state of the box-office in 2004; after watching RETURN OF THE KING, I knew nothing could better that movie and there was nothing really interesting on the horizon, either. Now, after watching THE LAST SAMURAI and noting the series of historical epics on the way, I'm starting to feel much, much better. THE LAST SAMURAI is a great movie, a breathtaking epic that equals Jackson's masterpiece in places, and certainly the frequent action scenes are shot in a much more violent, realistic and easier to follow way than in that fellow classic. THE LAST SAMURAI is a brilliant example of what Hollywood can do when it gets things right, recalling countless other epics such as BRAVEHEARt.<br/><br/>The film, which is long, is slowly paced, which makes a pleasing change. There's time for scope here, plenty of characterisation, sparkling and meaningful dialogue, and a handful of characters you really get to understand and care about. Tom Cruise is basically doing his heroic self, but there's nothing wrong with that these days. This is definitely his best in terms of performance though, and he fits the role like a glove. However, this isn't a film about Cruise: instead it's a film about the Japanese, and Ken Watanabe shines in particular as the fierce, proud and deeply honourable rebel leader. Watch out for Japanese cult hero Hiroyuki Sanada, second only to Sonny Chiba in terms of bad-assedness, as a real cool warrior who nobody can beat.<br/><br/>The trio of western actors are good, too, as is every performer in this movie. Sure, it's pretty downbeat with some tragic elements, but the action is just so breathtaking that I was moved every time. The camera-work and the sweep of the orchestral score just adds to the beautiful experience. The fights are gory, with decapitations, impalements and the like, and there are some real adrenaline-pumping scenes: a wounded Cruise fighting off half a dozen samurai; the amazing ninja attack; and most of all the final battle, which is one of the best that I've seen on the screen. A great movie and a real cinematic experience, this is definitely a hard act to follow."
"Tweekums","8","1","3","8 May 2016"," Tom Cruise becomes a samurai warrior
","By 1876 Captain Nathan Algren, a decorated hero of the American Civil War, has become an alcoholic; haunted by the atrocities to took part in against the Native Americans. He is making a living helping to sell rifles until he is offered a position helping to train the Japanese army who are trying to put down a rebellion by the few remaining samurai. These warriors cling to the old ways and fight with traditional weapons but can't admit that their time is over. Algren quickly sees that the Japanese conscripts he is training aren't ready to fight but they are ordered into battle anyway. He joins then and after they are routed he is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto. He is nursed back to health and over the course of the winter he goes to respect Katsumoto, his samurais and their way of life; so much to that he lays down his guns and takes up the samurai sword to fight with them even though he knows that ultimately they cannot win.<br/><br/>This might not be an historically accurate film but it is still gripping. The action scenes are very impressive and feel real as men with swords go up against men with guns. Tom Cruise is on top form as Capt. Algren and Ken Watanabe excels as Katsumoto; an honourable man who continues his fight even though he is fully aware that it isn't a fight he can win. The growing friendship between these two characters is a joy to watch. The rest of the cast were good too; I especially liked Timothy Spall's appearance as an English translator/photographer and Billy Connolly's cameo as Algren's friend Sgt Gant. The New Zealand scenery, filling in for Japan, looks stunning without detracting from the story we are watching. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the stars or those wanting a gripping war film with some great action scenes and a fine plot."
"KineticSeoul","10","1","3","19 February 2016"," Excellent fantasy film!
","This isn't a very accurate historical movie and not because it has a white guy playing the Last Samurai. But it's a riveting movie, that has depth and a style that sticks. I remember watching this in theaters and being blown away by how immersive and entertaining this film was at that time. I still watch it from time to time and just doesn't seem to get old. I love films, but a film has to be exceptionally good for me to revisit and check out all over again. And like I said, I watched this movie multiple times. It's like a fantasy movie with historical elements coming to life. And when I mean fantasy, I mean the way they portrayed the samurais in this. They really tried to over glorify and glamorize the samurai and their way of life. It made it appear more like a samurai anime over real samurais in japan at the time. Like they only cared about honor over hierarchy and power. The armor, appearance and the way they dressed was off as well. Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is a more realistic portrayal of samurais. But that is just what it is, it's a samurai fantasy movie and it's very entertaining to sit through. The film is over about 2 hours and 30 minutes long but feels like a 1 and a half film. While the story being inspired by a real historical figure Jules Brunet, it doesn't even touches the surface when it comes to that area. Watching this is sort of like watching a epic ""300"" movie. Except with more immersive and heartfelt story that strays away from it just being about the action and violence with more character development. Tom Cruise is outstanding in this and was at the time the perfect guy to play the lead role as the emotionally damaged character named Nathan Algren. Who is a captain in this story that fought against the Indians and has guilt trips about it all. This was the breakout role for Ken Watanabe who plays the supporting character in this. As katsumoto who is the leader of the samurais, he brings about charisma and standout presence when he is on screen. Some say this is like ""Dances with Wolves"" except with samurais. However I liked this film more. This is a emotional film about code and honor, that pierces through the screen and has an affect like Hayao Miyazaki films. <br/><br/>10/10"

After centuries of relying on hired samurai for national defense, the Japanese monarchy has decided to do away with the warriors in favor of a more contemporary military. Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, a veteran of the U.S. Civil War who is hired by the Emperor Meiji to train an army capable of wiping out the samurai.

"TMifune1961","10","1","3","1 March 2015"," A Beautiful Tale Of Redemption and Inner-peace
","""The Last Samurai"" is often criticized as another ""white man goes into a different culture, identifies himself with their beliefs, and changes his view and outlook upon them only to join with their cause."" Like ""Dances With Wolves"" for example. It's been disgustingly reviewed, on this board too, as another ripoff of just such a film. This film is beloved by people (Especially Japanese) and if any College Professor calls this film as another example of ""Orientalism"" or ""White-Man's Burden"" they are dead wrong and need to do some research or have their PHD removed. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a man haunted by the actions he took by killing a Native American tribe by the orders of Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) and drowns himself in alcohol to numb the inner pain he feels. He's hired to train Japanese soldiers during Japan's Meji Period. He's captured during the soldiers first battle with the samurai and brought to their village. After the hell of alcohol withdrawal he endures, he slowly begins a friendship with Katsamoto (Ken Watanabe) who, through the samurai code of Bushido, accepts begins to forgive himself and find a new reason for living. Through the experiences he encounters with the village people he begins a transition and while he doesn't immediately realize it, is being mentored by the people, especially Katsamoto himself. He begins to realize what these so called ""primitive savages"" are fighting to uphold: the code of the Samurai itself. What I find interesting is that both Algriens and Katsamoto's values rub off one another. This is why Algrein chooses to associate himself with the samurai and Katsamoto's cause. ""We've become nothing but a country of whores, selling ourselves to the highest bidder"" is what Katsamoto says during the film. The bottom line is this: don't let the cover image of Tom Cruise or whatever opinion you have of him, dissuade you from seeing this tale of redemption and inner-peace."

","When I first saw this at the age of 8 I thought it was really good. When I revisited it several years later it became quite possibly my favourite film. I'm not quite sure why, I don't like Tom Cruse that much and as far as historical inaccurate Hollywood mainstream over the top films go, this fits the bill. But for some unknown reason I love this film. Its bazaar. Not only that but it gets me at an emotional level. I cry ever time. Perhaps its the representation of conflicting cultures with east meats west plot line with clashing cultures. Additionally there is the tradition or modernization discourse which accompanies it. So perhaps the film speaks to me on a cultural level, I am one for loving the past. Or maybe just the fact I really like cherry blossom means I love this film. Either way I love this film."

","How to write a review that can fully express my appreciation for the last samurai is very difficult.<br/><br/>To avoid all the confusion of 'what the hell is Tom Cruise doing in a movie about samurai?', watch the movie with the premise that Ken Watanabe's character is the protagonist and Tom is a translator to bridge the Japanese culture with the west.<br/><br/>Upon visiting a Japanese friend in Yokohama, I asked everyone I met if they believed the movie represented the through should of Japan. They all said yes.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where the different elements such as storyline, film score and acting performance enforce each other into creating an unforgettable emotional roller-coaster and climax.<br/><br/>The movie artfully captures two clashes; the clash of a modernizing Japan, in conflict with its time honoured traditions and the clash of a warrior that has lost his purpose with a person whose sole purpose it is to be a warrior.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly one of Hans Zimmer's finest scores; put on 'a small measure of peace' and simply close your eyes and you will feel what I mean.<br/><br/>Simply breathtaking"
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","22 March 2012"," Honor, Integrity, Beauty & Self-Discovery
","Quite sound in its portrayal of old Japanese customs, traditions and way of life, nicely written by Zwick, convincingly performed by the cast, impressive work by the crew and stunning music by Hans Zimmer, The Last Samurai is a tale of romanticism vs modernism, purity vs corruption, and also a conflict of two different cultures.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai tells the tale of Captain Nathan Algren who, traumatized by his inner demons, is given an assignment to defeat the samurai warriors to clear the road for the westernization of Japan by colonial powers during the late 19th century Japan. Defeated and taken hostage by the samurai, Algren undergoes a complete transformation, discovering the power of the enemy, respecting their way of life, embracing their customs and finally taking up arms with them in fighting the army he originally joined for the preservation of their culture.<br/><br/>Although director Edward Zwick's research of Japanese history, culture, customs, traditions and accent is impressive, the plot could've made a greater impact than it did as the movie was not as emotionally investing as expected. The camera work is really good, both in the battle scenes and in picturing the westernization of 19th century Japan. The landscapes are beautifully photographed and traditions effectively captured. Tom Cruise plays the traumatic Captain Algren and his performance was convincing. Ken Watanabe plays Katsumoto, the samurai leader, and was the most impressive of the cast and did a terrific job. The movie overall keeps a good pace and narrative and scores high on the entertainment level.<br/><br/>Coming to the music, Hans Zimmer has written a brilliant score for the movie that stays true to the Japanese way of music. It weaves itself effortlessly with every event in the movie, striking the right cord at the right time and is one aspect of the film that carries no complaints and without a doubt is another stunning feature in Zimmer's bag.<br/><br/>Overall, The Last Samurai is worth your time. The overly melodramatic ending does betray the movie in some way and the film as a whole may lack the authority and emotional impact of the legendary films of its genre, but this epic tale of honor and integrity is still a ride that in the end felt pretty damn good."
"fredericksmith1952","10","1","3","1 March 2012"," Based very loosely on the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877
","Based very loosely on the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877, this two and one half hour epic is one of the closest views to Japanese life before western culture ever shot by an American. Tom Cruise shows us his ability to develop and mature as a character throughout the film, and Ken Watanabe displays the quiet yet powerful acting he is known for. The power and emotion of the film are riveting, and the scenery is incredibly beautiful. Supporting roles are exceptionally acted, with special credit to Billy Connolly for his brilliant, if not brief, portrayal as Sargent Zebulon Grant, the hard nosed enlisted man who is tasked with ""whipping"" the soldiers into shape. The only major flaw I see is a technical one that was added to the film to provide a more dramatic ending, and that is the use of Gatling Guns, which were in use in South America and Europe at the time, but not in the Orient. I believe Mr. Zwick did an excellent job in portraying the Imperial Court politics of the day. Omura is the prime example of a man consumed with greed and power, and his influence over the Emperor Meiji, the boy who has been thrust into the role of living god, is evident in every scene. Rated R for violence and language, this film is probably acceptable for teens who play battle games on their X-Box or Play Stations, but the little ones should probably be in bed or doing something else. Collectible for fans of Tom Cruise, good drama, or anyone who wants a little insight into the way of the Samurai."
"nicksftw92","10","1","3","9 November 2010"," The Single Most Amazing Film Ever Made
","The Last Samurai is a monumental film directed by (Sir - as I think he should be knighted for such a film) Edward Zwick with Tom Cruise as the protagonist accompanied by Ken Watanabe (who frankly steals every scene he is in). For those of you who do not like Tom Cruise, or cannot appreciate him as an actor, you're in luck, because in this movie you can hardly believe such an awe inspiring performance can be given by such a loony man.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately about the psychological struggle of a soldier as he tries to forget what he has done in his military days, serving under a merciless leader, Custor. He is hired for another job training the Japanese army in order to fight the Samurai rebellion (who believe Japan is becoming westernised too fast). To really enjoy the movie to its full capacity it must be watched more than once. The movie contains a lot of symbolism and is by no means the average persons movie, as it requires a lot of what the educated call ""thinking"". To understand the movie in all of its beauty, you must devote time to understanding Algren's character and how he chronicles his life, and ultimately his evolution to peace of mind. Algren chronicles his life through a diary and narrates much of the movie as we virtually enter the mind of Nathan Algren.<br/><br/>It begins with an introduction of Kastumoto (Ken Watanabe) doing what seems to be meditation, thinking of a white tiger, which later equates to mercy and a friendship between Katsumoto and Algren. We are then immediately engulfed into the world of Algren's character and personality as we see that he is a washed up soldier doing educational plays for the community. During this scene we see how morbid his character is, as he reflects on the hell he had to endure while under the command of Custor. Throughout the beginning of the film we see that he is a clear alcoholic (and he uses this to escape the reality of what he has done) and as the film progresses we see his declining need for it as he comes to terms with what he has done and finds peace within himself. Countless times he has escaped death, each time wishing it would be his last as he cannot take the strain of what he has done.<br/><br/>The movie turns around from a morbid character development of Algren to a positive progression of self portrayal after he is captured by the Samurai and held as a (somewhat free) prisoner in Katsumoto's son's village. It is here where we see perspective on his character as he realises the disgust he has for his own culture. He becomes lost in the beauty and serenity of the Samurai culture, slowly trying to learn their ways and as he does, he begins to forget about what he has done in his past and obtains a sense of closure and peace.<br/><br/>I cannot express the beauty of this film in words other than it is one of the most visually spectacular films I have ever seen. Every single actor in this film gives an absolutely amazing performance, and the directing is second to none. On top of that, there is a constant harmonizing soundtrack written by the one and only Hans Zimmer (and in my opinion is the greatest movie soundtrack ever written) which gives a beautiful ambiance to the whole movie.<br/><br/>Every time I watch The Last Samurai, I cannot help but weep at how sad the movie is and the concept of it. And for you action junkies, it has incredible fight scenes that have been amazingly choreographed.<br/><br/>I have seen this film 18 times now, and every time I love it more than the previous, and this cannot be said about 95% of the films made, but I realise something new every time. This movie changed my life and I can give it no less than a 10/10, and a movie that rivals it in my opinion is Shutter Island that I give 9.5/10 to."

Tom Cruise did just about everything right. But Ken Watanabe deserves an Oscar. He was ripped at the Academy Awards several years ago. The scenery is beautiful as the movie was filmed in Japan and New Zealand. The action scenes are perfect and all the guts and gore are shown unlike Kingdom of Heaven.

"jack-964","10","1","3","21 July 2008"," Misunderstood Perfection
","I bought this DVD a couple of years ago and really like the movie. Its one of my favorites and shows a Tom Cruise in a very different role, where he is magnificent. I had no intention of giving a review on this one, cause its not brand new and there are plenty of reviews. I did not read them all, but i read some of the 'hated it', cause i wondered why it didn't get such high votes as id like it to get and well, i have to say my thing:<br/><br/>People complained that it is not totally historically correct and I'm sure it isn't. Never looked at it as if it was. People complained Americans are too ethnocentric, putting Tom Cruise, there in the spotlight and yes they are. But this movie is that ONE Hollywood movie that *tries* to depict another culture, without throwing bombs at it and making it totally bad. Thats exactly the reason i cherish it! It could not be done without giving the American viewers something to identify with. They aren't gonna watch some serious Japanese movie... get real. Surely there will be some flaws in it, so what? The main object is to lay down a nice story, a moralistic story, in another culture, learning how that culture differs from yours and try to accept it, even appreciate it up to the fact that you want to live there! And that is done superbly! Can not be done better! This is exactly the movie that addresses what we are losing today! Our identity, our own cultures, since everything has to become western, 'civilized' capitalism. It is GREAT in showing exactly that what we know is not always best. That NEW is NOT always better! Yes without advancement we would still be apes in trees, i admit, but advancement one way, is going backwards the other. Maybe we would be better off being still apes in trees! NEW is NOT always BETTER<br/><br/>In the DVD set there is also some explanation about Bushido and i think that is far better than what we have here. (the 'west') New isn't always better. Western philosophy died decades ago. Im not saying eastern philosophy is better, cause there is none. Philosophy comes from where the Greeks started, with logic and that is exclusively reserved for that. In the east the knowledge wasn't layed down by logic reasoning that could be followed and deducted by everyone. They were written as simple, one lined moral guidelines. With all our logic reasoning philosophy and societies following with great lag (POST MODERNISM is NOTHING), we will find that west meets east. Or, we would, if the western systems hadn't swallowed everything else. Thats is why this movie is a pearl in an ocean of Hollywood pretentious bogus and drama. Ever wondered why there are so many good movies, more and more, that are about people in our free and tolerant and social western societies that are going totally crazy? It is a mirror of society. We are euthanising ourselves collectively. That is why this captain drank. He had ghosts in his head from killing Indians for the west. A whole culture slaughtered. And he ended up in Japan and saw something else...<br/><br/>Now, are you happy? And if not, to which country will you go? Aren't they all the same by now? Is that progression? It surely doesn't give you more freedom...<br/><br/>Progression is a movement in a certain direction. We call it development because we think we control where we go and think it is better if we can do this or that. But moral is subjective! Read Nietzsche! THINK! If i walk backwards, i still progress, i still develop, but who is to say if it is better or not? Do i go forward or backward?<br/><br/>New isn't always better and yes you may call it hypocrite that this movie could not have been made if we were still apes in trees, but then again, there would not be a need to make it.<br/><br/>Do you think Star Trek is realistic? Thats child's stuff. It never widens the horizon on moralistic issues. Hardly any movie does that well, if at all, because it is extremely hard to comprehend, to feel deeply that all we ever made for ourselves is ultimately hell, without any way to escape. Yea who enters here, abandon all hope. No, we rather see lies, cut and dried good and bad. Its easier on the eyes. Sleep well my friends...<br/><br/>Thats the main reason i will never let this great movie be put down by ignorant people.<br/><br/>Apart from that, it is a great story, well casted, well acted, great shots, great action, good pace, good dialogs, truly a GREAT movie. A MASTERPIECE. As The Japanese leading actor would say: ""Perfect"". as he dies. As it was supposed to be. Perfect.<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise stood there and wondered, on the brink of understanding it. He HAD to stay alive to serve the story. To be, not the pretentious westerner, but the loser who smelled at it, and got so close.<br/><br/>Go see it if you haven't."

","I really had no expectations when I got this movie on DVD. Now I am sorry I didn't get to see it on the big screen. Beautiful cinematography, excellent acting, powerful message. And not over-blown in the sense of pounding the viewer on the head with the message (although, in truth, that could have been ratcheted down a bit: we GOT it! Kind of like ""Hotel Rwanda"" or ""Last King of Scotland"" -- yes, there are terrible things which have happened...ow, stop hitting me on the head, you're already doing fine getting your message across). What is so great about ""The Last Samurai"" is that it discusses a code of honor which is a way of life even today, not just a hundred years ago.<br/><br/>One must be careful not to confuse the real-life actors with their on-screen work. (I was very impressed by Cruise in ""Vanilla Sky"" and yet lately he has become something of a caricature (this I only know from gleaning popular culture via the mainstream, since I don't watch TV or read the papers). Perhaps he has become somewhat like the character he plays in ""Magnolia,"" a fervent zealot.)) I admit I was prepared to watch another movie instead. Much to my surprise, the film was engaging immediately, and everything subsequent in the story / film was powerful, intelligent, and brilliantly done. The Japanese actors were integral to this. More to the point, the WRITING was key. This was a terrific story, using history and making it into something both visually stunning and ethics-oriented. <br/><br/>The Japanese seemed thrilled that their cultural ideals were being touted. (Based on interviews at Japanese premiere.) Also, this film must have cost a fortune to make; all the backdrops were painstakingly accurate. ""The Way of the Warrior"" or Bushido is given an impressive stance. I seldom think a film is a 10, but this was definitely worthwhile viewing."

","Very good movie set in colonial Japan. The first word that is coming up when I am thinking about this movie is --- sumptuous. There is no another word which can describe it better.

The story really delves into the samurai warrior with well-made direction. <br/><br/>In the middle of the story stands the love of the sister to Tom Cruise, all passionately inlove with the same women. Ken Watanabe is a brilliant actor. The others are also brilliant in their roles. It is like every scene has a speciall message. The lines are beautiful and so well thought out. Both the characters and the story fells credible. Upon all this the music is wonderful and powerful. Through the whole movie I burst into tears and I think that that The Last Samurail is one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>I will see it again."

The character played by Ken Watanabe seems so real, and it makes you wonder about the people you know. For example i asked myself: Do i know great characters like Katsumoto?

","I thought that the film was one of Tom Cruise's better projects. It didn't need a gazillion special effects (""Minority Report"") to bring the audience into a world that is so visually and culturally different but not unlike our own.<br/><br/>One of the biggest issues the movie deals with relates to modern day politics. Who says the Western way of life is better than anybody else's? What right as a freedom-loving people do we have to usurp the freedom of others to live as they want, to pray as they want, to pursue their own dreams and raise their children as they see fit? Religious and secular bureaucracies have imposed their will over different peoples under the guise of White Man's Burden. The Inquisition. McCarthyism. The Final Solution. Segregation. These so-called Manifest Destinies have often employed less than scrupulous methods in the name of god, government, and ""bringing civility to the savages"". Though history need not wonder who truly is the savage.<br/><br/>When a society begins to move toward modernization, often times it drifts little by little away from tradition, and not just religion or spirituality, but its roots. Knowing where we've come from, knowing our own cultural identity can help us understand where we're going as a united people and establish a balance between the past and present, secularism and tradition."

","Although the recent antics of Tom Cruise have made his acting skills even more suspect, he has fashioned a magnificent film, as producer. His acting doesn't come across as a very believable cavalry soldier, who comes to revere his captors, (akin to a Patty Hearst syndrome, or the realization of who are the real heroes in a feudal war of commerce). When he dons the samurai gear for battle, it's almost laughable, (or pathetic). The real star of the film, is without a doubt, Ken Watanabe. Powerful, and a visual delight, as leader of the last samurais, he commands the screen in every scene. His Japanese compatriots and supporting cast are, also, extraordinarily attractive and accomplished. The cinematography is authentic and gorgeous. The costumes should have won an Oscar. The story progresses like a folk tale, and concludes with a major question. This tends to leave it, unfortunately, unsatisfying and unfulfilled."
"dokada","8","1","3","27 August 2006"," A film everyone should see to gain a better understanding of the modernization of Japan
","The Last Samurai"" is a wonderful story that illustrates the evolution from traditional ways to a modern society and the adoption of the rifle and cannon as the new weapon to enforce this change. Capt. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise)was hired by the Japanese government to train their common people and ex-samurai how to fight using these modern weapons. In the beginning of the transition the Japanese Government Army had inadequate training and inexperience on the use of these weapons. They were still mystified by the samurai and as expected, the troops were slaughtered by the great warriors. Algren who was injured in the first encounter with the samurai is recuperating in the village and observes and experiences the Samurai philosophy. His training in the village helps him to understand and adopt to this traditional culture.<br/><br/>The director displayed an important message throughout the film. Emphasis on the effect firearms had in the battlefield and an illustration of the effect modernization would have in the new Japanese society . The Japanese government wanted to modernize their military and progress with the rest of the world. To achieve their goal, they needed to eliminate the rebellious Samurai and their traditional methods of combat with new weapons such as machine guns.<br/><br/>Many methods were used in the film to capture the spirit and feeling of Japan during the Meiji period, like modern photography, people's clothing and hairstyle, modern weapons and technology. The cinema photography contrasts the traditional life style of the samurai in the village where Katsumoto lived while still preserving the beauty of old Japan with the Samurai's armor, way of life, the mountain terrain with the mist among the trees and traditional weaponry. Multiple camera angles were used throughout the film to portray the greatness of the Japanese Samurai in battle."

","What can I say, the only film that starred Tom Cruise during which I forgot I was watching the Tom Cruise show. I cannot believe that Cruise did not win an Oscar for his role as Capt. Nathan Algren a disillusioned civil war hero who spends much of his time drunk and in menial employment. <br/><br/>Sent to Japan to fight the Samurai-who are fighting against the emperor's weak-willed natured and his advisers who are determined to westernise Japan; he finds himself joining their cause, and finding meaning in their lifestyle. Not only are the relationships in the film handled with extreme poignancy especially between Taka and Algren. The camera work lovingly shows Japan in all its beauty and you can understand just why Algren would be seduced by such a lifestyle.<br/><br/>A truly brilliant film, which went much ignored when released, I urge you to watch this film, especially if you liked Gladiator, Dances With Wolves or The Last of The Mohicans or if you just enjoy a great film and a great story with great attention to detail. Edward Zwick's direction tells the story at a measured pace, it seems unusual in films released today to actually find a great story; however this is certainly not the case with The Last Samurai."

"jansen-aui","8","1","3","19 June 2006"," The way of the samurai is not necessary any more ...
","Director Edward Zwick's unfairly maligned Japanese epic, The Last Samurai, is one of heart, sweeping beauty, rousing emotion, and a passionate romanticism of the Samurai. There's nothing wrong with romanticising the Samurai, of course, they are a fascinating people after all, and at the end of the day The Last Samurai is a motion picture, and motion pictures are fairy tales  make believe. Critics should forgive Zwick, then, for what may or may not be a lack of historical accuracy both in chronology and behaviour, for not to do so would be to forget The Last Samurai's touching, resonant story about the rise of modern Japan.<br/><br/>Set in the late 1870's, the film begins with war veteran Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) of the American army, pitying and drowning himself with liquor for hatred of his past actions. An old friend (Billy Connolly) persuades him to consider an offer from Mr. Omura (Masato Harada), in association with the man responsible for Algren's forgettable past, Lieutenant Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), to train the Japanese military in the use of American firearms. Despite his dislike for his former Colonel, Algren agrees to do so for the money. <br/><br/>When Colonel Bagley orders an unprepared regiment of Japanese soldiers to meet a group of ""savages""  Samurai led by the rebel Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe)  in battle, hundreds of soldiers are killed and Algren is captured and taken to the Samurai village, deep in the mountains. Katsumoto, a student of English and war, finds much to learn from Algren and holds him in captivity until the spring, when a safe passage will be cleared for his return. During this time, Algren begins seeing the Samurai in a much different light and by the time of his release, he has been shaped for the better by their gentle, spiritual, and honourable ways.<br/><br/>The cinematography in The Last Samurai is breathtaking, shot primarily in the landscapes of New Plymouth in New Zealand, capturing the essence of the Samurai way of life. The performances don't disappoint, either. While Tom Cruise was fine as Algren, and probably at the top of his dramatic game, it's the Japanese actors that stand out: Ken Watanabe, as the leader of the Samurai, delivers with such integrity, and the smaller roles of Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke Nakamura) and Algren's caretaker Taka (Koyuki) are acted with subtle, quiet, and understated power. Throughout the film's 148 minutes, Zwick adopts a slow, meaningful pace and combines his minimalist dialogue with Hans Zimmer's truly majestic score to forge the sense of epic."

","The Last Samurai is the story of an American soldier who is captured by Japenese Samurais, but as he is kept prisoner there he begins to respect the soldiers and eventually grows fond of them. He ends up befriending the samurais and fighting on their side against the Americans. This is one of the best historical type war movies there is out there, in the vain of movies like Dances With Wolves.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is very good. It shows that there can be understanding between two cultures who are taught to hate each other. The American soldier learns respect for the other culture even as he's their prisoner. And even though he's their prisoner, they learn respect for him. When they end up becoming friends, you can see they'd do anything for each other. The dialogue is also very good, even humorous at times. The fight scenes are perfect. This is one of those movies that puts you right in the battle so you can see what it would really be like.<br/><br/>I've always been a Tom Cruise fan. He's a pretty good actor. He seems like a far more down to Earth character in this film though, and it's refreshing. I can't really pick and choose good acting jobs, because they're all good. Overall, this is an amazing film, and I'd recommend it to fans of the genre.<br/><br/>8/10"
"hawkeyepierce3191","9","1","3","7 June 2006"," A versatile drama worthy of a wide audience's attention.
","The Last Samurai is not what you might call ""4 star Oscar material"" - but it manages to succeed simultaneously as a drama and as an action piece, and it manages to deal with many different forms of emotion on many different levels.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise stars as Nathan Algren, an American captain who is called to fight the Japanese Samurai. Algren is haunted by his memories of the Native American slaughter, and they keep returning to him - until he is defeated by the Samurai and taken in to learn their ways. You can tell that the movie borrows from the book ""Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,"" since some of the stories and motifs from the book are very familiar within the movie, and since Algren's history with the Indians is an apparent backdrop for the movie's story. The word ""savage"" is used heavily by the hardcore American fighters, and like in the book, Algren is spared from his comrades' fate because the enemy appreciates how hard he fought.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so versatile is how, at different points in the story, it can cover many dramatic feelings with such subtle touches. The story that is told through Algren's adventures begins with remorse. Upon encountering Katsumoto - the wisened leader of the samurai, masterfully portrayed by Ken Watanabe - Algren begins to understand the samurai, and he learns honor, discipline, and culture. Under Edward Zwick's beautiful direction, you can manage to understand and appreciate the themes of the movie by watching more than listening.<br/><br/>What holds The Last Samurai back is the choice of Tom Cruise for the protagonist. While he is not a bad actor at all, he himself is too glamorous and scandalous for a role that is intended to be subdued. Also, he manages to look convincing in everything he does, but something about the way he sounds is inconsistent and out of pace with the other actors in the film. He seems to approach this the same way he approached Minority Report - while he was perfect for that role, it doesn't work the same way here. Finally, one thing the film dwells on for too long is the concept of destiny. You know it's gone too far when it is asked if you can change your destiny when, as any logical person would tell you, part of the idea of destiny is that you have to end somewhere.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend The Last Samurai because it never dwells on anything for too long, and because the writing is always sharp and never awkward. The romance takes a backseat - where it belongs - by making it feel more like respect and mutual appreciation than desire or lust. The direction of Edward Zwick (Glory) is an appropriately slower pace, and it correctly accentuates the artistic approach to the film and the focus on the dramatic elements. The Last Samurai, besides providing lengthy and well-choreographed battle scenes, manages to succeed as a drama because it shows viewers the importance of honor and family, the significance of discipline and tradition, and finally, the glory - and tragedy - of war. But most importantly, it demonstrates the curse of an industrialized, unappreciative, and cold-hearted culture, and it will help to give you a better idea of what peace truly can be."

","This film was no doubt the best film of 2003. It is totally underrated and cheated in the Oscar academy! It is a film that actually has talent and beauty to it from its story to its vision of ancient Japan that has been swept into modernization.<br/><br/>the film is about two men. there's Kotsumoto and Nathan Algren. Kotsumoto (Ken Watanbe) is a samurai leader who witnesses his country being overtaken by modernization which leads to a change in the whole country from the new rising power of the Emperor Meiji, who took power for himself over Japan. Kotsumoto and the other samurai feels this is immoral and a disgrace to the motherland of Japan and pollutes the traditions and cultures of Japan. he and the other samurai must restore it to where it originally was before the Americans arrived.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, across the Atlantic Ocean, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is a drunken, ex-war veteran who drinks to relieve himself from a massacre he was a part of against the Native Americas. By fate, he meets a war friend (Billy Connoly) who found a job for the both of them, which is to train the Japanese army against the samurai, and was arranged by Nathan's old, cruel commander he has a score to settle with (Tony Goldwyn), and a greedy Japanese political figure named Omara.<br/><br/>Here, Nathan goes on a journey into the modern rising Japan. As he trains the army without much of a success, they are set on a mission to wipe out the samurai in the mountains. They are ambushed, most of the imperial soldiers are killed, and Nathan is captured by the samurai. Here he meets the samurai leader Kotsumoto and develops a strong relationship with him based upon the samurai code, the meanings of life, and their fates and destinies.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a powerfully moving film with some of the best acting i have ever seen since the film Gladiator. Ken Watanbe deserved the Oscar for his role of Kotsumoto. The cinematography was beautiful, and depicts the reality of japan's beautiful views of land. the costumes and set-decorations were fabulous, the battle sequences were well choreographed and intense, the story was gripping, and above all the score by Hans Zimer uplifted the film to a scale of grandeur. Easily a **** out of **** If only more films were like this one. This is why we see the movies!"

","I love sushi. I also love Toshiro Mifune. Guess that makes me a prime candidate for a samurai warrior - at least, that's all it seems to take for a Westerner in this movie to wear kamishimo and wield katana. Despite that annoyance, this film crafts a sincere portrayal of an outsider undergoing an assimilation into Samurai culture without Western disparagement or cheap stereotype satire. <br/><br/>*The Last Samurai* is a grandiose film, sweeping, majestic, inspiring - even WITH Tom Cruise in it.<br/><br/>The late 1800's saw Japanese businessmen convince Imperial Japan that the shogunate government advocating military rule through shogun and samurai (*bakufu*) - was fettering the country to the dark ages and hindering their financial and technological advancement. In transforming feudal Japan into a modern nation, they did, in fact, hire Westerners to train their outmoded armies in the Way of the Gun.<br/><br/>As imbecilic as that may sound (bringing haughty Yankees into a milieu where blade technology had attained a zenith in construction and killing prowess in the hands of the samurai millennia before the Americas were a twinkle in Europe's eye), the gun did historically overrun the sword as the primary weapon of warfare in Imperial Japan.<br/><br/>This flensing of *bakufu* came to a head during the reign of Emperor Meiji, by all accounts as naïve, indecisive and ignorant of the best political path for his country as he is portrayed by young Shichinosuke Nakamura in this movie. From this ""historical context,"" this film's plot centers around one last village of renegade samurai, led by Katsumoto (the leviathan Ken Watanabe, out-acting the movie's titular ""star"" by acres), obstructing the Way of the New Government, embodied by Meiji.<br/><br/>To combat Katsumoto's outlaws, Meiji's CEO analogues rescue a burned-out lush of a Civil War vet, Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), from his Dudley Moore *Arthur* impersonations, to train their ""modern"" soldiery, a conscription of weaselly, panty-wetting nerds, whose ineptitude in battle rivals that of *Star Wars* stormtroopers who trip over twigs and knock themselves unconscious when chased by Ewoks.<br/><br/>Ergo, it is no surprise when Algren's Benny Hill-ian troops are decimated during their first battle, Algren being taken alive as Katsumoto's prisoner.<br/><br/>Through the winter months, Algren is imprisoned by the natural isolation of the samurai village. Ostensibly to learn of his enemy's tactics, Katsumoto engages Algren in philosophical conversations, whereby Algren  begrudgingly at first - comes to learn the Way of *Bushido*, the samurai honor code, embracing it with a passion when he finds it fills the vacuum in his guts that had turned him to the Way of Dudley Moore's Arthur. In being an American soldier, he found only shame where he thought there was honor (when ordered to kill women and children); now, in this most unlikely place  the village of his enemy  he is startled to find honor once more in *bushido*.<br/><br/>It is during this powerfully moving second act that the movie simultaneously excels and fails: excels because of its quietude, its controlled passages defining Algren's recapturing of his humanity lost  and fails because Algren becomes too adept too quickly as a samurai swordsman. There is foreshadowing that he is a marksman and like most Civil War officers, he is issued a saber, yet all it takes is one *Rocky* montage and he is besting his fencing tutor, Ujio (Hiroyuki Sanada, who bears a marked resemblance to Toshiro Mifune, so was aces in my book from the get-go  giving Tom Cruise a beating with a *bokken* in the rain upon their first meeting only increased his net worth.)<br/><br/>It would have been enough that Algren embrace the creed and find ""life in every breath,"" but in following the Bushido For Dummies handbook and having Algren become a master swordsman in the space of one winter (and mastering the language to boot), the film ironically adopts the superior westerner stance that it fooled us into believing it was trying to avoid, thereby cheapening the lifelong devotion, dedication and discipline of true samurai.<br/><br/>That ain't right.<br/><br/>Vainglorious Yankee spirit triumphing once again  from a country where any kind of dedication to a discipline is disparaged; where collective bone-laziness has created such ""time-saving"" devices as the salad shooter, the leaf-blower, the workout video and exercise machines that end up as clothes racks  THIS is the society whom we are meant to believe can send one of its flock into the heart of a millennia-aged culture and assimilate it in one winter? <br/><br/>Turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese oh I don't THINK so.<br/><br/>When Algren is delivered back into ""civilization,"" he finds he cannot re-assimilate into the shameful *dishabille* of his own people, so allies with the samurai against his own army.<br/><br/>Thankfully, no computer warriors were killed on the final battlefield, hence, these rambunctious scenes resembled Mel Gibson's last-of-the-HUMAN battle epics, *Braveheart*. Gloriously so.<br/><br/>An unnecessary romance blossoms between Algren and the wife of the warrior he killed before being taken prisoner. Though it might be construed as Algren attaining such a level of respect that the warrior's widow is now considering him fresh meat (when once she considered him as smelly as a pig) the real reason is because this film sports a bankable Hollywood Man-Toy which necessitates a gratuitous romance for the chick demographic.<br/><br/>Director Edward Zwick and writers, John Logan, Marshall Herskovitz and Zwick himself might have forged a ten-star movie had they not made Algren such a superlative warrior and then opted for Hollywood Happy Ending protocol; steering so close to immortality, then insulting us with a paint-by-numbers.<br/><br/>Still, watching a samurai film without Toshiro Mifune is like eating sushi without fish.<br/><br/>(Read this review unabridged at: http://www.poffysmoviemania.com/LastSamurai.html)"

","Not being a big fan of Tom Cruise, I put off watching this movie for a couple of years. Now I had the chance to borrow the DVD from a friend, and I just watched it, amazed all the way through. Dammit, this is a movie that delivers! It is the most emotionally moving film I have seen for ages (well, since Monday, anyway... but that was a special case) - I lost count of the many, many scenes that made me misty-eyed -, and at the same time it was a great action movie, containing plenty of both swordplay and gun-play. Not to mention history. It focused on a crucial historical moment, where the old Samurai ways of feudal Japan had to give way to the vagaries of the modern world and its modern weapons and dirty politics.<br/><br/>The acting was all-round great, and the production values were simply astounding. A movie of incredible beauty and power.<br/><br/>As far as the debate on whether it's an art movie as such; no, I don't feel there is a ""high art"" aspect to this movie. I think of it as a serious - and seriously good - movie, produced by people who understood how to make drama convincing, and who were experts on cinematography. But I will say that it comes CLOSE to being an art movie; it certainly has enough poetic moments, both visually and emotionally, to make such a claim stick. But a movie doesn't have to be an art movie in order to be good. The Last Samurai doesn't suffer from not being an art movie. It is the movie it is supposed to be; a highly competent and evocative one.<br/><br/>The only reason I don't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is that it romanticized the Samurai too much. In reality, they too were embroiled in dirty politics, and most often never questioned authority (and if they thought that their authority figures were all honorable, they were fooling themselves). But it is true there is a certain purity in their concept of honor, and in many ways that honor was the basis and the substance of their civilization. The movie does a good job presenting this honor from its best angle, and as a work of art it is most certainly entitled to do so.<br/><br/>A triumphant and beautiful achievement. I will buy the DVD tomorrow.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

He's washed out soldier for hire who is hired by Omura (Masato Harada) to train Japanese troops in order to dispose a rebellious samurai Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). One thing leads to another and soon Algren finds himself surrounded by samurais, apprehended in a small village in the mountains. Both, Algren and Katsumoto, learn a thing or two from each other, but it really is Katsumoto who changes the destiny of Algren.<br/><br/>There actually isn't anything spectacularly original in the movies plot, it's just one growth story among others, but the settings, actors and direction is so fantastic, that it's rather hard not to like this movie. <br/><br/>You can say a lot of things about Cruise as a person, but after I saw him in Eyes Wide Shut I've came into a conclusion, that he really is a great actor. I can't pinpoint any bad actor from the cast, Watanabe does great performance and Koyuki does small, but effective role as Taka, Katsumotos sister, who takes care of Algren, even tough he has killed her husband.<br/><br/>In all things considered The Last Samurai is among the better movies of Tom Cruise."

","I don't have the patience to sit through many movies without feeling that I've seen this before, or it just does not meet my standards for a good, much less great movie. I have watched The Last Samurai in it's entirety 5 times and have yet to tire of it. The photography is stunning, the New Zealand countryside as 19th century Japan is breathtaking, and the story and acting are both captivating and real. Tom Cruise is a lightening rod for many folks due to his religious beliefs and outspoken manner. However a quick look at his representation on the top 100 box office films indicates that he is among the masters of his craft. In my opinion, The Last Samurai is his finest work to date."
"garboventures","6","1","3","16 October 2005"," Good in Parts - Dull and Predictable Finale
","The Last Samurai was much better than I had expected. It was never a film I looked forward to with keen anticipation and I waited until it was on satellite TV before bothering to watch it. This I now see was probably a mistake as the film's panoramic drama would have been more effective viewed on a big screen.<br/><br/>Perhaps my small-screen mode of viewing affected my response to this film? Frankly the grand battle-scene finale left me cold, while the more intimate section of the film which detailed Algren's assimilation into Samurai society was much more appealing. I felt sad to see Algren leave his mountain hide-out because I realised that this part of the film was now over - after this I was less interested. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise as Algren was OK - still so very much Tom Cruise of course, but then mega-buck uberstars always tend to play themselves; that's Hollywood I guess. Ken Watanabe put in a strong performance - perhaps a little over-hyped - and I enjoyed Higen's characterisation. <br/><br/>Scenery was splendid - partly shot in New Zealand, which is always a winner. And the photography was spot-on - although the 'direction' was a little stale at times, even plodding.<br/><br/>Obviously there has been some controversy over the portrayal of Japan and Japanese culture - I think this is understandable, and debate is healthy. There is a perpetual instinct for Hollywood to view the world from a US-centric position which in today's globalised world and with the constant threat of US Cultural Imperialism is not especially useful or necessary. However, Hollywood is making films for a primarily US audience - even though worldwide box office and DVD sales are vital economic components. Therefore having an American hero and 'experiencing' with this character what is to him, and to us (assuming most viewers around the world in the 21st century are not tuned into the ancient rules of Bushido) a wholly alien and yet fascinating and wonderful culture is not in itself patronising. Accuracies, misportrayals are a different story, but frankly I don't have the knowledge-base to challenge these - hopefully then this film can inform greater understanding, if only through the subsequent debate.<br/><br/>As a piece of entertainment, The Last Samurai has plentiful action and some pleasing moments - I have given it 6 out of 10 only because the draconian Amazon rating system won't allow me to submit a 6.5 which is where I would properly rate it!"
"ebiros2","10","1","3","6 October 2005"," Best samurai movie in history
","When I first saw the trailer about this movie, it didn't excite me. Tom Cruise and samurai somehow didn't sound like a match, and my guess was that the movie was stereotypical plot about an American going to Japan to kick ass - I was wrong.<br/><br/>I just couldn't believe the detail they've put into this movie. Everything looked absolutely real, and even in Japanese made samurai movie you don't see this kind of authenticity (e.g. if you recall plastic looking Armour in Kurosawa's Kagemusha). Given that this movie was made on a budget that's 30x the most expensive samurai movie Japan's ever made, you can still have fouled the plot by making it an ""American"" samurai picture. But no, Ed Zwick's vision is so complete, it overwhelmed me. And Tom Cruise was not a simple hero character, but a character based on principle who found himself in a situation where he didn't know how to get out of (until he gets to Japan).<br/><br/>Ngila Dickson and Lily Kilvert did a fantastic job with costumes and sets. Cinematography was beautiful. Props and special effects were flawless. All the casts were absolutely believable. In short, a perfect movie.<br/><br/>I truly believe that Hollywood have outdone Japan in its own game with this movie. It's the greatest samurai movie ever made, and perhaps one of the last of its kind. Japanese studios are no longer producing samurai movies due to lack of interest from audiences, and it's doubtful that another movie like this would be made by an American studio. They say that swan's last song is its most beautiful and the saying might just apply to this movie.<br/><br/>If you turn off the picture and just listen to the dialog you'll notice that only Algren (Tom Cruise), Omura (Masato Harada), and Higen (Sosuke Ikematsu) are really speaking from the bottom of their person. Others are just giving lip service. Harada is a director and maybe he knows how the craft really works. Sosuke Ikematsu was just so great in his role as Higen. He was blowing away actors who had ten times more experience than him with his acting, and maybe (I hope) he will one day grow into a great adult actor himself. As for Tom Cruise, I guess he's the biggest star in Hollywood because he can bring believability into his character at this level."

Lots of posing. Lots of blood/no sex. Cardboard characters. Enjoyable if you send your brain on vacation. <br/><br/>I bought the DVD with all the features but I don't think I'll bother with looking at them.

His performance is something that will make me remember him alongside names like Toshiro Mifune, and will definitely have this DVD sitting alongside everything else I immediately show to people and tell them they have to see.<br/><br/>I would also note, this was one of a few movies to invoke such strong emotions in me.

","This picture is beautifully directed. Both the long shots, indoor shots and close ups are rich, warm and evocative. The quality of the direction is sustained throughout the picture.<br/><br/>The acting is consistently excellent. The picture is well cast, both American and Japanese. Cruise, of course, gives another fine performance. This one lacks some of his usual intensity, but I think this reflects his maturity as a person and an actor. His performance is more subtle and refined. Like fine wine, he is improving with age.<br/><br/>This picture is based on historical fact. The theme is the nobility of the Samurai Way and the Code of Bushido. Like any apologia, it overlooks the less wholesome aspects of Bushido. For instance, all the people beneath the Samurai were serfs whose sole purpose in life was to support the Samurai 'way of life'. In other words, a beautiful life.. if you could afford it. And like all feudal societies, the nobility lived on the backs of the peasants.<br/><br/>In 1942 the Marine garrison at Wake Island surrendered to the invading Japanese. They had driven off a previous invasion, the only successful defense against an amphibious assault in the entire war.<br/><br/>As the prison ship made its leisurely way back to Japan the Marines were taken out, one by one, and beheaded.<br/><br/>Bushido.<br/><br/>When the United States invaded Saipan there were Japanese civilians living there. As the Americans pressed inland it became apparent they were going to be victorious. The Japanese women took their children to a nearby sea cliff. They threw their children over the cliff then jumped after them. Japanese speaking Americans with bullhorns begged them not to, to no avail. They watched helplessly until all were dead.<br/><br/>Bushido.<br/><br/>I recommend you watch this film, it is a good picture.<br/><br/>There are many admirable aspects of Japanese society. The Samurai Way and the Code of Bushido is not one of them."
"paulcreeden","6","1","3","19 September 2005"," It wasn't really about eye candy.
","""The Last Samurai"" (good riddance) is a Japanese Western along the lines of the Japanese samurai genre of the 1930s-1950s. Its visual scale is comparable to the late Kirusawa epics, but its content is a derivative hash of American Westerns and Clavell's ""Shogun"". The most laudable feature of the film is its cinematography. For those of us who admire antique Japanese design, the eye candy is very nice. But the end of the samurai culture was not about eye candy. I think the film misses this point entirely. It also was not about rugged (American) individualism fighting against corporate corruption. These are American stories which could be told again these days. The ending of the samurai culture was akin to the current turmoil in the (Saudi) Arab world. Samurai were xenophobic feudal creatures like Usama Bin Ladin, confronted by an Industrial Age, championed by an emperor who received a modern education for his time. The Hollywood propensity for making everything black-and-white from an antique American (cowboy's) moral viewpoint poisoned what could have been a wonderful film about the complexity of progress and human evolution."

His sister just happens to be the wife of the fallen warrior.<br/><br/>Everyone in the village hates Cruise, and the woman is repulsed by the foreigner, who has shamed her by killing her husband. Little by little, Cruise becomes fascinated with life in the village and the Samurai training. He feels at peace and is cured of his alcoholic addiction. As he becomes more skilled with the sword he starts to win the admiration of the Samurai and he bonds with the woman's son.<br/><br/>Cruise finally, earns his place in the village by being instrumental in driving back a ninja attack on the village.

In fact it was quite the opposite. Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) was teacher turned student as he had to be humbled by his captors. He learned a lot more than just how to sword fight, he learned honor, respect, humility, and a lot more intangibles that make a people wholesome and good.<br/><br/>I was converted, and for that reason I have to rate this movie high. I never was a Tom Cruise fan, but the last three movies of his I saw (Minority Report, The Last Samurai, and Collateral) have given me a change of heart towards him as an actor."

It was the most powerful movie I have seen in 2003 and in a long time. The direction, music, and acting were awesome.

You know a movie is good when the music keeps playing in your head and the images from it keep flashing back. I have no idea how it could have gotten a 7.9 average from the reviews when it should be up in the top 50. I noticed that the lower grades are from people who mostly hate Cruise, which is pathetic. This movie deserved the Best Picture Oscar, and I have no idea how it was not even nominated. Seabiscuit?? Come on!People actually clapped at the end of the movie, and that is a rarity. Everything about this movie was amazing, and each scene worth-watching. If you like Braveheart and Dances With Wolves, you will surely enjoy this. This definitely deserves an A in my book.

"Michael_Lepatsky","10","1","3","26 September 2004"," The Last Samurai: Simple Beauty
","This is my first review and I actually wrote it as an English 111 essay. I'm not sure if it contains essential spoilers, so I warn you now: May contain spoilers; read at your own discretion. Now with that out of the way...<br/><br/>The Last Samurai: Simple Beauty<br/><br/>The Last Samurai is a story of a man lost in his pains justifying his life through simple material gain. Without any direction in life it seems as though this man, Captain Nathan Algren, is destined to a life of depression and worthlessness. The powerful and moving transformation that Algren undergoes from a man of little worth to a man of greatness is done in such a way in this movie that I believe to be a very captivating experience.<br/><br/>Honor and tenacity, two major themes of this movie, are introduced early in the movie. We are also introduced to Algren whom of which is drinking and obviously miserable with life. Early in the movie Algren takes a job in Japan to train Japanese soldiers, whom of which are at war with the rebel Samurai, in the art of modern warfare. It is in the melee with the Samurai that Algren's tenacity is first displayed. The Samurai leader, Katsumoto Moritsugu, is intrigued by this tenacity and, after defeating Algren's forces, brings Algren back to the Samurai village, a place of honor, as a prisoner to study him. Here, Algren is unable to escape because winter is coming and, as such, prevents any flee from the mountain. It is in the Samurai village that Algren's transformation occurs.<br/><br/>A problem that I have with this movie is the over-simplification of some key elements of the movie. It is obvious throughout the movie that Algren's depression is a result of the Native massacre that his battalion was a part of. Unfortunately, though, this feeling of guilt and regret is coupled by an excessive and somewhat incessant number of flashbacks and blatant reminders that Algren does indeed feel this way. If it isn't extremely large pictures of the Natives drawn on multiple pages throughout Algren's diary depicting them as a divine people, it is Katsumoto blatantly articulating this theme during a conversation with Algren during the latter stages of the movie. Throughout the entirety of the movie other ideas or essential developments are also simplified in this manner. It is not that that the formalization of a theme is undesirable; rather, the incessant recurrence of this style only does the director, Edward Zwick, and the intelligence of his movie a great disservice. One other problem that I had with this movie is the Hollywood makeover that it was given. Though it is a movie of Samurai in the era of modernization in Japan, the presentation of it is only loosely based on what it was actually like at that time. Though they were deeply respected, the Samurai were also seen as rebels and practitioners of many old, less compassionate ideologies such as the absolute degradation of women. They were not as pure and kindhearted as presented in this movie. More over, the use of Kanji in the movie is also simplified and clichéd.<br/><br/>Though, the over-simplification of the movie may be a minor weakness, it is also, ironically, excels as the major theme of this movie. Algren learns to deal with his frustrations by looking at the grand scheme of things rather than getting lost in material insatiability. Deeply symbolic Kendo sessions show Algren's transformation and many epiphanies. In the beginning, despite its aimlessness, the Kendo sessions serve to show just how tenacious Algren is. As the movie progresses, they illustrate how aimless tenacity is no match for purposeful honor and, as such, Algren accepts this new ideology. The result is man at peace with himself.<br/><br/>Though, The Last Samurai does spell out or rather, at times, shout integral themes at the audience which, in turn, effectively lowers the intelligence of this movie, Zwick still delivers a story of epic proportions like no one else. Though, simple Japanese stereotypes are magnified and actual history thoroughly abused during the telling of this story, Zwick is doing just that- telling a story. Even though I was trying to find flaws in this movie, I was left finding a needle in a haystack of perfection. I am indefinitely captivated by the message that this movie conveys while practicing it itself- the beauty of simplicity and the simplicity of beauty. It teaches the audience that perfection and fulfillment is no more than a state of mind. It is all around us and bares no price-tag. It also teaches the audience that rather than seeking perfection through the consumption of substance and material, that perfection is actually created through the essence of simplicity. No one movie can ever be perfect just as no one measure of value can ever be perfect; rather, it can redefine a genre and raise the bar for its successors and that is exactly what this movie has done.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Excellent! 10/10: Recommended for those of us with eyes!"

"mulhollandman","Null","1","3","13 June 2004"," Braveheart goes to Japan
","I saw this film for the first time last week. I read a number of reviews before hand but I never expected it to this bad. I thought it was a terrible film. What a waste of money. <br/><br/>There a number of things that went against this film from the start. The first thing was that it is very obvious from this film that Tom Cruise really wants that Best Actor Oscar and he thought that a film about a drunk American going to Japan only to have his life turned around by the ways of the Samurai would get him it. What a fool. We have seen these kinds of films before and at the time of release the vast majority of us really enjoy them and think they are excellent but we always find that a few years later that we cringe at the thought that we once thought they were very good. I myself am very guilty of this. I will give Braveheart and Dances with Wolves as case example and studies. I hope that Tom will look back in ten years time and see this film as a bad film on his C.V. I think myself that Tom Cruise is capable of so much more. His supporting cast (Billy Connolly & Timothy Spall) were not far behind. Connolly was terrible from the very moment he appeared on screen as the Irish/Scottish (what was he please someone tell me) Sergeant. He cannot act he really should stick to Stand up comedy. Timothy Spall is a fantastic character actor however he sucked big time in this film. The only people that really suited their parts were Ken Wanntabe and his fellow Samaurai. They were brilliant. I cannot fault them.<br/><br/>The script was woeful. Everything that was said we have heard numerous times in films such as The Patriot, Michael Collins and Braveheart.<br/><br/>On a positive note I found that cinematography and sets were amazing and it was a pity that the above bad points took away from their splendor and beauty. <br/><br/>Finally I advise any up and coming film makers to watch this film and use it as an example of how films should not be made."
"Euromutt","4","1","3","10 June 2004"," Dances with cherry blossoms (possible spoilers)
","Quick plot synopsis: Tom Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a captain in the US cavalry and a veteran of the civil war and various campaigns against the Plains Indians. At the start of film, we find him in San Francisco in 1876, tormented by guilt over his participation in the massacre of a Cheyenne village, a torment which he is trying (in vain) to drown with alcohol. He is approached by Omura (Harada), a minister in the Meiji government of Japan, to help train the new Japanese conscript army to defeat a rebellion by traditionalist samurai, led by a daimyo named Katsumoto (Watanabe). Over Algren's objections, Omura throws the troops into battle prematurely, and the first engagement results in a rout for the Imperial troops. Algren, despite putting up a spirited resistance, is captured by Katsumoto's samurai. He is transported to Katsumoto's fief, which is soon isolated by the onset of winter. During his captivity, Algren comes to learn and appreciate the ways of the samurai, and becomes sympathetic to Katsumoto's cause. The spring brings an attempt at rapprochement between the government and Katsumoto, but when diplomacy breaks down (due to treachery by Omura), Algren sides with Katsumoto for the climactic battle between the traditionalists and the reformers.<br/><br/>Let me state that, in many ways, ""The Last Samurai"" is a magnificent film; the acting ranges from adequate to excellent, the cinematography is fabulous, the production values are top notch, and the scenery is nothing short of stunning. So why did I hate it?<br/><br/>First and foremost, the script is an exercise in one-sided stereotypes. Katsumoto and his samurai are without exception loyal, brave and true, not to mention honourable and selfless, desiring only to serve the best interests of the emperor and people of Japan. Perish the thought that they might be fighting to retain a feudal system in which they are on top of the heap, free to lord it over farmers, craftsmen and merchants, i.e. those who had to actually work, not only to provide for their own upkeep but for that of the daimyo and his samurai as well. How committed the warrior caste was to serving the people may be divined from the almost 3,000 peasant revolts which took place between 1590 and 1867, with increasing frequency and violence. The samurai are portrayed as disdaining guns as ""dishonourable."" For ""dishonourable"" read ""allows a mere commoner to easily kill a samurai""; can't have that. But since such historical facts would get in the way of Logan and Zwick's glorification of the samurai, so no mention is made of them. As a result, it never occurs to Algren that the only reason his captors consider him worthy of even an opportunity to win their respect is because they know him only as a warrior, and that if they knew he was merely (in their book) an upstart farmboy, their attitude would likely be less friendly.<br/><br/>To ensure maximum contrast with the noble samurai, their opponents are portrayed as having no redeeming features whatsoever. Omura and his henchmen are only interested in acquiring wealth and power, and are prepared to wade through the blood of innocents to achieve this. Omura even hints at plans for Japanese expansionism and the consequent need to match military power with the West; with this, he is simply reduced to a cardboard cut-out 1940s Hollywood ""Jap."" Of course, Omura is not a samurai, and therefore lacks their sense of honour. That the rulers of Japan, samurai included, had envisaged the subjugation of East Asia since the late Middle Ages (if not longer) is, again, conveniently ignored. Omura's American associates are similarly ruthless in the pursuit of riches, and more uncouth to boot. The Imperial cabinet and troops are either thugs or dupes (who realize the error of their ways only when it is too late). Obviously, nobody could really benefit from rejecting feudalism(!)<br/><br/>Stereotyping aside, the script strains the viewer's (or at least, *this* viewer's) willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point. Within a year, Algren has defeated his drinking problem, learnt to speak almost fluent Japanese, and has not only mastered the katana, but even manages to defeat multiple opponents while using two full-length swords. As students of martial technique (and role-playing geeks like myself) will know, the technique of fighting with two swords was reportedly developed in the early 17th century by the near-legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, who coined a number of names for it before settling on Niten Ichi-Ryu (""School of Two Heavens""). Also according to popular culture, none of Musashi's students (life-long samurai) could master it, and the technique died with its creator. Nevertheless, it seems to come naturally to Algren.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, it takes at least three bullets to slow down any given samurai, and another three to actually kill him. For major characters like Katsumoto, Nobutada or Algren, the number is much higher. If that were realistic, one wonders why the Tokugawas were ever concerned about matchlocks; even breech-loaders should have posed no major worries.<br/><br/>A host of ninja sent to assassinate Katsumoto fail mostly due to their complete failure to observe anything resembling stealth, supposedly their trademark. And, true to Hollywood, each shuriken thrown results in a guaranteed kill at 30 metres, whereas in actual fact, ninja would generally use shuriken not as a killing weapon, but to provide ""suppressing fire."" A ninja would throw a bunch of shuriken at pursuers, forcing them to seek cover while the ninja made his escape; any actual hits were an added bonus.<br/><br/>Finally, at two and half hours, the film just collapses under its own weight. Even before the ""climactic"" battle, each drawn-out samurai death was met with cries on my part of ""Just f*cking DIE already, you parasite!"" When you find yourself rooting against the protagonists, it's not a good sign. On top of all that, the ending is just too ludicrous for words. By all means, watch ""The Last Samurai"" for the eye candy (and Billy Connolly), but do not take it seriously."

","Being Amerasian and feeling a responsibility to support other Asian actors, I forced myself to go to The Last Samurai.  Before I did I was weary to the idea that a movie, based completely around the world of truth, was also toting fictional characters along to ""pacify"" the average American public. Tom Cruise's character (reminiscent of Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet)was an unnecessary additive because Hollywood seems to think that the only way to tell the story of such an ""exotic"" culture as the Japanese is to see it through the eyes of a Westerner.  The true story of the Samurai is amazing enough without being adulterated with Western influence.  PC aside, Cruise's character was flat and obvious.  We don't doubt his commitment to the Samurai even before the movie really begins because that's the kind of movie we're expecting.  Good guys are always good, bad guys are always bad.  The dialogue was cliché, especially the closing arguments.  The only thing beautiful about this movie was the cinematography and Watanabe's performance."

","The power of stardom! A civil war in 1870s Japan is not, one can safely assume, a likely subject for a major Hollywood epic. The part played by Tom Cruise in a civil war in 1870s Japan? Now that's a different matter.<br/><br/>Cruise plays Nathan Algren, a veteran of the Civil War and Indian Wars, who has become a cynical, disillusioned alcoholic after his part in the massacre of a peaceful American Indian village. He accepts an offer from the Japanese government to train the new Japanese army in the arts of modern warfare, and becomes embroiled in a civil war fought between that army and a rebel force led by the samurai warrior Katsumoto. Although the rebels are only armed with swords and bows, they are at first more than able to hold their own against the poorly trained, inexperienced government conscripts, and in the first battle Algren is taken prisoner. He is held captive in Katsumoto's remote native village, and gradually comes to admire the samurai and their traditional way of life. So much so, in fact, that he commits himself to their cause and fights alongside them against his former comrades.<br/><br/>There are many good things about this film. The set-piece battle sequences are well done and much of the film is shot against spectacularly beautiful scenery (actually in New Zealand rather than Japan; after its performances here and in the `Lord of the Rings' trilogy, the New Zealand landscape deserves a special Oscar for `best newcomer'). Although Cruise tends to over-act, there are some very good acting performances, particularly from the Japanese members of the cast. Ken Watanabe brings both intelligence and dignity to his portrayal of Katsumoto, and Koyuki is luminously beautiful as Taka, the young woman whose husband is killed by Algren in battle but who later falls platonically in love with him.<br/><br/>The film does, however, suffer from one fatal flaw. Unless it has an overt anti-war message, a war film needs to gain the sympathies of the audience for one side or their cause. Edward Zwick clearly understood this when making his earlier excellent war films `Glory' and `Courage Under Fire', but seems to have forgotten it since. Although `The Last Samurai' obviously invites its audience to sympathise with Katsumoto and Algren, it never gives them any real reason to do so. In reality, of course, the samurai who rebelled against the Japanese government did so because they were a ruling feudal aristocracy who feared that any change in the social order would endanger their power, wealth and prestige. No such base motives, however, are ascribed to Katsumoto; instead, he seems to be motivated by a preference for the old over the modern (traditional Japanese crafts are much in evidence in his village) and a distaste for recent innovations such as railways and Western dress. (He takes his medievalism to such an extent that he even forbids his followers to use guns, although firearms had been part of the Japanese soldier's equipment ever since they were introduced by Europeans in the sixteenth century). A British parallel might be if William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement had spearheaded an armed insurrection against Gladstone's government with a view to undoing the Industrial Revolution.<br/><br/>Indeed, the impression is given at times that Katsumoto is simply a rebel without a cause. Those who see death in battle as the highest honour (as he does) do not need a cause in order to fight. Much is made of the rebels' (and Algren's) sense of `honour', but no attempt is made to analyse the moral complexities of this particular concept, which can be used as the basis of an alternative morality in opposition to more orthodox ideas of right and wrong. Just as the gentlemen of eighteenth century England saw nothing wrong in fighting duels over points of honour, despite the fact that duelling was both illegal and contrary to Christian teaching, so Katsumoto uses honour to justify his bellicose lifestyle in defiance of both the laws of his country and the ideals of the Buddhist faith he nominally follows.<br/><br/>No doubt Katsumoto's rebellion makes sense in the context of his particular cultural background, and Algren's decision to support him makes sense in the context of his particular psychology; he hopes to atone for his crimes in the Indian wars by fighting alongside the underdogs in another war. Those of us, however, who are neither Japanese samurai nor conscience-stricken war criminals (and I suspect we will make up the majority of the audience) will have little sympathy with the rebels. My own sympathies were with the poor bloody infantry, the government conscripts killed because they stood in the way of Katsumoto's vision of Japan as a medieval theme park, and even with the leader of the government forces, the politician Omura. Although he is portrayed as corrupt and incompetent, Omura represents, however imperfectly, the nobler vision many Japanese of the period had for their country as a peaceful, prosperous constitutional monarchy.<br/><br/>There is a chilling ending to the film. The Emperor Meiji, hitherto portrayed as weak and indecisive, announces that in future Japan will combine Western innovations with traditional samurai values. The filmmakers present this as a posthumous triumph for Katsumoto's spirit; they seem quite unaware that it was precisely this combination of modern technology with an archaic warrior code that was to lead Japan over the next few decades to become an aggressive menace to its neighbours. Despite some good qualities, this is a historically dubious and morally flawed film which at times comes close to justifying war for war's sake. 5/10"

One man rising to fight for his values... to be frank I enjoyed Braveheart or the Gladiator much more than this one.

"noralee","Null","1","3","20 December 2003"," Tom of Japan is Ridiculous!
","""The Last Samurai"" has been quite accurately skewered as ""Dances With Samurai,"" but that only begins to get across how ridiculous this movie is, as, in contrast, I liked ""Dances With Wolves.""  <br/><br/>At least ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was based on a true, if improbable, story on how an Occidental gets caught up in the Mysterious Orient (as the Mideast too was called then), takes on traditional values, and becomes a Great Military Leader, while this is pure bunk fiction.  Or does he travel east because this is one group of people that for the most part Tom Cruise can be taller than? <br/><br/>How can Cruise's disillusioned Civil War veteran adopt a culture that he and we actually don't even learn about, other than a few words of Japanese.  One can certainly learn more from watching ""Yojimbo"" or a number of other Akira Kurosawa films than the zero one gets here, The one-on-one fight scenes are not only unconvincing once, but director Edward Zwick takes one tutoring fight and repeats it three times, one time even in slo-mo.  <br/><br/>It is out and out laughable that the head samurai speaks fluent English, let alone the surprisingly accessible Emperor; at least in old World War II movies the general always says: ""You are surprised I speak your language? USC, Class of '38!"" Maybe he went to USC class of 1838? Is that how he came to be so well informed about the American Indian Wars (but not about classical Greek military history)? <br/><br/>The romance is much played up on the trailer but mostly consists of curious and longing glances that could be out of an Austen novel, plus the mandatory cliche shot of the bland beauty discreetly bathing by a stream. <br/><br/>
And I was a bit confused as an audience member that I was being manipulated to cheer for an American who joins a fanatical resistance against an effort to open up a foreign country to Western influences, corrupt as they might be, and grovels with blind allegiance to an absolute monarch while in effect yelling ""Bonsai!"" against an army of ill-trained peasant conscripts. Hmm, isn't that what John Walker was doing in Afghanistan? <br/><br/>
The battle scenes are more like the naive brutality of old vs. new military technology showcased in ""Barry Lyndon"" than the drama of ""Saving Private Ryan."" <br/><br/>The repeating drum beats in the score, redolent of traditional Japanese drumming, are effective."

","Hi all! This is my first comment on IMDb, so I'll try to not spoil anything and make a good first impression. :) This movie is definitely my favorite. No doubt about it (well, maybe a little with 300 now showing). I watch this movie almost periodically to keep myself...'in check' with my values and to put into my perspective what is important to me and what is good for the people around me. I find that this movie hits me...in several 'dimensions', you can say. I'm reminded that decisions and actions I make will stick with me and that my life later on will be affected greatly by my choices and I'm reminded that courtesy, respect, devotion, and most of all, honor should be held high in my life.<br/><br/>Every time I see the film, I feel like I'm maturing in some way from all the emotional and moral vibes I get from this film. While there are fights in the movie, it isn't the conflicts that the movie focuses on. The movie focuses more on what the fight is for.<br/><br/>(I'm not sure this is a spoiler, but I'll flag my comment as a spoiler for it anyway, just in case) The samurai fight for justice and live to serve their emperor. The emperor's advisors, however, aim to gain for themselves using the emperor's goal for a unified and independent Japan. This conflict of interests is what makes the rest of the story.<br/><br/>This movie's portrayal of the samurai and 'the bad guys' is genius. By the end of the film, I saw the samurai nearly as saints while I see the 'advisors' as despicable. The samurai are represented with characters that each show admirable qualities, while the opposite is seen of Omura (watch the film to know him). Only in the beginning, before you get a chance to see the samurai's perspective, might you think otherwise.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, when the emperor is being told a secret, you can see Omura dropping in in the corner of the screen. Images like that throughout the film give powerful portrayals.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of the movie of all, its soundtrack. I LOVE this movie's soundtrack. Its quite beautiful and you can picture the movie while listening to it. It is slightly repetitive, just enough to notice, but not enough to change my opinion of it whatsoever.<br/><br/>This is my favorite movie and my favorite soundtrack (and possibly music in its entirety) 10/10"

","I thought the movie was incredible! I read many of the comments regarding Samurai versus Ninjas and felt that the portrayals of both did not detract from the movie. It was not billed as a docudrama. However it appears to have been based on history.<br/><br/>I speak some Japanese and found Tom's accent quite credible. The wonderful subtleties of the Japanese in their almost inscrutable expressions were so very clear in the eyes of the actors.<br/><br/>It was a 2 1/2 hour movie and the time just sped by. Some of the lesser action scenes really helped to engulf the viewer in the entire culture and feeling of story. One could almost imagine being part of it.<br/><br/>Great to see actors riding ability as well, it certainly added to the reality of the movie. Being a horsewoman it really takes away from the movie when a person is supposed to be riding horses for more than just a guided trail ride and truly cannot ride. It certainly adds to the realism when they can ride and apparently do all of their own riding in the movie. Also having the horse's almost always the same is a nice bit of detail. Tom's mount appeared to be only two horses with a very subtle difference in the white blaze.<br/><br/>The bloody(gory) scenes were handled quite well. One got the sense of the horror of the battles without being inundated with too much graphic realism. For a 'war' movie, it was extremely well handled and totally fleshed out the characters which added so much more to it than just one battle scene after the other.<br/><br/>The scenery was excellent. The costumes fantastic. Even though the material was present day the reality in the design of the costumes took away any distraction regarding them being 'polyester' :-).<br/><br/>Going through the stills of the movie gave me an even more incredible appreciation for the action shots. The stills say so very much about the training, etc. of the actors. They certainly look very realistic and one gets the impression that the actors were in excellent physical shape and really doing the action shots w/o obvious stunt doubles. There may not have been any stunt people at all. I do not know for a fact either way. But it appeared the main characters did all of their own action acting and riding.<br/><br/>Excecellent in all ways. I got an excellent appreciation for the ways of the samurai. The sense of honor and customs was beautiful and enlightening."

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","1","4","25 October 2004"," After thousands of years of war, we are no closer to peace than we have ever been.
","I remember being initially put off by a movie with 'Samurai' in the title and starring Tom Cruise, but like Brad Pitt did in Troy recently, Cruise delivers a powerful performance as a Civil War veteran whose meaningless life takes a shocking turn after being sent on an assassination assignment. We meet Cruise sitting backstage, about to be called on to speak to an adoring crowd about his military experiences, and he stumbles onstage, drunk and belligerent, and winds up pulls out his rifle and firing several shots above the shocked heads of the crowd. So yeah, war had a not so good effect on him and he's not too happy with life.<br/><br/>He takes an assignment to assassinate the samurai leader Katsumoto, and after a vicious battle, Nathan Algren (Cruise) is taken prisoner be captors who clearly respect/fear him because he fought a circle of men literally until he could not stand, killing the last one of them while lying flat on his back. The Americans were in the process of aiding Japan's eager transition from the Old ways to the ways of the West, the process of which provides endless opportunities for massive financial gain in areas like weapons and trade. Algren is already disgusted with the military because of a traumatic experience he had in following what he always felt was an immoral order from a superior officer, Colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who he never forgives and is never faced with reason to. That particular battle is only hinted at in a series of fast and blurry flashbacks, but it is more than enough to get the idea that it involved sacking a village that Algren believed had nothing to do with their conflict, and it resulted in the deaths of the entire population, including women and children.<br/><br/>After being taken prisoner by Katsumoto, he is returned to Katsumoto's village and kept as a prisoner, but here is the difference between the Civil War era Americans and the samurai Â– the Americans want to know their enemy, the samurai want to understand their enemy, and as the rest of the movie shows, there is a huge difference between knowing your enemy and understanding your enemy, not the least of which is that the former is generally useful toward the purpose of killing them, the latter more useful in the purpose of understanding why they live and fight the way they do.<br/><br/>Algren begins his captivity as a prisoner, albeit one with an amazing amount of freedom within the village. He is not imprisoned, but rather allowed to roam the grounds, exploring the area and people, and only reminded that he's a prisoner of war by the studying looks he receives from everyone he passes, particularly as he passes groups of warriors training for battle. Algren gets to know the people and their culture, as do we along the way, and we grow to appreciate their culture and their way of life, the cleanliness, honor, and respectability, especially when it is contrasted by Colonel Bagley's calling them savages armed only with bows and arrows. This juxtaposition of the American prejudices toward the samurai and our developed respect for the organization of their culture is indeed unsettling. <br/><br/>I just watched Fahrenheit 9/11 a few weeks ago and have since automatically seen parallels between the events in the Middle East and almost every movie I watch (I even managed to make two connections which you can find in my review of Day of the Dead, of all movies), so I try not to talk too much about parallels in every movie, but the ones here are too much to overlook, especially when America is so occupied with battling what are often called insurgents or savages. Given the videotapes that these people put on the internet, I tend to agree with naming them vicious savages, but The Last Samurai is a reminder that such terms simply cannot be applied to populations or cultures in their entirety. There are savages in EVERY culture.<br/><br/>I think this movie may have gone a little far in that the samurai were completely pure, there was no counterpart of Colonel Bagley on their side, for instance, which tends to suggest to me that the movie is more interested in promoting an understanding of cultures that so many people know nothing about. It's scary to watch this movie and see all of the good, moral people on both sides who kill each other and are killed when, as is in this case most demonstrated by Colonel Bagley, the primary reasoning behind it all is a lack of mutual understanding. <br/><br/>After spending some time in captivity, Algren comments in a voice-over that he has slept well in this village for the first time in many years, a curious statement which highlights the irony that the only way he found peace was through his experience as a prisoner of the very culture he was sent to destroy. This has to be one of the clearest and most effective anti-war statements I've ever seen in a movie. <br/><br/>The relationships that develops between Algren and Matsumoto is, obviously, where the majority of the film's message lies, as they grow from enemies to comrades on the battlefield. There are striking comparisons between the samurai's willing to die for honor (which, in sharp contrast to American beliefs, can be achieved through suicide) and what I think is a more apprehensive view of death on the American side. I believe that Americans see deaths on the battlefield as something tragic, a necessary amount of suffering in the name of something for which we as a people largely believe in (hence the enormous importance that going into war is done for just reasons), while the samurai see death on the battlefield as a good death, an honorable one. <br/><br/>The divide is sharp, but the two of them find connection in their values, not their cultures, and especially in their view of honor. Their mutual understanding of deaths in battle as honorable is the seed upon which they are able to build their relationship with each other. Despite so many seemingly uncross-able differences, this one belief leads to their understanding and respect of each other, which personally left me hoping that one day this might happen in the world on a larger scale."

","I'm changing my review on this after re-watching it and, well, seeing the politics of today.<br/><br/>On one hand, I still really think that we took the wrong side of this, given how the shogunate treated the peasants. And I can't really get behind that kind of oppression. So, I really don't like that part of what they were fighting for.<br/><br/>Then again, being older and wiser, I also can't understand the need to exterminate any culture as thoroughly as westernization side was attempting to do. That doesn't fit with me either, especially now when we are seeing a war on culture that has no intent to reform, just destroy.<br/><br/>So there is a middle line here and I kind of take that path at the moment. I'm not a fan of the total destruction of tradition and culture of any kind.<br/><br/>That being the case...it is a bit melodramatic, but it's not bad. It is done with an eye to beauty and you have to respect that, at least I do. And, honestly, I believe that traditions are worth fighting for, as is a culture.<br/><br/>I believe that this teaches a subtle lesson, that it's better to reform what is bad and preserve what is good without an eye to extermination. Tradition and culture need not be eliminated with such brutality, there is no sense in telling a people that their way of life is wrong.<br/><br/>""We can not forget who we are, or where we come from,"" and I believe that is true.

","'The Last Samurai' is a film that does a lot right but so much wrong. Eventually succumbing to the twin perils of becoming a Tom Cruise centrefold vehicle and a painfully over earnest tragedy.<br/><br/>Excellent photography and locations throughout the film are matched by lovely sets and costumes. The musical score fits the film better as it goes on and there are two or three very engagingly staged action scenes with lots of well edited cuts, sound effects, practical special effects, extras all generating choreographed mayhem.<br/><br/>It is clear to me that 'The Last Samurai' was designed as a very soapy and emotional epic historical tragedy complete with a tone of great deeds and greater losses from the receding past. In effect a soft or sallow hero movie rather than a bombastic or assertive one.<br/><br/>In doing this there are large heroic themes played on with this film; themes such as outsiders and outcasts not belonging in their time and place, old vs new, loyalty and humility vs selfishness and dishonesty, damage and redemption, and of course change and the passing of things.<br/><br/>These are most obviouse in the person of Tom Cruise's protagonist and in the interactions between different factions of Japanese society and through the captivity middle section of the film where Cruise's character is the hostage of the rebels.<br/><br/>All taken together 'The Last Samurai' has so much loaded into it and it becomes mawkish and morose in equal measure as earnest soap and flannel come to a cloying emotional payoff; or series of payoffs. All via the incredibly versatile, indestructible and irresistible Tom Cruise protagonist.<br/><br/>So much soap and flannel, so much Tom Cruise, that by the end 'The Last Samurai' has vacated any meritorious territory and is on full orgasmic emotional romanticism.<br/><br/>I rate 4/10 because there is a lot of good pumped into this monster but it accumulates into an astonishingly overwrought and overstated mess."

","First I was a little bit reluctant to watch this film but since my friend had to go to the army the next day I agreed finally to go with him. The film was not as bad as I expected when I entered the cinema.<br/><br/>The story was quite good told. But there were certain things that really annoyed me. The whole movie was too much Americanized. Sometimes I asked myself how many times we can bear to see these good looking swaggering heroes from the west who are so much skilled again. I mean, is it normal that one can learn such a difficult language like Japanese within e few weeks or that he can fight like a samurai without much training? At the beginning tom cruise killed like six or seven samurai even though he was seriously wounded. E few minutes later he had problems fighting against a young child with a wooden sword and another half an hour  later he was one of the best fighters in among the whole population of the samurai. What is the explanation of this phenomenon? That he is handsome? Or that he is an American? How many times is Hollywood trying to use the halo-effect(which means that we generalise from a specific features such as physical attractiveness to other features such as skills, unconsciously) again before people get tired of it?<br/><br/>******spoilers*******<br/><br/>But as I have said above the story was no bad in every aspect. I liked the way they showed how old values und standards where wiped out by the invasion of the western culture and the fear of the Japanese people to loose the big part of the cake and for that reason to forget who they were und to sell their own customs and their own past. But what was the worst part of the whole movie was the ending. If it had ended on the battle filed it would have been much better. Why did the last samurai had to be an American? I'm not saying that because I don't like Americans, they are not better nor are they worse than others but I think I would be a little bit ashamed if I was one of them. Would not be glad or even proud to see always and all the time one of my own people being the hero and the best and the greatest and superior to all others and the nicest guy on earth even though it must be very easy and entertaining to identify oneself with him. Maybe it would have been better if the Japanese had made this film by their own because I think that it is an important one. But then it would not be such a great success because we wouldn't understand the motives because they would  not be adapted to our schemes of culture behaviour and honour. Well  that's life. The last shot when cruise met his girl again was dumb too because it made one feel a little bit that the whole thing was a film about the life of a certain man and not about the lost of old values for economical reasons and the dark sides of `globalisation' which is what the movie really is about.<br/><br/>But if you do not care about such things I can recommend you this flick without any remorse. Personally I give it (5/10). It is a solid piece of cinematic entertainment. Solid because it is a film like hundreds of others.."

","The honour and code of the samurai has always been enticing to a Western civilisation that is far removed from such customs, which perhaps makes The Last Samurai such an enticing, enigmatic film. Edward Zwick crafts quite an epic adventure rich in mythology & thematic resonance that while traditionally Hollywood in its construction still manages to exist a cut above many such movies of its ilk, a touch of class surrounding how the story of Captain Nathan Algren is put together, based as it is on several real life legendary American figures who played key roles in the Satsuma Rebellion in Japan during the late 19th century. This isn't a direct re-telling of those events but serves as a leaping off point to construct a tale about a stranger in a strange land, of a man haunted by fighting an unjust war who rediscovers his honour & place in the world through a dying culture. Zwick's film is slick, sweeping, beautifully shot and frequently involving, backed up by a strong performance by Tom Cruise in one of those roles that remind you just what a good actor he can be.<br/><br/>In the role of Algren, Cruise begins a dejected man living out of a bottle, bereft of purpose & suffering post-Civil War nightmares of a man touted as a hero despite feeling the guilt of slaughtering Indians crushed under the might of a military machine; in that sense, The Last Samurai is very anti-war in its message, John Logan's story painting the Americans and specifically the Imperialist Japanese not in the greatest light. Cruise takes Algren on a traditional voyage of discovery, first pitted against the samurai code & eventually becoming consumed by it, consumed by the similarity of the way of the warrior between both cultures - and Ken Watanabe's dignified samurai 'rebel' Katsumoto learns from him, as well as the other way around, with Cruise remaining stoic & only getting flashes of a chance to display the usual Cruise charm, but that's OK - Algren isn't the kind of character to benefit from that, Cruise's natural magnetism is enough here. Wit is provided thankfully through, albeit briefly, Billy Connolly as a tough old Irish veteran & chiefly Timothy Spall as our portly 'narrator' of sorts, who serves to help mythologise Algren & the legend itself. Zwick is most concerned with that, you see, the idea of legends and how men become them, exploring that concept alongside digging into the cultural rituals and practises of a changing Japan.<br/><br/>Algren's story is placed at a time when the old ways of Japan were shifting, under the pressures of global politics & business; the Emperor here is a naive young man, sitting on an empty throne, looking to Watanabe for validation as his advisor's push to quash a rebellion fighting to preserve the old ways, preserve Japanese interests as America knocks on the door. That's why Cruise's role here is so interesting, his character learning of the samurai code & helping those around him remember their history, and Zwick explores well the concept of national identity alongside personal ideas of myth, legend & destiny. It all boils together in a careful script, never overblown, which neatly develops the relationships involved & helps you fully believe Algren's transformation into the eponymous 'last samurai'. Along the way, Zwick doesn't forget theatrics - staging plenty of well staged & intense fight scenes which utilise the strong Japanese production design, before building to a quite epic war climax with army pitted against army, with personal stakes cutting through it, backed up indeed by another superlative score by Hans Zimmer. It becomes more than just a historical swords & armour film, reaching deeper on several levels.<br/><br/>What could have been a slow paced, potentially ponderous movie is avoided well by Edward Zwick, who with The Last Samurai delivers one of the stronger historical adventure epics of recent years. Beautifully shot in many places, with some excellent cinematography & production standards, not to mention an impressive script well acted in particular by Tom Cruise & Ken Watanabe, Zwick creates a recognisably Hollywood picture but for once a movie that doesn't dumb down, doesn't pander and ultimately serves as an often involving well made story. Especially one to check out if you love the way of the samurai."
"FlorianLaur","8","1","7","20 November 2019"," Gets a lot of it right
","The Last Samurai (plural). What to say about this film? In terms of historical accuracy, it gets some of it right, but changes some of it or omits it completely. In the script of the movie, the army is eventually reformed and equipped by Germans/Prussians. It seems American movie makers can't stand not to be in the spot light, so they changed that.
The nobility is also cranked up to 11. In some way, it works (especially with Zimmer's soundtrack), but of course it's the old trick of pulling your heartstring.<br/><br/>I do forgive most of that though, because at least the movie uses mostly Japanese actors, involves the language and some of the culture. What's kind of misappropriate in my opinion is the quasi-depiction of the Samurai as a mirror image of Indians/Native Americans. They may have shared a sense of courage and may even share some ancestry (Aino), but that seemed like an unnecessary move.<br/><br/>In the end, I feel the movie still works though, even if it changes some facts for the American(?) audience and even though we get a hero with plot armour. In my opinion, Cruise should have died at the end, but I get it, they needed someone to bring the Emperor the message. Still, it may have been more powerful if that would have been Katsumoto's remaining family. But similar movies sometimes do a lot worse that way (47 Ronins anyone?), so I can ultimately live with it.<br/><br/>I recommend anyone though to read about the history of the events and to learn more about Japan in general."

","Amusing and enjoyable in parts, ""The Last Samurai"" is ultimately pretentious, indeed silly.  And wooden.  With Tom Cruise in the lead this should be no surprise.<br/><br/>1876 was a banner year for Americans as they celebrated the centenary of independence.  Patriotic fairs and festivals dotted the land.  A bump in the rejoicing was Lt. Col (Brevet Major General) George Custer's vainglorious disobedience of orders which led, eventually, to the Little Big Horn National Battlefield Park.  And cemetery.<br/><br/>Somehow 7th Cavalry captain Nathan Algren, Tom Cruise, missed the fun at the Grassy Grease and we meet him, trauma-ridden and booze-besotted, hawking ""The Gun That Won the West"" at a carnival.  His inebriation putting paid to this employment he is ordered by his detested superior, Colonel Bagley, Tony Goldwyn, to travel with him to Japan and train the Meiji emperor's new western-style army.  We're in the heady but turbulent first years following the Meiji Restoration when Japan sought to catch up with western nations and, in this film, the American Military-Industrial Complex can't wait to outfit his troops and reap the rewards, mostly monetary.<br/><br/>Cruise's Algren is transparently captive to memories - frequent nightmares - of a murderous assault on an Indian village where women and children were slaughtered.  Those familiar with an especially dismal episode in frontier history will recognize Algren's flashbacks as the horrendous so-called Battle of the Washita, a permanent stain on Custer's reputation.  And on the Army's.<br/><br/>Algren despises Bagley but he takes his orders, like a good soldier, from him.  He does this for $500 a month (let's ignore the issue that he's a serving army officer and ought not to be privately employed).<br/><br/>Not to miss anything formulaic, Algren's recruits are in worse shape than the men generals McDowell and McClellan had to whip into shape as the Army of the Potomac (did I mention that Algren has the Medal of Honor from that internecine conflict?).<br/><br/>As so often happens in both real life (tragically) and the movies (expectedly), troops prematurely committed to battle fail the test and the emperor's soldiers here are beaten and routed.  Somehow Algren is captured alive as Samurai-in-Chief Katsumoto, Ken Watanabe, witnesses and respects his extraordinary bravery.  Watanabe is a typical feudal warlord who speaks excellent English and writes poetry.<br/><br/>What follows is highly predictable.  With earnest debts to ""The King and I,"" ""Shogun"" and myriad Jackie Chan movies, Algren becomes part, slowly, of Katsumoto's clan.  They don't all love him at first but, hey, he IS Tom Cruise.  Katsumoto's samurai can't co-exist, we're told, with an emerging modern Japan so the stage is set for a titanic battle.<br/><br/>A clash of cultures-yes, we have a dawning recognition by Algren, stolidly telegraphed by Cruise, that we should share.  It's that the samurai are not savages, as Bagley claims, but are part of that diminishing cohort of noble natives facing cultural and indeed physical extinguishment at the hands of western, here American, inspired modernity.  We've seen it all before. Thank you Commodore Perry.<br/><br/>But I don't want to be too negative.  Sure, we admire the samurai who are desperately resisting destruction whether or not they get with the Meiji program.  But let's look at the bright side.  Without the Meiji steamroller re-make of Japan we might never have had the Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, Pearl Harbor, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere or SONY and NINTENDO.<br/><br/>There's a fair amount of Japanese dialogue with subtitles.  I'd love to see the reverse when this flick screens in Japan.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb-the country scenes are breathtaking.  The music is Ninja-film standard.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's films make money and so will this one.  Director Edward Zwick was scrupulously careful not to allow any originality to enter into the story.  Anyone who can't predict where this film is going from the first twenty minutes should be condemned to a lifetime of viewing only Ed Wood movies.<br/><br/>5/10.<br/><br/>P.S.  If any readers don't know what wasabe is, it's one of Japan's greatest culinary gifts, the ultimate sinus-clearing condiment."

It is a darn shame too because this is a true tour de force of a performance by Cruise in what is one of the most touching stories ever put to camera. The relationships our hero builds throughout the film are so deeply personal and the character arc moves so perfectly and subtly that one doesn't even feel jarred at any moment yet we as the audience are at a completely different place with Algren by the end of the film. This is possibly the gold standard when it comes to character study films that lead us through an arc with our hero. Watanabe also turns in some of his best work, and it is the relationship between these two men, Katsumoto and Algren, that drive this film and give it the almost unbearably emotional ending that it does.

"eveflower1970","7","1","8","2 September 2019"," Could've been a masterpiece.
","Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" (2003) aspires to revive the Japanese epics of the 1950s. It also follows already successful formulas - that of Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" (2000) and Kevin Costner's ""Dances With Wolves"" (1990) - but it doesn't live up to neither of the two.<br/><br/>What I specifically wanted to point out was the great potential this film had. Good storyline, interesting characters, and astonishing cinematography. But it eventually fell prey to commercialism, as well as rushed photography and post-production processes.
I'd like to begin with the well-done aspects of this film - the cinematography and the theme. The sets were simply sublime. They could've done so much more with them. The theme is that of old-values-versus-modern-attributes, perfectly suited for the period in which the film is set.<br/><br/>Now, the weaknesses of this film - that could've easily been avoided. First of all, they ruined the stunning cinematography with horrendous framing. I prefer to blame this on the limited time they granted the photography process rather than on the director's abilities. Another technical mistake they made was almost always playing the soundtrack. Don't get me wrong, Hans Zimmer did an incredible job crafting the wonderful piece of music for this picture, but it was heavily overused. It suited some of the scenes, but others would've been greater without the accompaniment of a soundtrack.<br/><br/>At 154 minutes of runtime, I didn't get to know the characters I was supposed to care for, therefore the final battle didn't feel as dramatic to me. There needed to be more time granted the characters, their backstories, and their motives.<br/><br/>And lastly, the casting choice of Timothy Spall didn't enhance him nor the film. Don't get me wrong, he's pretty good in his field of work - comedies, fantasy or overall strange films - but he doesn't benefit such a serious picture as this one.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this motion picture shows us what differentiates a masterpiece from just a good movie - it's the little mistakes the average audience person doesn't mind, or detect, for that matter. I believe this movie must be shown in film universities because there are mistakes that aspiring filmmakers can learn from.<br/><br/>My rating: 7.1/10"

"MovieAddict2016","5","1","8","21 January 2004"," A rather good story reminiscent of ""Little Big Man,"" although not quite as good...
","After watching ""Little Big Man"" and ""The Last Samurai"" within a week of each other, it seems as though they are both very similar. A man is taken in by another culture, then freed and decides to defend them out of his own free will. Both films bash Custer, too. <br/><br/>Edward D. Zwick, the man behind ""Glory"" and ""Legends of the Fall"", directs the latter of the two before mentioned films. Here he creates a good -- although long -- portrait of one man who joined a war not many people know about. It's not a great movie, but it's certainly a good one.<br/><br/>The hero is played by Tom Cruise. His name is Nathan Algren, and he is a Civil War hero who is paid to read lines on stage in the year 1876, fascinating onlookers with his knowledge and tales of the war -- when he's not drunk, that is. When his performance is noticed by Sgt. Zebulah Grant (Billy Connolly), he is offered a job to travel to Japan and train hundreds of soldiers in the art of war. Why? Because the emperor of the country wants to modernize Japan, but a band of Samurai are rebelling. They need to be fought, but Japan's soldiers have no knowledge of modern weapons. Nathan does.<br/><br/>During a battle between the Samurai and Nathan's battle, he shows great courage and honor and is taken hostage by the Samurai, falling under the care of Taka (Koyuki), whose husband was killed by Nathan in a bloody showdown. The Samurai leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), is impressed by Nathan and their ""good conversations,"" and decides to train him in the way of the Samurai.<br/><br/>Nathan falls in love (one of the biggest clichés of film history) with Taka, although the romance never goes over the top, which was a pleasant relief.<br/><br/>But when Col. Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) leads an army of Japanese into battle against the Samurai, Nathan has to ask himself whom he will fight for. The answer is somewhat predictable by any standard, and the ending is somewhat ridiculous, but it's a good film and certainly one worth seeing if you enjoy war films.<br/><br/>I've never been impressed by Tom Cruise, mainly because I've never seen him stretch his roles. ""Rain Man"" is one of my favorite performances, but Cruise plays Cruise. In ""The Firm,"" Cruise plays Cruise. In ""Top Gun,"" Cruise plays Cruise. And now, in ""The Last Samurai,"" Cruise once again plays Cruise. But at least he manages to do more than a few different facial expressions in this -- he's now added angry and sad to his list. In fact, Cruise does quite well here. The thing is, he has yet to impress me by playing someone...different. When someone can play an entirely different person (like Hoffman in ""Rain Man"") and convince me that they are no longer that familiar actor, it's always a great sign. I wish Cruise would try a more daring film role for once.<br/><br/>Tony Goldwyn, who has always played good villains, is perfect here -- really annoying with an evil-like voice that's actually just bland. It gets on your nerves, which is a good thing. If he had played the hero, I would have left the theater. (Or come pretty close to doing that. I've never left a theater, and I never plan to.)<br/><br/>Ken Watanabe, who is receiving generous acclaim for his role, is pretty good -- although I wouldn't say that his performance is deserving of an Oscar.<br/><br/>
Zwick's downfall here is that he sometimes tries a bit too hard. He had tried to turn ""The Last Samurai"" into both a political message and a rousing epic, but when compared to something such as ""Braveheart,"" it fails miserably. I didn't feel very much for Cruise's character here. And there are too many unneeded scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>And while I'm picking on the movie, another thing I noticed is that the dialogue is sometimes corny and rather dumb. ""Tell me how he died,"" an emperor asks Nathan. ""I'll tell you how he lived,"" Nathan replies. Seriously, it's just a bit too heavy on the cornball moments sometimes. And are we supposed to believe that Nathan would really survive a Samurai attack, then a battle against an army of Japanese soldiers with guns and cannons, left to be THE last man on the battlefield (hence the title)?<br/><br/>But the battle scenes are, for the most part, quite exhilarating; the acting is very good (although I still don't think Cruise has stretched very far from his other roles), and the direction fine. The two factors that reduced this from a great rating to a very good one are the length and sometimes quite silly dialogue. If you can stomach those two things, check out ""The Last Samurai.""<br/><br/>4/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","10","8 November 2019"," Watanabe the warrior-poet, a man of conservation... and conversations...
","In Kurosawa movies, what characterized Samurais was that were both men of action and men from a bygone time as if fighting could only draw the future with the ink of the past. Samurais were the last embodiments of a heritage whose relevance was fading at the dawn of modernity. Maybe that awareness forged their resignation for death for only dishonor they feared. The men lived and perished by the sword, whomever it came from.<br/><br/>But remember in ""Seven Samurai"", four of the warriors fell under fired bullets, deaths that actually dishonored the enemy but also marked the beginning of the end. In ""The Last Samurai"", it's not a few bullets but gatling guns that annihilate the glorious but suicidal ride of the last Shogun warriors, including their leader Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe, a composite of many historical figures; supposedly the last Samurai. Still, the film has no pretension to be true to history, but to a philosophy that forged Japan's history for centuries and that more or less prevailed even after the reforms.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" was directed by Edward Zwick, the name might not ring a bell, he was the director of ""Glory"" in 1989. And as much as ""Glory"" wasn't about fighting in the Civil War but the idea of fighting for a cause worth dying for, ""The Last Samurai"" also questions the virtues of fighting by confronting two different approaches of warfare, two philosophies of life. It does so with such a contemplative patience that we realize the Western and Oriental civilizations have a lot in common. Or might it be that every civilization built its definition of honor in a way that only a battlefield could give that abstract word its fullest meaning? Is it a blessing or a curse, history provides arguments for both sides, but where does the film stand?<br/><br/>It's interesting that the most riveting scenes in the film involve sacrifices, as to show that there was a greater nobility in losing for a just cause than winning. But the film's hero Nathan Algren, Civil War and Indian wars veteran, doesn't start with that mindset. He survived the infamous Little Big Horn massacre and saw Custer's madness killing thousands of Natives. Yet for all the atrocities Algren witnessed, maybe what he resented was the idea that men like Custer were capable to draw other men to their cause in all blind loyalty, history would prove that good causes didn't have the monopoly of sacrifices. and that's a thought-provoking issue the film raises.<br/><br/>Ironically, when Algren tells Katsumoto that Custer was ""a murderer who fell in love with his own legend. And his troopers died for it."", the warrior-poet responds it's a ""very good death"". The Samurai is so impregnated by the idea of dying rather than living in shame that anyone accepting the necessity of death is worth admiration. That's not exactly how winning is done but when you follow Katsumoto, you find out life isn't about the cause but about its guidance to find your own truth. When we first see Algren, he's an alcoholic, bitter and war-weary man, channeling a 'Ron Kovic' version of the Civil War vet but later, after a long immersion into the traditional Japan, he gains wisdom and a deeper and more balanced vision of things.<br/><br/>The film takes place in 1878, during the Meiji era that turned the old feudal Japan into an industrialized country and an Imperialist nation in the turn of the century. The young Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) is confronted to a rebellion from Samurais who reject the new order for the nation's own good though Katsumoto would die for the Emperor if he ordered him so. Japan seeks help from the U.S. Army and so Algren can leave his existential dead-end and train the fresh new Japanese troops under the supervision of Captain Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) his previous commanding officer, a wannabe Custer who despises the savagery of the Orient as much as he did with Natives. He finds an ally in Omura (Masata Harado), a wealthy Westernized industrial and corrupt bureaucrat who takes advantage from the Emperor's age to influence his decisions and allow the U.S artillery to wipe out the Samurai rebellion.<br/><br/>So the film is driven by two contrasting moves: Japanese politicians emulating the Western world, and Algren rediscovering the Japanese tradition and within it a salvation for his own soul, as if he could exorcise the very demons that stained America's history and march toward progress, the very one that inspired the Meiji. He owes his survival for his tenacity during a one-to-one fight, won in-extremis, raising the interest of Katsumoto who wants to study the stranger. Watanebe was rightfully Oscar-nominated for a quiet but intense performance as a man in constant quest for truth, not victory, a righteous man who'd die with honor in a lost battle against the tides of history.<br/><br/>The film is filled with spectacular fighting sequences but is at its most absorbing during the quiet and introspective moments, when we see Algren's gradual immersion into Japan's roots, learning the language and the art of Kendo, befriending Katsumoto's son, falling in love with his sister Taka (the beautiful Koyuki Kato) whom husband he killed and in an honorable duel. The film doesn't overplay the nobility and righteousness of the Japanese and makes Katsumoto an accessible fellow, with wit and humor, and his 'conversations' with Cruise provide the best moments and raise intriguing but deep philosophical questions about fights and causes.<br/><br/>Near the end, the film seems to give in to Hollywood spectacle requirements, the only aspect Roger Ebert criticized but I don't think it ever betrayed the film's soul. And it's not in every movie that you see soldiers respectfully bowing down to the fighters they just killed as if deep inside, they knew it was a page of history that was just turned, and turned Japan to a modern country with all the best to come... and the worst, too."
"bob the moo","Null","1","10","18 January 2004"," Is OK but is too dull & long for an action movie and too confused for the worthy, thoughtful mantel it tries to take on (spoilers)
","Washed up and weary soldier Capt Nathan Algren is offered a job training the Emperor of Japan's troops, the money is too good to turn down.  Rushed into taking his inexperienced troops into battle, they are over run and he is captured by the Samurai, however leader Katsumoto allows him to life and takes him back to their village.  Algren finds that his desire to learn of his enemy is replaced by an understanding and empathy with their aims over the more mercenary forces pulling the Emperor's strings.<br/><br/>The Oscar talk seemed to begin even before this film finished post-production and the interviews about the film have rarely done anything other than gush about `Ed', `Tom' or the epic way of the Samurai.  However viewing the film it is hard to leave the cinema without a feeling of a film that mixes action with long periods of dullness and ultimately confuses itself and the audience as to it's actual point.  The plot manages to avoid any strands of originality and if you are unable to guess the direction of the film after 10 minutes then something is wrong.  The ending of the film is about as perfect an example of what a cop out it was and is dreary rather than exciting.  Sure it has big epic battles that the director proudly boasts contain no CGI, but these are a small part of the running time and yet it seems more effort went into these than any other aspect of the film.<br/><br/>Certainly the plot could have done with a great deal more work - it can't sustain the running time and too much of it is slow; I'm sure this was done because the subject is worthy and `epic' (which often means long and slow, not a problem for those that deserve it), however here the film doesn't warrant it and the end result is it being slightly dull.  The film suffers from the fact that it doesn't know what moral stance it wants to take - this is made more obvious by the fact that (in the UK) this film and Cold Mountain came out quite close to one another.  Whereas Mountain has the clear view that war is hell regardless of the worthiness of the reason, Samurai wants war to be both hellish AND honourable.  Hence the film has to make Algren's experiences MORE hellish by having his unit killing innocents, so that `normal' war can be seen as something good in a sense.  The cast and audience share this confusion.  Algren's fate at the end of the film is more Hollywood than Samurai and Watanabe (who played Katsumoto) has spoken in interviews of the difficulties he had of relating to a character who would lead hundreds to certain death for `honour'.<br/><br/>The film settles on the idea that dying for a cause is honourable and offers good deaths for those who die and redemption for Algren.  For the sections of the audience who think about that, it is a difficult thing to swallow. I didn't think about it till I got home and saw the news of yet another suicide bombing in the Middle East.  The film's point about the honour of the Samurai versus the West is OK until when dealing with honour among men and the ideas of a balanced society.  However when you carry it as far as this film does then you are saying that `an honourable man will not meet someone halfway - if he believes he is right he will give his life, no matter how difficult it seems'.  Sadly this is what the 9/11 killers did, this is what suicide bombers do and I found the film very difficult to accept when it appeared that it was promoting this.  I know of course that this was not the intention of the film - but by failing to have a grip on what it was doing below the surface, this film does just that.<br/><br/>The script is full of Oriental wonderings and fortune cookie sentiment that prevent the audience ever really getting close to the characters.  Cruise is OK but his role isn't as deep and tortured as he thinks it is.  It is really quite an obvious role and, while doing OK as a movie star, he cannot do much from an acting point of view.  Does he deserve an Oscar? Yes he does - but for Magnolia, not for this!  Watanabe deserves a nomination for Supporting Actor and I hope he gets that (but not the award) for he does a good job of making this man likeable where, were he alive today he would be classed a terrorist.  His confusion of the character has been well hidden and I felt he was a good actor for being able to do that.  Atherton plays the `baddie' of the piece (it's Hollywood - there has to be one or the audience gets confused), while Spall and Connolly add colour but not much else.  The Japanese support cast are all OK but none are given characters and are left in `honourable' clichés.  The only interesting one was Koyuki's Taka (who struggles having the man who killed her husband in her house) but this is given precious little screen time.<br/><br/>The script and confused politics are not Zwick's fault and he does well with what he can do - the scenery looks great and the film generally have a good oriental feel to it in setting, costume, sets and movement.  However this film is only OK.  As an action movie it is too long and dull.  As a meaningful epic, it is confused and not worthy of the aspirations that it has.  I left wondering what all the fuss was about despite taking something from it overall."

","Edward Zwick is one of the most under-rated directors out there, but I don't feel this is entirely representative of his best work. Not to say it isn't a damn good film (it is), but it's plainly obvious that Hollywood had their hands on this.<br/><br/>The tone is inconsistent. One minute, there's a standard, generic Hollywood action scene, shot the same way all standard, generic Hollywood action scenes are shot. The next minute, however, is a very calm, still, introspective montage taken straight from Terrence Malick's playbook. If the movie was either a drama or an action film instead of trying to be both, I think it would have more of an identity. The pandering to the lowest-common-denominator viewer played a large role in preventing that from happening. Some moments feel overly simplified to the point where it almost becomes a detriment to the integrity of the subject matter. Zwick's touch was not entirely obscured; there are plenty of great shots, scenes, and moments that can only be the product of a film-maker of his caliber.<br/><br/>The story is not without flaw. The entire set-up is very plain and not all that interesting. The hero lacks motivation, purpose for his goal, has nothing at stake, etc. But once Katsumoto enters the picture, the movie takes a major turn for the better. Even though the hero is not doing much externally for a preponderance of the film, it still captivates due to the strength of his inner journey. Seeing Algren learn about the samurai culture and grow to understand and respect them is without question the movie's biggest strength. His gradual character arc is splendid to behold.<br/><br/>Cruise, however, was not a good choice for the role. He did the best job he could (a very good job, in truth), but he still felt entirely anachronistic; he didn't look, sound, or feel like a man from that era whatsoever.<br/><br/>A few lax passages early on and several others sprinkled around the second half certainly hold the film back from reaching its full potential. There is a truly great movie in there just waiting to get out. If only Hollywood would just let film-makers make films.<br/><br/>Despite their efforts and the flaws contained within, Zwick managed to come away with a quality product that is both meaningful and enjoyable. With more dedication to the film itself and less concern on how many people will go to the theater and spend money, this could have been a masterpiece on par with Glory.<br/><br/>PS: the musical score is absolutely fantastic."

"Prashast_Singh","10","0","2","28 January 2019"," One of the most poetic action movies of all time!
","This is THE most poetic film I've seen till date. The Last Samurai is truly an epic action drama that engages you emotionally and soon, everything is felt. Everything.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is really impressive in this film as the role is completely different from what he has played in most films. Yes, he's an action hero once again but with a difference this time. Watch the film and see it yourself. Ken Watanabe is truly the scene stealer. His well written character will be loved. The rest of the cast is also quite decent, but it's mostly these two men who are the stars of the film.<br/><br/>The action is beautifully cut, with sword fights, epic scale battles and a number of martial arts fights impressively crafted for a larger than life experience. Dialogues are quite philosophical and deeply impactful in nature.<br/><br/>But perhaps the strongest aspect of the film which makes each and every frame so impressive is the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer. It' doesn't end with the film. It stays with you. It completely does justice to the film, especially the action scenes and emotional moments.<br/><br/>This film is more character driven than plot driven so don't expect a film with twists and turns or heavy plot development. Just enjoy the character drama, soundtrack, dialogues and the exhilarating action. It's one film I'll never forget in my life. Very strongly recommended!"
"tabuno","8","0","2","25 January 2019"," The Epic Adventure Movie of the Year
","6 December 2003. With the similar trappings of ""Dances with Wolves,"" and ""Braveheart,"" ""The Last Samurai"" holds to the same level of richness, intensity, complexity, and grandeur as its predecessors. Every few years, a movie comes out that captures a national experience with a foreign flavor that both examines the epic as well as the intimate personal scale of experience. The Last Samurai presents the audience a solid and carefully crafted epic of a nation undergoing dramatic and revolutionary change as well as the complex, subtle trappings of cultural differences (particularly difficult when it comes to a culture such as Japan). With emotional sincerity and respect to Japanese culture and tradition, the high class Japanese language used in the movie captures the level of seriousness upon which those involved cultivated their craft and produced this movie. Unlike its predecessors, it takes a somewhat harder line and perhaps simplified portrait of the evils of society and the trappings of political intrigue as well as a loosening of script towards the end. As with ""Dances with Wolves"" but with an even less effective ending the movies unnecessarily overextends the ending ending by about thirty seconds too long (that is suggestive of American producer and mass audience testing might require or dictate for better word of mouth ratings and profits). While perhaps not exactly reaching the same league of its former film epic giants with its slight blemishes, this movie is definitely the epic adventure movie of the year and maybe the last several years. Eight out of ten stars."

"cashbacher","10","0","2","8 January 2019"," Brutal clash of internal cultures within Japan
","This is a great war movie, the action is fierce, unforgiving and intense. Even though the viewer knows what the outcome of the climactic battle will be, the goal of the ""good side"" is not to win, but to lose gloriously.
As the title suggests, the backdrop is Japan in a time of great transition. Although Japan was closed to foreigners for 200 years, there was enough leakage so that the rulers of Japan were well aware of what the British and other western powers were doing in China, essentially subjugating it. They also knew that they had no weapons that could stand against those of the colonial powers.
Therefore, when the American Commodore Perry sailed into Edo Bay in 1853 and carried out a show of arrogance and force, the Japanese government had no choice but to accede. This led to a national crisis in Japan, where the rulers knew that they had two choices, modernize the country or be subjugated like China was.
The internal conflicts within Japan in the rush to modernize forms the background for this movie. For centuries, the warrior class of Japan were the samurai, skilled soldiers that fought using only hand weapons, most commonly swords, bows and spears. They resisted the modernization efforts, so the government formed a modern army with firearms and cannons to defeat them.
Tom Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren, a highly decorated soldier that is now in a love affair with the bottle. Algren is recruited to train the fledgling Japanese Army, but after the initial skirmish, he is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto, played by Ken Watanabe. During his lengthy captivity, Algren learns to appreciate the discipline and beliefs of the samurai, taking their side in the hopeless fight against the modern Japanese Army.
The performances of Cruise and Watanabe are superb, the viewer becomes very empathetic towards the samurai, all while knowing that their cause is hopeless. While these exact events did not happen, there is enough historical truth to make it a history lesson. The mindset of the samurai also will help viewers understand the Japanese unwillingness to surrender in World War II. For they were only following the bushido code."

","""The perfect blossom is a rare thing. You could spend your life looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life."" - Katsumoto<br/><br/> It is probably one of the saddest and most inevitable things in this world - war. And though war should not be tolerated at all, a civil war - when brother goes against brother, when those who share the same history, culture and language go one against another, this kind of war is the most horrible and painful. <br/><br/> ""The Last Samurai"", an epic action movie directed by Edward Zwick, is enlightening the events that took place in The Land of the Rising Sun of the late 19th century. The main character, Captain Nathan Algren, a lonely tortured soldier who's been trying to redeem his life back from the atrocities and nightmares of war is being dragged into the whirlpool of a new one far away from his homeland. Times are changing fast, and dictated by the examples of other countries Japan is gradually but firmly going from the old native ""samurai-like"" way of life country to a modern technological western style of living. ""Progress is a stepping stone of civilization"" - some say, but it doesn't mean that civilization itself progresses. Samurais, as the eternal symbol of the Japanese culture and as its guardians protest against the changes that civilization brings. Railroads, western cloth and food, western buildings and technologies, firearms and war tactics - all this might seem to be building a strong country ready to enter the international arena, but these things also tend to consume everything that Japan represents of itself - dedication, discipline, spirituality, philosophy. Katsumoto - the last leader of the samurai clan is trying to convince the emperor in his wrong choice of blindly following all modern tendencies and letting the country be corrupted by capitalism that hides under the mask of industrialization. Allowing other nations to have influence over Japan can be a crucial decision that might lead it onto the road of full obedience and dependence from other ""world players"". But will his words ever reach the emperor's ears, will he ever be able to keep the legacy of his ancestors... is he alone in this fight?<br/><br/> The movie focuses on the most important changes in the Japanese society in the late 19th century and tries to show it from the standpoint of the main hero, American captain, who happens to be very far from understanding everything Japan stands on at first, but ends as one who has found peace and comfort in a culture as distant as America and Japan are on the world map. The directors' work is great - displaying every bit of the eastern culture and lifestyle in a slow pace really makes us almost ""taste"" the spirit of the Samurai Epoch. Same can be said of the operators' work - paying much attention to details, whether it's a battle scene or a peaceful one, you will see the whole spectrum of events under different angles and from different points. Actors' work doesn't stop to surprise: Tom Cruise in the skin of Captain Algren - firm veteran of war, who has taken his part in suppressing the Indian rebellion during his war career and already has many sins haunting his mind making him be ashamed of who he has become; Ken Watanabe as Katsumoto - a true samurai by blood and by his heart, dedicated, strong and unbendable, the one who has the strength to follow his way of worldview and to lead others by his example; so different and yet so same, both are children of war, only, one saw it as a merciless, gruesome and unjustly slaughtering reaper, the other - as the way of ideals, morality, perfection, discipline, philosophy, virtue,.. and as the true way of the sword. Their distant roads have crossed to make them both understand what the destiny of a true warrior is. Secondary heroes like Billy Connolly (as Sergeant Zeb), Tony Goldwyn (as Colonel Bagley), Masato Harada (as Mr. Omura), Timothy Spall (as Simon Graham) and Hiroyuki Sanada (as Ujio) also deserve to be praised for building strong supporting characters and the background atmosphere of the movie. <br/><br/> Writing is screaming of majestic delight, unique vision and philosophical beauty. You will probably never find another action movie which concentrates its plot around religion, culture and spirituality that much as this one, and not only concentrates, but depicts it in the most harmonic way possible. Costume design, sets and decorations, makeup, special effects, fighting choreography, staging, views and heavenly gorgeous landscapes of The Land of the Rising Sun - everything is on the impeccable level, interweaving with one another draws a picture of splendid beauty and strikes into your memory forever. Nothing less to expect from a ""hundred-million-dollar"" Hollywood movie with not only technical quality, but a lot of heart in it.<br/><br/> The original score. Hans Zimmer. Not many words can describe this cosmic sublimity. It's like lying on a soft cloud with a cotton moon as a pillow, covered with blanket made of mild night with shining stars and angels are coming down from the sky singing lullaby and rocking you to sleep. It's a pure magic dream, where violin is a cloud, flute is a moon, trumpet is a blanket and the angel's voices are a mix of shakuhachi, taiko drums and other national Japanese instruments. Beautifully calm and violently stormy, starting with delicate koto melody, than letting the drums and percussions take over turning the mood from the softly-sweet to the battle-ready, the music emphasizes the spirit of every scene as it accompany the viewer through the film. Taking the breathtaking ""Way of the Sword"" track at the final battle scene - while bullets fly around, Algren holds dying Katsumoto in his arms and music becomes especially tender as though symbolizing his departure and a relief from all the hardships and duties he bared through his life. Fascinatingly crafted Asian-like music - ""The Last Samurai's"" original score will rightfully take its place among the Hans Zimmer's finest works.<br/><br/> 4 Oskar nominees (Best Supporting Actor, Best Decorations, Best Costumes, Best Sound Mixing) and dozens of other awards and nominations... philosophical, touching, captive - ""The Last Samurai"" will forever be on the list of the most brilliant movie works of our time!"

","The theme of honor and integrity run throughout this picture, with Tom Cruise portraying a former Civil War and Indian Wars soldier who's disillusionment with killing has stripped him of his humanity, leaving him a broken and dispirited individual. Aimless, Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) accepts an offer to train the Japanese in the art of warfare to put down a Samurai uprising against the new Emperor's quest to modernize his country. What Algren comes to understand following his capture by the Samurai will change his life, one which will offer a renewed dedication to discipline and learning. For Tom Cruise, it's an intense role in a picture that calls to mind the 1990 Western epic ""Dances With Wolves"" in it's examination of a foreign culture and how becoming familiar with the unknown can be a life defining experience. Perhaps even more charismatic than Cruise is his opposite in the story, Ken Watanabe as the Samurai Master Katsumoto Moritsugu. From Katsumoto, Algren attains a spiritual view of life that he never had before, grounded in values deemed noble, like honor, loyalty, and personal integrity. When it comes time to test Algren's new resolve, he joins the Samurai quest to turn back the forces that would diminish or destroy an entire culture for the sake of elusive modernization and monetary gain. Perhaps most notable is the manner in which Algren earns the eventual trust and admiration of his Samurai hosts by learning the language and adopting their martial art tactics. The Samurai way is emphasized a number of times in the story with the ritual seppuku performed by General Hasegawa (Togo Igawa) following an early American defeat by the Samurai, and later on as Katsumoto accepts death as his spiritual reward on the battlefield. What influences the story most is the ever present honor among a people to maintain their traditions and way of life."

","Continuing my plan was to every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to The Last Samurai (2003)<br/><br/>I will be honest, I totally dismissed this upon release in 2003. I deemed it a sub par imitation of Dances With Wolves. I never cared to revisit it until today. I don't mind admitting I was totally wrong!! This movie is much more than that. <br/><br/>It is intelligently written, brilliantly acted and in this day and age, it's an uncommonly thoughtful epic. The full power of the movie is only lessened by an ending that seems like it goes totally against what the movie was building up to. I won't go into spoilers!! That is only a minor gripe though. <br/><br/>I can't believe I was so wrong about this movie. Once again Cruise proves he can act and Watanabe is a seriously powerful presence; looking at it now, you could see he had potential to become a bigger star. Tony Goldwyn (always an a$$hole) is as slimy and unlikeable as always, and Timothy Spall is decent in his small but important role, likewise Billy Connelly. <br/><br/>Truthfully there is greatness in The Last Samurai but it falls just short of being a great movie (again the ending) instead of a really good one. <br/><br/>The Last Samurai grossed $111 million at the domestic box office (to continue Cruises run over $100 million domestic grossers) ending the year the 20th highest grossing movie of 2003."

","Over the years I heard my friends say how great THE LAST SAMURAI is. Guess what? I gave it a go. Apart from the usual ""white guy saves the day""...<br/><br/>I found it annoying.. the use of the word samurai. Samurai way, samurai sword, samurai this, samurai that.. it has to be a million times as if to constantly remind the viewer of the title. We get it, it's the THE LAST SAMURAI. <br/><br/>During the battle scene our Tom boy is only hit twice, once in the leg and other in the shoulder. Not to mention, he's spearheaded towards an enemy firing canons, rifles & gattling guns (25 rounds p/m).

Despite the fact that he killed her husband, later is responsible for the death of her nephew, her brother & literally every single able bodied men of her village. Further reiterates that he's the man, THE LAST SAMURAI. <br/><br/>I find Ken Watanabe's acting to be funny. Instead Chow Yun-Fat would've done justice to the character IMO (I don't care if he's Chinese).

","The Last Samurai largely and greatly benefits from its emotionally powerful, exceptional, completely unexpected and knockout ending and the best ending I've ever seen in movies in memory, stunning visuals, thrilling battle scenes and high production values. I love the slick comical touch in the movie and it truly works and suits the movie. The way the characters behave and look at the world around them is interesting. The movie also has a strong feeling and sense of heroism, honor, redemption and vulnerability and I like that. Well done. Now, I would like to comment on something people tend to misunderstand. A few, some or most people say that the ending is ruined and that annoys me because I can easily suspect that these people think too quickly for what it is to them as a first place idea in their mind rather than first trying to uncover its purpose and meaning and find out whether it is a ruined ending or not. Because whether it's a movie ending that we as humans in our nature are generally used to or not, that's not what matters, instead it is the meaning and purpose which is important. The so thought ruined ending isn't there just like that, and it's likely there for a (good (and worthy)) reason. So for those of you who still think of it as a ruined ending, please do what I just said: think deeply before saying. On my side I thought that the ending was great (as I, of course, already said). My rating: 7.2/10"
"oreoradley-621-48080","9","0","1","27 March 2013"," The Last Samurai? Or the BEST Samurai? (And/or the worst samurai?)
","Its definitely the best samurai. This has to be my favourite Tom Cruise film (along with Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages, Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, Knight and Day, Tropic Thunder, Mission: Impossible III, War of the Worlds, Collateral, Mission: Impossible II, Jerry Maguire, Mission: Impossible, Cocktail and of course, Top Gun). I don't usually watch art-house films but I never miss a Cruise film and as usual he did NOT disappoint. <br/><br/>In the film Cruise gives a commanding performance as he LITRALY plays a performing commander who has to travel back in time to ancient Japan to reclaim his honour (which has been stolen by the British again). While there he learns important new things like how to eat with chop-sticks and use a sword but most importantly he learns about himself and what's inside. Basically an f-load of honour. I think what made this film really excellent was that as well as having some super cool action scenes it also made me think about like, honour and what I would do if I was sent to ancient Japan?<br/><br/>Just as a warning to people THERE ARE SOME SUBTITLES IN THIS FILM. I know what you're thinking, 'if I wanted to read I'd buy the Daily Mail' and usually I'd agree, but if you stay to the end its totally worth it for the last fight scene alone (three words, CRUISE v NINJAS). <br/><br/>To conclude my review, I liked this film A LOT and would give The Last Samurai 11 Bens out of 14 bens (that's a strong recobendation). ;)"

I thought the Japanese actors did a good job and all the extras and there were also some pretty good action sequences it was very interesting this film and I thought the director did a marvelous job so was the screenplay.

","The picturization of this movie is above all. It has beautifully captured the countryside of Japan. This does make you feel the peace and beauty of the countryside of Japan. Yet , it goes very slow in that part too. Its probably a 30 min content increased to an hour. Even I felt that Tom Cruise struggled in most of the scenes in the countryside and he was more sort of dumb in that part. Common, you can speak thru your expressions which always seems a blank face on Tom Cruise. Though, he rocks in the action and initial scenes. The Samurai fight in slow-mo is amazing. Bow and Arrow is good too. The idea almost comes good of modern vs old weapons but it a little pace could have helped. Also, the story is rather simple on the whole and mostly predictable too in the later stages. But, the plus point of the movie except the picturization is Ken Watanabe. He steals the show whenever on screen. He perfectly fits into Katsumoto till his last breath. Overall, this movie sometimes bores you but it is still pleasing(7/10)."

","Tom Cruise is in top form as a samurai warrior no less in this action packed adventure.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a civil war vet in the 1800's Nathan Algren (Cruise in one of his better performance's since Michael Mann's Collateral). Nathan is sent to Japan to help the Japanese army fend off the Samurai, whom are being a real pain in the butt. Cruise being beaten in battle is now captured by them and learns their way of life from their leader Katsumoto (Watanabe). Nathan's eyes are opened to see who truly is the worse of the two, he is turned against the Japanese government and fights in one of the biggest sword swing, horse riding battles of all time (Just my opinion). Cruise and Watanabe give an electrifying performance in Edward Zwick's masterpiece The Last Samurai."
"tom-curtis","7","0","4","31 March 2012"," It IS a Tom Cruise film so. . .
","I give it a 7 out of a possible 10. And while you DO have the greatest movie star of them all in this flick, and some of the sword fighting scenes were very well done, the story still had a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>First it is such a cliché to have our war hero, Nathan, a drunk, but really have a good heart. He fought with Custer and has been haunted by the women and children he killed. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train the emperor's soldiers. During battle, he managers to defend himself while surrounded and the Samurai leader, Katsumoto, decides to spare his life. So Nathan is taken to the Samurai village and cared for by the wife of the man he killed. What doesn't make sense is why does he take this ""kidnapping"" so lightly. He is a very violent man, why doesn't he do something crazy. So, of course, he learns to love the Samurai way and chooses to fight for them. And of course they have to throw a silly love interest in being the woman who nursed him.<br/><br/>As I said the battles are done OK. I'm surprised it didn't get an R rating. There isn't much blood, but there are a number of people shown getting swords put right through them. But, I'm sure there is much more to the history lesson than is shown on screen. I never tells why the Samurai want to fight and don't want to get along with the emperor. I'm sure the movie paints the Samurai as much more likable than they really were.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It isn't a great epic, so I don't recommend it if you don't like long movies. But, if you really like epics then take the time to watch it because it isn't bad."

","This is a movie I will stop and watch again, and understand something valuable that I never noticed before. And that fact alone makes The Last Samurai an excellent movie.<br/><br/>First of all, I love cross cultural movies and this is one of the best. You can learn so much from the approaches of people in different cultures, and their interactions. The Last Samurai can be compared to Dances with Wolves. Both movies have an epic quality about them, well directed, wonderfully filmed and scored. Both movies are a cinematic sensual experience. But as strong as these aspects of The Last Samurai are, it is the human life themes that are important. It is the movie's message to the mind that matters.<br/><br/>Lieutenant Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, is a post Civil War cavalry officer who suffers from the guilt of killing women and children on the raid of an Indian village. Ironically, he is recruited by Colonel Bagby who led the raid, and by Mr. Omura of Japan to train a modern Japanese army. Omura represents the modernists of Japan, who wish to wrestle away political control from the remaining traditional Samurai war lords of Japan.<br/><br/>Algren, who would prefer to drink himself into oblivion and at times wishes for death to take him, is actually a wonderful trainer and leader of men. He knows how to communicate and encourage his young Japanese peasants to become effective fighters. But Omura and Colonel Bagby have their own time-line, because Lord Katsumoto is raiding Omura's railroad. They believe Katsumoto's forces cannot stand up against a modern army with rifles. Algren knows his young trainees are not ready, and this fight will be a bloodbath.<br/><br/>If there is a formula for success in recent movies it is action scenes, and this movie has four such action/battle scenes. They are important to the movie's structure, and in the battles many people are killed. Still, the plot structure allows the movie to move to the valleys in between the action scenes, and this is where the beauty of this movie occurs. Characters are explored, and viewers see the growth of people.<br/><br/>In the first battle, Algren refuses to retire to the rear and fights with his trainees against a full-blown traditional Samurai force attack. He sees his friend Sergeant Zebulon Gant killed in the charge, and fights to the very end, somehow avoiding death and taking the life of Katsumoto's brother in a last desperate attempt to survive. Katsumoto is moved, perhaps by the tiger banner of the spear that Algren uses to fight off the Samurai's forces, to take the American prisoner.<br/><br/>As Algren recovers from his serious battle wounds in Katsumato's sister-in-law's (Taka) house, and in the presence of Katsumoto's son (Nobutada), he also begins to heal spiritually isolated in this village from the rest of the world because the mountain passes have been closed by winter snows. He relates well with the children of Taka's house, and these small personal moments help show the normalcy of daily living salving the captain's troubled soul.<br/><br/>He admires the diligence of the people of Katsumoto's village, each seeking to be as perfect in their duties as they are able. He develops a friendship with Katsumoto; Algren understanding the honor and courage of this man, and his people, and Katsumoto and his village admiring the perseverance of this stranger.<br/><br/>At one point in the movie, Katsumoto finds out that Algren knew George Custer, and mentions how marvelous he was to fight to the death. However, Algren counters that 'Custer was a terrible general whose arrogance needlessly cost the lives of 200 men.' In that statement there is the contrast of the two cultures. The Japanese culture valued honor and courage in death, while the American saw honor and courage in life.<br/><br/>Algren is a good student of the Japanese language, and the use of the Samurai sword, so good in fact that he is able to help defend his adopted family, village, and Katsumoto from a band of ninja assassins hired by Omura. The American has gone from being a prisoner to an honored friend, with respect from each party growing into admiration. When he returns to Tokyo, his loyalty has shifted from Omura and Colonel Bagby to Katsumoto and his village.<br/><br/>The third action scene is his helping Katsumoto to escape back to his village, and then Algren organizing resistance against the more highly trained Imperial army that now has cannon and Gatling guns in the dramatic final battle, with Algren somehow again surviving.<br/><br/>This movie is about life and death, and honestly writers John Logan, Edward Zwick (director), and Marshall Herskovitz communicate well the beauty, and sometimes the struggle of life; and the terrible waste of life in war. Tom Cruise does an excellent job of understating his character--he is extremely believable. Ken Watanabe is also excellent as Katsumoto, but all the actors in this movie are believable, particularly the villains.<br/><br/>This movie is not perfect. Some situations seem a little unlikely. But sometimes real life seems unlikely. A viewer can enjoy the scenery, the musical score, the acting, and indeed the entire film. But hopefully the viewer will also perceive the contrasts of the cultural philosophies, and ultimately the complimentary natures of differing cultural philosophies."

","This movie takes place in the 1870's where Japan is trying to repress and eliminate the old sacred samurai way within Japan. They hire Captain Nathan Algren(Tom Cruise), an American civil war veteran, who will work for anyone. He is to help westernize the Japanese Emperor's army by getting them accustomed to firearms and taking away the threat of the sword and close quarters combat. But, Algren noticed when the Emperor wanted them to take place in battle his army was not ready. The Emperor still ordered the attack and the part of the army was slaughtered by the Samurai. Nathan Algren was badly wounded but he still fought to the end by killing Samurai leader Katsumoto's best samurai; this lead Katsumoto to spare Algren's life and took him in. When Katsumoto took him in this is where the movie started to get interesting in my opinion. Algren when he was healed enough to walk around he started to soak in their lifestyle and he started to appreciate their daily routine of waking up and dedicating your life to one thing to master. After he talked to Katsumoto awhile and realized they truly weren't enemies and Algren was forced in this action they began to get along and Algren trained with all the other Samurais'. After his time was up Katsumoto let him go but Algren didn't really want to leave and when Algren got back to the Emperor, they asked him all these grueling questions and he didn't like how they were like savage dogs in one big wolf pack. So, Algren had his change of heart and went back to the Samurai's and suited up with them when they went back to war with the Emperor's Army. I believe anybody can make this change in lifestyle if they truly see the pure greatness and the evil they have done to the good."
"jboothmillard","6","0","2","21 March 2011"," The Last Samurai
","I knew about this film purely because of the theme and the leading actor, and it was rated four out of five stars, so I had to try it, from director Edward Zwick (Glory, Legends of the Fall, Blood Diamond, Defiance). Basically set in Japan in the 1870's, cynical American Civilisation war veteran Nathan Algren (Golden Globe nominated Tom Cruise) works for anyone, and he finds himself hired by the Emporer of Japan. His job is to train his troops, and they will be the first army to use modern warfare, using firearms, and they will also be trying to eradicate the Imperial Samurai warriors. After a big battle or two against what are supposed to be the enemy, Algern winds up with the Samurai army, I think he is captured, and he finds himself impressed with their ways. Along the way of learning the world of the Samurai he is guided and finds friendship with the leader Katsumoto (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Ken Watanabe) who spared his life. This newfound liking for the opposite side seems to place him in between two worlds and two eras, including during battle, and the only thing to guide him is his honour, which he keeps until the end when he returns to the Americans, seemingly as The Last Samurai. Also starring Timothy Spall as Simon Graham, Billy Connolly as Zebulon Gant, Tony Goldwyn as Colonel Bagley, Hiroyuki Sanada as Ujio, Koyuki as Taka, Shichinosuke Nakamura as Emperor Meiji and Shun Sugata as Nakao. Cruise is noble and cool throughout, and from what I remember Watanabe is certainly a worthy award nominee, I may not have understood all the story, but for all the battle sequences and the really good costumes and scenery it is a worthwhile period action drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Sound Mixing, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Hans Zimmer. Good!"

In ""Black Rain"" and ""The Yakuza,"" Michael Douglas and Robert Mitchum, respectively, learned all about honor from the Japanese.<br/><br/>There's usually a good-looking woman in the alien culture. The native beauty serves a couple of purposes. (1) She provides a focus for those in the audience looking more for romance than blood; ie., the female audience. (2) A chance for a little nudity and simulated sex for the men. (3) She serves as an index of the white guy's integration into the alien community. (4) She's there to demonstrate that, by falling in love with her, our boy is not a racist.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is hired by the Japanese court to train civilians in the use of guns so they can put down a nativistic rebellion of a group governed by the code of the Samurai. After a clash with the rebels, Cruise is captured and harshly indoctrinated. He proves his worth. All the generic conventions apply.<br/><br/>I didn't stick around until the end because another officer in the US Army, about half way through, shows Cruise the new model of the Gatling gun -- two hundred round per minute and it doesn't jam. The rebels are armed only with swords and bows and arrows. I could see some unpleasant scenes in the offing. I quit watching when Cruise made an ominous reference to Thermopylae.<br/><br/>Maybe I was wrong and the rebels, whom we've come to respect and admire, didn't get slaughtered. However, that would be going against the generic current. It would take the inner gyroscope of a Samurai to do that and I don't think this movie has the guts."

","I have never been a big fan of Tom Cruise, but this film was proof enough to me to show that he genuinely can act when he puts his mind to it. Edward Zwick has been one of my favourite directors for a while now, because of his ability to produce such visually enthralling films which always present a controversial issue with a wonderful thought-provoking new light. The cinematography is simply breath-taking,and coupled with the beautiful Japanese rural setting and the adrenaline-fuelled battle sequences, this makes for a very high quality film. Many of the other reviews i have read on this film comment on the similarities between this movie and one of Zwick's earlier productions - ""Glory"". Evident though they are, I see no reason why this should be held against either the film or director, as everyone involved in the film industry, (and any other industry) develops 'trademarks' that they use from one job to the next. Personally, I would rather see a single duplicated entry sequences of soldiers arriving through mist than the far over-used cliché shot used in most Hollywood productions where the camera pulls out from a close-up of the main character to reveal the danger - the ""dun-dun-duuuuun"" moment that we see so often in modern films. Zwick has expanded on the emotion and sense of honour create in ""Glory"" to produce a far deeper and more moving film than he had previously, creating a perfect balance in the depiction of the Japanese culture and driving the narrative forward, capping it all with an outstanding finale. A touching story, supported by a superb score by Hans Zimmer, this film is a must-see for any viewers who appreciate a strong plot and great acting, especially given that Cruise expels for one rare occasion."

","One of my favorite movies ever. Its this generations Dancing With Wolves, with a career highlight performance by Tom Cruise, and a heartbreaking story that shows how the majority of today's nations have forgotten their culture in the process of adhering to industrialization and mass commercialism. Among the films trump cards is the absolutely beautiful score by Hans Zimmer. It reaches its emotional crescendos at the right moments and manages to uplift the films climax a few notches. The cinematography, set design, and amount of research that has gone into the film should also be applauded. The scene's at Katsumoto's village are the best of the picture, amply supported by the organic feel and stunning camera-work of its surroundings. The film's more quiet, poetic moments with Cruise's Soliloquy's are also brilliant. Lastly, Ken Wantanabe is excellent as Kasumoto and nearly overshadows Tom Cruise in a number of scenes they have together. Timothy Spall is noteworthy, as usual, in a supporting role.

It's entertainment not a documentary not once did anyone say this was based on a true story. Also being upset over the central character's turning his back on America shouldn't be so upsetting along with claiming he's against Christianity, um enough with throwing religion into this movie for all we know before the character was imprisoned perhaps he was Jewish instead they never show his religious beliefs at any point during this film.<br/><br/>Onto the film it's a modern day epic and does a better job than most films Hollywood has attempted to throw out. Yes the story is rather cliché and it gets cliché at times but again it's entertainment and it's a film trying to go back to the old day epics. The story is great along with the acting. A well written modern epic that captures what was great about the great films of the past and adds a few newer things to keep it somewhat original. I'd give it a 10 but the lack of originality and the many clichés take it down a notch."

The movie even illustrates the differences. If America was smaller the the honor of the Indian probably would of coalesced into a more cohesive unit.

","I'm not one for picking a favorite movie, but if I did have to pick only one film as my favorite (instead of six or more, as I usually do)...

","impressive and quite entertaining. I for the first time witnessed the way of Japanese life style. Here American army captain Nathan algrin played by tom cruise is sent to japan at the request of the emperor of japan. Algrin itself is very disturbed , shocked and ashamed of killing and witnessing of Navajos (the red Indians) in cold blood. The emperor himself asked personally asked about the Indians , how much they are fearless and they ready themselves for an honorable death before going to battle , tom cruise answered yes ,they are very brave. When he is confronted by the samurai army who is in opposition of the royal monarchy algrin is deserted and surrounded by the warriors. Here is the moment , he catches the eye of kasamoto , played by ken watanabe. Kasamoto had a vision of a white tiger surrounded by his warriors ,and the tiger is still defiant and is willing to do or die. Tom had a spear at that time with a flag carved with an image of white tiger. When algrin is captured ,kasamoto willfully forced his lieutenants not to kill him. During he is in their custody , he experiences strange time. He is not like a prisoner but a guest. He is made stay and treated at the woman , whom her husband was killed by him, she is the sister of kasamoto. He is surprised when tells kasamoto about a general who took all his cavalry in between swarm of angry Indians and they all were slained. But kasamoto is very impressed. The samurais are very interested to know about the way Mohawk and Navajo Indians lead their lives. Mostly he came to know that the samurais are in opposition of the emperor just because they didn't wanted him to sign on an agreement regarding trade with USA , that would definitely impact the cultural identification of Japanese people. On the other hand inside in their hearts they respected the emperor as their father and mentor, all they want is to make him realize about the welfare and prosperity of Japanese people, to curb an iron hand on corrupt officials and politicians who are willing to malpractice in the cover of the trade agreement. They follo0wed a strict code of honor and preferred death before dishonor. Their spirit and will to fight till the end was so powerful that it even won the hearts and minds of their own rivals. Coz they just wanted to depict and display their own royal army adversaries the spirit of Japanese glory and prestige , they wanted all of them to know the way living the life before death. There is so much to say about this movie but i sum it up that this movie gave very much insight about the japs and i say they are awfully great people at the face of this planet. If u re not moved by watching this film just little only than i am sorry about u but at least i consider it damn good."

","best acting from Tom Cruise other than the movie jerry Maguire.its a brilliant movie overall and should have won Oscars if not for LOTR. There might be a slight flaw in its historical aspects, but come on this is a movie.there is nothing wrong with Nathan(cruise) living until the end because it was already mentioned that his time has not come(conversation between cruise and watanabe before the final battle).<br/><br/>The main theme in this movie is Honor, and it portrayed that in every way.the theme is Honor, not culture or history so don't expect to get much of those two.this is not a movie where there is another superior American, but an American who learns from people around him and adapting himself to their culture.<br/><br/>some people find it very hard to accept an American samurai, but in this movie, Nathan is already a professional warrior in his own country, so he does not find much trouble learning from them.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie for me is an epic and i Honor it in every way."

","The movie is good. Or it isn't. It all depends on you and how do you accept the American ""samurai"" movies. That is what 'The Last Samurai' is - an American movie. This movie has some great action, pretty good acting, beautiful cinematography but lacks in showing the real Japanese culture. Don't get me wrong, there is the samurai honor and everything else you want to see but it all was made more elementary and easier for the westerners to accept it. And there was the American Super Hero - Tom Cruise... This is a big problem.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!!! Algren learnt Japanese in less than two years. This is impossible no matter how good linguist you are. At the same time he became the greatest swordsman in Japan and he learnt everything about being samurai just in a few months. It was him who saved the samurai leader from the ninja. All of the movie's message was destroyed by showing the American as the greatest and the strongest person.<br/><br/>The other big problem of the movie is the story. I do not know about historical accuracy but the biggest part of the story was almost directly taken from the great novel ""Shogun"". It is not the first time nor the last time when I see the same story in another book or movie or even comics. I have seen it even in a comics about Conan. But in all of these movies the depth of the original story is just not there. I almost hate it when I see something like this...<br/><br/>END OF SPOILERS!!! <br/><br/>There are some big problems in the movie but there are some very good things too. As I said before there is some good acting and beautiful cinematography. But the greatest reason to see the movie is the action. There are some of the greatest fights I have ever seen. And they are done by the Japanese way - one strike - one dead enemy. It is just great and you have to see it.<br/><br/>I guess you will be disappointed by the movie if you expect some deep story about the confrontation of two cultures - there is not depth. But if you expect great action you will enjoy it."
"sddavis63","8","0","2","11 January 2008"," A Great Movie That Borrows A Bit Too Heavily
","After the first half hour or so, I have to admit that I was very disappointed with this movie. It seemed as though we were being treated to a remake of Edward Zwick's earlier (and magnificent) Civil War movie ""Glory."" Several of the scenes seemed lifted almost word for word and action by action from that script. Think about it: the young officer (Algren, played by Tom Cruise) tormented by his memories of past battles (like Shaw in ""Glory""); the training scene in which Algren demands that the inexperienced Japanese soldier shoot under fire (as Shaw did with Jupiter in ""Glory""); the Samurai emerging from the fog to take on the inexperienced Japanese army (as the Confederates did in taking on the 54th Massachussetts in ""Glory""). ""Glory"" was a great movie, but I really wasn't looking for it to be refilmed in the context of a Japanese civil war. Fortunately after that first half hour the overt references to Zwick's earlier movie faded away (with the exception of one scene near the end of the movie when Algren hands his journal and papers to an observing journalist before going into battle, just as Shaw did before the Battle of Fort Wagner) and ""The Last Samurai"" is then able to take on a life of its own, and it does so very well.<br/><br/>There were a number of things I really liked about this movie. It provided an interesting reflection on Samurai culture. (I say reflection rather than study because I have no idea how historically accurate the reflection was.) We see a clear reflection on American history (and particularly on the winning of the west.) Algren was supposedly a veteran of battles against the Sioux, and there are several references to Custer. Obviously, Algren is trying to make amends for helping to wipe out native American culture by trying to preserve traditional Japanese culture. There was also a perhaps inadvertent reflection on the so-called ""Stockholm Syndrome,"" in which a captive begins to increasingly identify with his captor, as Algren clearly does after being taken prisoner by the Samurai.<br/><br/>This movie features very good performances by Cruise (with whom I am not always enamoured) and also by Ken Watanabe, playing Katsumoto, the head of the Samurai warriors, and there was an excellent closing battle scene (obviously Zwick - as he showed previously in ""Glory"" - is an expert at recreating such scenes.) The only thing that detracted from this (aside from the lack of originality in stealing too many scenes from ""Glory"") was an ending that was altogether too sappy in a number of ways. I would have ended this on the battlefield, which to me would have been more appropriate. Still, there's no doubt that this is deserving of an 8/10."

No kung fu or fancy sword moves, just brutal Medieval warfare. This is probably how it was for samurai warriors, sept they didn't kill men by the hundreds in one sitting, and that Tom Cruise didn't wear a helmet. Oh yeah that scene with samurai vs. ninjas. I'd expect that from a corny magna.<br/><br/>As for the violence goes, I've heard people say ""It's REALLY"" violent"" or ""Last Samurai? That was GORY"".

This was Ken Watanabe's 1st role in an American film, and I'm absolutely positive, he could think of nothing better with the work he did in this masterpiece, and the sword fighting was extremely well choreographed, plus I would put this performance of Cruise's up there with one of his best!.

Tom Cruise is amazing as always and is incredible here, He really shocked me with his passion about The Samurai, and also proved his incredible versatility, his sword&fighting skills, were also very impressive, and some of his scenes with Watanabe are some of the most powerful I have ever seen, he can add another top notch performance to his resume with this one, he was truly incredible! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Ken Watanabe is incredible here, he gives us a performance that we will never ever forget, he was just so powerful and had an amazing presence, he was also very intense, and so passionate about his role, his performance really moved me, for a lot of the film this was his show, I can't wait to see more of this guy!. Masato Harada is brilliant as Omura, I hated him with a passion, he was so unlikable, and I hated him for what he did, and sure you will too. Tony Goldwyn and William Atherton do fine in there roles.

","Tom plays Nathan; a somewhat fearless, ignorant soldier who is asked to train a Japanese army to go to battle against the Samurai. He agrees, but the Samurai are closing in on them too fast and against Nathan's will they get ready to battle with the Samurai. They're doomed to lose and the Samurai capture Nathan. Nathan grows to respect and admire the Samurai, which is what the movie boils down to.<br/><br/>There are hints of romance and Nathan's problems with sleeping in the movie, but the latter just disturbs the movie IMO. Tom makes the movie believable, but with good help from Ken Watanabe (Katsumuto). It has a serious tone throughout the whole movie. With a movie like this it is probably hard to make a great ending..it has been done, but not here though. Definitely worth watching, preferably at night when you are doing nothing else."
"Elswet","7","0","2","5 March 2006"," Beautiful, but still lacking
","I LOVE this movie! But it's not all that it's made out to be. In some ways, it's more, but in others, it's less. Let me explain.<br/><br/>This film has been hyped as a masterpiece of cinematic art. It IS wonderfully filmed, with great effects, superior sound, and beautiful location shots. A masterpiece? Hardly. The plot line is too weak, Cruise's character so contrived, that there is little point to this movie.<br/><br/>This film has been dogged as completely useless with too many slow spots. It DOES have slow spots. It is primarily a drama, actually, regardless of how it was billed, so there ARE slow areas where story- or character-development are given center stage.<br/><br/>It seems viewers either love or hate this movie based on the two basic factors above; however, I find myself somewhere in the middle. I was genuinely surprised with the caliber of performance Tom Cruise turned in. I'm NOT a fan of his work, but this time, his portrayal was quite compelling. I found the story and all and details surrounding the way of life of Japan's past to be interesting, and the action sequences (what there was of them) were stunning. So was the cinematography of this picture. Astounding and the landscape shots were breath taking.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this work, although I don't consider it as art house as the makers (or the Academy) did. <br/><br/>It rates a 7.4/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"zenk0006","7","0","2","28 January 2006"," Excellent movie, but mediocre actor in lead
","I thought the plot line and story was an excellent one, much in line with Shogun, Dances with Wolves and other movies where a lost soul finds truth in who he is through another culture. Where this movie falls short for me is in the acting of Tom Cruise. I have no personal beef with Cruise as I think he has had several good movies that suit his acting style. Mission Impossible and MI2, Top Gun, Risky Business, just to name a few. I personally don't believe he is a great drama actor. He simply does not pull it off as his dramatic range is more believable when it involves a character with a huge ego such as in Jerry Maguire, A Few Good Men, or The Color of Money. I think a better choice of actor for the role of Nathan Algren would have been Christian Bale. This critical role needed a highly physical actor, capable of performing highly technical martial arts skills, with a tremendous dramatic range. Without this, the movie falls well short of its potential."

","I had really not great expectations when I saw this movie. I was just waiting to see another Hollywood smoothed show about exotic cultures, without any real compromise, historic accuracy or deep characters -especially when it was Tom Cruise who appeared as main character. I was gratefully surprised when I saw the story showed the least due respect to History, and towards the social and personal conflicts it depicts. Whether it is arguable that the Samurai philosophy is worth defending it, as a war-based style of living, anchored in a dark past disguised in tradition, the plot focus on the positive aspects that were perceived as endangered along the modernization of Japan. Of course, there is room for Western ""endophobia"", since the bad guy is a Japanese Judas eager to earn money western-style, and as I explained before, it seems that the only way to express Honor and the quest for perfection is a fascist or maoist-like, isolated society. Yet the movie is fair enough to watch at it a second or even a third time. It is entertaining and well made, and it is easy to sympathize with the ideals of the Samurais."
"Alex-372","7","0","1","15 June 2005"," Artistic License
","Oh dear. The Last Samurai, directed by Edward Zwick (of the equally problematic Glory, with Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman, as well as the prophetic Under Siege), has directed a movie that is a Hollywood gumbo of historical facts, romantic fabrication and artistic license.<br/><br/>The main character, captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), is sent to Japan so his Indian wars AND civil war experience can be put to use, teaching the Japanese modern warfare.<br/><br/>One problem is that Zwick plays havoc with the timeline. In one scene, Algren witnesses a samurai having his top knot cut off by a squad of Japanese soldiers in Western uniforms, to which his friend Simon Gray (Timothy Spall) says: 'It has begun'. This then must have been during the Meiji Restoration, when the Samurai lost their privileges, from 1866 to 1869, just after the American Civil War (which ended in 1865), during which the Samurai lost the privilege to wear their top knot and their two swords.<br/><br/>However, Algren also claims to have been traumatized, fighting Indians under George Armstrong Custer, who was killed at the battle of Little Big Horn, in 1876, at least 7 years later.<br/><br/>I have serious doubts that the Samurai versus modern army battle ever took place, and if it did, it certainly was not after 1876.<br/><br/>Then, there is the unlikely Madam Butterfly romance between the Yankee soldier and the wife of the Samurai he killed. At one point, she asks for permission to kill herself. Wouldn't it have occurred to Algren's protector Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), that she may also try to kill him by slipping something into his food or the sake he drinks so much of? Oh and by the way, the Japanese had experience with firearms before. However, because of high casualty rate on both sides, which led to famine (most of the foot soldiers were farmers), they were banned.<br/><br/>The movie does however give an accurate picture of how the new weapons (howitzers, machine guns, rifles) made a huge impact in warfare, and made ""modern"" colonialism possible. It is no coincidence that colonialism came to it's high point (with the 1885 Vienna Conference) when these faster weapons made decisively defeating Native forces (Zulus, Native Americans, Indians) possible. The irony of course is that it were these weapons that came back to bite the West and destroy it only 40 years later, in Flanders fields."

","In this film, the director employed numerous theatrical elements to convey to the reader a sense of majesty in relation to the samurai of Japan. One of the initial scenes to take place on the battlefield pitted the poorly trained imperial soldiers against the battlehardended samurai. The director filmed the scene in a mist and with suspense building drumbeats in the background. Because the samurai were seldomly focused on, it added an air of unrealism to the scene, which was compounded by the mist.<br/><br/>During other scenes, the director used lighting and sound to convey messages to the viewers. In the village, all of the colors are rich and comforting, to display the comforting nature of the samurai. On the other hand, the cities were portrayed as overly busy and had bland colors and depictions.<br/><br/>In whole, the movie was an excellent work from both the battlefield and intellectual, posing the question of whether ""civilization"" is all it is cracked up to be, levels."

The overall themes were tired and old starting with the US mistreatment of the Indians to the western worlds ignorance of cultures older than our own in the early part of the last century. (I say in the early part of the last century. Currently we are not ignorant of those cultures even if we act as if we are.) Some good sword fighting in the Samurai film tradition and a beautiful landscape. Ken Watanabe's acting was wonderful and heartfelt, portraying feeling and emotion not from the things he said, but from his bearing and expression. But that was about it. They touched on some of the aspects of what being a Samurai is about, but didn't really go deep into the meaning. (See ""Ghost Dog, Way of the Samurai) This I felt would have been much more interesting than watching Tom Cruise play a teary eyed drunk dealing with inner demons. Sorry - been there, done that.

","I enjoyed the exploration of Japanese culture, and the struggle between modernisation and tradition, an issue which has found an interesting balance in Japanese society to this day. The one thing I could not stand in the movie was the incredulity in parts of the storyline. As already mentioned, the fight seen where Algren beats 5 samurai with a blunt flag is unbelievable, as is the machine-gun fight scene, where by some lucky coincidence, he is THE last man standing among the whole cavalry charge. And his capture... and the willingness of the samurai community to allow the enemy to join them? Fine, it makes for good drama but it somehow seems a bit too far-fetched a concept. Nonetheless, it does expose a lot of the Spartan and philosophical self-discipline of Bushido, and a great performance by Ken Watanabe. I was a bit disappointed by Cruise's appearance though, it seems like he's becoming more in love with himself as a big-name movie star rather than play the character."

The ONLY differences: there's no Two Socks, Dunbar wasn't a captive of the Sioux in DWW, and Algren's diary doesn't get stolen.

","**Spoilers ahead but not really if you think about it**<br/><br/>Start with one pinch of Gladiator, two parts Dances with Wolves, four parts of Braveheart, and a generous serving of Glory. Release the Tom Cruise in all his rabid, teeth-gritting, brow-furrowing intensity. Mix.<br/><br/>The result of all this inbreeding is the most predictable movie of the year.<br/><br/>Here is what you might guess The Last Samurai is about, given the trailers and assuming you've seen more than three Hollywood movies in the past 20 years:<br/><br/>White man is thrown into far-off, exotic culture. White man clashes with the savage locals. White man is eventually moved by aforementioned, exotic culture. White men wins over the respect of the exotic locals by beating them at their own games and revealing his own areas of superiority. White man joins exotic locals in their struggle, they all fight valiantly against impossible odds, but lose anyway because they are a fading breed of far-off exotics. The only expectation LS failed to deliver was a gratuitous sex scene starring white man and a female member of the exotic natives (though yes, he does get her). <br/><br/>So yes, this has all been done before. But for the most part, the cliché plot elements are tastefully handled. There were one or two absolutely cheesy scenes that had me retching in my seat, but all-in-all the movie rarely gets too emotionally ridiculous.<br/><br/>Towards the end, I realized Cruise's character could have been removed entirely from the movie and it would have been just as good, maybe better. I give The Last Samurai a 6 / 10: worth watching but nothing special.<br/><br/>Oh and don't forget to add ninjas, because Americans LOVE ninjas. Remember those turtles?"

","While some of the sword fighting scenes were well done, the story still had a lot to be desired. First it is such a cliché to have our war hero, Nathan, a drunk, but really have a good heart. He fought with Custer and has been haunted by the women and children he killed. He gets an offer to go to Japan to train the emperor's soldiers. During battle, he managers to defend himself while surrounded and the Samurai leader, Katsumoto, decides to spare his life. So Nathan is taken to the Samurai village and cared for by the wife of the man he killed. What doesn't make sense is why does he take this ""kidnapping"" so lightly. He is a very violent man, why doesn't he do something crazy. So, of course, he learns to love the Samurai way and chooses to fight for them. And of course they have to throw a silly love interest in being the woman who nursed him.<br/><br/>As I said the battles are done OK. I'm surprised it didn't get an R rating. There isn't much blood, but there are a number of people shown getting swords put right through them. But, I'm sure there is much more to the history lesson than is shown on screen. I never tells why the Samurai want to fight and don't want to get along with the emporer. I'm sure the movie paints the Samurai as much more likable than they really were.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It isn't a great epic, so I don't recommend it if you don't like long movies. But, if you really like epics then take the time to watch it because it isn't bad."

","Spoilers. Read only if you've already seen the film.<br/><br/>My summary line was a favorite expression of the late sci-fi writer, Philip K. Dick. He used it in reference to the late Roman Empire, which instituted a materialistic Christianity from the Apostle Peter. Before that, there were numerous Christianities that rejected materialism, such as the Gnostics. The Romans prevailed, and their legacy to us is materialistic philosophy, hence ""the Empire never ended"".<br/><br/>This has considerable bearing on Last Samurai. The climactic scene involves dozens of samurai in traditional armour being mowed down by a Gatling gun, manned by westernized Japanese artillerymen. It was quite an amazing spectacle of the impotence of the meta-physical samurai, with their trust in spiritual tradition and virtue, to compete with progressively minded Government forces in the Age of Progress.<br/><br/>On another note, the Americans are miscast here. It was the Prussians who initiated the academic study of war, and thereafter consulted on the modernization of Japan's army.

","There were not an overabundance of moviegoers which bowed to `The Last Samurai'. The film was a moderate box office disappointment despite the fact it starred megastar Tom Cruise. Did Cruise make a risky business decision in taking on a Japanese epic? Did he feel aggravated that the film did not show him the money? Was it a mission impossible for `The Last Samurai' to obtain blockbuster status? Let me cut to the chase: `The Last Samurai' stars Cruise as Nathan Algren, a 19th century Civil War soldier who takes on a job in training a Japanese army in battling Samurais. In a fierce battle, Algren `sword' of gets held captive by the Samurais. Through a gradual & grueling process, he is befriended and welcomed by the Samurai nation and ends up being `sword' of a Samurai himself. Ken Watanabe co-stars as Katsumoto, the fearless & commanding Samurai leader. Watanabe received a Best Supporting Actor nod for his performance here. He had a tyrannical presence here, but I think the nod was not deserving. I `sword' `watanabe' Sam Rockwell of `Matchstick Men' to had received the Best Supporting Actor nod instead. The masterful components of `The Last Samurai' was its breathtaking cinematography, ingratiating sound editing, and cultural costume design. A few critics felt that the Academy was crude to Cruise by overlooking him for a Best Actor nomination. Tommy Boy's sensible & courageous work was notable but not for him to cruise a Best Actor nod. Director Edward Zwick is one slick director with all the effort he put into the film.  All in all, `The Last Samurai ` was quite lengthy and should have `cut' some scenes out, but it still displayed luminous filmmaking qualities. *** Average"

But after being captured by the Samurai he is redeemed, of course, when confronted by the blatantly positive painted picture of the Japanese samurai culture. No dark shades here. In a few months he learns a good word Japanese and to fight on par with the best of the samurai (who took probably most of their live to get to that level). To keep the cost down they have one bad guy in the movie, called Omura, who presents the new (and of course abject ways). He seems to be solely responsible for all that is bad and none can oppose him, as he controls the emperor, runs the railways, issues the laws and at the end commands the Japanese force opposing Cruise and friends. Quite busy little man that one, and what twisted picture of Japanese history. Finally the movie closes with a version of the charge of the light brigade or is this a Kagamusha remake? Cavalry charges Gatling guns and howitzers with the predictable results. But what an amount of lead does it take to down cruise. I think he must have received his bodyweight in bullets. Summary: bad performance for Cruise, unbelievable story and characters, bad fighting scenes.

Now where have we seen that plot before? <br/><br/>On the good side, this movie is extremely good as a DVD, the photography is stunning, and the audio uses the full range of Dolby Digital sound effects. Also the DVD shows how much attention to detail the filmmakers paid to making sure that all of the weapons used in the movie were authentic looking and relevant. They made sure the Japanese soldiers used authentic rifles of that era, the Samurai used authentic Samurai weapons, and the Ninjas used Ninja weapons. <br/><br/>Too bad they didn't pay as much attention to the historical context though. They made it look like the Samurai were some backwards peasants attempting to maintain a agrarian way of life -- equivalent to some native American tribes. But the DVD itself shows up its own flaws: one of the features in the extra features is a documentary showing the historical accuracy of this film and it wasn't too good. The Samurai, far from being peasant villagers, were detested and feared by the general population, and their rebellion wasn't about maintaining their old ways of life but about maintaining their political clout within the empire which was waning.<br/><br/>Watch the movie for its special effects, but it's not much of a story.

He genuinely looks peaceful and serene (and who wouldn't be in an idyllic village where all you have to do is exactly what you WANT to do) and is also convincing in major battle scenes.<br/><br/>However the film has a major flaw as far as I am concerned and people can criticise the script, the directing, the production, the special effects as long as you like, I really don't care, it's a good film in my opinion. But what REALLY irritated me about this film is that the first half of it is spent building up the fact that the Samurai have been masters of war for a thousand years and that they are highly noble, honourable, self-trained killers. Tom Cruises character comes along and all of a sudden the mighty Samurai leader looks to Tom for ever single battle decision that needs to be made, for either reassurance or inspiration. It's ridiculous! At some moments, Tom actually orders the troops himself without actually consulting the leader! It's yet another ""Thank god the Americans have come along to fight the war for us, we never would have coped without them! which I find utterly hilarious because the Americans have a terrible reputation in war - they haven't won against a major power war since WW2 (Iraq is not a major power) and wouldn't have even won that if it hadn't of been for the British resistance beforehand and afterwards.<br/><br/>This film would have been an awful lot better if they had taken the chest beating American stuff out of it."

Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is an ex-American cavalier, who once took part in fighting against the Indians. He is hired by the Japanese government to train their peasants-turned soldiers how to fight the 'blood thirsty warriors.' The Japanese believe his past brutality gives him the knowledge to do this. Armed with inadequate training and lack of experience, the Japanese troops are deployed to battle the rebelling Samurai. As expected, the troops are slaughtered by the great warriors. After the melee was through, Capt. Algren is captured and taken back to their village by the Samurai leader Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). There he learns of the Samurai way of battle and grows attached to their culture, even learning the Japanese tongue. Because of the Samurai and their discipline, Capt. Algren reforms and becomes a better man overall.<br/><br/>The director Edward Zwice has put much thought into this film. The director displays an important message throughout the film. The message emphasized was the drastic effect of firearms on the war field. The Japanese wanted to progress with the rest of the world and upgrade to rifles and gun powder. To achieve their goal, they eliminated the Samurai and their strict methods of combat. When the Japanese engaged the Samurai, they obliterated the warriors with machine guns in a few seconds once they were adequately trained. This reformation not only happened with the Japanese, but also with the rest of the world as well.<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" displayed diverse technique and planning. Skillful procedures were used to display the Samurai as fearless warriors, as well as intimidating. In their opening battle, the Samurai were portrayed as fearsome, 'ghost-like' warriors and the battle cries yelled by the charging horsemen struck fear into the hearts of the peasant soldiers. Before the warriors could even be seen, their presence was known by fearsome cries and eerie chanting. Many methods were used to build suspense, like fog and overcasts from trees, during scenes involving combat. Multiple camera angles were used throughout the film to portray the greatness of the Japanese Samurai."

","I just saw the latest Tom Cruise Action/Melodrama, The Last Samurai. The film was a mixed blend of good and bad cinema that culminated in an all too Hollywood ending. The film was directed by Edward Zwick who has a long history of making average but memorable films such as Glory and The Siege. The Last Samurai was no different.<br/><br/>The film is a story about Civil War hero Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) trekking to Japan to teach the new Japanese army the western ways of killing. Once there, he leads the shaky soldiers into battle against the Samurai and their leader, Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe). Algren is captured by the Samurai an ala Dances with Wolves adopts their ways and joins them. The two main themes of the movie are acceptance and redemption. The movie becomes an educational lesson for the viewer by underling the ignorance of the American's of the time and showing the greatness of the culture that they are saturating and destroying. The other theme of the movie that came to light was redemption. Through the film Algren has constant flashbacks that came to describe how his cavalry massacred a village of Native Americans.<br/><br/>The story is written fairly well but seems to lose believability and substance at key times. The dialogue of most of the conversations carries well, but many of the characters seem to contradict themselves. For instance Katsumoto seems to be content with halting modernization and does so by burning railways. Yet later on he tells Algren that he is the perfect samurai blending modern with the past.<br/><br/>The acting in this film, with the exclusion of Tom Cruise, was great. Ken Watanabe had a very commanding presence and was the star of the movie. In fact, the lot of Japanese actors and actresses in the movie were great. Tom Cruise on the other hand was the usual. It seems that for some reason he thinks that staring at something really hard is acting. I personally found him to be playing the same character arch from Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>Some of the underlying plots were either good or blatantly unnecessary. Algren seems to bout with alcoholism through out the first half of the story but it magically goes away after one screaming night of pain. One of the other underlying plots that was presented very well is the film's depiction of the Japanese's repressed sexual tension by the supporting character Taka (Koyuki). This is an accurate subject that still can be sensed throughout Japan today. <br/><br/>The visual of the film is good but is laden with a mess of mediocre shots. The spacious establishing shots are constantly compromised by TV-like close-ups. It's almost like the cinematographer, John Toll, gave the camera to his assistant and went back to his trailer. The variation in visual style is shown best in back-to-back shots during a montage in the middle of the film. The first shot is a beautiful silhouette of Algren whisking his sword in the blowing grass in front of a setting sun. The second shot is of Alrgren and Katsumoto strolling through fake falling snow that blatantly screams sound-stage.<br/><br/>Probably the worst part about the film was the Hollywood ending (Spoiler but nothing really to spoil). In it the film Japanese Emperor Meiji accepts Alrgren's plea and decides that Japan should turn back from is modernization. In actuality Meiji led the Japanese on a whirlwind of modernization and took them to war against China, Korea and Russia during his reign. Despite being historically false, the Emperor also seems to belt out a lengthy conversation in English.<br/><br/>Being highly critical of the movie, there were still many great parts. One of the parts that I like was that the movie was done in the real dialogue of the characters. This meaning that for the large part of the movie that was in Japanese, they spoke it in Japanese. I really like this and felt that it added to the creditability of the film. It also created a film that relies less on its dialogue and more on its visual components.<br/><br/>The best part in the movie came when it actually submersed it's self in Japanese culture and sent in a team of ninjas to take out the samurai leader. I thoroughly enjoyed this part of the movie. Samurais versus ninjas, what else could you want?"

","Does anybody else think this may be a rewrite of the old SHOGUN? The book, SHOGUN, is superb, but I didn't care much for the film. Obviously, the plot is somewhat different, but the basic story line is the same. We have a Westerner teaching the Japanese, who before used only the bow and the sword, to use guns in war. Westerner learns to love the ancient Japanese culture, turning his back on his awful western ways. Sound familiar? This is much better written than SHOGUN (the film) and in my opinion, has superior acting (but then even I can act better than Richard Chamberlain). Cruise is excellent, but Ken Watanabe as the warlord Katsumoto steals the show from Tom. A beautiful Japanese actress Koyuki also does an excellent acting job. A lot of the dialog is in Japanese with English subtitles, but somehow that's not too much of a distraction; it adds to the realism. There are a couple of large battle scenes and, yes, it gets very bloody. But when you hack someone's arm off, they're going to bleed! Overall, very well done but some borrowed or recycled material."

During a battle he is captured by the enemy.  During his stay he learns the way of the samurai, and eventually embraces it.  All the elements are there.  The problem was Tom Cruise.  His portrayal was so flat that I didn't care about his character or what happened to him.

","Contrary to common comments I read, I don't agree to call it a boring unrealistic movie because it is quite realistic for both American (America native people) story and Japanese according to the real history and time. The only part invented was that those supposed hired strangers were British and not American. But at large I liked the way they have judged the United States war history old times from a soldier point of view.<br/><br/>Native massacre was real and a 3000 year's old civilization was destroyed in less than 100 years. On the Japanese part, it was well done to make it simple, because Japan's history is not quite so. The characters names were even kept to give an epic illusion. Everything was quite realist, the weapon, the philosophy and even the complete discuss of strangers that you can feel all along the movie is realistic. On the other hand I hated the battle scenes as I hated the brave heart/lord of the ring etc. battle style. On a giant cinema screen you can't seen a damn thing because the camera is zooming-moving and shaking at the same time (the point is get you trilled) and 2000 men fighting with 2 very alike colors moving as fast as they can. I thought Matrix and other modern movies had killed this battle style once and for all, but some people look to appreciate those head hake images. I don't really like to comment on actors, because Tom did the job and this was not a very difficult role, not stunning at least, so I prefer to comment the movie as an entire work. Very American directing, slick and swell, is all I can say. If you need any idea what a Japanese movie is supposed to look like, then watch some Kurosawa or even Kill Bill vol.1. Attention Spoiler!!! The last battle, with the canon shooting: I have seen this part at least 20 times in Japanese movies and animations! That is such a classic, so probably it happened more than one time. Samurai's proud ''Katana'' against a great Portuguese canon and even automatic gun, is a classic to illustrate the brutal ''bushido'' end. As often, I judge many critics to be wrong (unrepresentative) because of a lack of knowledge. But all information was given in the movie (names / period etc.) as tools to complete the story by yourselves by reading books or other information sources.

","First off, this was not a terrible film.  It was ok, and worth a watch.  I would rate it a 6 overall, since it does have certain parts that are somewhat enjoyable.  But, when comparing this to other worthy samurai films, such as Seven Samurai, Rashomon, or Ran, this movie clearly falls apart. The plot is one that isn't truly believable, not saying that all plots are, but for some reason much of what happened to me was predictable and cliched. When watching any number of scenes, you could predict word for word what Tom Cruise was going to say.<br/><br/>Now some may argue that the film is visually captivating.  Maybe.  It does have some scenes which are decent, but comparing this again to other color samurai movies, especially Ran, the images are weak and empty.  Although flagging is done somewhat correctly on the warriors, this has absolutely no meaning for the viewers and thus is just another ""cultural awe"" of asian cultures that many will just look at and think to themselves, ""strange"".<br/><br/>The character development in this film was also a bit on the weak and unbelievable side.  Tom Cruise starts out as a boozer, but then becomes a compassionate warrior, even though the only thing that has changed is that he is now a prisoner and eating rice.  His character develops into something that fits with what american audiences want to see, not what may really happen and something that may be even more interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, this is still a better than average film, but I would never call this movie a classic nor even rank it with other worthy masterpieces of Akira Kurosawa.  It is a good film to watch if you want a very americanized film of samurais, but definitely everyone who likes this films NEEDS to see Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai)."

To pull down some big bucks, he signs on as a mercenary to help Japan get rid of a bunch of Samurais who, for reasons unknown, try to kill the modern Japanese army even though Samurais are peaceful warriors who only fight at the Emperor's command, etc...blaa, blaa.

","About every 3-4 movies, Tom Cruise likes to remind us that he really can act. He did it with ""Rain Man"" and ""Born On The Fourth of July"", and now he's done it with ""The Last Samurai"".<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" tells an epic story set in Japan during the late 19th's century when the island nation first opened its doors to Western ways and trade, sparking a cultural battle between the old ways epitomized by the samurai and the new ways of the outside world. This is the Japan as seen by Cruise's character, Captain Nathan Algren, a Civil War hero haunted by battlefield horrors to the point where he has become a self-hating, alcoholic plugging Winchester rifles for $25/week.<br/><br/>Algren is recruited by his former commanding officer to travel to Japan and help train the nation's fledgling army. Specifically, his new employers want their modern army to defeat rebel samurai who aggressively oppose the invasion of Western thought and technology into their culture. With nothing to lose and a significant pay raise to gain, Algren accepts and soon finds himself drilling conscripted Japanese farmers.<br/><br/>Against his recommendations, Algren is forced to lead his barely-trained troops against the samurai. Algren's troops are slaughtered even though the samurai fight with traditional weapons (sword, spear, bows & arrows). Algren is captured by the samurai leader, Katsumoto (skillfully played by veteran Japanese actor Ken Watanabe), so that he may learn about his American enemy.<br/><br/>It is here that we get to the meat of the story. Algren is held captive in the samurai's mountain village where he gradually becomes more involved and amazed by the samurai lifestyle and philosophy. While he slowly becomes integrated into their culture, he never quite convinces himself that he's one of them. Nonetheless, as his relationship with the samurai switches from being adversarial to deep friendship, and even love, we are treated to a series of rich and emotional transformations for both Algren and the samurai. In most movies, this would be the ""slow"" part between battle scenes. In ""The Last Samurai"" conversation gets balanced with action to keep you involved in both the story and the action.<br/><br/>On many levels, it is as much a deftly-told love story as it is an epic adventure. And not just a stock love story. ""The Last Samurai"" wraps the love of ones culture, love between a man and a woman, and the deep, familial bond between soldiers into one story.<br/><br/>Considering the barrage of summer/autumn action thrillers, we're not accustomed to films like ""The Last Samurai"". Here we see director Edward Zwick (who also directed 1989's ""Glory"" and 1994's ""Legends of the Fall"") use a more thoughtful pace to let us settle into the story, watch characters interact, and then ramp up the tension with carefully placed (and beautifully filmed) battle scenes. ""The Last Samurai"" leads the audience through a broad range of emotions and shouldn't be compared to the high-octane action films we've watched for the past few months.<br/><br/>So, overall it is a very good and powerful story. But as you're watching ""The Last Samurai"" you may get the sense that you've seen this very good and powerful story before. And perhaps you have. It was called ""Dances With Wolves"", another fine epic film that addressed the same themes, conflicts, and even used many of the same character types that are carbon-copied into ""The Last Samurai"".<br/><br/>This isn't necessarily a criticism. The story worked for audiences before and ""The Last Samurai"" adds enough new angles to avoid being a blatant rip-off. After all, ""Dances With Wolves"" was ultimately a loose rework of ""Lawrence of Arabia"", and no one seemed to mind."

"tyron_hunter","Null","0","1","17 March 2004"," Passion and ferocity, but with time for introspection
","Recently the culture of the Orient has become extremely fashionable in the West. Sushi, Tai-Chi and Feng-Shui are all part of the English lexicon nowadays. Isn't it ironic then that over a century ago that Western civilization did its best to marginalise and even stamp out the rich Eastern cultures it encountered?<br/><br/>'The Last Samurai' is a film rich in irony. It's ironic that the very introduction of modern weapons of war to Japan by the U.S.A. would ultimately culminate in the tragic bombing of Pearl Harbour a century later. It's ironic that the emissaries from the West try to bring 'civilisation' to a culture that has been civilised for thousands of years. And it is ironic that had Tom Cruise won the Oscar for Best Actor his ex-wife, Nicole Kidman, would have presented the statuette to him by virtue of her being the previous year's Best Actress winner. Life doesn't always imitate art.<br/><br/>Cruise's performance is a landmark - possibly the best of his career to date. It seems as if all the other films he has appeared in have prepared him for this character and it's fascinating to watch those former roles surface in this movie: the disillusioned former soldier he portrayed in 'Born on the Fourth of July'; the muscular martial artist he was in 'Mission: Impossible 2'; and even a bit of the tortured soul he exposed in 'Vanilla Sky'. But in 'The Last Samurai' he brings an extra-dimension to the character that isn't part of his acting technique. Tom Cruise is an embodiment of the all-American hero - he has been ever since 'Top Gun'. And in this film that aura is used effectively to emphasise yet another of the movie's ironies: it is this American hero who is the first to realise the wrongfulness of the American involvement in Japan.<br/><br/>The story follows an American Civil War hero, Captain Nathan Algren (Cruise) as he goes to Tokyo to train the Japanese army, who are embroiled in a battle with a tribe of Samurai. The Americans are there simply for the money, and that money is happily offered by the Emperor's Westernised advisors who want the Samurai out of the picture so that they may continue to pull the Emperor's puppet-strings unhindered. In an early battle however, Algren is captured by the Samurai and held by them for the winter. During this time he learns the way of the Samurai and eventually ends up fighting alongside them - breaking his allegiance to the country he once fought for.<br/><br/>The obvious comparison to make is to 'Dances with Wolves', where Kevin Costner's character similarly defects to the side of the natives. Indeed, Cruise's Civil War hero fought with Gen. Custer against the native Indians, witnessing first-hand the atrocities of that war. However, Costner's love interest in 'Dances with Wolves' was a white woman and that shared ethnicity formed the basis of their bond to one another, whereas the bond between Algren and the Japanese woman he comes to love is far more heartrending. I won't reveal the details of that relationship, but the woman is played by Koyuki, and her performance is accurate in its portrayal of a woman who is just as scarred as the warriors she cares for - but she wears those scars on the inside.<br/><br/>It is Ken Watanabe in his performance as the samurai leader Katsumoto who dominates the cast though. His introspective and thoughtful warrior is a sharp contrast to the ill-disciplined American captive. Their initial encounters bristle with an energy that lies beyond the spoken dialogue. It is chiefly through Watanabe that the samurai are depicted as noble and intelligent. The movie wants the audience to wonder about which side it is that is actually the civilised one. In the course of the movie, individuals from both sides refer to the other side as 'barbarians'. Certainly the fighting that is vividly dramatised in the movie is violent to the point of barbarism, but who can judge whether it is more barbaric to lop off a soldier's head (as the samurai do on plenty of occasions) or to mow down an enemy that is armed only with swords using a machine gun?<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of Kurosawa's classic, 'The Seven Samurai', especially in its depiction of war as a duty that the samurai must fulfill - almost as if it was as much their place in society to be fighting as it was for the farmer to be sowing his crops. In Kurosawa's film, the samurai are loners who band together only under a banner of war and who are always separated from civilian life by the duty of war. In 'The Last Samurai' however, the warriors live in towns with wives and children - a sense of community is depicted in the scenes when they leave for and return from battle. I sense that this difference has less to do with our history of the samurai being revised and more to do with the fact that Kurosawa was influence by the old Westerns and their loner cowboys, whereas Zwick is far more familiar with family values on screen.<br/><br/>The screenwriting credit that Zwick and producer Marshall Herskovitz are awarded is evidence that the director tinkered with the screenplay during filming. This tinkering seems most obvious in the movie's final scenes, which seem awkwardly different in tone from two hours of film before. It's almost as if Zwick was so aware of the many messages the film had to convey and the deep ironies present in the story, that he couldn't help himself from hammering those ideas home a little more.<br/><br/>I think that it's only a minor misstep at the end of a glorious film though. If you enjoyed the passion and ferocity of 'Gladiator' and 'Braveheart', but seek a little more mental than visceral stimulation I highly recommend 'The Last Samurai'. It's certainly one of the best films I've seen over the past summer."

","As wholly predictable a picture as i've seen in recent years, this is nevertheless impressive entertainment; criticized heavily by some for attempting to emulate the 'Dances With Wolves' formula in the Japanese world (as if copying what works in Costner's masterpiece is ill-advised), Edward Zwick's 'Samurai' epic unabashedly sweeps all such cliches along in its earnest and often stirring story.<br/><br/>Late nineteenth century Japan: US military officer Nathan Algren is hired to train a new imperialist army to fight against rebel samurai warriors. Defeated, his brave stand whilst surrounded arouses the curiosity of the rogue samurai leader, who takes his wounded foe back to his village to recover. Thus begins a relationship that will change Algren forever... offering him a chance to face his haunting past...<br/><br/>Tom Cruise delivers a standout performance that recollects moments of his amazing Ron Kovic in 'Born on the Fourth of July'. This dignified actor here showcases an on-screen charisma that few can match in his generation. Ken Watanabe displays searing intensity as the tribal leader who commands the respect of Algren, through both his intelligence and fighting prowess.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are incredibly tense and brutal, and the cinematography by turns painterly and immediate. Pretty much what you'd expect then: but when movies are this enjoyable, that is no bad thing."

","While watching it, you begin to realize that The Last Samurai is almost a carbon copy of dances with wolves, with a few minor changes. this movie takes place in japan, so the indians are replaced by samurai. other than that, all the themes and plot devices are disturbingly similar.  There are even the same kinds of voice-overs by the main character, who also draws cute pictures of the natives in a little book. Also, they keep mentioning indians in this movie, so every five minutes you're reminded of it. I couldn't watch this movie without thinking of  several other epic war/drama movies that it was eerily close to. Like the native americans, the samurai are on the verge of becoming obsolete, and are fighting to maintain the old ways of life in japan. Cruise, playing an alcoholic captain haunted by his bloodfilled past, goes to japan to help train troops to supress the samurai rebellion. To make a long story short, he ends up being captured by the samurai and adopting their ways of life and gaining a new respect for the people he once thought of as enemies, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>I found cruise's acting in this movie to be somewhat jarring. I never really bought the fact that he was a man living in the 1800s - there's something just too modern about him and the way he acted in this movie. Aside from that, I thought that the samurai in the movie were portrayed in a completely one dimensional way. The movie showed them to be completely honorable, always morally upstanding, and to be great warriors. Which is fine, but is that how they really were? Yes, and no. I think things were more complex than that. A complexity this movie chose to ignore completely. As a previous reviewer observed ""Samurai have a code, but are not perfectly moral and honorable individuals"". From my severely limited understanding of feudal japan it seems that samurai were skilled warriors who dedicated their lives to serving their masters - but also that they were part of the aristocracy and would sometimes commit cruel and unjust acts against the lower classes with their superior social standing being their only justification. Basically, if you were a peasant in feudal japan, and you did something to anger a samurai, no matter how trivial, he could cut off your head and that would be perfectly ok with everyone. I'm not saying all samurai were like this, but that was acceptable behavior for the upper classes at one time. I don't know if that kind of thing was still going on during the time this movie was supposed to have taken place, but it was like this at one point. In light of this, maybe its not so suprising that many of the people in this movie seemed to be against the samurai - even though the movie never bothered to explore the question of why the samurai deserved to remain in power, other than the fact that they were the ""good guys"" and represented the ""old ways"". This movie doesn't deal with that at all, instead showing only one side of what the samurai were like - the politically correct side.<br/><br/>
TLS disappointed me, although i should know better by now than to expect much from a hollywood epic. It LOOKED really good, if that means anything (probably not). The script was kind of lame. Some of the fighting was nice, though. As a whole, it was striving to be profound but seemed really contrived. I would have liked a more realistic version of the samurai. The ones in this movie never seemed human to me. They were just too perfect, politically correct, and glorified beyond all reason. I also found it hard to buy that the uber-traditionalist samurai in the movie would so totally accept a gaijin (foreigner) into their lives so readily like that, but whatever. if you want an entertaining and less completely homogenized view on feudal japan check out something like Blade of the Immortal, a japanese samurai manga (comic) by Hiroaki Samura. It's a comic book, but it is written and illustrated by a japanese and is supposed to be a pretty well-researched look at feudal japan, although the characters and story itself are fictional. It has been translated into english by dark horse comics. But then again, Blade of the Immortal is not very popular in japan, so take that how you will.<br/><br/>If you thought Dances with Wolves was condescending and unbelievable, you'll find The Last Samurai to be even more so, and less entertaining on even a mindless level.  Hey, nice try, though. 5/10"
"stanleyleo87","9","0","1","23 February 2004"," Great Movie...except for the ending.
","After watching The Last Samurai a couple of months ago, the images and themes it bring up still linger in my mind. The image of Katsumoto (played by Ken Watanabe) meditating on top of the hill to begin the movie was pretty powerful. It presented the idea of inner-peace, yet also one of confusion, which seems to be a paradox that many people face. Also, the theme of honor runs rampant throughout the movie, and is strongly conveyed through the Samurai characters. Hiroyuki Sanada was impressive as Ujio, the tough, brutal, yet loyal and disciplined Samurai, and Ken Watanabe stole the movie with his powerful performance as the regal Katsumoto, who was faced with the dilemma which was complete change, or annihilation. The only character I felt was a bit overdone was Tom Cruise's. Granted, he was the main character, which is why the majority of the luck went to him, but it is still hard to believe that any man could have survived that charge on the howitzers. Getting stabbed my a couple spears when he was captured yet surviving, believably lucky; not getting ripped apart by hundreds of gatling gun rounds while everyone else around you is, unbelievably lucky. There were moments where I felt that there was a fair amount of overacting by some of the actors, but overall, the mood of the film was well maintained and expressed. I believe this movie deserves an 8.5/10"
"shinymc_shine","8","0","1","25 February 2004"," Another Civil War Hit For Zwick.
","Edward Zwick's ""The Last Samurai"" is an epic, dramatic, war film set after the American Civil War in which a disillusioned soldier is hired to instruct modern warfare to the Japanese.<br/><br/> The opening sequences perfectly and succinctly introduce Tom Cruise's character, the time and place the film is set and the violence that is to come. Co-screenwriter John Logan is certainly the flavour of the month, or should I say decade, with past credits that include Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"", Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" and ""Star Trek: Nemesis"". Not to take away from Zwick's involvement who has created a beautiful, humouress and gentle film that is punctuated by moments of graphic brutality.<br/><br/> Over the last couple of years we have been introduced to a new Tom Cruise. The pretty boy of the past who inundated us with arrogant, always heroic characters has been replaced with an older but wiser thespian who's not afraid to disfigure his globally known face. Here he plays an alcoholic, emotionally scarred, Civil War veteran. Not your usual Cruise role. He tried to change his image twice before. In 1989 he portrayed Vietnam War veteran/protester Ron Kovic in Oliver Stone's ""Born On The Fourth Of July' to much acclaim. Then in 1994 Anne Rice adapted her own novel for Neil Jordan's ""Interview With The Vampire"" in which Cruise starred as Lestat much to Rice's dismay. After viewing the movie Rice changed her mind and thoroughly endorsed their choice. Now with Cameron Crowe's ""Vanilla Sky"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"", Cruise has made the leap from movie star to actor. His choices as an actor and producer are quite bold, challenging, even intellectual. He provides a stand out performance as a tortured man ruining his body, losing his will to live but with a never say die attitude on the battle field. This is a complex character and Cruise has obviously paid special attention to crafting a very real, compassionate and moralistic soldier.<br/><br/> The other star of this film is Ken Watanabe. This is his first English language role and he commands attention with a quiet but powerful screen presence. He physically conveys the ideology of the Samurai to an audience that may be clueless as to what Samurai do or stand for. Along side Cruise he stands his own and in some cases steals the scenes they have together.<br/><br/> Scottish comedian Billy Connolly appears in a supporting role as a fellow serviceman of Cruise's. There is something quite pleasing about seeing Connolly in a big budget Hollywood production. He always brings a smile to your face whenever he enters frame. After some strong performances in previous dramas, John Madden's ""Mrs Brown"" for example, you no longer let out a little giggle when you see Connolly's name up on the big screen. His laid back persona and loud, sometimes controversial stage performances serve him well as an actor. He fits his role perfectly. I only wish that he could've sticked around a little longer.<br/><br/> Also in support is Mike Leigh regular Timothy Spall as an Englishman abroad who fell in love with the Japanese culture. Spall has always been a likeable actor with a natural flair for comedy. He's in some part the comic relief but also a Caucasian teacher of basic Japanese life for Cruise and the audience. Tony Goldwyn and William Atherton also appear.<br/><br/> The special effects are certainly worth noting. It's getting tougher to figure out whether crowd scenes are real extras or computer simulated people. Unfortunately there is one shot that screams it's a blue screen effect. When Cruise is standing on the boat coming into port there is something extremely artificial or cartoonish about the background especially the sunlight shining over the horizon.<br/><br/>This is not the first time that Zwick has tackled the subject of the American Civil War. ""Glory"" was a brilliant film about the first black regiment in which Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for best supporting actor. That film was a very tragic tale and one of the most horrific aspects was that they seemed to have no knowledge of strategy. So it comes as a surprise in this film when Cruise's character turns out to be a brilliant tactician. Majority of what he knows about tactics comes from Greek history. But with ""Glory"" in mind you have to ask yourself how intelligent or educated were the soldiers at that time. One film portrays them as unschooled in the art of war while the other has them as genius strategists. What is the truth of the matter?<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/> Some critics have complained about the conclusion of the film saying that it becomes too Hollywood, pandering to it's lead actor. Here's a hint. The film's called ""The Last Samurai"". It's star is Tom Cruise. What did you expect? It's all in the title."

Anyway Algren is hired by the Japanese army to train their troops in the fight against the rebellious Samurai. Algren is captured in battle and learns the way of the Samurai.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses the politics gets harder to understand and loopholes appear in the plot line such as 'Why does Algren change sides?' and 'Why does Algren fall in love with the widow of a man he killed in battle?'. Also the movie begins to drag and all the scenes not involving Algren are in Japanese. The makers of the movie seem to believe that this can be made up for with cool scenes involving ninjas, which is partly true.<br/><br/>The producers made the mistake here of trying to mix Samurai, the coolest guys in the world, with an epic. By the end of the movie you could not care less whether the samurai get killed or not, you just want it to end. This has Hollywood corniness written all over it and the final scenes of this are packed with enough cheese to make you sick.

In a serious film, or at least a film trying to portray reality one expects a certain amount of credibility. This was most evident in the last scene of the 'last stand' of the Samurai warriors against the 'modernised' howitzer, machine gun equipped japanese modernists who used these modern weapons to great effect against the sword equipped Samurai, yet our hero - Nathan Algren, after a moving scene of seeing his mentor and Lord die, gets up unscathed, whilst all around him are dead and wanders off the field of battle!

After an early battle, the Japanese army is massacred by the samurai, and Algren is captured.  He is brought to the samurai's home, where he heals from his wounds and talks to Katsumoto about the Japanese army and Katsumoto's rebellion.

","This pompous, one-dimensioned, uninteresting, long and phony picture tries really hard to portrait `the real Japan'. Needless to say one single frame from any Mizoguchi film (sixty, seventy years old as it may be) is ten times worth than this banal reproduction, poor ensemble of local color and cliché. From the lifeless, mummified characters that seem to bring together  and in a lighter dose- the charlatanry of Morpheus from The Matrix and Karate Kid's Pat Morita, to the cheap plot devices and filmmaking (we see the sword fight and right afterwards the videoclip of the fight, a nicely learned lesson from Tarantino's school), Cruise's attempt to build a legendary figure embodied with Custer's bravura and Samurai's honor is anything but believable, rather a wannabee metaphor of some new age dubious doctrine. Cruise character is tormented by memories of his past as a women and children's murder; this issue never nails on the audience as in the case of `Unforgiven', where the character's inner demons must be confronted and defeated by paying a hell of a prize. In fact it is precisely Eastwood's humanity what constitutes his heroism. On the other hand, Cruise's experience `on the other side' is more of a tourist kind compared with Harrison Ford's life with the Amish in `Witness' or Gene Kelly's magic discovery of `Brigadoon', two classic examples of imperfect individuals transcending themselves after coping with a world that is not their own. Bad as a film could be, there's always one or two scenes worth remembering. Not in this one. Let's give credit to the title and hope it'll be the last."
"vincentwsho","Null","0","1","21 January 2004"," First time watching is not the last
","A movie can be successful in many ways. It may have stunning visual effects, bringing you at the edge of your seat. It may have a fantastic story, inspiring you deeply. It may have fabulous actors, making you truly believe in what you see. It may have hysterical spots, making sure you would never be bored. 'The Last Samurai' no doubt contains all these successful elements. The story begins with Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise), who could never seem to find a decent job. He seemed destined to become a captain. Hired by the Japanese government, he was to train their soldiers with modern arms. Due to the rash behavior of his fellow colonel Bagley (Tony Goldwyn) and Omura (Masato Harada), he was forced to bring a troop of unready soldiers to battle. The result would be obvious, and he would be held captive in the hands of his archenemy. There in the deep hills, he met Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), the leader of the samurai warriors. Through these conversations Algren had with Katsumoto, he began to learn more about 'Bushido', the spirit of the Japanese Samurai. And Katsumoto would learn about the American culture. As time goes by, the friendship between Algren and Katsumoto would develop, and Algren would discover the best for Japan. Eventually, he would join forces with Katsumoto and participate in the final showdown with the modern army of the Meiji Government. As the film had first articulated, the crucial word linked within this story is 'honor'. It is exactly what Bushido is like, 'to serve'. Japanese people would do whatever to serve their country, to make Japan a strong country. It would be a disgrace to lose in a battle. Rather than dying or held hostage in the hands of your enemy, suicide would be an act of glory. Told from the view of a foreigner, Algren in this case, the story becomes a lot more convincing. This movie wanted to bring out a message: was modernization really most suitable for Japan? Could wearing Western clothes and buying Western arms really make Japan a better country? It may be necessary, but should Bushido be forgotten by all? This film wanted to remind people that Bushido was actually the major factor which brought Japan to power, and not modern arms and weapons. The movie began in fascinating style, with already something to laugh about. As it went on, there was not a bit of boredom, with gunshot and war scenes appearing frequently. It might have gone less active in the middle, but with the funny parts between Algren and the Japanese, it remained interesting. The film reached its climax when the battle of Katsumoto and the Meiji army began. The film kept a really good pace and I simply couldn't find a place where it was sappy. From beginning to end, the film was inspirational, some reflected by the passion of the scenes, and some by the sentimental elements of the scenes. I must say, I was excited all the way through. The acting of Tom Cruise was magnificent. Recalling a few of his more recent works 'Mission Impossible II' and 'Minority Report', 'The Last Samurai' would have a completely different style. These three films may be similar in terms of action, but 'The Last Samurai' requires a lot more in terms of acting. To tell you the truth, I am not a Tom Cruise fan, but I really admired his work in this film. He successfully portrayed a character of no choice but to disobey his true self. He had to make a living, but killing was not his cup of tea, especially when he had to kill innocent lives. He demonstrated his hatred to colonel Bagley. He showed his loneliness in the village, where he could not speak or understand Japanese. The feeling of eternal waiting was tickling the very veins of his heart, not knowing when he could be released. He was being treated like a stray dog with the eyes of anger all on him, like he was a friggin' freak. Later on, he revealed his friendship for Katsumoto and love for Taka. All this shows what a fine job he has done in this film and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination for the best actor this year, at the least. The acting of Ken Watanabe was equally as good, showing the power a true leader should possess and the spirit that every human being should be born with. The care for the Emperor was clearly sought out, and his loyalty for the country could never be doubted. Make that two Oscar nominations. The scene of battle was realistically shown, thanks to the great directing of Edward Zwick. The visual effects were awesome, bringing out the overwhelming strength in the battle. The smooth flow of the film should also be credited to the director. But like any other classical film, there are also some defects. If Algren was a captive, how could he be treated with such hospitality? He could go anywhere he wanted to in the village, and how can the children be so kind to him? After all, he did kill their dad. And at the end, Algren should have died! These parts didn't really make sense. Even so, as long as a movie can move the audience in some sort of way, it is a good one. Even now, I still stand by my word and consider this the top favorite of this year's Oscar winner. It would not be the least surprising if 'The Last Samurai' can emerge as the Best Picture of the Year. For those who like action films, this is a wonderful film. For those who like historic or literary films, this is a fantastic film. For those who like comedies, this is a great film. For all, this is definitely a masterpiece that is worth watching over and over again."

","This movie has a basic source of what such a movie as Titanic, that was based on #1-the Story; but this was questionare, but OK, #2-Action;Battle Scene, Costume.., #3-Actors;Tom Cruise(Japaness Actors were even greater), #4-Conflict; (as far as I know, the best conflict involves some sort of a love story between the couple,family, or community, like Companionship that needs in order to make the audience feel through their heart) On the other hand, this movie can't afford to do that in order or anything further to prove for making the audience to be in such a companionship with the characters in a movie. Because Audiences are familiar with no one but Tom Cruise as who he is known for regardless.  For example, Titanic could hire Brad Pitt instead of Neonardo, or Claire Daines instead of Kate, but they did not.it would make the audience to belive the movie is just another Hollywood film and less focused on the story. American Audiences did not know many Japaness actors or anyone like you would've seen in a movie ""Kill Bill"" those Japaness actors..but somehow..in this movie, Last Samurai...those Actors were so great..so people do not even question so much about how bad they were or anything.because thats just the fact..as they were so great in a film....Period..But I believe this movie should not be made without someone like ""Tom Cruise"" not because he is such a great actor but the best candidate to be in the film for American..(Additionaly, to correct from the above-mentioned, Tom Cruise is a great actor now.....and may not the best of all, but we have seen him doing enough to prove that he is capable of doing more if he has a chance to prove it at any given time.) #PG-13(Titanic) VS 4-Rated R movie(Last Samurai)..I wonder why...I wish it wasn't put out as Rate-R movie, so kids could've seen it as well as many audiences who have already watched it.  To be the best, we can never exclude the Hollywood commercialism that makes the winner of all time based on who made what movies for how much in return for the gross sales.  In my theory, as if Brad Pitt once made a hit movie, ""The legend of the Fall"".so what if Tom cruise was younger in his 30's, in which might be helpful for many targeted movie audiences who are in their teen age to 20's and the movie delete the few scene of cutting the head off or Haritoka whatever that caused the film to be rated-R. Then In additon, if it was possible through the story, more love scene before the battle scene, so people would have felt such a companionship beyond the doubt about the way he survived after the battle scene, ..then it would make sense more for his returning to the village and meet the Woman again for a happy ending of American soldier's life story as a myth but ok to let it be..as a story. I wonder what if a story begins with a given sword that was kept and held by his next generation...and they started telling the story about the myth how their grandfarther(Tom Cruise) lived as only knowing of what happened but also, they belive the story because they have some sort of a connection to prove that to the audience about the myth of their grandfarther..or whatever..So, the Samurai Story begins to reveal the story instead of showing a weak character of Tom Cruise who is an alchoholic and a retired army veteran....So, my final opinion is ..this movie has a great action scene than any expectation from a movie trailler that many people have watched and felt about how...or what..and acting was such a great ...and to be fantastic..costume was more than great, and cinemaphotography was as good as the lord of the rings and better than Titanic.  Sounds or songs in a movie was not that great but ok.  Hours of the film..never bothers me but some younger viewers or someone that is not a big fantatic....in general..I believe. This movie is the best of what I have seen so far in 2003..and I hope there are more movies like this coming soon in 2004 as well.."

","I was not sure whether to see this film or not because I was tiring of the Tom Cruise performance style. However I am glad I did as I found it valuable entertainment with some great quotes and inspirational satire.<br/><br/>Its true, Tom Cruise can act after all! It is quite a performance, with fantastic Japanese backdrops and culture, excellent supporting roles by Ken Wantanabe and Billy Connolly and great action sequences.<br/><br/>So whats the catch? No catch really but more a warning as Tom Cruise balances on the edge of self-adulation that has a familiar danger about which Kevin Costner became an expert. The last sequence of the film records his apparent immortality when everyone about him is killed. This for me did not provide a happy end to the movie but made it rather unbelievable and made an unfortunate diversion from reality. This rings alarm bells that ask is Tom going to do a Kevin; blinded by success and available finance, will he be create films to further his immortality rather than the filmmakers art. I hope not."

"soma36","9","0","1","14 January 2004"," A very good time
","First of all the movie was not overwrought or cliched except perhaps for a couple of scenes, and the ending was satisfyingly ambiguous....Much in line with the the spirit of the times, and not just in Japan. The battle scenes I found were more enjoyable and less abritrary the LOTR and the development of the plot appropriately paced. I found it even a little more rousing and emotional, at least in terms that i could identify with than ROTK. I guess unlike ROTK and precedents, the story was a good one but simple. Thus it left a little more time and resources for good execution. I was amazed although not suprised at the performances of the Japanese contingent in this movie, and Tom Cruise was quite bearable, and the training he put in for the movie definitely paid off. The cinematography and scenery spoke for itself, but I am biased! At the end of the day, the movie was sufficiently cynical about some historical things, and idealistic about others- but i think in the right way around. Perhaps the Samurai came off as being little too overglorified and consistent in their virtue (as with any human spiritual/religious sect, consistency is desired but not always achieved), but it made for an excellent story and vehicle for alluding to the troubling loss of virtue and ethical coherency endured at the time, and one that may well be appropriately contemplated now. Overall it kicked the butt seriously<br/><br/>BTW, I dont understand the ""Dances with Wolves in Japan"" criticism. The premise is admittedly the same- a tormented US Civil War veteran finding solace in the customs in another culture- but the development of the story is completely different. First it is a completely different culture so therefore the internal dynamics and interactions are different, which in itself is interesting. Anyone who misses this has perhaps too much interest in the technical aspects rather than the movies key theme. Secondly, DWW was more a love story, while in the LS the love story (happily) is quite incidental, other than to express the cultural different conceptions of virtue (vis a vis her somewhat ""troubled"" initial relationship with Algren), and for that matter quite intriguing because of it."
"hot-chocolate","8","0","1","26 January 2004"," Liked it...
","Simple enough, I liked this movie.  I didn't know what to expect when I went in.  Tom Cruise -- some movies you can love him, others you hate him.  I feel he was the big name draw for this movie but that it could have been played by any number of other actors.  His character in the movie will not be one that defines him.  Its just not a Leonardo DiCaprio/Titanic memory.<br/><br/>
I enjoyed the supporting cast and the general storyline.  Powerful emotion without the melodrama and over acting.<br/><br/>I especially enjoy the spirituality of films like this, much like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  I was moved by the final fighting scene in which Katsumoto sees the blossoms and says ""they are all perfect"".  I guess for me that's the kind of Zen I wish I would like to have.<br/><br/>The movie didn't have me looking at my watch -- always a good sign for me! Nor did it have me feeling like the WB should paying ME to be there!"

","Edward Zwick did it again. He made another good movie. Although not as great as ""Legends of the Fall"" or ""Glory"", it has its moments.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was good. Ken Watanabe is an excellent fit for the role of Katsumoto. The cinematography was excellent; the fight scenes, especially the scene of the samurais vs. the modern Japanese army was outstanding. We even get to see a picture of what Japan was like in the 1900s (and I mean not like the one we saw in Samurai X). <br/><br/>All in all, good movie."
"mightyalgo","8","0","1","13 January 2004"," No, the last samurai is NOT Tom Cruise!!!
","In The Last Samurai, we are treated to a glimpse of the effect that modernisation had on the ""old ways"" of the world. We are given just enough of a taste of what things were like that we begin to dread their eventual, inevitable demise. Stealing the show is Ken Watanabe's Samurai general, who starts the movie with a vision of a white tiger fighting for his life - a motif that comes back during his later attempts to sum it up in poetry. This white tiger is revealed to be the deeply damaged American Captain, Nathan Algren. Captain Algren, despite all that you may hear, a wonderful character, and very well played by Tom Cruise (one of the nicest actors I have ever heard of). He is, in my opinion, representative of the conscience of the film; and it's destiny. He is cursed to live on while others may die around him, he is atoning for the sins of his time. He even puts this into words: ""I should have died so many times"". The unlikely escapes throughout the film (yes, there are many) as well as his unerring ability to pick up the ancient art of swordfighting over two seasons are merely, as far as I am concerned, the forces of his destiny at work - he does meet his destiny, but it is not through a death on the battlefield; he achieves it through standing up at last for what he believes in above all else - honour, and acts as a saviour for the honour of the Samurai. As I have said, this is my reading of this film's point - of course he is an unlikely hero, but it not Cruise who is the last samurai; it is Watanabe. Algren is an act of fate - the catalyst for the samurai's salvation and adherence to their code of honour. He is prepared to die but does not fear death, he is told. I believe it is this key issue of Captain Algren's >secondary< role in the events that occur (he sets nothing in motion, remember, until the rescue of the general, so that the general can lead his samurai), that makes the effect of this movie more profound than you would have thought.<br/><br/>Having said all that (and there was a lot of it) this is in the end a blockbuster vehicle for it's star. He has so much screen time it's scary, but this is due to the fact that the plot is seen through his eyes and hence we are taken on the same journey he experiences towards his own redemption. That having been said, the casting is entirely wonderful; especially in the samurai camp, though arch ""baddie"" Omura is excellent too. I was especially pleased also, to see ""that guy out of ring; you know, the psychic ex husband"" in a completely different role as the (sadly) hilariously named ""yujio"" - I have worked in computer game sales for a while, so I hope you'll forgive this slur on a perfectly reasonable name. Not a weak acting performance to be found, as far as I'm concerned!<br/><br/>It is beautifully, if not particularly innovatively shot, too - a couple of shots smacking (maybe too much) of composition.<br/><br/>I do, however, have several complaints to make (hey, what else is the internet for, huh?)<br/><br/>I) Too much ""meaningful"" dialogue. In a complex movie like this I can't help feeling that some of the dialogue could have done with a once over by the thousands of ghost writers there must be in Hollywood.<br/><br/>II) The ending would, I feel, have benefitted greatly from not showing Cruise at all, but fading out the way it came in, on Japan's gorgeous horizon.<br/><br/>III) I don't like narration as a means of showing internal dialogue, but I can't suggest a better way of doing it. Maybe I should shut up?<br/><br/>IV) The scale of the battle scenes was all messed up (that didn't look like 4000 troops to me coming round the hill!)<br/><br/>V) (the big one) WE DON'T NEED A LOVE INTEREST, FOR GOD'S SAKE! I didn't buy this at all. Just unnecessary.<br/><br/>I hope you've found my views interesting, I'm always open to discussion. Give us a mail. In conclusion, I would say that it is really worth seeing this film, it won't change your life, or reveal some secrets about the universe to you, but that isn't what going to the movies is all about. You want spectacle, a well shot and acted film, and to share in one man's journey to redemption I would recommend this film with the utmost pleasure.<br/><br/>See you later.<br/><br/>Algo.<br/><br/>P.S. Remember - the use of machine guns at the end foreshadows the changing of warfare forever - no more cavalry charges!"
"skisox24","Null","0","1","13 January 2004"," Gladiator Wannabe
","The director and screenwriter John Logan seized an intriguing idea and succeeded in converting it to film in an entertaining movie product.  Tom Cruise plays a veteran American Civil War military hero who is hired by Japanese businessmen/political schemers to modernize the Japanese military from its samurai tradition to a military fully equipped with the latest in weaponry technology.  Cruise's efforts are cut short with his capture by samurai soldiers who decide to spare his life in exchange for the opportunity to learn from this foreign specialist.  It is with this relationship dynamic where this film succeeds the most.  A western military professional thrust into a community of samurai traditionalists poses a bountiful stage for cultural clashes.  The eventual polishing of Cruise's western style ""edges"" into fine tuned samurai values is a story that the film chronicles effectively and with conviction.<br/><br/>While this somewhat overly-long film scores well on several levels in its story telling, it falls short of classic status for many reasons.  While for the most part the Japanese cast, lead by John Watanabe, is first rate, Tom Cruise's character is wooden and predictable leading a cynic to conclude that Tom's range of acting may be constrained by his well known mannerisms and countenance.  As a counterpoint, John Watanabe is mesmerizing in his role as the last samurai.<br/><br/>The cinematography is first rate and the music and mood is consistent with the film's objectives.  However, am I the only film spectator who is bored and annoyed with the obligatory battle scenes that are central to films of this genre?  As with many films of its type, Gladiator included, one can use the battle scene sequence effectively as a rest room or popcorn break, and not miss a beat with the essence of the film.  I sometimes relate ground level battle sequences with the nonsensical car racing or car crash sequences of modern police adventure flicks.  The scenes are overly long, difficult to really understand and appreciate, and grotesquely predictable. Where was the editor with these scenes?<br/><br/>All in all a worthwhile film with laudable acting and pleasing vistas. With its interesting theme, a movie well worth the admission price.  But while this film is clearly not only not a classic, it is truly not a great movie by any stretch."
"kalbun","8","0","1","12 January 2004"," A profound message against the war
","I like very much the traditional Japanese culture and its sense of honor, and this was the main reason for going and seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Yet I found there a much more profound and topical message.<br/><br/>Personally, I consider the whole movie, especially the intense last run towards the gun machines, not only as a celebration of Samurai sense of honour. Instead, I think this is a strong message against violence and war; Samurai choose to die rather than surrender, Omura prefer to kill rather than renounce to its own interest. How many times people kill or die for an idea, for personal interest, or even for nothing at all? How many times people kill or die because they are like actors in a game, and are obliged to play their role up to the (obvious) end?<br/><br/>A message that is sadly valid in the time being, no matter if we are the ones running against the gun machines, or those opening the fire."

","Plot spoilers - do not read if you don't want to know what happens!!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise rarely gets the recognition he deserves for his acting.  Now finally with The Last Samurai he finally achieve this.  He is still perceived as a star rather than actor even with performances from Magnolia, Jerry Maguire, Born On The Fourth Of July among others.  But here he should truly lay these ghosts to rest with a memorable turn as an anti America war hero.<br/><br/>I read someones review of this saying that they disliked it because the white man once again saved the day.  It shouldn't be looked at as a matter of color.  The Last Samurai tries to show that color should be ignored. With Tom's Nathan Algren statement that Custer was a murderer.  His belief that the Indians weren't an enemy but a people trying to look after all they had left after it was taken from the so called discoverers of America.  With the mutual respect Katsumoto and Algren show for one another as warriors not as race.  And in the fact that the white man didn't save the day but helped destroy it with their supply of weapons to the Emperor's army to kill the Samurai.<br/><br/>The film mixes the violence of the battlefield with the tranquility and discipline of a Samurai life with ease.  You are shown that these people are warriors and not killers and their way of life can help a lost soul find itself once again.  Stunningly shot, you are treated to a visual beauty rarely seen within a film about war.  Think of the contrast The Thin Red Line provided for WW2 and within its own context, The Last Samurai repeats this feat.<br/><br/>Some will try and compare this, quite naturally, to the work of Kurosawa but as with all films of a similar genre, they should be judged on their own merit.  Even Quentin Tarantino mass produces his influences to make his movies but does that make their quality any less?<br/><br/>Samurai is a wonderful film experience.  Enjoy it with an open mind and listen to what is said rather than the color it is spoken by."
"Chris_Docker","7","0","3","20 January 2004"," Good action flick
","A great action adventure in a setting that hasn't been too overworked by Hollwood before  the final days of the legendary Samurai Warriors. Cruise plays the American hero of General Custer's time, recruited to Japan to help the government defeat the Samurai, but he learns to value the values of the Samurai. There is nothing very Japanese about the feel of the movie  it seems firmly like a Hollywood recreation put together to glorify Cruise's strengths and set in historical Japan  but Cruise puts plenty of work into the part with a performance to be proud of. And historical tosh as might it be (the Samurai were not really as noble as they are portrayed)  it does present the legend quite well, and the legend and the values retrospectively attributed to the Samurai are in some ways more important and interesting perhaps than any reality."

"m-p-williams","8","0","1","17 January 2004"," Regrettably the ending is disappointing, but a very impressive motion picture none the less *NO SPOILERS*
","On first sight of the trailer for The Last Samurai, I immediately became very optimistic about this film and after seeing it was very pleasantly delighted as a majority of the aspects that make a great film were there with a little bit extra.<br/><br/>The film lasts around 2 1/2 hours approx but didn't drag at all like some long, outstretched pictures do. Each scene had significance and was genuinely interesting to watch. <br/><br/>The Last Samurai was a compelling and highly interesting and entertaining film about a final group of Samurai in Japan that the Emperor wishes to rid their 'reign of terror' lifestyle among the people of the country.  However this idea of the Samurai being savages is explored when Captain Algren aka Tom Cruise is sent there to 'resolve' the problem inevitably being kidnapped and living amongst them as a 'prisoner'.  Honour, tradition, culture, betrayal, rivalry are all aspects that are explored within this epic and are done to great effect.<br/><br/>In terms of characterisation, Algren(Cruise)develops at a pleasing rate as we become more involved with him and learn about his past and changing beliefs, more to the point Cruise puts in a very convincing and solid performance who is haunted by his past adding a diverse darker side to his already mysterious life. In fact, the entire supporting cast do fine jobs of portraying believable and 'real' characters, most notably Cruise's Samurai guard he names ""Bob"" which brought a touch of light heartedness to the tense situation.<br/><br/>The plot was very interesting and works very well with an interspersion of the typical Japanese life as well as the Samurai way-of-life. There are minimal flashbacks, which allow the story to run in a chronological and comprehendible rate. The only aspect of the plot that let the film down is the ending which whilst is disappointing in comparison to the film as a whole, can be excused for the great acting, direction and superb battle scenes.<br/><br/>The setting, props and entire mise-en-scene was very convincing and had a real look of authenticity to it which made the tale ever more believable as it progressed and due to the fact it was based on real events, was reconstructed rather accurately and is great style exploiting the Samurai way of life to the audience in a fascinating way.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film to watch which doesn't fail to impress, possibly one of Cruise's best performances to date combined with a compelling story, interesting characters and breathtaking battles as well as settings, makes this the best film of the year so far, and will end up as one of the years greatest."
"Vaggs","6","0","1","15 January 2004"," I was right, Cruise still can't act.
","Whilst I wasn't dragged kicking and screaming to see the movie, I was reluctant to see it tonight.  After searching IMDB and reading a few positive reviews, and the insistence of my friend that Tom was on the receiving end of some praise, I conceded and went to see it.<br/><br/>Dang - there goes $14 of my hard earned cash... Ultimately, I wasn't wrong. Cruise was wooden and unconvincing.  I tried and *almost* felt emotional, but nope, the close up of his face wrecked that idea.  I'd be interested to hear from people who speak fluent Japanese to see if his delivery of those lines were as stunted as most of his non-aggressive english ones.  To cap it off, his closing line was delivered with more corn than the Corn-on-the-stick guy at the Rocks Market in Sydney.  <br/><br/>
Then again, there was a plenty of polenta sprinkled all over the movie.  The digital special effects would have been impressive 5 years ago (although one of the brief aerial battle scenes wasn't bad), and some of the sets looked just plain fake.  In terms of plot - it was Hollywood 101, but at the same time, given the whole package, it was palatable enough for a DVD rental - just not sure that I got value in my ticket this time round. <br/><br/>
On the more positive side, I did like most of the battle and fight scenes - the subtle Manga influence of blood spraying around was well done, and actually added some character to the sequences.

Though it is quite long (2 and a half hours) it did keep me quiet (which is difficult).

Also Koyuki (Taka) plays her part with excellence.<br/><br/>The story is captivating and although it does resemble ""Dances with Wolves"" you have to appreciate the depicting of the japanese culture and mentality of the samurai.<br/><br/>This is a story of an american captain who's experience in the Custer battles grant him the opportunity to train the japanese army in a war against the samurai who do not agree with the views of a young (fooled) emperor who decides to make Japan a modern country.<br/><br/>(mild spoilers) After being captured by the samurai, Cruise's character starts to appreciate their culture based on honour and dedication to a higher cause and in his own words ""I can not help destroy that wich i have come to love"",which pretty much sums it up (yeah right).

By the look of that trailer I had high hopes for the Last Samurai.

The sets and costumes are completely believable. The cinematography is amazing with many beautiful shots. The battle scene that takes place near the end of the film is spectacularly filmed.<br/><br/>
Some people are saying that Tom Cruise's portrayal of Nathan Algren deserves an Oscar Nomination for his work here. I do not agree. Cruise is solid in the role but I do not think it is Oscar Material. However, Ken Watanabe's portrayal of Katsumoto is certainly worthy of an Oscar Nomination. This is a commanding and powerful performance that overshadows Cruise's performance. The rest of the supporting cast is solid. <br/><br/>The problem with the Last Samurai is that its a little too long. There was one useless scene that did not go on that long but was really out of place (""Are you a Ladies Man, Bob""). The conversation with the emperor at the end of the film felt like it went on forever. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I did enjoy the Last Samurai. However, it was not a masterpiece and not Oscar Material, except for Watanabe's performance and some technical nods. I do recommend the film though."

It was a great movie in all aspect, except the ending where Tom Cruise is the only one alive. It would be much better if Tom Cruise died in the battle or commit seppuku.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","0","1","18 January 2004"," Very Hollywood, very Tom Cruise, very well crafted, very enjoyable.....but, not sure if it's really samurai
","spoilers warning	<br/><br/>(all the names herein are the artists, names rather than that of the characters they play)<br/><br/>I'll skip the synopsis as one can be found easily within this website or in other movie websites. Not long after the start of the movie, once it got to the heavy-handed, absolutely over-done scene in which Cruise demonstrates that the army he is training is not yet ready for battle, I knew what to expect for the rest of the movie. <br/><br/>Comparison of Last Samurai to Dances with Wolves is almost inevitable, and has been done again and again. Other than the similarity in plot, one subtler point comes out in the comparison: the plot can fit pretty well into any different cultural background and work just as well. The corollary then is the question: is this really a movie about samurai, or is it about Americans?<br/><br/>For a real samurai movie, I think few will argue that the beat example is Kurosawa's `Shichinin on Sanurai (7 samurai)' (1954), in which there is no karahari-cum-decapitation, no rousing heroic speeches. What looks Japanese is not necessarily Japanese. For example, immensely popular operetta The Mikado is anything but Japanese. It's a satire about the British. Similarly, Last Samurai is an American view on heroism. I am making this assertion merely as a statement of fact, as I see it, without intentions of making any value judgement. <br/><br/>For entertainment value, Last Samurai is completely satisfying. The scene where Cruise disposes of four or five ambushing samurais reminds me of a similar scene in Duel on Ganryu Island (1956) where Koji Tsuruta (actor, not movie character) similarly disposes of four attackers in the street. The scene in Last Samurai however is done with innovative imagination, showing the audience what happens first, and then allowing them to savour it again immediately through Cruise's `instant flashback'. The final battle scene is also very skilfully handled, well balanced between close-up skirmish and overview of strategy and formation. In the latter department, however, a movie has yet to be found that can surpass Spartacus (1960).<br/><br/>In the romance side, the scene where lovely Koyuki puts on samurai armours for Cruise is shot with tender loving care. This scene, however, is several notches below a similar scene in a samurai movie (notice I did not say `another' samurai movie) `Tasogare Seibei (Twilight Samurai)' (2002) in which Rie Miyazawa tends to the hair of Hiroyuki Sanada before he goes off to a duel. (Details in my comments posted on 12 May 2003). Hiroyuki Sanada, by the way, appears also in Last Samurai, playing Ujio, the samurai who teaches Cruise how to use a sword. A professional, Hiroyuki of course delivers what is expected of him in Last Samurai. Compared with what he achieved in Tasogare Seibei, however, what he did in Last Samurai is kindergarten stuff. An actor has to make a living too, I guess.<br/><br/>Emerging from the cinema, while totally satisfied with getting the full worth of the admission I paid, I couldn't help allowing my mind to wander off to an alternative ending, in which Ken Watanabe commits karahari to show his devotion to the emperor rather than escape with Cruise. In the finale, Cruise leads the samurais in the last battle, and is killed. This would have been a much more powerful, as well as logical ending. The treatment of Ken Watanabe escaping and coming back to fight against the emperor takes away much of the poignancy. But then, who can argue with Hollywood?"
"Danny_G13","Null","0","1","18 January 2004"," Nicely told epic
","The Last Samurai continues Tom Cruise's evolution from his Top Gun/Day of Thunder days to his current Magnolia/Vanilla Sky tenure where he proves he can act. Well, certainly in a deeper way than he could when he made The Firm, a Few Good Men etc. Indeed, Last Samurai is one of his finest performances, managing to convey a convincing portrayal of a reluctant war hero who is held in contempt by his superiors and banished to Japan to train a regiment there in preparation for war against the uprising samurais. The war is short lived, and his men are nowhere near experienced enough to handle it causing them to get easily overpowered. He gets captured and is made a prisoner in the samurai village. And that's where the development of his character really begins.<br/><br/>Where this movie excels is the level to which it draws you in and makes you care. It is directed with flair but without arrogance, the cinematography is highly impressive, the performances are uniformly excellent bar the Emperor (Shichinosuke Nakamura) who really struggles with his English in one scene, and the relationships between the characters are extremely well-judged with some highly appropriate humour showing a lack of conceit and ability to smile.<br/><br/>It is a long story, but a rewarding one."
"travisimo","9","0","1","18 January 2004"," Powerful and Insightful
","The Last Samurai displays some of the best sword fighting I have ever seen in a movie.  Ken Watanabe gives an Oscar performance as the Samurai leader, Katsumoto.  Not only did he have some awesome fighting scenes, but also his character was deep and just fun to watch.  Tom Cruise gives a surprising performance as a disgruntled American general turn samurai.  Needless to say, I was skeptical of Tom Cruise pulling this role off, but he did so pretty nicely.<br/><br/>The story is a powerful, moving piece, but it can get kind of long and depressing.  This isn't really the feel-good movie of the year.  It also got a little confusing particularly with the blossom scene.  I zoned off for one minute, and I was lost on the significance of the blossom for the rest of the movie.  Oh well, it wasn't too big of a deal, and I enjoyed the movie anyway.  If anything, this movie gives great insight on the mysterious and intriguing life of the samurai.  It's definitely a good experience.<br/><br/>My IMDb Rating: 9/10.  My Yahoo!

","I just saw the Last of the Samurai's, it was a very good film about Samurai's and their ways during that time, set with the backdrop of Japan modernising to keep up with the rest of the world. Tom Cruise's Character in the film is a US Army Captain named Nathan Algren who has turned to alcohol to seek refuge from horrific experiences whilst fighting in the Indian wars. Coupled with his Disillusionment and his alcoholism he accepts a mission as a representitive of the US Army to goto Japan where he must train Japanese troops using rifles to fight against a renegade group. This group being the Samurai who are old guards of the emperor, they are lead by Katsumoto who is played by the brilliant Ken Watanabe, they rebel against modernisation in order to follow their Samurai Code and preserve their old ways. Captain Algren is captured by Watanabe's samurai's in a ensuing battle and kept alive so Katsumoto can learn about his new enemy. We delve into the culture of the samurai and village life during that period thru Cruise's perspective as he spends time with them. In time developping close relationships within the village, especially with Katsumoto's sister, Taka, Who is skillfully played by a very beautiful Koyuki. Tom must lay his demons to rest and decide where his loyalties lie. During which he discovers himself and the one true enemy. Good acting by all and a brilliant period piece. To sum it up, the film is about old vs new, low tech vs high tech and how in the end we are taught never to forget. 4 outta 5. Tank you viddy Much..."

It seemed very realistic in many ways (as much as one today can know what realism was in the times and events portrayed).  The acting was very good, and I will be surprised if awards are not give for this film.  The scenes of Japanese life were calming, and the Japanese portrayed in the village  do seem very 'disciplined'.

"TheNorthernMonkee","Null","0","1","11 January 2004"," I REALLY wanted to hate this
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>From the moment I first heard of this film, I disliked it. I felt the idea of a film like this was hideous, and I felt for it to be staring Tom Cruise, well it was blatantly going to be just a vehicle for his self esteem. Cruise, to put it bluntly, is awful. There are two over rated actors out there who appear in films and have the exact same facial expressions throughout. These actors are Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves, and I think they ruin a lot of good films.<br/><br/>So, with my dislike for Tom Cruise and my dislike for the idea of this film, I travelled to the cinema to watch this movie, took my seat, and for not the first time, was forced to eat my own words. Truthfully, I think this film is brilliant.<br/><br/>In ""The Last Samurai"", Cruise plays Captain Nathan Algren of the United States Army. Hired to teach the Japanese how to use modern warfare technology, Algren, a man with many painful memories, is placed in a battle against the revolutionary Samurai of Japan. Eventually captured, Algren is introduced to Master Katsumoto, played wonderfully by Ken Watanabe, and is slowly shown the way of the Samurai.<br/><br/>Ok, why is it that I enjoyed this film? Looking at the main star, looking at the basic plot, looking at practically everything about it, I should have come out of the cinema in unsurprised disgust. The strange thing is though, that if you get all the bad parts which make up this film, and put them all together, it somehow works. It's like trying to create Frankenstein's monster out of a body which had been buried for two years. Ultimately all the parts are rotten, but yet still manage to function. Cruise, whilst I do hate him, performs acceptably with his three facial expressions of smile, tear in eye and grit faced determination. The plot, despite being tacky and slightly over long has depth and quality. Even the blatant cheesyness of it all comes through with flying colours. This film is ultimately, good.<br/><br/>I suppose put under pressure, I could say there are one or two things which are wrong with this film. Billy Connolly's voice in it is painful to hear and I'm grateful when he leaves the screen. The same is true for Timothy Spall at the beginning, but his voice seems to improve with time. The Emperor of Japan is awkward and infuriating, but I wonder if that's not how he's meant to be played. Other than these three characters, and the last ten minutes, though, I really can't think of much bad to say about this film. So it'll never win Oscars, watch me be proved wrong here again although I find this unlikely, and most of it is easy no brainer viewing, but for what it's meant to be, I think it holds up quite well. Definately worth viewing."

Although not based on many real facts, the Samurai way of like did come to an end with the new emporer and the industrialisation of Japan.

","Not exactly the most thoughtful work of art, but well executed (still I liked Dances with Wolves' music better, and there were no buffalo).<br/><br/>But while I was watching this film it dawned on me why I am drawn to these types of stories where an old, rich culture is decimated by a new one, simply because the former has outdated technology. If the former is so weak, then what good is it? Honor and discipline? The point is that it is a real community. To me, the culture and spirituality serve one end: effective communication and connection. When two warriers nod to each other, it seems that they understand each other so well they might as well be mind readers. Signs of love between strangers, against the background of quiet toil and discipline all aimed at fundamental survival, take on way more significance than they normally would.<br/><br/>In an increasingly global society, we lack the universal codes needed to relate to each other properly. Religion? Which one? There are way too many, as globalization has demonstrated. It seems the best we have is pop culture, the output of a commercialism which is only an economic game. I don't have the answers. Ideally, everyone would try hard to look for answers, in books, abroad, and each other. It would be the trying and the yearning that counts. Everyone needs toil and discipline in *something*, so that when a gesture breaks that discipline, that gesture would be especially meaningful.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film, as cliche-laden as it was, was still worth it."

Tom Cruise plays a former civil war veteran who was forced to kill innocent women and children native americans causing him to be an alcohol despot.  He gets an opportunity from one of his old civil war friend to train the japanese army against the samurais who were against the emperor working with the Westerns.  During the movie, Cruise is defeated and brought in as a prisoner of war against Watanabe.  Mr. Watanabe studies his enemy per se. Cruise finds himself and then turns against the Japanese army by joining the samurais.  <br/><br/>Overall, this movie was simply excellent in two ways:  first that the guilt of individuals rises to the occasion and secondly and most important the honor of the Last Samurai during his life and later his death of not having others take control of the Japanese nation during the 19th century.<br/><br/>The Dark Gengar gives this excellent movie from one Gengar to ten Gengars: Nine Gengars  <br/><br/>Enjoy the movies one and all!!!"

However, I do wish to point out a glaring error in the movie.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film, we're shown a scene of San Francisco with the date ""February 1876"".  Minutes later, Tom Cruise relates the story of Custer at the Little Big Horn to a group of citizens standing on the street. Evidently, the screenwriter as well as the actors didn't know or forgot that Custer's ""last stand"" happened on June 25, 1876 - four months later.

","The Last Samurai is a big, old fashioned sweeping entertainment with big scenery and battles and strong acting and a thoughtful script.

First off, I can't take a movie seriously when it makes some American a guiding force in the history of Japan.  I mean, come on.  And the ending drags out a bit; it's the, why-have-one-moving-ending-if-you-can-have-three philosophy of filmmaking.  <br/><br/>
Some things are great though.  Ken Watanabe is excellent as the Samurai. While the movie insists on using an American as an entry into this world, in typical Hollywood fashion, the film is mainly acted by Japanese (although oddly enough if you watch the end credits all the top billing except for Watanabe goes to western names).  And you've got to love a movie that avoids the seemingly obligatory sex scene and replaces it with a weirdly-erotic getting dressed scene; that was cool.<br/><br/>Fun movie, plenty to criticize but still lots of fun to watch.

No other character in the history of film conveys the samurai ways more than Katsumoto.   No, I do not fight with swords etc.  But I do live my life in the same thread as Katsumoto!!  I am an actual, real-life samurai who follows the code of the BUSHIDO!!! (Jake doesn't know this that I ama in a way, Samurai). Samurai affiliation is not limited to race, so Tom Cruise being one does not fall into the realm of impossibility. I am a white man and am a samurai. Of course, this amazing movie was shot in Japan, specifically Awaji City, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan!!  Many of the scenes were shot in California as well.  Anyway, the movie was good.  Sure, it was kind of like Dances with Wolves in a way.  Tom Cruise, as always, DELIVERS THE GOODS.  This is right up there with the best of Cruise.  He looked kick ass in his samurai outfit.  Sure, I know all about Akira Kurosawa and how great he is.  I am the first to admit that I am a student of his methods and have watched the Seven Samurai in great detail.  I have seen the commentary as well.  But let's get something strait, Akira Kurosawa is Akira Kurosawa. Akira Kurosawa is not Ken Wantanbe or Edward Zwick.  The goods were delivered in this movie.  The performance of Ken Watanabe is pure Samurai. I mean, he looked like one.  This movie delivered on all counts in terms of how the Samurai are.   The movie was very accurate.  Samurai do not die in shame.  Samurai are proud.  Samurai devote every waking moment to perfecting their chosen craft.  The Samurai are a very noble people.  It's too bad that the Samurai's values are not more prevalent in today's world.  As for the role of Omura, effortlessly played by Masato Harada, it was nothing short of miraculous.  I was impressed to see how scared he was to get killed by Katsumoto at the end.  In fact, when Katsumoto took his own life at the end, Omura was kind of mad, because in a way, Katsumoto won.  I thought that Tom Cruise was going to kill himself at that moment also.   Yes,  this movie FOCUSED more on the character of Katsumoto than anything.  Katsumoto has the oscar nod this year, not Tom Cruise.   Sure, Cruise was great, but Katsumoto was amazing.   I also liked when Tom Cruise screamed for Sake.  And that fight scene with the wooden swords was great.  Tom Cruise would not give up fighting the amazing Seizo Fukumoto who played the silent Samurai.  That was great.  It was cool how they eventually became friendsand Fukumoto even made sure Tom's armour was on correctly.   If you ever get the chance to VISIT JAPAN, I suggest you DO IT.  Also, look for a cameo of Jackie Chan in the Japanese Army."

","`The Last Samurai' (2003/Edward Zwick) *** out of ****<br/><br/>`If you spent your whole life looking for the perfect bloom, it would not be a wasted life'- Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe)<br/><br/>The quote that I mentioned above is one of the many memorable quotes said by Ken Watanabe in the film `The Last Samurai'. The film stars Tom Cruise as a Civil Veteran who is fighting personal demons within himself. He gets an offer from a Japanese official to train the Emperor's modern army, and to help wipe out the remaining Samurai, who hold on to the traditionalism of ancient Japan. After the first battle, Cruise is captured and forced to live with the Samurai for a few months. During this time, he comes to realize what is important in life, and who he should be supporting.<br/><br/>
For me, this film was the most anticipated film that I wanted to see this year, next to `Kill Bill'. And I am sad to say that I am somewhat disappointed. I was filled with mixed emotions as I walked out of the theater into the rainy reality. I was hoping this film would be a major Oscar contender, but I don't think it is worthy of any nominations. Cruise's performance was good, but not worthy of a nomination. The cinematography and score, however, were very well done. The directing (Zwick won Best Director at the National Board of Review), was good, but nothing spectacular. The best actor in the movie is not Cruise, but Ken Watanabe, who plays the Samurai who takes Cruise under his wing. He gives a great performance. In my opinion, the film sold its soul to Hollywood with the ending, but the final battle was surprisingly emotional and the film should have left it at that. But instead, it was longer than it should have been. <br/><br/>The parts of the film that take place in the Samurai village are by far the best parts. And the use of rain and the sun rising and setting are artful additions to the film's quality. But when the story focuses back on `civilization', that is when the film gets a little dull. It has a few Kurosawa' moments, but don't go in expecting `The Seven Samurai' or `Yojimbo'. Instead, expect a cross between `Dances With Wolves' and `The Patriot'.<br/><br/>The film's themes are what really interested me. My knowledge of Japanese History is limited, but I am led to believe that the way of the Samurai' was in fact the way of life in Japan for a long timeuntil the mid 1800's, when this takes place. The film portrays the end of an era. The ending of a way of life, known as the Samurai. The ancient battle between traditionalism and secularism. The film asks the question: Is change always a good thing?<br/><br/>The film has ambition and contains some greatness, but much to my dismay, I did not find it to be the best film of the year which I had hoped it would be. But, it was a worthy effort and I recommend it.<br/><br/>-30-"

"sunsetrider","7","0","1","18 December 2003"," A fantasy of romanticized Japan
","The Last Samurai is an epic that features Tom Cruise, in a film that seems to draw some inspiration from either Dances with Wolves or Lawrence of Arabia. The similarities extend to some degree where these films all share a common trait that features a protagonist who is confronted by an alien culture, but who grows to appreciate it enough to sacrifice his life upon its defense. The similarities cannot resolve the inevitable differences, though, when it becomes clear that the Last Samurai does not delve more deeply into the culture that the movie draws other facets of wonder.<br/><br/>The film describes a tribulation of a certain Nathan Algren, who is wasted with guilt for having taken part of systemic massacre of native Americans during the nation's expansion toward the west. He is called upon by his former colleagues to help modernize Japan's army. Despite reluctance Nathan travels to Japan, only to be haunted by his old fears and but this time strives to challenge them...<br/><br/>There are more than a few novelties or liberties that can be counted upon when it comes to manipulating the viewer's perspective on a different culture as depicted in film. How Tom Cruise's character, Nathan, survives his first conflict with the Samurai is a prime example of how Japanese code of honor is fused with Western ideals of compassion. How Nathan resolves his guilt with the widow of a fallen warrior in the prime showcase of forgiveness triumphing over a cycle of vengeance is another such example. What amounts to be a fairly detailed and appealing rendition of Japanese culture ends up being a hopelessly romanticized view engendered only for your viewing pleasure. Also, it does not certainly hurt that Tom, an embodiment of the collective conscience of viewing public, embraces the culture fully.<br/><br/>For me, however, this implausible and sweeping depiction of the culture is the greatest failing of this movie. It is a fairy tale, and what with one principle character drawn from the real life equivalent in that particular era of Japan, among other things, it is a mishmash of parameters for a setting that confuses rather than informs.<br/><br/>However, if one is prepared to accept the setting as it unfolds and view the film with an open mind while negating preconceived notions of anything realistic that one would expect of Japan, this film delivers on many levels. Tom Cruise's acting is fairly sound, although his character does not require him to exert a wide range of emotion. Ken Watanabe plays a superb supporting role as Katsumoto and very much becomes an integral force carrying the film. Other notable roles including subdued yet tender presence of Koyuki as Taka to always enjoyable contribution from Billy Connolly round out an impressive cast, even more so given obvious communication issues and the enactment of numerous battle scenes with fairly hectic swordplay.<br/><br/>The camera is obviously enamored with the natural beauties of Japan, of which they are plenty in the film. Set against a backdrop of serene pastoral landscape of Japanese countryside, the panorama of all four seasons are established upon it. Especially in the spring time where cherry blossoms bloom, it is a great sight to behold. Only that they were attributed as an example to some philosophical mumbojumbo between Katsumoto and Nathan is irritating.<br/><br/>In summary, this film is a beautiful to watch, except for vicious battle scenes that only ends up providing a stark contrast in a way that has been done in other films of this ilk, but very striking notwithstanding. The story is an illuminating journey of a disturbed man, who is rejuvenated by his admiration for something alien yet compatible with his sense of honor. However contrived and unconvincing the movie finds itself in the end, set against the shameless and incongruous depiction of fictitious Japan, I was captivated by the film's various individual parts each of which are superbly conceived and acted. Feats that their sum, unfortunately, does not fulfill as resoundingly.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Granted I still think that Lord of the Rings:Return of the King should win Best Picture this year this is not a slight in the least against this movie. Rather I think that the Lord Trilogy should be seen for what it is really is, one giant film. The amount of work going into something like that is nothing less than astounding. That being said, The Last Samurai is an absolutely wonderful movie. Very good acting overall, I really think Tom Cruise is underrated. This movie brought forth emotions that I really didn't think that a modern day blockbuster could provoke. However, I think the real beauty of this movie is the overall art direction.

","In my high school writing class, I was told that when writing a paper I should do tell the reader what I was going to say, say it, and then explain what I said. While that is an excellent primer for the written word, the method doesn't translate as well to the big screen, as effectively illustrated in this film of great themes, which is slightly marred by heavy-handed redundancy. **Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>""The Last Samurai"" tells the story of Nathan Algren, played by Tom Cruise, a unhappy and drunk Army captain who is recruited by the Emperor of Japan to train the incompetent Japanese troops in the ways of modern weaponry. The purpose is to combat the (ahem) last samurai, led by the fearsome Katsumoto. Before long, Algren falls into enemy hands, and the bulk of the film follows his experience as the prisoner of the samurai, who indoctrinate him into their culture. <br/><br/>As the main character, Cruise plays a part akin to every other role he's had, a cocky yet talented guy who learns his lesson over the course of the film. But he once again nails the part, this time with more human emotion than normal. In a role that could have easily been done in an over-the-top manner, Cruise chose not to do so and proved very effective. I don't think it's an Oscar-caliber performance, but it does rank among his best work. I do think that Ken Watanbe as Katsumoto is worthy of an Academy Award nomination. A new face to American cinema, his pathos-packed performance is the soul of this film, a physically imposing presence who fills the screen literally and figuratively. A la Chow Yun-Fat, he appears primed to make the Pacific leap to stardom in the United States. <br/><br/>As is apparent from the advertising, this is intentionally a film of epic scope, and that theme enjoyably oozes through the technical aspects of the movie thanks to an experienced top-notch crew. Director Edward Zwick (""Glory,"" ""Courage Under Fire"") again provides a sure and steady hand in getting what he wants and needs out of all participants. In a musical style reminiscent of his ""Black Hawk Down"" work, Hans Zimmer presents his usual excellent orchestral accompaniment with clear and ear-pleasing tinges of Eastern music. Editors Victor Du Bois and Steven Rosenblum, who both worked on ""Braveheart,"" accomplish the underrated achievement of comprehensibly piecing together chaotic battle scenes. And speaking of that film, Cinematographer John Toll also shot ""Braveheart"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" and one can see visual similarities between the films. Toll provides the mandatory sweeping battlefield shots, along with numerous slow pans that allow time for the passion of the Japanese culture to bleed through the screen. While some movies thrive with the help of or in spite of their behind-the-scenes aspects, Last Samurai excels because of the firm technical foundation. <br/><br/>The main annoyance I have with ""Last Samurai"" is its single-minded intent to hammer the virtue of Japanese culture into the thick American skulls. Within the first half hour, the theme is made evident, but that does not prevent the filmmakers from iterating and reiterating it to the very end of the film. Before long, this wears on the audience, leaving them a bit antsy over the last half hour, which would have been better off shortened or altered, instead dragging down the film in the final act. I don't say this to minimize the importance of culture in this film. In fact, I think it was portrayed very well, but even something done well becomes bothersome when repeated too many times. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: This film still attains near-greatness. In a lackluster cinematic year, it will assuredly be on my top ten list, entrenched a cut below the top tier as a film that is better than most and will deservedly earn a handful of nods come January.  8 of 10."

","Overall, I liked the Last Samurai--as a story. As a representative piece of Japanese history, though, I'm sure there are plenty of purists out there holding their noses.<br/><br/>Hollywood has this real penchant for producing historical figures who are uncharacteristically 21st Century Politically Correct for whatever era they live in. Tom Cruise is no exception in this film. He, with conventional wisdom no older than forty years, had no respect for Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer or his tactics. A genuine military contemporary of Custer, however, would realize he was the youngest US officer to reach the grade of Brigadier General during the Civil War. He didn't reach that rank for having a good filing system.<br/><br/>What about the premise of the film? Tom Cruise, a has-been hero from the wild west, is hired to help develop Japan's new modern Army. How does being an individually brave person who can handle a weapon and ride like a trick shot artists translate into being an organizer and trainer of an entire army? Had such a person demonstrated all those skills in military service, he would have been promoted like Custer was.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's hard to believe his purpose for being in Japan: building the Army. The film seems to imply it is for fighting an internal rebellion. Sure, there have been people like Katsumoto in the film known to operate briefly even in modern times (Noted author Yukio Mishima, who committed seppuku about 35 years ago, is a recent example of such a person). Nonetheless, they haven't been a serious threat to Japan's order since the early shoguns a couple of hundred years prior to the Meiji era. Japan developed a modern army, all right, but the purpose was external--there were issues with the Chinese and the Russians. <br/><br/>I think the intent here was to turn the tables for the character in the film. He went from fighting on the side with the guns against the side with the bows and arrows to the opposite situation. In that respect, the film succeeds. The characters had depth and the story was fascinating. Unlike many American films with Japanese themes, I would have no problem recommending this film to a Japanese--provided he doesn't take history too seriously. I gave the film a seven."

","Delete Kevin Costner, replace with Tom Cruise.  Replace all the Sioux Indians the Japanese Samurai, and during the fight scenes, replace William Wallace and the kilts of Braveheart with Samurai garb and some wool uniforms and we have ourselves Dances with Braveheart in Japan.  There was even the underlying forbidden love story of the stranger befriending the widow of a fallen soldier (DWW and Stand with a fist vs.  Taka and Cruise) ... and the stranger (Costner/Cruise) is the enemy that befriends then fights along side the opposition fighting for their cause.<br/><br/>Though this movie was very familiar and therefore disappointing, I was impressed with the notion of dying a good death, a proud 'til the last man' battle, but that still doesn't dismiss the fact that the plot was just set in Japan with the japanese traditional warrior.<br/><br/>We've also seen Tom Cruise play this role before.  Remember when he's sobering up and has the worst night of his life in Taka's house?  Ok, think back to when he was beaten to a pulp in the boxing fight and left for dead in the street during winter in Far and Away. We've seen him writhing around on the floor in agony and covered in blood (or in this movie sweat). Come on, this was a dramatic movie, but Tom doesn't really sell us on the dramatic ROLE, per se.  The love interest Taka had good emotion but it was hard to read what she was thinking in the ""wear my husband's armor to honor the family"" scene.  You get it, but was there really enough in her body language if it hadn't been for the romantic climactic music in the background?<br/><br/>In short, if you have seen and know Dances With Wolves and Braveheart, you've already seen this movie.  Spend the 8 dollars if you want to, or if there is Oscar buzz, but I don't see the luster of Oscar performance in this movie.  Just rent it when it comes out on video.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE Tom Cruise fan, but this just doesn't cut it.  Now, if i could only get back my copy of Top Gun so I can remember why I love Tom to begin with."

","Honestly, I thought the movie was pretty decent.  But there were some seeeerious historical issues that bothered me.<br/><br/>1.  The movie has an absurdly idealistic notion of Samurai.  Certainly Bushido is a wonderful code, but not every samurai follows it.  The code for clergy in the medieval catholic church was laudable, although certainly not followed consistently.  Samurai have a code, but are not perfectly moral and honorable individuals.  The movie (understandably) glosses this over to make the samurai more appealing to the disillusioned Algren, but still.<br/><br/>2.  The Ninja attack.  No one ever (ever) ever caught a ninja.  Once.  In history.  The idea that a platoon of them invade a village is almost laughable.<br/><br/>3.  This isn't historical so much as simply annoying.  Katsumoto is unnecessarily kind to Algen (Cruise) in the beginning, but by the end, he defers to him!  How did that happen?  Algren is certainly a fine warrior, but the idea that a powerful and experienced Daimyo like Katsumoto needs Tom Cruise to explain things to him is silly.  A bit.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that I disliked the movie.  I thought it was decent, and the middle hour and a half was wonderful.  That said..."

Did the director succumb to pressure to insert a sappy, schmaltzy ending into an otherwise great motion picture? (Warning:  possible Spoiler ahead)  Why have a main character unbelievably stay alive when he should have died?

","Please read!  The Last Samurai movie is going to win most of the Oscar awards next year.  It is guaranteed to win ""Best Picture"" at the very least and Tom Cruise is guaranteed to win ""Best Actor"" finally.  Yes, fuss and kick all you want...it is a matter of time.  Don't judge by movie tickets sales because that does not win oscars, generally.  Those who give out awards for movies are looking for all the positive things in a objective fashion supposedly.  I am not trying to upset people or pretend to be a prophet--the writing is on the wall. Sorry to disappoint all those anti-Tom Cruise fans or wanna be Ebert critics.  Everyone has an opinion, but it is the majority that counts when deciding who and what deserves the recognition.  It is everyone's God given right to express their feelings as it is written in our Constitution.  The thing that bugs me about some critics is that they can always find the negative in everything--always a bias opinion.  Your opinions are more subjective than objective.  I have read many articles on the amount of work and heart that went into this movie.  Tom Cruise is very big on taking his time and doing it well.  He spent two years working with movie director Stanely Kubrick, no matter how long it took because he believed in something and someone.  He lost many years of blockbuster movie making and megabucks due to his passion to act and create something special--substance.  The majority of people fail to see the real beauty in both ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Vanilla Sky"".  You see what is on the surface and immediately attack.  You failed to see the underlying meaning of why the movies were made because you don't care!  Have you ever thought about how many good points in life can be learned by such movies. Movies are like books that can teach you alot about life--you have to find the not so obvious meaning sometimes.  ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" both teach us so many valuable lessons about love, friendships, and so fourth.  You don't see that because your eyes are the ones wide shut. Have you noticed in ""Eyes Wide Shut"" the beautiful color reds and scenery in the film--forget about the orgy part.  The orgy part was necessary to illistrate the freaky things there are in this world when your eyes are closed.  The movie was NOT selling ""SEX"".  The point was that he was in the wrong place trying to do the wrong thing--vegenence for his wife's secret confession when drunk.  She did not cheat, she said stupid things because she was under the influence.  Therefore, it drove Cruise's character mad about the possibility.  Again, you only confirm my negative theory you critics have. You ruin movies, an art, because you tell others what is good and what is bad without letting others decide for themselves.  I never like reading reviews about movies because it ruins everything.  You as the individual need to decide for yourself how a movie is good or bad and not comform to these social norms in society.  It should be a crime.  I am a true movie buff that has seen the majority of the films worth watching and I can find the good in most of them.  I used to be closed or narrow minded, but as a person who is ill most of the time due to a rare medical condition I have spent many years watching, rewatching, and really analyzing movies.  My eyes are wide open and I am a better person because of it.  I can appreciate what I used to take for granted.  What about you..."
"directjw","10","0","2","14 December 2003"," The White Samurai
","First off, let me state that I am Asian, so I am writing about The Last Samurai from the perspective of an Asian viewer.<br/><br/>This could have been a great, classic epic about the clash between the East and the West, but the last twenty minutes of the film ruin everything that the filmmakers worked so hard at.  Although I won't give away the end of the film, all I will say is that the film finally succumbs to Hollywood conventions which it worked so hard to avoid prior to that point.  What I will say is that the last two scenes of the film are racist to the extreme in that the White man triumphs over his Asian comrades in the most blatantly offensive manner!  Just watch the film, and you will see what I mean.<br/><br/>However, prior to the offensive conclusion of the film, The Last Samurai is for the most part a thoughtful and respectful film about Japanese culture and history.  Also, Edward Zwick did a great job of developing the characters of the lead Samurai and the Cruise character.  Their relationship was endlessly fascinating and enlightening.  Also, the battle scenes were among the best that I have ever seen, almost up there, but not quite, with the master himself, Kurosawa.<br/><br/>But I must admit that I am tired of seeing films about the White man who meets the noble savages, and learns to appreciate and eventually assimilate their ways (Dances With Wolves, Last of the Mohicans, The Thin Red Line, Zwick's own film Glory, and the list goes on...).  I guess that this is a standard convention because Caucasian audiences need a lead character which they can identify with.  But, as an Asian viewer, I find this filmic device rather offensive, because if I want to understand another culture, I want to view it through the lens of the culture itself, not through the eyes of a colonizing force from outside the culture.<br/><br/>I know that it sound like I don't like The Last Samurai, but as I stated earlier, there is much to admire in the film.  But, I believe that The Last Samurai could have been a classic if the filmmakers disposed of Cruise' character entirely, and just focused on the conflict between the Samurai culture and the modernizing forces of the mainstream Japanese culture at the time.  Oh, and one more quibble, is it just me, or is it extremely offensive and disrespectful when the Cruise character ends up getting romantically involved with the wife of the man whom he killed in battle?  Come, on, guys, this is just wrong.<br/><br/>Someone hand over the Last Samurai's script to a Japanese director, and let the Japanese tell their story, please.<br/><br/>And Mr. Zwick, I haven't seen Courage Under Fire yet, but please, if you do another war movie, try to avoid racially charged subjects such as Black regiments during the Civil War, and Japanese samurai fighters."

"MadPowerBomber","10","0","1","8 December 2003"," A wonderful experience.
","And I say that honestly.  The Last Samurai, to me, was a wonderful experience from the beginning to the end.  The story telling aspects of the film can be formulaic, but they're formulaic for a reason: they work.  Tom Cruise's character is a gateway character -- one with his own story at that, and his own inner demons -- for us to jump head first into an alien culture -- an often misunderstood alien culture -- and learn to embrace it, admire it, and adore it while he comes to do the same.  To me, it worked.  It worked on a plethora of levels.  It echoed Sunzi's teachings in the Art of War to take in a prisoner of war and treat him as an equal -- which is what Katsumoto did.  To sway him, and lure him away from his side to yours, and learn as much as you can from him.  This, I think, is what the intent was behind in that essence of the picture.  It was also a story of redemption for Cruise's character to redeem himself in his own mind from the things he'd done, or taken part of, in his past.  And through bushido, and through zen buddhism he accomplishes that.  While he doesn't attain enlightenment per se, he does change his life, his outlook, and become more than he was before.  In Katsumoto's tale, we have a tarnished samurai, a samurai who, in some eyes, has betrayed and rebelled against his emperor -- whom he's supposed to remain loyal to the end of his own life.  In his own eyes he's fighting not only for his emperor, but for his homeland as well.  It shows a great conflict, not only between others, but between himself.  Has he failed as a samurai or is he the epitome of the samurai?<br/><br/>In the telling of one story in this movie, we have the stories of several men -- two of them taking the forefront.  And it's those stories that drive the picture completely, and I tend to think it did so with a style and grace that came close to the samurai epics of one Akira Kurosawa.  Also in the telling of this story we are shown the beauty and the poetic side of the samurai, and of bushido, as well as the spiritual nature of those that followed it.<br/><br/>I think this film has several profound things to say, and it's really just a matter of whether you're listening or not."

","this movie is great, tom cruise is perfect for the role he plays.  The story and plot is fantastic.  If you like japanese culture and good ninja fights you would like this movie.  Wolfgang Peterson does a good job directing. The movie is a good story of never surrendering and having heart.  It does a good job of exploring the mind of a samurai"

"jinx237","10","0","2","6 December 2003"," I want to be a samurai after seeing this movie.
","I am quite susceptible to the power of suggestion, most notably when it comes to movies. This condition has brought me great success (imagine my fate after seeing ""The Ladies Man""), but also caused me some considerable problems (""Half Baked"" comes to mind).<br/><br/>Alas, I went to the local cinema Friday night with my strange affliction, knowing full well that I may end the night a worse person. It pretty much all banked on Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>At least nine times throughout the film, I accidentally, instinctively, loudly whimpered; I was simply overcome by emotion. And, to be entirely honest, this movie marks the first time since ""The Sixth Man"" I've cried in the theater. I won't say which part(s), because that would be Grand Theft Emotion for some unlucky ones out there who haven't seen this work of art yet. But yes, the movie simply took hold of me. Tom Cruise's performance was a Flawless Victory, the action gut-wrenchingly good, and the cinematography was pretty excellent as well (cameras are really clear these days).<br/><br/>Thanks to Mr. Cruise, I am a wanna-be samurai. I am like that little kid who's really cute, thinks Tom Cruise is the man, and wants to be him even though he doesn't quite understand the Way of the Samurai."

","Movie of the year!!!<br/><br/>This movie show you the true fact about how governments are easily influenced by their advisors about how to run the country.  It tells us that a lot of leaders are led by their assistants who twist the truth about situations or supposed rebels and how innocent people are prosecuted.  Tom Cruise gave a spectacular performance and his supporting cast did a very good job too.  The scenery was beautiful and the story tug at heart strings especially the parts about how the enemy's family took care of Cruise, forgave and accepted him into their lives.  It shows us that human beings need to stand up for what is right instead of just going with the flow because someone else has control.  It shows us that doing right is what matters most because honor, respect and compassion makes life more meaningful and fulfilling. The facts are true that change is not always for the better as the old ways set by the older generation were wiser in terms of discipline and honor."
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","1","6 December 2003"," Be kind to your feudal friends
","It's easy enough to trash Edward Zwick's new movie.  You can say it's just another silly story of a white boy condescending to `natives,' and all too similar to Kevin Costner's slightly embarrassing and very much over-praised 1990 Dancing with Wolves.  The odyssey of Captain Nathan Algren  is both idealized and preposterous.  It can be seen as insulting, if you think all those Asians are just dying onscreen to make Tom Cruise look like a hero. It's awfully convenient that the main Japanese character is quite fluent in English even though he's a samurai warlord living in a remote village in the 1870's.  It's easy to argue that this is all ridiculous wish-fulfillment stuff; that it not so much tells a story as manipulates images and emotions, pursuing its fantasy of nobility in the face of modern, urban, westernized corruption. It's utopian racism, exalting an outmoded, aristocratic feudal code that was already long bankrupt by the time Algren came to it, and suggesting that Japan ought to have stayed out of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>It's also easy to point out that Tom Cruise is unimpressive in physique and stature and lacks emotional power onscreen.  Indeed he's unconvincing as the drunken, burnt-out soldier he's supposed to be at the outset.<br/><br/>But those who dismiss Tom Cruise in this role forget that he's Tom Cruise. Not only will millions of people go to see his movies, but his is a personality that exudes drive and charisma, while we either sense or actually know that there's something a bit empty and needy at the core of the man, and it's not just a question of missing Nicole.  It's therefore very believable that he would have the dedication to master sword fighting, gain his captor's respect, embrace the Bushido and be entranced with Japanese culture, with its emphasis on excelling at everything - and on hiding emotions! Anyone has to admit that Cruise is more than adequate at the technical, physical side of his part  -- he not only does his own sword fighting and stunts, but also does them sharply.  This isn't a movie that cheats the way Gladiator did:  in hand-to-hand combat, you see all the moves.  There's a logic to the physical action in every Last Samurai battle, large or small, practice or to-the-death, that's very satisfying.  The Last Samurai contains some of the best fight scenes ever.  Yes, Tom works a little too hard here, but it pays off in the fights.<br/><br/>To condemn The Last Samurai's gaijin ethno-centrism is to overlook the fact that in its somewhat simplistic way it pays homage to an essential aspect of Japanese culture.  Its focus on the samurai reveals such centrally important Japanese values as face, honor, duty, politeness and the Bushido tradition that the samurai `shows no sign of joy or anger.' Algren is a visitor in a foreign world, one which he comes to admire deeply. We aren't told much about that culture, but we're shown people and an environment of great beauty.   The ironies of Kurosawa's samurai are missing, but the look of them is splendidly captured.  Thanks to Lilly Kilvert's designs, Ngila Dickson's costumes, and John Toll's cinematography (not to mention Zwick's orchestration of the great battles), this movie has fantastic production values.  Scene after scene, shot after shot, it never ceases to be a real aesthetic pleasure to look at. Sure, it's a bit adolescent to imagine a white man at the center of all this (it's a boy's fantasy), but the Japanese people aren't condescended to. And how else would you lure a western audience in to get a glimpse of this moment in Japanese history?  The whole presence of Algren, who is never referred to as `samurai' in the picture, is a cinematic convention to give focus to a depiction of the encounters between America and Japan at the time of the Satsuma rebellion when the emperor Meiji was young.  The focus of the story on the last few members of a warrior clan is a very literary one.  It's as elegiac as an Anglo-Saxon lament.  It's the celebration of a lost world that holds disappearing values to be superior to anything in the new world.  Is that wrong? Is it false? I confess to feeling a resurgence of my deepest Luddite sentiments while watching the howitzer artillery being cranked around and mowing down armored samurai on horseback, faring forth in their last charge, destroyed as if being fed into a meat grinder.  It's as good an indictment of modern technology as has been seen for many a reel.<br/><br/>But the whole trouble with the film is not its still-wet-behind-the-ears white hero or its simplifications of Japanese culture and history, but its complete lack of irony.  Irony is something that any dying race quickly learns.  You get a hint of what might have been when Katsumoto (the admirable Ken Watanabe) keeps talking about trying to find the last line of his poem.  You would get more irony if anyone besides Katsumoto, with a third point of view, could come in and talk to Algren about the downside of the job:  about how the samurai were no longer anything but palace guards and hired killers, like mafia hit men (a reality that Kurosawa does show in his samurai movies, which Zwick professes to adore).  An example of a movie with splendid irony is Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 Le Samouraï, starring the cool, implacable Alain Delon.<br/><br/>The Last Samurai however isn't a delicate piece of film noir like Le Samouraï; it's a Technicolor epic in the grand tradition.  Sure, Zwick is no John Ford or David Lean, but if you'll sit back and relax he'll give you a grand time.  And there's nary a terminator or replicant in sight.  My reaction when it was over was:  `That was a lot of nonsense - but I loved every minute of it!'<br/><br/>My choice for Edward Zwick's best film:  the meandering but charming 1986 About Last Night, his version of David Mamet's play with Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, and James Belushi."

","This is Tom Cruise's best film since Jerry Maquire.  The story is so compelling and the cinematography so stunning that you will forget you are seeing Tom Cruise - he becomes the film in a way that only a great actor can.  There is a mellifluous transition from drama to action - with a hint of comedy.  I recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates a great story and is not put-off by on screen violence."

","I very much enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>Go and enjoy the film for it's beauty, extremely detailed historical re-enactment, and see it as a glimpse of life,  man's struggle to come to terms with change, and ongoing imperialism of the USA since 200 years ago. Exporting democracy for 200 years by the tip of a sword or the barrel of a gun.... And no, this is not about bashing US at all.<br/><br/>I liked the movie because it took the time to dwell over the reasons ""why"" people were fighting, and how there's so much more always beyond what is going on in one's life. Additionally, the way of the samurai was not glamourized; I do think that the movie went a bit fast over the downsides of living by the sword, but it tackled very well the main issue: change happening too fast will unnerve people and will not be received well. Historically you always had revolutions on hand when people felt their way of life being violently threatened."
"djdavig","10","0","1","5 December 2003"," Let's Roll - Don't Walk, Run To See This Movie
","Rarely will you ever see a movie more inspiring than this epic treatise on the nature of good and evil.  In this new millenium ""Braveheart"" it is the greedy, self-absorbed corporate charlatans versus the selfless tribal warriors, who, knowing they are fighting a losing battle, decide to fight on with the utmost honor and bravery imaginable.  You will want to stand up and cheer just like the dozens of people I saw voicing their thanks for this rousing story.  It portrays America as many unfortunately see it in the rest of the world today, as an untrustworthy and greedy bully using its superior technology to stamp down the downtrodden and line its own pockets.  Yet it is an American Civil War hero (Cruise) who redeems his terrible crimes against humanity in the Indian Wars and teaches the brave Asian warriors what it takes to win against a far superior enemy.... not just honor, courage, integrity, and passion.... but faith, hope, and an undying will to see the good triumph over evil, no matter what the odds or the price.  The battle scenes are fantastic, characters sympathetic, sub plots engrossing, and you will wish as I did that the movie would not end.  I walked away a better man, the snickering cynics be damned.  You will too! I doubt any of them have ever fought valiantly in a battle to the death, even when they knew they would probably lose. Remember 9/11?  If only we modern day Americans could live every day like the last samurai, like it was our last fight, and understand that ours is mostly a battle between good and evil within the mind.  Our words are our swords and to die in battle is a ""good"" death.  ""Every man dies, but not every man really lives."" (Braveheart) Let's Roll!!!"

","I thought a few of the scenes in this movie dragged on and that they could have made it a LITTLE more deep into samurai culture and japanese culture (i love japanese culture though so i dont think this applies to most people). This movie was pretty amazing though. It was the best movie i've seen in AGES. Watch it.<br/><br/>PLEASE DONT PAY ATTENTION to people who say it is the worst movie of the year. If you look at the vote statistics more than 50% of the people who watched this movie rated it a 10. There are a lot of fake voters out there voting a 1 for this movie and saying crap about this movie. It may not be a PERFECT 10 but it isn't much lower than 7.5 at its lowest.<br/><br/>

","In a year where movies are constantly getting weaker, it is very relieving to see a new movie that is actually very good.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays as a soldier who fights the indians most of the time. He has a haunting past that gives him nightmares all of the time, and hates the man who he takes orders from. He delivers a solid performance, especially at the very end.<br/><br/>All of the supporting actors do a very good job. The cinematography is wonderful, and the direction is crisp. The battles were well edited, not too choppy or too close up. Even Cruise's fight in the middle is very well put together. ****+/5(four and a half out of five)."

","The Last Samurai is everything everyone says it is. Exhilarating, poetic, beautiful to look at, it is like a painting in a canvas, that you look at and wonder at the technique of the artists.  <br/><br/>The problem is that I never stopped looking at the technique, I never got involved in the story.  I was not swept away by the directing, rather, forced along...  <br/><br/>I really can't put my finger on why it was that I didn't love this movie. Although I did love the battle sequences OH BOY!<br/><br/>I am a fan of Tom Cruise, have always been, but I just didn't quite buy him in this role.  He was servicable, he was fine, but he was not the actor for the job.  I kept thinking about the wonderful things Russell Crowe could have done with this role.  And that's when it hit me.  I have seen this movie so many times over the last couple of years.  BRAVEHEART, GLADIATOR, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, This movie follows a formula which I like to call, the ""Let's go for a best picture nomination FORMULA""...<br/><br/>I do think it's one of the top ten movies of the year. Simply because of the way it portrays it's Japanese characters.  Still --- when it's all said and done.  I walked out of the film feeling a little cheated by the experience. I felt like the director, designer and cinematographer were saying... LOOK OVER HERE! aren't I GREAT!!!! everything was individually great, it just never came together as a complete film for me."
"Brogan","8","0","1","25 November 2003"," Great, but not best picture.
","<Possible Spoilers> One of the most anticipated films this Christmas is the new Tom Cruise film, THE LAST SAMURAI.  I personally was very excited to be seeing this movie (along with RETURN OF THE KING), and I am pleased to say that it is worth the wait. Tom Cruise stars as Capt. Woodrow Algren a U.S. Calvary vetertan who's seen his share of bloodshed.  Algren keeps having haunting flashbacks of seeing his fellow officers and commander, Col. Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) slaughter Native Americans (including women in children).   Algren is offered by his friend Zebulah Grant (Billy Connolly) and Bagly to train soldiers in Japan to fight against the Samurai warriors. Algren who has been drinking in his sorrows and looking for a excuse to die feels that this his is moment, he agrees to take the offer and sails off to Japan.<br/><br/>Over there Algren meets English journalist/photographer/interperter Simon Graham (Timothy Spall) who informs both Algren (and the viewer) about the Japanesse customs and traditions.  It turns out that the Japanese government, like America have problems with expantation of the railroad, which railroad workers and the Emperor's soldiers are killed by the samurai from the surrounding areas. Algren's expertise and knowledge of previous war experience is much needed for the Japanesse soldiers who wish to ""finish"" off the samurai and continue to build the railroad, very much like the western civilaztion. Algren trains the men, yet when Col. Bagly informs that Algren must have the soldiers prepare for battle the next morning, Algren disagrees believing and even showing that the men aren't ready yet. Col. Bagly ignores Algren's comments and orders the unprepared men to fight the next morning. Bagly believes that since the Emperor's soldiers have rifles that they can defeat the primitive samurai's with their ""sticks and arrows.""  The next day, as Algren and the soldiers wait for the samurai in the forrest, the warriors arrive and practically kill all of the Emperor's soldiers, at least the ones who didn't retreat with Col. Bagly. Algren stays behind and since he's been looking for a way or reason to die, he figures to fight to the death.  As eight samurai warriors surround Algren ready to strike, Algren takes one of the samurai flags and defends himself with it. This impresses Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the village leader and head samurai. As Algren is then knocked to the ground and is about to be killed by one of the warriors, with quick thinking, he defends himself by stabbing the warrior in the neck killing the samurai. Katsumoto orders his men to take Algren alive instead of death. As Algren recovers he realizes he is being taken care by a beautiful mother who lives in the village named Taka(Koyuki Kato).  It turns out that the warrior that Algren killed was Taka's husband.  Katusmoto informs Algren that he wants him alive to study the ""western"" way of battle and war.    However when Algren gets is a lesson of the way the samurai lives as well as the traditional way of the Japanesse culture. But even most important, Algren learns the ways of fighting and defending himself like the samurai. Like one of my favorite films this year (SEABISCUIT), LAST SAMURAI is a familar road traveled.  And like SEABISCUIT, it might be a familar road, yet it is a very enjoyable ride.  When I was watching this film I was ready to dubbed it ""DANCES WITH WOLVES GOES EAST.""   Then as the film continued, I enjoyed this film more, simply because the action scenes were more enjoyable. Yet, although both films have the plot of the individual who was a part of the advancement of the modern world, then realizing that they enjoy the traditional world of what was thought to be their enemies.   Having the central character realize that the world and environement he grew up in was wrong. But, I still did highly enjoy this film.  Tom Cruise did a very good job in this film.  However, I don't think he will be getting that ""Oscar"" this year. Cruise wasn't as good as his role in MAGNOLIA, however with LAST SAMURAI Cruise proves that he is one of the best actors working in film. Timothy Spall(ROCK STAR,& VANILLA SKY) did a great job as the ""comic"" relief as well as the sidekick to Cpt. Algren.  Tony Goldwyn (GHOST & THE 6TH DAY)does his usual passable role as the villian. However if anyone comes out of this film deserving a Oscar nomination is Ken Watanabe who played the head samurai, Katsumoto.   Watanabe, coming from Japan, gives a outstanding role as the leader who teaches both Algren and the audience that death is meaningful as long it was done with honor. Listening to the audience members after the film was over, a lot of people were impressed with his performance.   I will say that Ken Watanabe should get recognized for his moving and emotional performance. The directing by Edward Zwick is enjoyable.  Zwick who is no stranger to epics (GLORY & LEGENDS OF THE FALL) does a very good job with this film making the 150 mins. go by pretty fast and entertaining.  But the cinematography by two time Oscar winner John Toll (LEGENDS OF THE FALL, BRAVEHEART, ALMOST FAMOUS) does a amazing job! Some of the scenes and images of this film were just very beautiful with the lighting, the images of the flower blossoms, and the tricks of the trade (TOT) shots.<br/><br/>What really impressed me with this movie was the fight scenes with the samurai swords.  Woha!  I am a Akira Kurosawa fan, and seeing the sword fights done in this film makes the fights in the recent MATRIX films look pale in comparison. There is one fantastic scene of a unarmed, yet a trained Algren who is surrounded by government samurai's who all have swords. Watching this as well as a few other action scenes with the samurai fighting were great, making most of the action scenes from most of the 2003 films look boring to silly (except for ITALIAN JOB, PIRATES, & KILL BILL). I do applaud Edward Zwick for bringing the excitement and fantastic samurai fighting from the Kurosawa films. Overall, I think THE LAST SAMURAI will get some Oscar nods (Cinematography, Ken Watanabe; maybe picture & director) and it is that grand epic tradition like GLADIATOR, GANGS OF NEW YORK, and BRAVEHEART. It was at times predictable, but it was a fun and enjoyable ride.   Right now, for me, I would say that SEABISCUIT, MYSTIC RIVER, MASTER & COMMANDER, FINDING NEMO and LAST SAMURAI will be the ""front runners"" for nominations for Best Picture.  But that might change with other films including  Gus Van Saint's TURTLE, 21 GRAMS, and, of course, PETER JACKSON's RETURN OF THE KING.   But compared to the majority of the films out this year (like GIGLI...yeesh!) LAST SAMURAI proves to be one of the more enjoyable and entertaining films of 2003. ****1/2 (out of five)"
