","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is probably as close as we'll come to having an experimental film released in theaters nationwide. This is one of the most innovative, original movies to come out in years. It's unlike anything I'd seen before. And yes, it is good, very good. I could not stop laughing the whole time.<br/><br/>Onto the plot. Scott is something of a loser. He's socially awkward. He shares a mattress in a bunker-like apartment in Toronto with a sarcastic gossip king. He's in a band called the Sex Bob-Ombs, but they're really not that great. He also has a clinging, hyperactive girlfriend, ""Knives"" who's only 17- kind of a big deal when he's 22. All this changes when he dreams of a purple haired girl on roller blades. The very next day he finds out that she's real; that her name is Ramona flowers and she's the cool new girl in town. His first attempt to hook up fails miserably. His second attempt, although even more lamed brained, actually works, and they're soon an item. But now comes the bad news; to win her love, Scott must defeat her seven evil ex's. He also has an evil ex of his own. Plus, there's the matter of breaking up with Knives, and the battle of the bands is coming up!<br/><br/>That's the setup, what follows is a hilarious romantic comedy punctuated by a series of completely over-the-top video game style fight scenes. Stylistically, I'd have to call them a cross between Sin City, Street Fighter and Viewtiful Joe. Each of the ex's has their own unique fighting style and their own super powers, such as vegan-powered telekinesis or summoning an army of stunt doubles. Often you hear martial arts movies criticized because the action is obviously computer aided. Here, that's the whole point.<br/><br/>The movie's humor comes not only from the sheer ridiculousness of the situations, but also from the characters' reactions to them. After one of the ex's has flown in through a brick wall and battled Scott in the middle of a concert, everyone is just kind of weirded out. They don't act like nothing has happened, which would make it hard for the audience to suspend their disbelief, nor do they run screaming for the police, which would only complicate matters.<br/><br/>Comedic effect is also generated through the use of deadpan dialog. For instance, when Knives confesses that she's never kissed a boy before, Scott replies, with a straight face ""It's okay, neither have I."" Or the band's self-introduction, ""We're the Sex Bob-Ombs and we're here to make you all sad and depressed and stuff.<br/><br/>The movie also pokes gentle fun at hipster subculture with the way that Ramona has thirty plus flavors of tea, or how Scott's roommate is always texting. There are also quirky touches like one girl who can bleep herself out, much to Scott's amazement, and a scene when the intro from Seinfeld plays after the characters enter the apartment, and canned laughter follows every line.<br/><br/>The editing and structure are highly non-traditional, with heavy use of dreams, daydreams, montages, animated flashbacks and asides, and chapter titles introducing segments. The visuals are impressive and very imaginative, such as the way that flashes of color accompany the playing of any musical instrument, allowing you to see the sound. Speaking of which, the sound is another high point, not only the energetic, rock fueled sound track, but also the sound effects taken from classic games like Mario and Zelda.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World succeeds in telling an offbeat story, providing interesting characters, and in producing lots of laughs. Other than a couple of too-obvious puns, I honestly can't think of anything wrong with this movie. I would highly recommend it to anyone in their teens or twenties. Four stars."

","Scott Pilgrim versus the World is a Canadian romantic comedy and musical based on the comic books by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Scott Pilgrim is a 22y.o teen-age-looking insecure guy and guitarist who plays in a rock band called Sex Bom-omb and is going out with a minor high-school Chinese girl, Knives. He seems content until he has a dream about a girl. She happens to appear in his real world in the form of Ramona, the ever-changing-hair-colour American recently moved to Toronto. Scott is over the moon, but he has to face his own personal demons, break up with sweet Knives and fight for Ramona's love against her seven exes.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is one of the most refreshing teen-sophomore movies produced in the last years, and one the best movies of 2010. The movie is cute, funny, entertaining, has great characters, a terrific soundtrack and stunning visuals. The story is presented as in a video-game in which the main characters are the players, and their lives is the game. The issues regarding relationships are masqueraded by the video-game approach, but they have depth. Unlike many other movies focusing on the emotional challenges of very young people, sex is not the focus, although it does not avoid it either. The movie focus on how difficult is to make a relationship work when you fall in love whit people who already have an emotional baggage and you are insecure about yourself. Scott's fights against Ramona's exes are just a metaphoric way of putting it. Moreover, the emotions of the girl are not the focus here, but the emotions of a young man who is not obsessed with sex. How do you get a girl who has an emotional baggage when you are not an over-confident guy, your dream girl is uber-cool, and her exes were brilliant guys? The good thing is that any of this is boringly presented. On the contrary, the movie is lots of fun and does not take itself seriously.<br/><br/>All the actors are great in their roles: Michael Cera as Scott, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Ellen Wong as Knives Chau; Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill as the other band members Stephen, Young and Kim. Kieran Culkin is Scott's confident grounded gay Wallace Wells, Anna Kendrick as the know it all Scott's sister Stacey, and Jason Schwartzman as the revolting Gideon Graves. However, Cera really shines in this movie, in part because his physique really portraits the character from the start.<br/><br/>The visuals of the movie are stunning, the camera's movement, the video-game and comic use of the screen adding to the freshness and originality of the film. The fights wit the exes are extremely funny and witty. I specially liked the fight with the Vegan ex-boyfriend, which is hilarious. Also visually stunning is the musical competition between Scott's rock band and the techno Asian twins band.<br/><br/>The music is truly terrific. An extra bonus to a great script.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs the Wold movie is not only well done but done with passion, a project cherished by the whole team and by director Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>The movie has freshness, soul and a special something that stays with you longer after you've seen it! It is miles away from any other young people romantic comedy lately made."
"Crys383-3","10","434","663","24 July 2010"," Epic indeed
","The tagline for this film is ""An Epic of Epic Epicness"" and I couldn't agree more. After waiting in line for 3 hours after last night's Comic-Con and finally being sat in the gorgeous Balboa Theater, I didn't know what to expect. I loved the comics and the previews looked faithful. The moment the movie starts (literally; the Universal logo and theme are 8-bit) you are thrown into a comic book atmosphere with video game references aplenty.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim needing to defeat the 7 Evil Exes of Ramona Flowers in order to date her and it is a harrowing sequence of battles. Each fight is crazier than the last and some are used purely for comedy, not excitement. Almost every other line is a punchline and they all work. References to TV shows, video games and comics (just like a 20-something's life would include) are everywhere and if you accept the concept of the plot, it all feels natural.<br/><br/>While the audience might've been biased (we held a 10-minute standing ovation for Edgar Wright when the movie finished) there's no denying that it's an excellent film. Edgar Wright has an uncanny sense of comic timing with edits and sound cues to make the picture tight and focused when it's looking for laughs.<br/><br/>I can't imagine a mainstream theater erupting in applause and laughter like ours did but make no mistake; this a crowd pleaser and the MOST enjoyable film I've seen in years. Don't hesitate to watch this masterpiece in a theater near you."
"wilderblue2005","8","115","174","9 December 2010"," Something unusually great
","I came to this films with no preconceptions of it as a movie and I have to say I am glad. I guess I was expecting another Michael Cera movie about some dopey kid in love. And thats what it is ... but done in a unusually great way. For anyone under 25 brought up on gaming (I am 30 and not) this will be just brilliant. The style of the movie with its ""end of level baddies"", game-play set-up and visuals are a welcome and refreshing twist on what could have been a hum-drum movie. The music rocked, the comedy was fast, slick and laugh out loud ... I'd definitely recommend this to my friends looking for something that little bit special."

I must say that I didn't quite know what to expect but except that I thought this movie was for teenagers and I was terribly wrong. <br/><br/>I am 40 years old and I TRULY enjoyed this movie and it had a clear story line that targeted more than just teenagers. In addition, I saw every age group, race, gender in the screening that I attended which was impressive and we all were jumping and laughing at every scene as if we were all teenagers. <br/><br/>I truly left the movie saying that "" I cant wait to see more films put out by ""Oni Productions/Closed on Mondays "".

","I was lucky enough too see this film during a test preview to an audience that weren't told what we were about too see. I was honestly expecting some odd film that really needed a lot of help but i was pleasantly surprised with how great this movie was.<br/><br/>The movie had everyone laughing, and i mean everyone, I've been too almost every Wright film and somehow the audience wasn't as amused as i was, but this time everyone loved it. I've never heard so much laughter in one cinema.<br/><br/>The jokes were fast and although silly, they weren't stupid which made for quite an enjoyable film. Wright's trademark quick cuts, and simple comedy made this film, i personally think if it were directed by anyone else it wouldn't have had the same effect.<br/><br/>The characters were well written and performed, every individual character fitted perfectly. The film had many scenes that were quite pointless but still quite funny for example the Seinfeld scene.<br/><br/>Apparently its based on a comic book series? I've never heard of them before but i certainly will look out for them now. If you're a fan of Edgar Wrights films or just good silly humour you will love this film.<br/><br/>Great comedy, definitely the best of 2010 8/10 Morgan"
"bennyhagen","8","131","225","12 November 2010"," Fantastic!
","Teenager problems (find yourself, get real, etc.) might not give anything to people considering themselves mayor adults, but consider this is a movie built on arcade video gaming motifs, I don't think it concerns mayor adults at all in the first place. I for one did not necessarily long for dark moral drama in this particular movie at all, I think the story was just about right for this movie, but you decide, if this is childish watch Haneke.<br/><br/>Now for the rest: Surprisingly, Scott Pilgrim features the best martial arts scenes in years. Every fight is choreographed and executed in the most awesome ways and the fact that it's not Jet Lee pulling off these moves makes it even more fun to watch. And you get the fights absolutely frequently which is really, really satisfying. The editing is incredibly skillful as probably the most crucial element that makes this work. It gives the movie an incredible rhythm, reaching new levels of dynamism and the use of CGI and the visual design is plain fantastic. The amount of creativity put into this part is mind- blowing, resulting genuine and most original style. The cast is cool and I don't think anyone should look for academy material here. I liked these kids and they suit the movie.<br/><br/>So, all together I found Scott Pilgrim being one of the most original, exciting and fun productions I've seen in my life. As a huge fan of things like fighting games, comics, or martial arts anime I felt satisfied to a point of screaming 'awesome' out loud after 30 minutes into the movie. Though people who never played Street Fighter or kept crossing fingers for Goku and friends yelling 'kamehameha' as evil bosses get pulverized by energy beams might not really get what Scott Pilgrim is about, it's very hard to deny the originality featured and the creative and professional qualities of the way it's executed.<br/><br/>Fantastic! 8/10"

"Wizard-8","Null","30","50","26 November 2012"," Visually impressive, though lacking in its script
","I have a feeling that many young people would go ape for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"". It involves both young people, and its video game elements will be greatly appealing to youths. However, I think older people (like myself) will be somewhat let down by the movie.<br/><br/>Before I get to criticizing the movie, let me say that I did feel the movie had SOME positive elements. The visual effects are top notch, successfully crossing live action with what you might see in a video game. There are also a lot of small touches here and there that are amusing, like defeated opponents transforming into coins.<br/><br/>The visual look of the movie combined with those small touches ALMOST makes up for the flaws in the movie. The source of all the flaws is the same: the script. The script is really inadequate in a number of areas. The biggest flaw is that except for the character of Knives, NONE of the characters are sympathetic or appealing. They come across as thoughtless and kind of dumb, especially the title figure. Another script problem is that much of the movie consists of it repeating several times stuff that has already happened. The movie becomes monotonous after a while. Also, the ending is very frustrating, with Scott (in my opinion) choosing the wrong person to be with.<br/><br/>I have not read the graphic novel series this movie is based on, but my guess is based on its length, a LOT of character development and story was cut out in order to make the movie last a little under two hours. So if you have a choice, I would advise you read the multi-part graphic novel instead of seeing this movie."

It very quickly became my favourite film after watching it and I could watch it over and over again without ever getting bored of it; the same way that you could watch the same episode of Friends for the 'nth' time and find it as hilarious as the first.<br/><br/>Though the character feels quite different to his graphic novel counterpart, Michael Cera does an excellent job as the awkward Scott, Kieran Culkin is perfect as Wallace and Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays a much more tragic version of Ramona Flowers but this change still works well.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a must-see and it deserves more recognition. Go watch it, you'll love it."
"kevinxirau","9","46","82","30 November 2011"," Crazy, stupid, awesome video game fun.
","Scott Pilgram, a comic series unlike any other, is brought to insane life onto the big screen. When I first heard about this, I dismissed it as some lame movie, but to my surprise it isn't. This is one of the best movies with the word ""versus"" in the history of cinema. It's so absolutely mind-blowing that I can't tell if the author of the comics was tripping on acid when he made this.<br/><br/>Now on to the plot: Meet Scott Pilgram, a teenage boy who has his own rock band, been in a few relationships, lives in an apartment with a homosexual roommate, and happens to be the best fighter in town. When he meets a mysterious hair-color-changing girl named Ramona, Scott suddenly falls in love. However, to be with Ramona, he has to defeat her seven evil ex's, each with their own skills and powers, in awesome and hilarious video game style brawls to the death.<br/><br/>All I can say is that this film is pure freaking genius. Action-packed and incredibly stupid (in a good way). I wish I had fights like these, then my life would be complete! All the evil ex's are delightfully despicable, each having their own funny little quirks. This is a wonderful movie and I recommend that you check this out."

He's become typecast, but this is one movie which breaks the mold. (Or at least it ignores it and does its own thing.) Edgar Wright has also directed the great movies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz,"" and he doesn't disappoint with this. I haven't read the anime series this was based on, but I don't really want to, because this is so much better than it could ever be. To be completely honest, the only thing I don't like his how fast Scott's 'pee bar' empties.

"leeatwork","10","15","25","5 June 2018"," A Bold Masterpiece That Defies All Norms
","Edgar Wright is a creative genius and crafts one of the most delightful pieces of entertainment that unites a set of insanely likable, charismatic characters, a unique visual style, a truly original plot, charming dialogue, nuanced comedy, innovative editing and a soundtrack that kicks ass.<br/><br/>The story follows Scott Pilgrim, a 22-year-old guitarist who plays in a not-so-successful band and who seems to stumble from one social misadventure to the next. He starts off dating a 17-year-old but is soon enraptured by purple haired Ramona Flowers who works in delivery service. However, to be with her, he first needs to defeat her seven evil exes. <br/><br/>This set-up, although seemingly ridiculous, paves the way for a film that captivates the viewer with its colourful set designs, smart dialogue and of course its over-the-top, awesomely choreographed fight scenes with video game aesthetics. Despite the exaggeration, the story never feels forced or contrived. Instead, it flows amazingly naturally and the comedy never falls flat, which is certainly also due to the superb performances of the cast. <br/><br/>I couldn't praise this film enough. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is one of these films that succeeds on every level. You see it once and immediately want to re-watch it. The creators obviously knew what they were doing and the result is a well-paced, highly entertaining film spiked with references to pop culture. It dares to be unconventional and geeky but never gets too absorbed in its references. The film knows when to be quiet and when to be loud but most of all, it doesn't take itself too seriously, granting an out of this world, two hour spectacle that couldn't be more epic."
"jaysilentbob37","4","120","257","29 August 2010"," I really wanted to love it. But I can barely even bring myself to like it.
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has made me question just how well I fit in with my generation. According to other members of my generation, it is the movie to end all movies, and the best movie... I'm sorry... most EPIC movie ever. I'm partial to The Godfather myself. Scott Pilgrim is a film that I was looking forward to as Michael Cera has made me laugh numerous times in the past, and Edgar Wright is easily one of the more talented newer directors working today. Combined with the eye-popping visual effects, I couldn't see how these things could add up to anything less than a fun and entertaining film. Fun, to a point. Entertaining? Well...<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim's first problem is the plot. The plot is self-conscious and repetitive, as well as overly laid back and easygoing. Scott Pilgrim has to defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil ex's. That's the whole plot, and at no point do we get the sense that anything is at stake for these characters. I know that probably shouldn't matter in an effects-driven popcorn movie, but with nothing to root for, or no suspense of any kind, I found the film to get boring after the first thirty minutes. That is approximately when the first evil ex shows up. They fight. He defeats him easily. Too easily. The fight isn't all that exciting as a result. And with six of these to go, the movie became a tedious experience before it was even halfway over.<br/><br/>Not to say the film doesn't have it's good points. Michael Cera, though not as witty as he can be, is still somewhat likable. And while the script lacks structure of any kind, it is jam- packed with hilariously quirky dialogue and brilliant sight gags. The filmmaking is generally good throughout, and as a director Edgar Wright hasn't lost his talent. Unfortunately, the poor storyline ultimately overshadowed these elements for me. <br/><br/>Maybe it's because I don't play video games. Maybe I just need to read the comics. Or maybe I'm just becoming less fun of a person as I mature. I want to like this movie and take the same joy from it that my generation does, but I simply can't. I'll stick to films with stories and social relevance and enjoy being the outcast. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets a generous 5/10 because I feel giving it anything lower would just make me look bitter."
"Likes_Ninjas90","4","180","398","29 August 2010"," It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is in his early twenties and has started dating a girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) who is still in high school. The news circulates around all of his friends including his gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and his nosey sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). At first Scott enjoys the company of Knives. She watches his band play during their practice sessions. At a party though Scott meets who he believes is the girl of his dreams in Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He opts to go out with Ramona instead and decides to breakup with Knives. Yet when his band is performing at a gig, Scott is confronted by one of Ramona's seven ex-boyfriends. This leads to a series of video game style fight sequences where Scott must take on each of Ramona's exes, many of which have superhuman powers of their own and defeat them so he can date her properly.<br/><br/>Although Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has been adapted from a 2004 graphic novel series, it is to a fault like a computer game. It's been directed by Edgar Wright, who previously worked on Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Hot Fuzz (2007). He has chosen to shoot the film with an overwhelming number of visual tricks that look to have come straight from the graphic novel source and the arcades machines. When someone knocks on Scott's door the onomatopoeic words appear on the screen. When Scott kisses Ramona tiny hearts trickle out between them. During the fight scenes icons popup to reveal Scott's high scores, like an arcade game. But Wright seems too excited by these gimmicks and they are used too frequently. Rather than being charming little treats for the audience, they quickly become excessive. The film's rapid pacing is also problematic. As the director and one of the film's screenwriters Wright seems highly intent on moving through the film's opening quarter as quickly as possible, with rapid cutting hurling the audience from one scene to another. Given the speed of the first act and the array of video game aesthetics thrown in, the rest of the film desperately lacks urgency. It fires all its shots at once and then there is no momentum to build upon with any of the fight scenes, leaving the movie at a monotone rate. Scott Pilgrim already knows how to fight too so there is no character development or exposition here either. Each fight sequence feels no more significant than the last. It makes for extremely repetitive viewing, with at least three exes too many and just not enough substance.<br/><br/>Michael Cera has potential as a comic actor but the script here does not allow him to develop anything new beyond his trademark dopey persona. Given how engaging he has been in films like Juno (2007), it is surprising how dislikeable he is here. The way that he treats Knives and gets away with it makes him less appealing as a protagonist. It does not help that Cera is forced to deliver dialogue that is entirely self- conscious in its attempts to be hip. No one has anything interesting or funny to say here. When his sister Stacey asks him if he really thought that he had a future with Ramona he replies thickly: ""Like with jetpacks?"" There is an overdose of style here and not an ounce of sincerity. A lot of the other performers are wasted too. Anna Kendrick, a talented actress from films like Twilight and Up in the Air (2009), is barely seen and no matter how cool and alternative Winstead's hair looks her character is still underwritten. It's disappointing that the exes fail to reveal anything about her past. Jason Schwartzman has only a small role as the film's central baddie and it would have been nice to see more of him in the film because he is a regularly enjoyable talent on-screen.<br/><br/>Despite the efforts of director Edgar Wright to bombard the audience with an array of visual tricks, there is little by way of substance to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Its computer game counterpart probably soars on its artistic flair but this film disregards too many of the basics of screen writing. It's pacing runs on a single, exhausting note and does not give enough urgency to the repetitive fight sequences. The lack of a substantial narrative here diminishes any possible depth the performances might have had too. It's so intent on being hipster cool that it forgets about keeping it real. Exit game."

","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' was executed from a graphic novel to a film very nicely but didn't make it a better film. The movie was great but from comic to movie really didn't make it any better although it probably wasn't intended to make it better. This film exceeded all of my expectations and actually surprised me that a comic like this type could be made into a movie so nicely done. I immediately picked up the graphic novels and it explained a huge amount of references that never got displayed in this movie. I really really liked Michael Cera's performance in this and he continues to be exceptional. The film's tagline ""An epic of epic epicness"" really defines the film for what it is. It was funny, intense, and serious while it has it's own style of a film itself. 'Scott Pilgrim' had it's own type of humour, the intense fight scenes that were really fun to watch and see the creativity of the authors point of view. This is a fun movie and must see."

This movie to me stomps the best story lines out there, Crush's action films like ""The Matrix"". Overall this is where ""Film"" should be going.<br/><br/>If you remember what it is like to be a kid and your a adult now, you and your kid(s) can watch this together. Trust me it's worth it, We all love a good drama story and thats exactly what this is. Sure they threw a awesome amount of action in there but isn't that needed so men and women can enjoy a film together these days? Oh and lets not forget the awesome way the music was brought into this storyline Kudos! MAD prop's goes out to Michael Cera dude you have brought me over to your fan base. Good call on the 100% flawless cheat code. I PRAY! there is a sequel to this movie and i hope it earns awards.<br/><br/>Peace for now Xavier"
"Karlamon","8","23","45","30 June 2011"," An awesome comedy that stays apart from others
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a very smart teen comedy. While being a romantic comedy, it also makes jabs on video game culture at the same time to create unique storytelling and cinematography. Thanks to its fast-paced action, eye-popping visuals and spot-on references on recto gaming, Hot Fuzz director Edgar Wright successfully turns this simple comic book adaption into a funny, innovative and very awesome epic comedy flick that sets itself apart from the crowd.<br/><br/>This is a film based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel with the same name. While I didn't read any Scott Pilgrim novels, I still got engaged in the films fast paced story. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is the basest of his garage rock band Sex Bob-omb who one day, befriends with Ramona Flowers (Elizabeth Mary Winstead) who turns out to be the girl of his dreams. But in order to win her, Scott must stand up and destroy Ramona's seven exes.<br/><br/>The acting in this treat of a film is very witty and well-directed. Michael Cera is very fitting for the title character Scott Pilgrim, delivering his speedy lines in a stable, geeky and enthusiastic way which to me, made him very likable. The same goes with the rest of the cast members including Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona and Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate Wallace. Even the seven axes are spot-on, each one being unique and distinctive from each other. While I was a little annoyed with the lack of character development, the characters themselves were still fun and believable.<br/><br/>In addition to Scott Pilgrim vs. The World's witty dialogue, references of old school video games are scatted throughout the film. Not only are they done in such a humorous way and give the film personality, but they also act an important storytelling device. This is no game of ""spot-the-reference"" like in those ""Movie"" movies. In Scott Pilgrim, these references help the story keep its flow and pace and gives you the feel of being in a video game. Whether it's Scott's bands name that's taken from the Mario villain or the boss battles that humorously mimic classic fighting games like Street Fighter and Mortal Combat, they are all excellent and retro gamers will easily pick them up.<br/><br/>It's not just the video game jabs that make this movie so cool. There are amazingly flashy special effects which dominate the films cinematography. What I found special about them is that they are very unique, not clichéd fireballs or gunfire like in other action movies. But instead of those, we are provided with effects varying from classic 8-bit pop-ins and dazzling and colourful light clash effects during the battle scenes. As a bonus, enemy remainings are coins instead of blood. Score!<br/><br/>I had a blast watching, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. It's dazzling, wittily written and filled with nostalgia, but it's such a shame it failed at the Box Office. To finish off, this is a cult film that I highly recommend, especially for fans of the novel, video games and Wright's other works. ""B+"""

","Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) is a 22 year old slacker, who is in a band and lives with his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin),and life seems to be pretty predicable. Until he meets Ramona Flowers( Mary Elizabet Winstead from Sky High, Final Destination 3, and Live Free or Die Hard). Scott feels they could have something, but Ramona is unsure, but gives in and starts going out with Scott. But remember the saying your past comes back to haunt you, in Ramonas case comes in the form of seven evil exes with superhuman powers. In order to win Ramonas love Scott must defeat them, but the question is will he? <br/><br/>Entertaining to say the least, Michael Cera is good, so is Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Co stars don't disappoint either, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, Mae Whitman(Hope Floats), Alison Pill, Anna Kendrick(Up in the Air), and Kieran Culkin. The video game effects are also awesome.

","I like / love Edgar Wright's other movies (""Shaun..."" is easily one of the 10 best British films ever made and is endlessly quotable, and ""Fuzz"" so perfectly captures the vein of the genre it affectionately spoofs) as well as his TV show ""Spaced"" (final scene of first series filmed in my local!), so I was looking forward to this a lot; unfortunately I was really really disappointed.<br/><br/>I found the film flaccid (at least 30 mins too long) the characters unengaging and uninteresting, the drama non-existent (was there ever any doubt how it would turn out?) and most frustratingly of all just not funny enough. It was just boring.<br/><br/>Yes, I can see that all the video game stuff is clever, and the Flash Gordon reference was fun, but being clever is not enough to make a film good and I found it pretty annoying before too long.<br/><br/>I am not familiar with the source material but if this is faithful to it I can only conclude that it wasn't worth being turned into a movie. No-one ever made a good movie from lousy source material.<br/><br/>I am in my mid 30s so possibly older than the target audience, but I'm still astounded this rates so highly and is in the top 250 (at time of writing). It has been widely commented that this will polarize audiences, I'm just slightly sad I didn't find anything to like in it at all."
"jennalee-1","1","74","168","6 September 2010"," Warning: This movie is a mega fail
","This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever sat all the way through. Worst meaning; it bored me senseless. I was on the verge of turning it off several times and the only reason I let it keep playing was I somehow hoped it would come alive somewhere in the middle, or three quarters in, or even in the last few minutes. But it just doesn't. Despite having the potential to be a good movie - A girl with rad hair colour, a reasonably OK story line, comic strip captions, indie music and quite a few actors I like, it totally fails to be interesting in any way. In my opinion there are no redeeming qualities about it. None. There are no characters to like. Or dislike. Since the main character is so totally unlikeable, it's impossible to dislike his enemies much and when you don't actually care if the ""evil exes"" take him out or not it renders the whole experience simply boring. Besides they don't seem that evil, I don't really know what was evil about them apart from being exes. Scott Pilgrim on the other hand is an utterly awful character, I'm glad he's fictional. I'd like to call him quite a few things but I'm pretty sure IMDb would censor them and not accept this review so I'm leaving them out cos I want to warn others before they waste money and an hour and a half of their lives on this movie. If there is such a category as ""indie B-movie"" this is it. Except that ""B-movie"" implies it's so bad it's at least funny. This is not even funny. It is the most boring movie I have ever seen all the way through. So if you decide to watch it despite reading this and it turns out you find it boring too during the first 20 minutes, SAVE YOURSELF! TURN IT OFF! You can spend the remaining 1hr 25 minutes doing something way more fun with your life. Cos pretty much ANYTHING will be more fun than watching the rest of this movie. If you're on the other hand aiming for death by boredom - carry on. Scott Pilgrim vs. the world will do the trick. Guaranteed."

The acting was awful, the dialogue was awful, the characters were all horrible people, the editing was obnoxious and annoying, the special effects were obnoxious and annoying, the story was Annoying, the music was awful and there was Not one Single Redeeming or Likable Feature about The Whole Thing!<br/><br/>The frenetic editing style mixed with lots of colourful flashing things almost seemed like a desperate attempt to keep the audience focused on the film, treating their aged 16-25 demographic like magpies with short term memory loss, if there isn't something flashy, colourful and new on the screen every 10 seconds their eyes might wonder away from the screen and down to their iPhones, since they just can't stop themselves from updating their Facebook status in the middle of the cinema. Besides that i found the whole arcade game mixed with comic book style tiresome and ugly to look at.<br/><br/>The whole film is so obnoxious and in you face all the time with its ""oooh we're so geeky, cool and retro, yeah 8-Bit rules, i'm in a band!, Pac-Man is so totally awesome"" etc attitude which is pretentious and sickening. The attitude of the film is that of Pseudo-Intellectual student/trendy/hipster/cool kid posturing, it was trying too hard to be clever, i couldn't focus on what was going on because the editing and the special effect were giving me a headache, the characters had nothing interesting to say and were (for the most part) horrible people, i couldn't relate or care about them at all and the whole film was messy, unfocused and most of all Uninvolving.<br/><br/>I was so full of rage that i felt like i was about to have a panic attack, i was hyperventilating, my whole body was shaking, my knuckles were white from clenching my fists and i felt physically sick!

I mean i wasn't sure if i was going to like it but i did not expect to be so insulted and enraged and i highly doubt if the remaining 67 minutes would have been any better! I have Never walked out of a screening in a cinema before and its my ultimate golden rule never to do so even if its really bad, i stick with it until the end so i can say i have seen the whole film and i can make a fully informed opinion about it BUT THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH I CAN PUT UP WITH!!!"
"Youngman_Grand","1","110","260","22 October 2010"," Me vs. Cynical money-spinning exercise in audience manipulation.
","The one star rating isn't something to be dispensed lightly; there are very few films that have so little in the way of entertainment value that they deserve such a critical pasting. Most flicks I've seen that fit comfortably into the category of 'awful' have some redeeming feature, even if it's the dreaded 'unintentional comedy' factor. That being said, when the movie in question is already being marketed as a comedy, a person can really find themselves reaching. So it is with SPVTW, a movie that manages to not only be thoroughly unentertaining and an ordeal to sit through, but one that doesn't even have the decency to let you laugh at it. This is that rare beast: a film that actually makes the rational audience member seethe and froth with rage at how shallow and calculating it is, how utterly empty and devoid of any soul or any artistic sensibility.<br/><br/>Of the actual plot, there isn't much to say. Blah, blah, urban ennui, blah, blah, cardboard existential angst, blah, blah, the theme tune from Legend Of Zelda? Blah. Michael Cera once again sleepwalks through a part he seems to be playing via satellite link-up. His philosophy, behaviour, fashion sense and interests are all carefully delineated in order to make him the ultimate hipster composite, an icon for trend-whores everywhere. Will he get the girl of his dreams, whose quirks are equally well chosen to make her his ideal match? Will his tedious garage band make it big? Will this movie try and challenge its audience in any way? Seems to me the mark of a good film is to start from more or less a neutral position, then to actively make you enjoy it via good writing, acting and direction. This is the emo equivalent of one of those dreadful Christian Bible films, where quality is pretty much irrelevant since the faithful will always defend it on the grounds that it's Jesus-friendly. Here the target audience will be so enthralled to see it's own interests acknowledged in 35mm that normal standards won't apply.<br/><br/>Hollywood has always made its money by tailoring genre films to demographic expectations - so it really shouldn't be any surprise that a movie so resolutely targeted at 20-something hipster/slacker/poseurs should be as blandly plastic and artificial as any Disney puke-athon. But for those of us who quite like things like old 8-bit video games and anime, it's hugely irritating to find them hijacked and press-ganged into service as garnish for some smarmy indie manifesto. And it's even more annoying that someone like Edgar Wright, who up to now I rather respected for his subversive take on sitcoms (Spaced), Zombie horror (Shaun of the Dead) and crass action flicks (Hot Fuzz), is basically pandering to a ready made market with something as utterly conventional as this. Because ultimately, though it might seem superficially to be a fresh and original product, this movie is total formulaic sludge, full of low-budget indie tropes, jacked up on a hundred million dollar budget.<br/><br/>Had it been made by a genuine independent company, with a cast of unknowns and utilising the whole retro gaming aesthetic more authentically, it might actually have been a lot better. Because it is kind of cute and fun to see some old Super Mario graphics crop up in-film, and sometimes the use of sound FX is clever enough to justify the exercise. But then it would probably have won a bunch of awards at Sundance and been remade as precisely the film we have now. So Edgar Wright has thoughtfully cut out the middleman. Indie cinema nowadays is generic enough in it's attempt to be the 'anti-Hollywood', but once mainstream studios have finished co-opting its clichés and CGI-ing the crap out of it, this is the result.<br/><br/>Terrible, terrible film."

","Let's cut to the chase. This movie is woefully bad in almost every single aspect. The characters are vague, irritating, two-dimensional non-entities, and as such, I found it impossible to relate to any of them. In particular, Scott Pilgrim is a dull, whiny brat with no personality whatsoever. The rest of the ensemble are cardboard cut-outs aimed at an audience that must surely prize pre-teen rambling over actual conversation, and you'll be hard pushed to remember anything interesting that any one of them said after the movie.<br/><br/>The plot is insulting - boy must beat girl's evil ex's to win her. That's it. Wow! The battle scenes are ridiculous, with enemies reduced to coins after being defeated, one of many, many repetitive nods in the direction of out-dated games consoles such as Nintendo's.<br/><br/>Seriously this has all been done before and with more style. I cannot believe that this pile of equine manure is the product of the same man that wrote Hot Fuzz.<br/><br/>I'll make it plain for you - Do you have ADHD? Are you impressed by flashing lights? Do you want dumb American teens mumbling incoherent nonsense as main characters? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, I give you Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.<br/><br/>enjoy."

","Being quite the fan of director Edgar Wright's previous efforts and being a self confessed gaming nut since 1981 and seeing the rise of the Nintendo generation from the beginning who supposedly this film is directed at. I was really excited and looking forward to spotting all the gaming references that Wright likes to sneak into his films and shows.<br/><br/>It turns out this film is the most shocking example of what passes for entertainment these days. It was terrible, unfunny and extremely annoying.<br/><br/>The film is absolutely tailor made for a generation that has an attention span of about 0.2 seconds. The characters all talk in a similar quickfire style with a camera cut happening almost every half second and the screen is littered with bright coloured, animated fx obviously there to stimulate whatever moronic mind would find this fun. <br/><br/>The characters are horribly accurate examples of today culture with protagonist Scott Pilgrim himself being the archetypal anti hero. Weedy, weak, unsure of himself and sensitive along with the token gay friend and 'rocker' girlfriend.<br/><br/>This is a nerds wet dream. It places a weakling in a world where game rules apply and said weakling proceeds to annihilate 7 rather more burly boyfriends of the pretty girl he is trying to woo. It's what every nerd, outcast and skinny emo boy in the world wishes would happen to them.<br/><br/>I'm insulted that this film wants to the the hero for gamers of the world. I am a massive gamer and absolutely nothing about this film appealed to me at all.<br/><br/>Now to be fair I must give kudos to the visual effects in the film. They are both stylish and impressive and the actual fight choreography itself is excellent. To those that think that this is enough to make a film good, even a comic book action film, must have something seriously wrong with them.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, walk out after the 8-bit Universal logo.

","Although i had only heard good things about this film I was half expecting it to come across as a typical teen 90s teen comedy and was expecting something quite childish. I tried to push these thoughts aside as I am a huge Edgar Write fan, and also a massive geek.<br/><br/>As a film I think It was very well done, if not just a few minutes too long. Although a younger cast and a story line that relates to younger people there is a very 80's feel to it with the big reference to the old snes games in the fight scenes and the the special effects as well as sticking very close to the old school comic books and typical manga style of the hand drawings to accentuate certain parts of the film and characters, even going to the point of have writing about whats happening or what people are thinking/saying appear on the screen. It is well written, subtle but funny, although only if you are into that kind of humour. A lot of the humour revolved around old computer games and consoles. Plus, the film was very visually pleasing, something that I have always found edgar wright to be very good at. It did touch into crappy teen comedy but was made as if this was being aimed at a more adult audience.<br/><br/>On to my second point: Despite all of this, I found the film a bit all over the shop. Although there was clear plot it just didn't feel concise as if they had just done a half assed job with the screen writing.<br/><br/>I love edgar Write and I'm sure he will produce some brilliant stuff again in the future but overall, I found scott Pilgrim underwhelming and disappointing."

","I honestly wanted to like this movie because I liked Michael Cera's work in other titles like Youth in Revolt. However he often seems to be typecast as the lovable loser and in this film it just did not work for him, leaving his character seeming unlovable and unrelatable.<br/><br/>The plot centres around his character Scott Pilgrim who is struggling to make his band a success and get over a bad break up a year before. He dates a high school girl 5 years younger for a while before being attracted to the cliché unapproachable new girl in town with the mysterious past. She is obviously way out of his league but seems attracted to him as a rebound because he seems sweet and shy and all her exes were evil. Even though this is obviously not a recipe for a lasting relationship he follows her like a poor lost puppy, cheating on his poor lost girlfriend. Eventually he dumps his girlfriend so him and the new girl he knows nothing about can live happily ever after. However surprisingly there is a catch in the form of the 7 evil exes he has to defeat to win her hand. Notice it says 7 evil exes not just ex boyfriends. This is because a tired 'I kissed a girl and I kind of liked it' moment is dragged out in a desperate attempt to stop you losing interest, it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Through the fight scenes the film makes hackneyed points like 'self respect is stronger than love' using ham-fisted video game metaphors you'll be bored of before the action even starts.<br/><br/>This might work as a game but not a film, the story and the characters are so superficial and two dimensional that the only true stars are the special effects and Ramona's cool hair.<br/><br/>The game sequence's are not the really unrealistic bit, that comes with the human relationships. During the final fight, Scott finally casually admits ""I cheated on both of you. I'm really sorry...so are we all good?"" And they are! So he gets to screw over everyone and get his sappy ending. Wait, I thought this was supposed to be a feel good movie? In conclusion I found the movie and especially the ending disappointing.

There is just no point to the story, and it was in no way memorable. The acting was also terrible, as no one was convincing as their character. Perhaps it's just that I find a stupid movie made to look like a comic book (a comic book I would never read)uninteresting. To me, this movie is a lot like Kick Ass, another terrible movie, and adding a ""boy meets girl"" over tone.

Reportedly, his expression doesn't alter at all during the whole scene, and all that comes out is... wood chips.<br/><br/>So, no, not a fan. Wright does all his usual jump-cut trickery, and finally with a budget to match his vision. Normally that would give a film a score close to fifty out of ten. Unfortunately, compressing the already trite source material down to under 2 hours minutes knocks off a couple of points, and then Michael Cera is a solid 300 point ding.<br/><br/>Scott - and there's a slacker hipster emo douche name right off the bat - is a slacker hipster emo douche, let's be clear on that. Note carefully that the Pilgrim fans denying that are all slackers, hipsters, emos and/or douches. So there's your market, right there. <br/><br/>Since he's that particular sort of 22 year old just-getting-creepy slacker hipster emo douche who nails hot high school girls, that takes high school slacker hipster emo douches out of the picture. God damn 22 year old slacker hipster emo douches, stealing our girls.<br/><br/>And since slacker hipster emo douche over 22 can't nail high school girls without getting 10 to 15 in Federal, that's another slice out of the potential market.<br/><br/>So, this is a film for 22 year old slacker hipster emo douches. The kind of 22 year old slacker hipster emo douche who play 25 year old 8 bit games. In short, this is a film that will actually have to ""find"" its target audience by growing them in a vat. Should have spent some of the $120 million production and marketing budget on that, Universal.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, there are only two things that you need to know about Scott Pilgrim: one, Michael Cera gets punched in the face.

","This movie was awesome for the first 30 minutes. Then it just got really boring and I was actually waiting for it to be over. I do like the whole comic book/ video game idea. That was awesome. The music was really good too.<br/><br/>Now for the bad stuff. The chick has SEVEN ex boyfriends. SEVEN. By the third fight with the ex, I was dreading having to sit through 4 more fights. Also, the two main characters had a weird chemistry. I get that shes his dream girl but they make a horrible couple and I could never see them together in real life. I kept wishing he would stay with Knives.<br/><br/>Ramona's character was very under-developed and her acting was pretty bad. She had the same ""I feel sorry for you because I'm too good for you"" look on her face throughout the entire film. She had no personality and the only thing she had going for her was the hair.<br/><br/>Lastly, the plot made no sense at the end. Why did she go back with her Ex? They made her out to be weak and indecisive. She was being portrayed as this girl who was controlled by her ex-boyfriend and had absolutely no say in the matter. Kind of degrading towards women in my opinion. She turned into some kind of slave without a brain. Is that how women should be portrayed?"
"iamaspacecoyote","4","55","127","16 August 2010"," Lots of ""Look at me!"" not enough content
","The unique video game style of the movie was intriguing; however, the total lack of chemistry between the main characters made the story line rather unbelievable at times. Michael Cera had more chemistry with Kieran Culkin than with Mary Elizabeth Winsted. I hope that isn't what love looks like otherwise, I guess its not all its cracked up to be. Michael Cera plays the same geeky gangly hero that he has been typecast into for what looks like the rest of his young adult life. The music is original and great, and Alison Pill and Kieran Culkin both provide great moments of their own. Unfortunately, like Scott Pilgrim, this move never gets past second base..."

Originally he just wants to get some action from her but when that doesn't work he says maybe I'm in love with her. After that she gives him a chance. The only condition is he has to fight her ex boyfriends.<br/><br/>The ex boyfriends are by far more entertaining than Michael Cera is. Michael Cera is like a walking, talking stick. He plays the same role he always does.<br/><br/>There aren't many action scenes and the only good action scene is the one where they're on some scaffolding on Mount Rushmore. That was pretty cool.<br/><br/>That was really the only part I liked, aside from the females in the movie. If you really want to see this, I'd wait for the Blu-Ray."

","Im going to keep it short and get straight to the point. This movie is not for everyone, the younger crowd of teenagers will probably enjoy this film for all the flashy animated scenes and references a lot more as apposed to a 40 year old, who wont completely understand the comic book style setting, and think of it as childish. In the same breath this movie cannot be mistaken for an animated style children's movie. There are some openly gay sexually related references that don't seem to fit into the over all bigger picture at all. The movie jumps around quite a bit not really knowing what age group its trying to target. Often i'd find myself thinking i'm watching a movie that would appeal only to a 14 year old girl, and at other times i would feel like the movie just isn't appropriate for the younger crowd at all. The film doesn't seem to have much of a lasting appeal and no message that its trying to convey. The whole movie is built up on many quirky one liners and the characters don't really seem to fit there role. I've never seen so many woman chase after a bunch of nerds in the fashion that this movie portrays. It almost feels like they were the ones who wrote the script, and if you're not a comic book fanatic, you might not enjoy this movie as much as what you would have hoped. the only good aspect of this movie would be pretty, flashy camera work. Other than that this movie is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who made it through high school. The movie just tries too hard to be ""cool"". If you're looking for a good story, lasting appeal and clever script, give this one a miss."

Character development is non-existent as I've previously noted and the whole setting is far far away from reality.<br/><br/>Video games themselves (their 8-bit style is heavily featured here) have been moving away from this type of presentation and more into reality and SPvtW perfectly sows us why - many video games right now are more thoughtful, engaging and a better representation of art than this movie.

","Scott Pilgrim vs the world is such a boring film. This is from the guy who directed Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead? *shakes head*. If you've seen the trailer you don't need me to explain the premise, but suffice to say Michael Cera is a terrible actor. He's not funny in this movie, he looks like he doesn't care about anything that's going on, and we have no reason to care about him or his plight.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much 100% eye candy. There's a good use of sound, and despite the fact I grew up during the height of the 8-bit gaming era, I felt a strong disconnect with this film. I mean what reason do we have to be interested in this film? The Evil Ex's are kind of interesting but their screen time is fairly minimal. <br/><br/>The protagonist is a jerk, and frankly the most interesting character in this film is Scott Pilgrim's gay roommate(Portrayed by Kieran Culkin). Even as a Gamer this movie was bland and uninteresting to say the least. Seriously, the fight scenes were pretty, but when I can say the fight scenes in Matrix Reloaded look better, something is terribly wrong.<br/><br/>Yeah, the visuals are cool, but even with those visuals this movie is still lame. It's really a marathon and really hard to sit through.

This is cutesy, precious, look-at-me filmmaking at its worst! The humor is sophomoric. Just putting up silly graphics every two seconds doesn't mean that the content of the graphics is remotely funny. It's like the writers saw the first ten minutes of ""Fight Club"" and thought if they added a bunch of bells and whistles, that would be extremely clever. It's not.

When I saw an average of 8 stars I immediately grabbed the Bluray thinking it would be great. Unfortunately, as I sat through the show I kept wondering how Pilgrim got such high marks; it's an OK flick but nothing to get excited. I suspect the producers paid people to write positive reviews on IMDb and other boards to improve DVD sales. <br/><br/>This film would have been innovative if done 10 or 15 years ago, but today it's bit too late. For the Scott Pilgrim comics books aficionados maybe this is a great movie but for the rest of us it does not impress much. <br/><br/>The story is a bit flat; it's about a guy who must kill the exes of the girl he is dating. The killing happens in a video game fantasy world that is set in reality. That's it! Video game arcade world is so passé! The movie takes a bit from several films of the genre like The Matrix, Hero, etc, it' a melting pot of ideas that other movies rendered with much better results and inspiration. There is nothing profound to be discovered here and apart from the few funny moments, it's insufficient reason to justify renting that movie. <br/><br/>'Kick-Ass', similar in style and genre, is a much better and funnier movie than Pilgrim, a pale imitation of the genre. <br/><br/>For this one, one can wait for it to play on TV."

"Quinoa1984","10","30","66","12 August 2010"," 7,000,000 points for this movie: comic KO!
","Edgar Wright just keeps getting better as a director, and his latest offering after the good Shaun of the Dead and better Hot Fuzz is a kind of super-speed-surrealist take on young love and imagined video-game battles. It's a geek-storm of comedy, the kind of effort that we don't get too often in movies that are dictated down by committee and tested so much for laugh ratios. There are so many things that go on in a scene in this film that some of it will pass by your head. Or maybe not; maybe it's just the right tone for a combo platter of comic-book/anime/manga/8-bit-to-PS3-video-game movie that knows itself and knows its intended audience so well that it can be so POP in its sensibility. This is a super-comedy, suffused in melodramatic romance and fiery action, for people who still wonder what it's like to be surprised at the movies.<br/><br/>I wish I could contain my enthusiasm for the movie enough, but it's hard to do. Wright pulls off such a high-wire act, the likes of which take me back several years ago to Kill Bill Vol. 1, or to comedy masters like Mel Brooks. The filmmaker just *gets* it, how to pull off material that is nothing too new but with an original eye and perspective for what's funny. And in this story- of Scott Pilgrim, a ""hipster"" with a band (of course) dating a 17 year-old Catholic high school Asian girl named Knives (of course) and who falls for another hipster girl, Ramona Flowers (beautiful Mary Winstead) who dyes her hair every several days and has seven (give or take one or two) evil ex- boyfriends (and a girlfriend) to fight to the death- the intensity and energy goes hand-in-OMFG-hand with the subject matter. <br/><br/>But what's even more impressive, as it was also with Hot Fuzz, is how much affection Wright really has for not just his source material, but how people who dig the culture and nature of it so much. He clearly does enjoy what's hip in music, video games, clothes, hair, action movies and kung-fu fights, but also knows how to satirize it until it bleeds its own blood. And boy does he get some juicy satire here, always in the name of good fun and, indeed, some melodrama. As Scott (Michael Cera in a kind of amalgam of his on-screen persona to a perfect nth degree) goes through these evil ex's, each with their own ""quirks"" and super-powers, such as one being an egotistical movie-star jerk and mega- Vegan (Chris Evans and Brandon Routh respectively, also both brilliant), we see how his character does go through an arc, that it's not all just fun and games. If a video game like No More Heroes took the perfectly- confused love tale of (500) Days of Summer, it might look like this... kinda.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is that for everything that is familiar, even down to the coins doing their EXPLOSION on the ground after a baddie dies, or how rock bands awesomely suck so much that they become awesome again, this is shot and scored and performed like nothing else you've seen this year, or most years. Wright keeps throwing things at the audience, and knows (or hopes) they'll keep up. At the same time it never bores with its (::I snap fingers::) rhythm, and, and if a joke doesn't fly to the sky it still gives some chuckles or belly laughs. Lines are instantly quotable, and one can't wait to tell friends and others about this character or this shot or punch, or how Jason Schwartzman reacts when he swallows his gum. It's a radioactive treasure trove of romantic comedy, blazing action, random beats, well-timed reactions and physical gestures, awkward longing, and lots of kick-ass rock songs. <br/><br/>In other words, if you dig it, it will be the cult movie of your time. If not... move along, or FIGHT in the arena! A+"
"camelslayer","2","26","56","24 January 2011"," Utter Crap.
","By far one of the stupidest movies I've seen in a long time. This mess of a movie is an attempt at blending a video game with anime-style combat, a comic book and a movie in an unusual blunder to be funny. It completely fails. Even after watching about half of the movie I was still bored.<br/><br/>Although the trailers did make the movie look epic, it is anything but superb. Since ""dorks"" and/or ""nerds"" are now the new ""cool"" on the block, someone decided to pull this pointless acid trip out of their behind. The movie is filled with stupid effects, such as a pee meter, points that are scored whenever Scott hits or kills someone, and even picks up a 1-Up at some point in the movie. The stupid game clichés were incredibly predictable, as I waited patiently for a health meter to appear. It did.<br/><br/>Aside from the utterly pointless effects, the characters seem completely shallow and the story is utter trash. The entire story basically implies that it is okay to cheat on your girlfriend with another girl that you find physically attractive, and that the person you hurt will simply forgive you of your sins. Any impressionable child that watches this will definitely be in for a rude awakening later in their lifetime. The part that aggravated me the most was that one of the evil exes was a vegan, making me feel like they were implying that anyone who does not eat meat is a monster (I'm not a vegan, but it could still be very offensive to some.) This waste of money will most likely not keep the attention of anyone over the age of 35. I'm 18 going on 19 and it barely kept my attention. And I play video games for heaven's sake. I laughed a couple of times, but probably no more than three times. If you are easy to please with movies, then go ahead and watch it. Otherwise, pass it up. It isn't worth it."

The ""tweeness"" of all things will now be measured on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 = Lawrence Tierney and 10 = Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. If ""twee"" were Christianity, this movie would be Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22 year old feeb who's sponging a place to live off his gay friend Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and platonically dating a sheltered 17 year old girl named Knives Chao (Ellen Wong). He also has a sister (Anna Kendrick) who really doesn't need to be in this story. Oh, and Scott spastically plays the bass in a band alongside a lead singer (Mark Webber) desperate to make it big and a drummer (Alison Pill) that's like a caricature of the Janeane Garofalo role in Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.<br/><br/>That's an lot of set-up for a simple yet fantastical plot. Scott meets the woman of his dreams (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and, despite Scott being the Sarlacc Pit of pathetic nebishness, she likes him. In order to date her, Scott must defeat her 7 evil exes in a series of video game/comic book battles royale.<br/><br/>This is the sort of movie that when a phone rings, the word ""RING"" appears on screen. It's the sort of movie that starts imitating an episode of Seinfeld for no reason. It's the sort of movie that constantly references a subplot for the first half of the film, but that subplot turns out to have absolutely nothing to do with the resolution of the story, like a Return of the Jedi where all references to Darth Vader being Luke's father were removed from the last half hour or a Godfather II where Fredo doesn't get killed.<br/><br/>Now, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is extremely well executed, visually creative and occasionally funny. But because there's no unifying theme to its elements of fantasy and because the main character just treads water until an epiphany is forced on him by the script, watching this film is like looking at a merry-go-round. It's fast and colorful but you just get tired of it after a while.<br/><br/>One definition of ""twee"" is ""something meant to be ironically cute where all the irony has been removed"". That's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. There's a self-conscious, unwarranted and unearned distance that's woven through it. The viewer isn't supposed to identify with Scott. You're supposed to self-awarely recognize that you're meant to identify with him. You're supposed to self-awarely recognize that you're meant to nostalgically respond to the film's invocation of 1990s video games. But nothing is ever done with that distance. It's only there to make the people who made the movie and the people watching the movie feel smarter and more sophisticated than they really are.<br/><br/>And that's really twee."

","I really enjoyed Scott Pilgrim vs.The World, and consider it one of my favourites of the year if not the best. The film is shot in a unique way and looks wonderful and the music is cool with lots of energy. Edgar Wright does a superb job directing the film, the film is filled with humour and good humour at that, it goes at a cracking pace and is compelling throughout and the characters are appealing. The acting is great, Michael Cera gives one of his better performances(only his performance on the brilliant sit-com Arrested Development is better in my opinion) and he is well supported by some very talented co-stars.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie and one of my personal favourites of its year so far. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

At the same time my daughter who wanted to watch this movie told me after she made me set through the entire movie that the movie wasn't very good.

When you have a bunch of special effect thrown into the mix you get this movie.<br/><br/>Every plot device is either predictable or silly. Predictable being the chip on the back of Ramona's neck. Silly being the whole ordeal with the vegan police. Most of the characters are entirely hate-able, even Scott is a bore. Even the soundtrack is terrible. What are these hipster kids listening to?! If i could watch two creatures being created by musical instruments fighting to actual good music, that'd be splendid. Sadly that scene was ruined.<br/><br/>Thankfully the action sequences are sometimes really enjoyable, but that's the only good thing to be said about this film.

But overall it is not the kind of movie I enjoy.<br/><br/>Michael Cera is Scott Pilgrim, musician wanna-bee, and mostly a social misfit.

Thankfully this movie shoryuken's that out of theatre and from the 8 bit universal logo and music you are thrust into a sea of references memorable quotes and the most well shot and choreographed fight scenes in recent memory. Unfortuantly though many people will dismiss this movie and go see a unoriginal and gimmicky movie because it is the safer option. many people have said that the film is only appealing to one demographic.

","Honestly, when I saw the trailer for this movie in the cinema a long time ago, I really wanted to go see it, but its release coincided with a family holiday, so I had to wait and eventually forgot about the movie. Some months later(obviously) it came out on DVD and I decided to watch it with my girlfriend who was also quite excited.<br/><br/>All I can say is that we were so disappointed that after around 20-30 minutes we switched it off and watched something else.<br/><br/>For starters I'm a nerd, I love video games and Nintendo but the constant references were just dull and repetitive. It was far too over the top. The characters were also dull and their one liners were as punchy as a pacifist. The story was linear I felt that it should have lasted literally the 20-30minutes of my viewing.<br/><br/>The main reason I didn't like the movie was that Scott Pilgrim was a jerk. I mean how can you empathise with a character who cheats on his girlfriend? And thinks it's OK? And then carries on like nothing happened? <br/><br/>One more thing, how can a weedy nerd with no training beat up anyone especially 'evil' people who seem fairly tough? He's a weedy loser.<br/><br/>My advice, if you're between the ages of 12 and 17, you might (not definitely will) enjoy this movie because it has a lot of references to retro stuff that means nothing to you, 'cool' indie music and random untied extra garbage. If you're 18+ and genuinely like this movie, I literally have no idea why."
"Naenae72","8","37","88","23 July 2010"," Movie vs. Graph Novel
","The Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series is a great mix of comedy, romance, science fiction and fantasy. I was fortunate enough to see a screening of the film at San Diego Comic Con. <br/><br/>I am also a huge fan of Edgar Wright. His vision of the film turned an epic genre mash up into a big screen video game. It was fun to watch but a poor substitute for the books. The jokes were there and the action was EXTREMELY there. A few illustrations were even there. <br/><br/>Wright did his best to include as much of the books into the film, instead of skipping over smaller details the way other book-films do. It was refreshing to see this but it hurt the movie. The film felt rushed and the characters lacked arc. I give Wright props for not trying to turn SP into another comic book sequel ruining genre but if the film was split in two the characters would feel real the way they did in the books. <br/><br/>Ultimately the film is a fun summer action comedy. If you're a fan of the books you won't hate it but you won't love it. And if you're a fan of Edgar Wright you'll probably call it your least favorite Wright."

Michael Cera doesn't seem like a bad kid and has achieved a kind of cult status from his film and television work but as Scott Pilgrim he's lazy and whiny to the point of being unlikeable.

","I am reviewing this title because I want to ply devil's advocate to the other reviews which give it such high praise. Have you ever seen a movie (like a bad 80's film) and thought ""Wow, that's so out of date"". Well in four years, you will look back on Scott Pilgrim and probably say something like it. The movie is so rooted in the now, that it in my opinion will not fare well next to classic pieces of cinema. Now, do not get me wrong, it was entertaining but it lacked depth and staying power in my opinion. I see it as gimmicky and all too flashy. When the smoke clears I think it will be a kitschy movie at best. So, if you want to spend some time watching pretty flashy colors and laughing at cute video game jokes, rent or buy this movie. Looking for an experience? Grab a copy of Big Trouble in Little China or an Indiana Jones movie or heck, Lawrence of Arabia. Sorry for the negativity but I got to add my two cents."
"borriss-p","4","10","19","24 September 2012"," Too much special effects and a poor plot don't work well together.
","Let me begin by stating that I don't know if Scott Pilgrim vs the World is either unique or weird. Probably both. Fact is, while watching it, I wasn't very entertained. See, I believe that if a movie has an interesting plot, deep and likable characters and witty dialog, it can get away with not having top-notch special effects. My main problem with Scott Pilgrim vs the World is that it fails in these three important aspects. As I watched the movie, all I got was special effects, and special effects, and more special effects. While these wouldn't have bothered me if the movie was good plot-wise, this is not the case.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera), a slightly nerdy guy in his early twenties who is dating a girl in high school, Knives Chau(Ellen Wong). While everything was good at first, he starts to feel like she's too childish sometimes, and feels unhappy with his relationship. Then, he has a weird dream about a woman with purple hair, Ramona Flowers(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), whom he later meets at a party. They eventually start dating, and Scott finds out that in order to continue going out with Ramona, he must defeat her seven evil exes. Yes, seven evil exes, you read that right. Now, my main problem with the plot is how little importance they give to it, since after all of this has been explained the plot feels like an excuse to show off special effects in colorful fights. The fights itself are okay at first, but start to get repetitive after a while. It usually consists of Scott getting kicked around the area, then finding a miraculous way to save himself and win. Even with all the special effects, I eventually got bored of watching Scott go through brick walls and beating his enemies in the stupidest way possible(remember the words ""vegan police"").<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me were the characters. While I liked Cera in movies like Superbad and Juno, his character here wasn't very likable, and often came off as annoying. Also, I didn't believe the chemistry between Scott and Ramona until the very end of the movie, it just felt unrealistic. And, yes, even though this isn't supposed to be a realistic movie, if I don't buy the interaction between the two main characters, then how am I supposed to enjoy the fights when I don't understand what they're fighting for? There's one character, Scott's sister Stacey(Anna Kendrick), that is completely useless. If she wasn't in the film, nobody would notice, and I assume they left her in for ""comic relief"". The only REAL comedy(and props to the actor)comes with Scott's gay roommate, Wallace(Kieran Culkin), who uses dry humor to entertain.<br/><br/>If I had to highlight the best part of Scott Pilgrim vs the World, it would be the quality of the effects. It's not like I'm changing my opinion all of a sudden, I never complained about their quality, I complained about their usage in the movie. Sin City, another movie based on a graphic novel(although much darker), managed to keep the visual flair inspired from the comics and added an excellent narrative to keep the viewer interested. Scott Pilgrim vs the World has the visual flair but has no narrative to keep us from leaving our seats.<br/><br/>I remember the days where all you needed was a good script to make an excellent movie(Pulp Fiction! Yay!), even if I wasn't even born at that time. Scott Pilgrim vs the World suffers from the now common disease of ""many special effects equals good movie"". It's colorful yet bland. It's annoying when it should be fun. Still, Scott Pilgrim vs the World isn't an awful movie, and I'm sure there are many people out there who think it's some sort of masterpiece, but if you're like me and enjoy good narrative over special effects, then you likely won't enjoy this movie."

","My nerd credentials are reasonably high—I have a comic book collection; I go to movie conventions; I possess one or two T-shirts bearing pop culture slogans and graphics; and I obsessively review cult films on IMDb—but I'm still nowhere near qualified enough to connect with Scott Pilgrim vs The World, a film that proudly enters the realm of the über-nerd, a plane of existence where Manga is king, Japanese vinyl toys are objects of desire, retro video games are cool, web programmers are gods, and designing and building your own PC is the mark of a true man.<br/><br/>The hero of this film is a pale, scrawny wimp, the kind of guy whose awkward appearance would normally condemn him to a lifetime of self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. In director Edgar Wright's nerd-centric universe, however, Scott Pilgrim is an aspirational figure: his entire existence is played out in video game/graphic-novel mode, with FX lettering and motion lines accompanying his every move; he's a bass player in a rock band; he possesses awesome fighting skills; and seriously cute/smoking hot girls find him irresistible (he even dates the gorgeous Mary Elisabeth Winstead—talk about punching above your weight!!!). In short, he is the ultimate geek icon.<br/><br/>For those who closely identify with the guys in The Big Bang Theory, this film is going to be the stuff of dreams, the ultimate fantasy come true, thus earning itself a dedicated fan-base; in time, it might even make its money back from the lucrative 'dweeb dollar'. But to anyone who has even the vaguest semblance of a life within the real world, it's endless geek subculture references, heavily stylised and often surreal action, incessant use of game-speak, and elevation of obnoxious loser to hero status will seriously grate on the nerves."

","This film has a really spectacular supporting cast and what would have been a great premise IF it had been built around a better actor. I doubt even readers of the comic imagined the weedy, sunken-chested, round-shouldered, soprano-voiced Michael Cera as Scott (except possibly in their nightmares). <br/><br/>Honestly, what was Edgar Wright thinking? Cera is the vacuous center around which this film careens and I don't think that was the intention. He's eclipsed by Kieran Culkin (who obviously intends to be Robert Downey Jr.'s successor in acerbically droll performances), Anna Kendrick and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (who looks as if she could crush Cera). A shame, because with a strong lead this could have been a great film, one which actually made money."

","To be frank, a bad film <br/><br/>I am not entirely sure, why people liked this film? Maybe, I am just stupid and did not get it. That is probably the case. However, I just do not see any point of liking it. The reason I endured the film till the end is partly by the somewhat enjoyable cast and some fast moving story telling. Still, I do not see the point of the fights and most likely than not, I must have missed something. Michael Cera is making a career of roles like these and is fast becoming a cliché. While the whole cast of actors are enjoyable to watch, I just do not seem to be able to get into the film and have fun. Is it just me? <br/><br/>All in all, Scott Pilgrim is at its core a comic book film. Not that I read the comics, which probably answers my question as to why I did not like or get it. However, it must be said that some use of computer games effects are fun to watch. Still, a good gimmick or two does not justify me wasting a good 90 minutes. With all the rave and good reviews churning out all over the net, I even contemplated watching it in the cinemas. Now after the DVD venture, I am more than happy to declare that I didn't.

"montera_iulian","6","10","19","30 October 2010"," Visually great and innovative but boring as overall entertainment...
","Is this movie overrated? Hell Yeah (Kbowww). Scott Pilgrim vs. The World follows the story of ... Scott (Michael Cera), a typical nerd that lacks presence in society and doesn't know how to really connect with people. After a break-up (here's the cliché) he falls under a rock and has a hard time finding himself. Being part of a band he tries to gain success and with that probably the notoriety and his personal revenge on his own frustrations. Things get complicated when he meets this girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) which is a hippie copy-cat of Clementine from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, at least that's who she reminded me of. ""Of course"" in order for Scott to get more dates from her he needs to defeat the League of Ex-es which contains all her 7 (seven) ex-es. The story is pretty much you know, the typical clicheic, nerdy type of storytelling, which really gets me bored at times. Some scenes succeed to be funny but many of them just fail. The dialogue is pretty good but I just felt it dragged on nothing at times. Some lines were there just to add a couple of useless minutes. What I found attractive in this movie was the editing and the visual effects which were amazing done. Obviously a lot of passion had been put in the visual aspect of this movie and all this gaming influences really did work on me and for that I will not bash this movie as being a failure but there's nothing there, not even the visuals, that could handle the important gasps in the script.<br/><br/>Besides the dully and cheesy narrative aspect of the movie, the casting of Michael Cera was kind of obvious since he's the guy that always gets chosen to play the nerd/virgin guy and I did not got thrilled about it. You know why? Because I'm tired of Cera being the same guy in every movie. It's just boring to me and I don't get all the hype behind this Cera guy. He only portrays the same character over and over again. Few movies that I have watched had a slight different Cera but in 90% of them he's just the same and that to me is boring and old. Nothing new or fresh to keep me interested in him as an actor. If this would have been one of Cera's first movies then I would have probably liked his impersonation but since it's not... I just felt I was being cheated. Everything else was on point but just above average...<br/><br/>The technical aspect was I think the best part of this movie. Cinematography, editing and visual effects, all, were handled well and delivered a bad story in a great way and for that you must give credit for the passion they've put in the visual style of the movie. With all that though I don't recommend Scott Pilgrim vs. The World as a good movie because to me it isn't... It's just a movie you could see if you're a Cera fan or you didn't saw too many Cera movies... It's not that much fun neither interesting enough... People who compare this to Kick-Ass make me laugh but then again... it's just my personal opinion... This is just a visually great and innovative but boring as overall entertainment..."

","Top 2 being the Bill & Ted movies.<br/><br/>Thinking about the forty minutes of life and oxygen I wasted watching this film is truly depressing. I can't even begin to describe the sheer awfulness of this movie.<br/><br/>For starters, it is full of clichés, unnecessary lines that don't make any sense and annoyingly, plenty of product placement for Nintendo. I kid you not - SPVTW is more like a badly written and drawn out Nintendo ad. <br/><br/>All of the characters are irritating, stereotypical and lacking in substance. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a whiny, freaky little nerd who just happens to know enough martial arts to kick the living daylights out of the 'seven evil exes', all of whom, I may add, have super-powers. There is no indication that he is capable of self-defence (HE IS A LOSER FOR GOD'S SAKE) and no explanation as to where he learnt it. The revealing of this is, for lack of a better word, completely random. His character also sends out a terrible message to society: cheat on your girlfriend and it doesn't matter because apparently, you have found your 'one true love' (after like, one date and having met twice).<br/><br/>Then there's the issue of Scott's high school girlfriend. Knives Chao is a screechy, annoying girl who does nothing but squeal throughout most of the film as well as having been cast as an extremely unfunny Asian stereotype. His ex and the drummer in his band, Kim, is no better and throws in more unfunny one-liners with an expression less lively than one you would find on a corpse. And Ramona? Typical, broody, 'I'm-so-deep-and-misunderstood' rock-chick who has absolutely no personality and bad hair.<br/><br/>Aside the crap characters, there's the storyline (or lack thereof). The film does not flow at all - there is absolutely no build-up to any of the main events which leaves the audience lost as to just what the heck is going on. Then of course you have the cheesy, terribly done fight scenes which have been shot in a 'comic book' style. When these strange fights are occurring (I mean fireballs, kung fu, flying around, baddies turning into COINS at the end, the works!), no one seems perturbed in the slightest. Other cast members and characters do not even react - not so much as a ""what the heck was that?"" which further makes the storyline completely unbelievable, unrealistic and nonsensical.<br/><br/>I don't understand how anyone, who is not a 14-year-old gaming nerd, could have rated this above a one. Truly DIRE!"

I am a big video game fan, grew up in the 80s, so I know all that beat-em-up stuff going on. But the movie just made no sense.<br/><br/>Of course, one might say that this kind of movie should not need to make sense. But I disagree. I admit, I never read the comic, so I did not know the story. But from seeing the trailers, I was expecting it have the basic premise that the evil exes were all DEAD. Right. That's why they are evil, because they come back from the dead to hunt down anyone trying to date Ramona. Now to me, THAT would make sense. Yes, it would be total fantasy and supernatural, but it would make sense.<br/><br/>Scott would be out somewhere with Ramona, and suddenly BOOM, one of the evil ex ghosts show up out of nowhere, ready to fight him. Much like the first evil ex in the film, who just appeared out of thin air.<br/><br/>But the whole fact that they were just ""regular guys"", meaning living people, made it all the more senseless. Like that Vegan guy, he made zero sense at all.<br/><br/>If you want to make fantasy, at least put the supernatural element there to make it ""realistic"" so to say. I would have accepted an evil ghost with superpowers showing up, but a guy who has powers because he's vegan? Come on man.<br/><br/>Disappointed :("

","This is the most fun I've had at the movies for a while. I believe is it because it is inventive in several ways and the inventiveness is coherent through the thing and across the narrative pathways (cinematic effects, narrative rhythm, character reactions). It is not difficult to push the envelope in any one of these, in fact I see it done even accidentally because film conventions form such narrow roads.<br/><br/>But it seems difficult as getout to control it well enough that it emanates from a coherent world, to make a long form project that lives in the inventiveness rather than just sees it from time to time. Much of this is credited to the filmmaker, and how he can focus his team. Since there is very little motion capture, the effects did not have to be planned in advance and I imagine there was a lot of tinkering.<br/><br/>Some of the credit has to go to the source, which I understand is a comic. I have not seen it but I imagine the overall shape was set and refined there. <br/><br/>But we have to give the key actor credit too. He has to understand the cosmology of the thing well enough to convincingly inhabit it. This is a difficult acting challenge. Remember Bill Murray? It was his gift I believe to anticipate the finished tone of the film and place himself square within it. ""Groundhog Day"" depended on us seeing that it made sense to him.<br/><br/>I have to admit to a generational deficiency that made this even better for me. The girls were unattractive, excepting the redhead drummer who is shunted to buddy status. They were emotionally damaged, intellectual nitwits and not physically desirable. In the story of course, they are all a guy lives for, literally. I am imagining that it made sense to the young audience that these trivial beings mattered. But for me, it increased the weirdness and otherworldliness of the thing.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","This much anticipated flick was definitely not all it was cracked up to be. After hearing rave reviews from indie rockers and Scott Pilgrim graphic novel fans, I thought I was going to see one seriously awesome film. I was wrong. The acting was far below par, although kept along the lines of Michael Cera's awkward underdog preferred character. The supposedly comedic lines were delivered poorly, falling flatly amidst the silent audience; I'll admit it had its small moments, however. Some were even audible ""ha"" worthy. Those moments were far and few between. I really wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone out of their teens that isn't heavily (and I mean HEAVILY) submerged into indie culture or does not have a tolerance for completely nonsensical films. It was truly ridiculous, with a bland plot line and bad acting. I wouldn't waste my time watching it for a second time, or spending any money on related products, such as the novels themselves. If they're anything like what the movie was, I am so not interested."
"harry-austin","4","9","17","2 July 2011"," Childish and Predictable
","'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.' In the past five or so years a string of films have been created that have been inspired by the growing popularity of graphic novels. 'Watchmen', 'Sin City' and 'Kick-Ass' to name a few successful ones, but for me 'Scott Pilgrim' has to be one of the most irritating pieces of cinema I have ever watched.<br/><br/>First of all, the film has tried far too hard to appear to literally be like watching a comic scroll across the screen. The screen is often cut in sections to show windows of animation, while the use of onomatopoeia as a part of this wears thin. It is a nice idea, and can make things a lot more light-hearted, as it was effectively used throughout the 'Batman and Robin' series with Adam West. But in 'Scott Pilgrim' it is used probably at least once a minute. This is a film! Not a comic, or a television show. One of the main parts of watching a film is also to enjoy the sound effects throughout, we do not need it to be spelled out constantly for us!<br/><br/>And now to what I found to be the most awful part of the film. Michael Cera. His voice is listening to a cat that is being run over a a steam roller. A horrible whiny moan, it really drills into your skull as the film progresses. I always thought that there was a fairly wide selection of young actors at the moment - so why choose the worst?<br/><br/>Admittedly, the film has probably a couple of laugh out loud moments, but not many. Too few for a comedy. Perhaps I have mistaken the viewing age, and maybe it has been aimed at younger teens, or maybe the new 'tween' generation who seem to have some bizarre love for skinny boys with odd haircuts. And maybe that is why this film has become popular, despite it not being especially viewable."

","Would be more entertaining. I've been reading the other reviews on here and I just can't understand for the life of me how this movie ranks at almost an 8/10. Yes, I realize people view graphic novels as capable delivery devices for quality literature. That doesn't warrant a 2 hour plot that jerks to each cutscene like some guy tripping on acid, waits to deliver any sort of message till the last half hour, then flip flops back and forth about 5 times right at the very end trying to appease everyone in the audience. Combine that with preteen concepts and daydreams of love & fighting and this whole thing was like The Wonder Years in a video game played by someone with severe ADD. This is by far not the masterpiece people made it out to be.<br/><br/>I won't lie, there were some funny bits just from the sheer nature of having the characters say random things for the entire 2 hours but there was nothing that even came close to the applause this movie has received. Originally, I wasn't going to watch this at all based on the trailer but I kept hearing good things so I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>Bottom line <br/><br/>The Good: Funny bits, decent fight choreography, interesting cinematography choices integrating the comic book/video game world with reality, hot Asian chick <br/><br/>The Bad: Extremely immature love story, random main character, laughable plot, terrible scene transition <br/><br/>4/10, I recommend not seeing it to begin with but if you do make sure you do so with someone who gave this film an 8 so you can ask them to point out exactly what they were thinking"

","After watched the film, I seem to know why I have no interest in video games at all, I would rather waste my time on anything else. The truth is that I had enjoyed director Edgar Wright's previous films HOT FUZZ (2007) and SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) (both starred with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost). <br/><br/>Love it or hate it, it's a film eyeing for the geeky culture and the generation of video games, I stand firmly in the opposite of it as I find it tedious (seven ex-bfs? why we have to watch Michael Cera's ass being kissed multiple times and then he stroke back to knock over his stronger opponents by some gratuitous trickeries?). <br/><br/>Is there anything recommendable I could squeeze? The special effects are dazzling, some dialogues are funny, but not tangible, the whole film is a big disappointment to me, no wonder it underperformed in the box office as well, as its direct target is indoor otaku, whom I am sure prefer staying at home playing video games rather than going to cinemas to watch someone else playing it. Maybe sales of the DVD market is the right strategy. <br/><br/>As for the cast, Michael Cera has been a symbol of man show geeks since JUNO (2007), so there is no real breakthrough here, Mary Elizabeth Winstead is way too cool for a comic role (yes, it just occurred to me the film is an adaption of a comic series), others are fine, not worth mentioning except it was glad to see poor Brandon Routh back in the business."

He makes awkward situations more awkward because he has no social skills. He complains and mopes, and complains some more about how life and doing stuff in life is ""hard."" <br/><br/>The plot is similar to that of just about any other Michael Cera movie.

"DonFishies","8","24","57","28 July 2010"," Edgar Wright's precious little movie
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-something slacker living in Toronto, who basically leeches off his friends. Despite being in a ""relationship"" with Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he keeps dreaming about another girl. He quickly finds out this dream girl, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), is actually quite real, and decides to pursue her. But before they can truly become the couple Scott hopes for, he has to defeat her seven evil exes.<br/><br/>I did not think it was possible, but Edgar Wright has fairly successfully brought Bryan Lee O'Malley's epic graphic novel series to the big screen in the most uniquely entertaining way possible. It is his first adapted work, but it feels every bit as fresh (I use that word very loosely) as Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz did upon their initial releases. It deviates from the books a bit (much like Matthew Vaughn's excellent adaptation of Kick-Ass earlier this year), but the majority of the film stays true to the series and gives the fans everything they might expect from a Scott Pilgrim film. Right after the film opening with an 8-bit Universal logo and score, you know you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>What propels Wright's epic and inspired vision is the editing style. All of the little idiosyncrasies, background/foreground items and ideas, everything that made O'Malley's books so revered in the graphic novel community are all in full force here. Some shots in the trailers suggest the comic book-style feel of the film, with the sounds of the actions appearing as words on-screen and the video game-related pop-ups appearing the same way they would in the game. But that is only the start. The entire film is filled with them, and with references to numerous pop culture entities (specifically video games), to the point that it looks and sounds like a ridiculously enhanced motion comic or game. Add to that the quick cuts and multiple panel style of the format, and you have the closest film representation of a comic since Robert Rodriguez attacked Frank Miller's Sin City.<br/><br/>Even with all the nods and references to the original work, Wright's film still feels very much his own work. He makes Scott Pilgrim's epic quest to defeat Ramona's exes into an understated work you will likely not see replicated too soon. After seeing Christopher Nolan's Inception just under a week ago, I did not think that mainstream Hollywood would release something so blazingly original and something so astonishly unique so close together. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is not nearly as strong a film as Nolan's masterpiece is, but Wright has clearly given it his all here. He has sidestepped away from following the lead of other comic book/graphic novel-style films, and has created something he can truly be proud of. The visuals on display are simply remarkable, and are worth the price of a ticket all on their own. The musical choices are even better. If you have seen the trailers, you are merely only getting a hint for what Wright has in store for you here.<br/><br/>If I do have an issue, it is that the film is a little too exposition-heavy in the first half, and way too jumpy in the second. It never loses its tone or its style, but it becomes all too blatantly obvious where the books stop and the deviation begins. The pacing here is also a touch off, and on further research, thoroughly suggests there is material missing or altered from the final cut of the film. I understand that Wright and his co-writer Michael Bacall wanted to set-up the story and where it plans on going for the few who venture into the film without having read a single issue, but there is too much detail given in those early scenes, and not enough to pivotal moments later in the film.<br/><br/>Another gripe, although it is one I hope will be less bothersome on repeat viewings, is that a good chunk of the characters feel incredibly underused. The books are stacked to the brim with an eclectic mix of supporting characters, who are present in the film, but they feel very stunted and get absolutely no development. Kim Pine (Alison Pill) is a very important character in the books, but she merely appears in the background here and delivers some of the best dialogue. Wallace Wells (the absolutely incredible scene-stealer Kieran Culkin) is the moral centre and source of an incredible amount of exposition, but he is barely in the film after the first half. Envy Adams (Brie Larson) almost feels like an extended cameo as opposed to an indispensible figure in Scott's character development. But then, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and especially Jason Schwartzman all deliver stunning performances as three of Ramona's exes, despite the lack of time on-screen.<br/><br/>Cera on the other hand, is perfect as Pilgrim. The character plays a little too close to his stereotypical neurotic and off-centre archetype, but it works out beautifully here. He makes the character real, and brings a depth to Scott Pilgrim that no other young actor could. He has the right look and the right sound down pat. It was a little weird to see him get so physical in some sequences, but this is a vintage fit for Cera. Although they are downplayed more than I liked, Winstead and Wong are great as Ramona and Knives. They both have a certain edge throughout the film, and even at its most ridiculous, deliver strong performances. It helps too that they have insanely good chemistry with Cera.<br/><br/>I jumped at the idea of an advanced screening of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and I do not regret seeing the film in the slightest. It is a bit of a niche movie, but it is one that is lovingly made through and through.<br/><br/>8/10.<br/><br/>(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."

","I will first state that I was a HUGE fan of the original books, having read them before I decided to see the movie. Unfortunately, the movie did not live up to the potential it could have; in my opinion.<br/><br/>The acting did not fit to the enthusiasm the books had, and there were many things that irked me about how the movie was cast. Like I said, it had the potential to be an amazing movie, and the acting was unenthusiastic.<br/><br/>The references were mashed in, unlike how they were in the books, and it was overwhelming. You were almost required to know all about a certain time period in video games, which ruins it for older (40-somethings) and younger (most teens) viewers. This is disappointing, because it would have had a lot more of a following if it had laid back a bit.<br/><br/>The music was delightful, if a little too indie. I understand that it was meant to be ""hipster music"" but it was laid on a little thick as well. Most of the references that were shown in the book were not conveyed as easily through the music, and there were many times where it just didn't work.<br/><br/>Finally, there was the matter of how much the time span was ruined. In the books it is stated that Scott and Ramona went out for quite a long time, I'm pretty sure at least 4-6 months, while in the movie it was only about a month. Considering there were 6 books, meanwhile one movie, I do understand that shortcuts had to be taken. Unfortunately, the first book was told in its entirety, taking up almost half the movie, while the rest were crammed in. Why not make it a series? It would have been delightful for the fans of the books.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if you find this irrelevant, but I feel as though this movie got far too much praise for how lacklustre it was to the fans of the books."

"MartinHafer","9","21","50","13 August 2010"," Wildly creative and fun...but probably NOT for all tastes...
","""Scott Pilgrim"" is one of the most creative, fresh and original films I have seen in ages, and because of that I was in absolute awe of the film. However, despite being a terrific film, I also understand that this is NOT a film that will appeal to everyone--in fact, it's probably one of the more polarizing films I have ever seen--you'll probably either love it or hate it. While I am NOT in the target demographic group (aged 15-30 and predisposed to loving graphic novels AND video games), I did enjoy it--and am probably the rare 40-something person who loved the film. What was different about me is that I am a geek (a definite plus), enjoy video games and have a rabid comic book fan for a daughter--so I understood many of the pop culture references throughout the film. But, if you are NOT a geek, hate video games and see graphic novels more as comic books, then the movie might be a chore to watch. Plus you might just feel ooky hanging out with geeks. Don't worry, they are almost all very nice people! <br/><br/>So what, other than originality, did I love about this film? Well, just about everything--and I seriously considered giving the film a 10--I liked it that much. Perhaps the best thing for me was casting of Michael Cera in the lead. Unlike the traditional super-hero, he is by far the geekiest and most likable main character I have seen. Seeing such a wimpy and unassuming guy become, out of no where, like a character from Mortal Combat was a wonderful juxtaposition--you just couldn't help but smile. And, despite his nerdy looks, he was winning as Scott Pilgram...and actually played the music his on-screen band played--now that's talent. Additionally, I loved the film's gentle sense of humor---I laughed harder at this film than any film I've seen in the theater in some time. I could try to describe these moments--you just need to see them for yourself. Odd references to games like DOA, Mortal Combat, Marvel Vs. Capcom and Zelda II were great--I caught on to those due to my own geeky background. And, my familiarity with anime/manga also made me laugh--as the hair, love for girls in school uniforms and style were often straight out of Japanese comics. And, I loved how the film made me love video games and was simply much, much more fun that the original ""Tron"" (which I always felt was too dry--perhaps the new version will correct this).<br/><br/>Clever, wonderful and strange, this film is the geek's dream come true...and not a film to be missed. However, if you aren't a geek or are perhaps too old to get the pop references, I say take along an interpreter--many comic book nerds and couch potatoes would be glad to go with you and help explain things...provided you pay for the tickets.<br/><br/>Among the nearly 9000 reviews I have now done on IMDb, this ranks in the hallowed ranks of a very small group of movies that transcended the pack due to its utter weirdness. It's surreal and weird--and I think this makes it very special. For other films that fall into this category, try ""The Happiness of the Katikuris"", ""Delicatessen"", ""Yes Nurse, No Nurse"", ""Tatie Danielle"" and ""Tampopo""--all truly unique, surreal and fabulous films."

","This film was a great disappointment. Although films starring Michael Cera do seem to target a certain demographic (ie, white middle-class Americans) I haven't seen one that contained so many racial stereotypes. You know, it seems like Hollywood directors have realized that making fun of African Americans gets them in a lot of hot water, but they've yet to learn the same lesson when it comes to mocking people of other races.<br/><br/>If you're from an Asian background get ready to be offended. The film starts off by portraying ex-boyfriend #1 as an effeminate South Asian man whose breaks out Bollywood dance moves while attacking Cera's character. Knives Chau, Pilgrim's 17 year-old ""Chinese girlfriend"" is a walking stereotype of a Japanese high school girl complete with high pitched squealing and fainting at rock concerts (the Chinese are NOT Japanese!) I found it extremely offensive when Pilgrim assures his friends and family that his new girlfriend, Ramona Flowers, is ""American"". Apparently it's not enough to be born in the United States and speak English as a native language. Apparently you're never an ""American"" as long as you're not white (no, African Americans don't count). Thanks Mr. Wright, for reminding me that movies targeting middle-class white Americans are not made for ""ethnic"" people like me. This movie was so chock full of racism that I just walked out of the theater disgusted and swore off your films forever. I truly loved ""Shaun of the Dead"" and rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I am so disappointed in ""Scott Pilgrim""!!<br/><br/>To any white person thinking that this Asian person lacks a sense of humor just remember that some of your ancestors unfortunately thought minstrel shows were funny too and that black people just ""lacked a sense of humor""."

Personally i believe that this is the best editing i have ever seen in any movie, ever. All the tech and they way it was put together was so dumb, but it just worked. Edgar Wright found a place among the deitys of film with this movie alone. I won't get into the story since its so amazing that you need to find out for yourself.

","VERY MILD spoiler<br/><br/>While the film's hyper-kinetic action scenes and overall storytelling will irritate the unconverted, those in the right mood will have a lot of fun, even if you are wishing for more character development.<br/><br/>The cast is a riot and really tie the film up, particularly Brandon Routh (I'm sorry, SUPERMAN), who seems to be better at dead pan than the film's lead, Michael Cera.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are just so damn outlandish that you can't help but laugh out loud, and along the way, gives you some really nice eye candy. That's the reason why you get Bill Pope for the Director of Photography. The Matrix, baby!<br/><br/>The movie isn't quite as heartfelt as some of Cera's other Rom Com's, but when the film has time for it, there is some genuine sweetness and the ending ties up the adaptation nicely (please pay to see this, so we'll get a sequel!) Now I just have to start reading the comics."

","""You feel chilled because you have no character. You're a depressing assemblage of pop culture influences and cancelled emotions, driven by the sputtering engine of only the most banal form of capitalism. You spend your life feeling as if you're perpetually on the brink of being obsolete — whether it's labour market obsolescence or cultural unhipness. And it's all catching up with you. You live and die by the development cycle. You're glamorised drosophila flies, with the company regulating your life cycles at whim. If it isn't a budget-driven eighteen-month video game production schedule, it's a five-year hardware obsolescence schedule. Every five years you have to throw away everything you know and learn a whole new set of hardware and software specs, relegating what was once critical to our lives to the cosmic slag heap."" - Douglas Coupland <br/><br/>Cultural theorists see postmodernism as a vacuous trap of circular references. It is the product of a heavily globalized, multinational dominated economy, which carries the multinational media industry as one of its main branches. As such, postmodernism stresses a ""blip time"" aesthetic, one of amnesia and schizophrenia, in which the omnipresence of media merges all discourse into an undifferentiated whole. With this media saturation comes a form of ""historical amnesia"", in which contextualisation becomes increasingly impossible.<br/><br/>One of the chief characteristics of postmodernism is a kind of all encompassing fragmentation or ""liberative incoherence"" (""F**k it, just surf the wave man!""). This includes the fragmentation of time into a series of perpetual presents, the rootlessness of the modern experience, the destruction of the family unit, the abolishment of the Sovereign Self (the trauma of which, ironically, leads to a rise in both narcissism and a quest for ""individuality""), the complete reordering of society and technology toward vast networks, nodes, conduits, transit points and non places, and the general atomization and pixelation of every aspect of our world. Philosopher Jean Francois Lyotard also identifies several other shifts. That of a move away from art which addresses symptom/causes and toward instead pure desire, a shift away from metaphysics toward pure irony, determinacy toward indeterminacy, and transcendence toward immanence.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the postmodern subject, or what is presumably left of subject-hood, seems to be mainly the personality constructed by and for technological capital, described by the Marxist literary theorist Terry Eagleton as a ""dispersed, de-centred network of libidinal attachments, emptied of ethical substance and psychical interiority, the ephemeral function of this or that act of consumption, media experience, sexual relationship, trend or fashion."" And of course with postmodernism, even alienation dissolves, for there is now no longer a subject to be alienated. Contemporary fragmentation and powerlessness could hardly be heralded more completely, or existing anger and disaffection more thoroughly ignored.<br/><br/>The Internet, interactive video games and the personal computer are themselves resolutely postmodern in the way they bring the outside, fragmented world into our lives whether we want it or not, each fostering the provision of a kind of ephemeral, and therefore unstable, experience. While this is going on, humanity itself starts to become an ephemeral substrate perpetually in the service of a long-lasting ""transcendent level"". Just as the cells of your body, which are short lived, are in the service of a body which lives longer, so too is the human subject the substrate of a technology/civilisation on a transcendent level (a singular, social super-organism). Or in technological terms, the human is now a node, always on and always attuned but never quite fully conscious of the network (what is known as CPA – continual partial attention).<br/><br/>But it is not that the world (or the chaos of postmodernity) is turning us into machines, as some grimly foretell, but that we desire to be the machines that we have created in our image. That we are already cyborgs, making the world in our image.<br/><br/>Humans have always been fascinated with the cyborg. The cyborg, of course, is itself inherently postmodern, by its nature drawn from a number of sources: art, science, medicine etc. And just as we create and draw toward ourselves ever more complex machines, machines which represent the hardware of human existence, so to we express through these machines a collective consciousness - the software of human existence - a consciousness increasingly garlbled and eclectic.<br/><br/>What does this all have to do with ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World""? Essentially, ""Pilgrim"" represents the worst of our f**ked up, glass-eyed cyborg future. The film is populated by machines; one-dimensional non-entities. Significantly, these machines do not work, belong to splintered families and are never supervised. They are self-excited circuits, perpetually playing, pleasuring themselves or fighting cool video game battles. The emotional range of these machines is completely bipolar; they're either suicidally depressed or riding technology's drug-like highs. Likewise, they live in a jazzy, supermediated, hyper-reality. A reality which mercilessly absorbs everything from Manga, to video games, to Kung Fu movies, to romantic comedies, to ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"". <br/><br/>Born in digital graffiti, in which every image is augmented, the cast themselves cannot distinguish between reality, video games, past, present, sleep, dreams and waking states. It is all a blur. Time itself overlaps, our characters continually unaware of where they are, what time it is and what ""plane"" they are currently occupying. Unsurprisingly, the film's characters are mostly neutered, whiny, but sex obsessed kids, shooting dialogue back and forth like binary code. This is speech as economy; too much talk is wasted energy. Everything's been said anyway. The film is relentlessly dehumanising, its subconscious admittance that there is no human, no soul, no self, to destroy, cosily grafted onto a ""message movie"" plot in which our hero learns Self Respect. And that is the paradox of the post-human, for he destroys himself in the name of his own liberation.<br/><br/>7/10 – Formulaic behind its fireworks. See ""Demonlover"", ""Summer Hours"" and ""Existenz""."

","After success in Britain making Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright has been given the chance to direct a Hollywood film, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. And Wright was does not disappoint with this action, comedy comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>Set in the Canadian city Toronto we follow our hero Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a slacker dating a 17-year-old high schooler Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) and the bass guitarist for the Sex Bob-omb. But Scott is recovering from a nasty break up and he falls literally for the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He tries to win her over, but there is a big problem, he has to defeat her seven evil exs, including Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha), Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh), Roxy Ritcher (Mae Whitman) and the worst of them all Gideon (Jason Schwartzman).<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a visually rich film, with Wright literally makes a live action comic book. He brings in the style of the comic book into the film with little visual touches like words coming up onto the screen, using images from the comic for telling some backstory to using panels to great affect. The fights were done with incredible skill and Wright employs the style of Capcom beat-'em-ups, with the opening of a fight shot like a landscape and used visual lettering like in though games. The fights were wonderfully shot and edited, with the camera placed in the right areas and shows that Paul Greengrass style shaky-cam and quick cutting is not needed: audiences want to see what happens in a fight scene. Wright also employ other video game references, like the extra life was reminded me of the Sonic the Hedgehog games I enjoyed in my youth, 3D beat-'em-ups like Virtual Fighter and Soul Calibur and arcade games like Donkey Kong. There is also a video game style score to go with the indie-rock preformed by the bands.<br/><br/>There is a great amount of comedy in the film. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World starts out a witty, dialogue that offers smiles and chuckles, but no real belly lasts: yet they include later on there are more jokes, involving clever observations, great characters, physical humour and how real young people. Wright and graphic novelist Bryan Lee O'Malley do understand both young people and how pop culture. Much of the humour is very sarcastic, particularly from the female characters.<br/><br/>There is a excellent cast. Cera gave his best performance as a slacker with personal baggage and well cast. Winstead too was brilliant as Ramona Flowers, leaves plenty of mystery in her character and well, she has a great body: I particularly like her fight with Whitman as Roxy Ritcher. Wong was good as Knives and also fun to look, I enjoyed her naïve young girl act who is just excited to be dating someone older but not confidence about doing anything with Scott. She grows as a character. Alison Pill and Anna Kendrick both offer a lot of sarcastic humour and do it very well: Pill did have a good supporting role but I would have liked to have seen more of Kendrick. Kieran Culkin had a good as Wallace Wells, Scott's gay roommate who is a gossip and willing to annoy people, but a good friend when it court. Culkin is smart simply plays the character as a normal man who happens to be gay, not a gay man, his performance was more natural that way. Out of the exs Schwartzman is perfectly slimy as the leader of evil exs, Routh was very funny as a dimwitted psychic with no morals and hopefully he will get to play Superman again and Evans was very good as an over the top action star with a deliberately gruff voice and speaking in action clichés. Whitman was also good in performance.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a excellent alternative comic book film, one of the best. It can stand along side films like Sin City and 300 and it is an excellent action-comedy. But I still think Kick-Ass is the best comic-book adaptation of 2010."

","Scott Pilgrim vs the World An epic of epic epicness<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs the World is a film adaptation of the graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim, The film stars Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It's directed by Edgar Wright of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs the World follows Scott Pilgrim as you would have guessed It begins with Scott dating a 17 year old girl Knives, Scott is happy for the most part and is enjoying this cute little relationship. Scott then starts having these strange dreams of this girl. Scott starts seeing this girl called Ramona Flowers around town and then falls in love with her. But there's one little catch. Scott must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes.<br/><br/>That is the basic story of the film. Edgar Wright done well into all 6 books into a 114 minute time slot. We also get a different ending from the 6th novel. This film is a geeks dream come true, Edgar Wright has cleverly made the film into an actual moving comic book. This idea works really well for the whole film and makes you feel like your watching a comic book unfold onto the big screen. The film is packed to the brim with references to video games, movies and culture altogether. Hell there's even one scene composed of Legend of Zelda music. You can tell Edgar Wright really wanted to appeal to everyone. Comedy wise everybody in the theatre was laughing. The jokes are like Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, they're built upon and thought about before they throw them out. There are a lot of Recurring gags, but the way these are executed make you enjoy them. The fight scenes against the exes play out like a video game boss fight and are done very well. These fights are over the top and just plain epic. A lot of the fights have been changed for the big screen, if these were just copied out of the graphic novel straight out then it probably wouldn't have worked well. Michael Cera delivers a excellent performance as Scott Pilgrim, this is a first that he's played a different character and if film makers gave him a chance to play as a different character then his usual nerdy type persona then people would stop hating on him. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does Ramona just as you would want her to be.<br/><br/>The problems of the films are the things it cuts out. For example the whole Eve and Scott flashbacks were cut out and you never really got the sense of them going out. The Katayanagi twins get no dialogue in this film and while the battle felt epic it just felt like filler before the final battle. Scott and Ramona's relationship never got much screen time near the end and that's what I didn't like.<br/><br/>The film is one the most faithful adaptations I've ever seen. It's ranked as probably one of the best if not the best adaptation you'll see. <br/><br/>Scott Pilgim - 9 0 - World"

","Edgar Wright is fanboy gold. Shaun of the Dead proved that he was a director to watch and Hot Fuzz showed that he had a bit more up his sleeve. So what happens when Wright branches out to comic fare without the help of his regulars? We get a film that is nonstop entertainment done in a way that only Wright can. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is unique to its very core, the fact that it's also well done and enjoyable is icing on that one-of-a-kind cake.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22-year-old Toronto slacker. When he isn't practicing with his band, he is hanging out with his 17-year-old girlfriend Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). Everything is business as usual until Scott sees the literal girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Scott quickly discovers that being with Ramona isn't as easy as he thought. While dealing with an unclear relationship with Knives he must face off against Ramona's seven evil exes.<br/><br/>The casting of this film is inspired. For all those that have grown tired of Michael Cera I urge you to go see this film. At the surface Scott Pilgrim is yet another awkward young man that you've seen Cera do before, but he finds a way to dig deeper into the character. Scott is a flawed individual and Cera is able to communicate these flaws without negating the charm that is at the character's core. It is a tough performance to describe, since it is simultaneously similar to his prior roles while also being quite a bit more complex. Technically Michael Cera is the lead, however very few scenes are all his own. Nearly every supporting actor is able to steal at least one scene. From Kieran Culkin as Wallace to Johnny Simmons as Young Neil, there was not one actor that I tired of. I found myself wishing the film could be longer simply so I could have more time to get to know all of the other characters. Anna Kendrick is sweet and smarmy as Scott's little sister, Aubrey Plaza is endearing as the overworked and unappreciated Julie Powers and Ellen Wong manages to sidestep the chasm of annoyance as Knives Chau. Then there are the seven evil exes who you should hate but just can't. In short, if the saying ""you're only as strong as your weakest link"" is true, then this cast is a diamond chain.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic, if a bit simplistic. Bryan Lee O'Malley has created a world that is both ridiculous and relatable. The film is as much a character piece as it is an action film. The writing is able to examine the complications that come with relationships at a young age. Scott is a selfish individual that pays little notice to the effect his decisions have on those around him. Ramona has led a life of regret and is constantly running from a past that will not let her escape. The characters and story are complex enough that you will be surprise to see them following you out of the theater.<br/><br/>The reason the film is able to work is Edgar Wright. I cannot imagine this film in any other director's hands. Some have described Wright's style as customized for the ""ADD generation"" but I believe this is borderline insulting. While he does utilize several fast cuts and the film has very few moments that do not cruise by, I believe this is necessary. A comic book does not contain several solemn moments of reflection and as such, a film based on a comic book should not either. I was shocked to realize that the film is close to two hours long since it seemed to clip by at such a fast pace. I may be a bit bias since this film seems to be customized to me. I grew up with my Sega Genesis at my side and a television nearby. Due to this, I found all of the video game and television inflections to be a delight. These references are in no way a distraction, simply a fantastic supplement. If the sound of the Sonic the Hedgehog theme brings a big smile to your face, then this film is just for you.<br/><br/>Comic book films have become pretty commonplace. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may not be a Marvel or DC film, but it manages to feel much more like a comic book than any film since Sin City. Wright shoots for the moon when it comes to staying true to his source and I am glad he did. The screen oozes comic charm and this allows for the intense fights and stylized musical numbers to feel completely authentic. I believe that a comic should only be transitioned to the screen if something more can be added to the experience in the process. I have only read portions of the Scott Pilgrim comic, but when it comes to the film, I would be elated to sit down and experience it all over again.<br/><br/>With this film, Edgar Wright completes a hat trick of memorable fare. Bryan Lee O'Malley has created a story that we've seen before in a way that is completely unique. Wright is able to take O'Malley's fantastic story and transition it beautifully to the screen. Every member of the cast is fantastic; I only wish that each actor had more time on screen. With so many comic book films feeling obligated to be rooted less in the fantastic and more in the real, it is nice to a see a comic book film that embraces its roots. The strong comic book style, coupled with video game accents, results in a film that is never boring. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World will make you laugh and yearn for young love, all while pummeling you with its awesomeness."

","I already read the first comic it wasn't that good til it got to the ending with the action. The same I would expect from this movie which can't be helped since they have to stay true to the comic. The comic and the movie can be placed under one genre juvenile which is not a bad thing but if not executed properly than it's going to be ridiculous.<br/><br/>This movie was not funny and it was too boring, not because of the dialogue and the characters but because the actors could'nt get into character. Who here has ever seen Michael Cera smile or at least act happy and rejoiceful, none from what I seen and because of that it has a domino effect on the other actors and they have to be the same boring, lame people. Most people would say it's not suppose to be serious well that's why I hate it because it felt too serious throughout the whole movie and the dialogue was suppose to be funny but the way they say it with a grim face then it's not. <br/><br/>Why do they all look depressing? If you're going to see this movie fast forward to all the action bits otherwise you will be bored with all the talking. The comics are meant to be funny so don't bother listening to what the actors got to say."
"mrswag2","10","16","39","17 August 2010"," Simply Awesome
","While I realize that this movie is not for everyone, I cannot think of a more inventive, unique, heartfelt, and fun movie I have seen in theaters recently. To me, the movie is more than just a spectacle. Sure, the special effects are amazing, the fight scenes awesome, and the visual style extremely entertaining. To the contrary of what many critics are saying, I thought the movie worked great on an emotional level as well. Scott Pilgrim is completely relatable to anyone unsure of where their life is headed, and every teenage boy understands his plight. He's played to perfection by Michael Cera as an unconventional hero, one who is sometimes a jerk, but nevertheless wants to do the right thing. The contrast of this realistic character with the ridiculous world which he inhabits keeps the movie grounded, even when an Indian scenester is performing a Bollywood dance number for no discernible reason.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong: the movie is completely insane, but in a wonderful, devil-may-care sort of way, rather than feeling like a carefully calculated marketing ploy. The crazy fight scenes could have gotten tired by the end, and the movie could have been an exhausting experience. Instead, every fight scene is filmed with a sense of child-like wonder, making the movie feel uplifting and energizing rather than it pounding the audience into submission. The complete lack of rules and the possibility of anything happening keeps these scenes entertaining throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>I also find this movie beautiful in a way like no other. Of course, from a visual standpoint the special effects are top notch, and the scenes well shot. But it is also beautiful for other reasons. The ethereal moments such as when Scott dreams about Ramona roller blading to his door, the awesome soundtrack/score which perfectly accentuates the different moods in the movie, and the contrast of a simple, almost naive love story amongst the craziness all compound to make it an almost transcendent experience.<br/><br/>To me, this movie works on all levels: emotional, visual, and even spiritual. But above all, its original. It saddens me that the American movie-going public has mostly ignored this movie, choosing instead to view mindless garbage such as The Expendables and Eat, Pray, Love. After viewing the movie 2 times, I still love it, and think a lot of other people would too if they just gave it a chance. So do yourself a favor and go see this movie. Even if you don't love it as much as me, you won't see another movie like this for a long time."

"johnnyboyz","4","11","25","15 August 2011"," Hypocritical and ill-judged mess; in which the titular Scott Pilgrim does not, in fact, take on the world but does make room for Edgar Wright to take on our patience.
","Was Gregory's Girl as remade by Stephen Chow really what the world needed? Accomplished British director Edgar Wright's latest, the graphic novel adaptation of the same name in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, is the frenetic; overly energetic and just generally annoying version of such a thing. Here is a needless, post-modern explosion of tricks and gimmicks; the film appearing to want to be some sort of a cautionary, screwball comedy depicting the lengths people go for those they love; the entire thing ending up an often unbearable slog which, in spite of the adult foundations, comes across as a ill-judged and immature trudge through a mire rife with very little content to get involved in and very little to actually like. <br/><br/>Drawing on a parallel to what the likes of respective British directors Danny Boyle and Paul McGuigan tried for in the late-nineties, Wright blurs the lines between realism and surrealism for his American audiences; enabling characters to achieve a great deal of what humans cannot often in the presence of a lot of other people whom witness it, but do not react in any great way that suggests the activity is out of the ordinary. Michael Cera, stretching his acting limitations, here plays the softly-spoken; weedy looking, although more confident than you give him credit, young man somewhere in between that of high-school, university and the beginnings of full time employment. He is named Scott Pilgrim. As the title might suggest, it is him versus the world; only, it isn't. In fact, for the bulk of the time, Wright's film features the titular character taking on a handful of ex-lovers. When it isn't doing that act, it briefly focuses on both he and his girlfriend against one other ex-lover, before further still briefly veering off to focus on that of Scott's ex-partner taking on his current one.<br/><br/>Living in the Canadian city of Toronto, Scott is frequently a guitarist in a band. He has recently come out of a relationship with a woman he felt a great deal for; the nature of its capitulation leading him into a tryst with that of Hmong girl Knives (Wong). The members of his band, particularly that of snotty drummer Kim (Pill), entrust it to be a façade relationship; such accusations begin to mutate into statements of truth when fiery, but underplayed in that alluring way, Ramona (Winstead) arrives with her dizzy arrays of coloured hairstyles and tendency to roller-skate around if outdoors, - Scott going on to woo her. In all intents and purposes, the character of Knives is the most interesting; prior to being dumped, her innocent demeanour and carefree attitude when she's with Scott encapsulates a universal exterior of happy-go-lucky living and enjoyment. A crucial scene sees her partake in an act which doubles up as the film's entire nucleus; specifically, when she changes her hair colour out of reaction for being ditched for Ramona and her wacky ideas in regards to hair, in what is a brief capturing of the tribulations and reactionary process one might go through for means of love; the opposite sex or attention and affection.<br/><br/>Unfortunaley, Wright decides to explore the thesis by way of Cera's rather arrogant and somewhat unlikable character; an exercise executed via a process of inherent boredom during which four-or-so too many fight sequences act as the centrepieces around which a bunch of offbeat sound effects, that are inexplicably taken from arcade machines of old, pepper a demented aesthetic of noise; rabid cutting and quip spouting teenagers. Principally, the film covers Scott and his quest to defeat the seven ex-partner's of Ramona – so, the girl gets around, and in this age of disturbingly high teenage pregnancy figures and societies rife with sexual infections, such a notion does not deserve to be handled with the throwaway attitude it is here. The battling of the exes is an idea which does not go on to spawn any sort of plot per-se, and instead induces a series of fight sequences in the mould of that awful video game of years past ""Tekken"". The fights might unfold in any order, and sadly renders Ramona's essential presence that of a prize awaiting the lead at the end of his quest.<br/><br/>Wright brings about these fights during occasions in which violence or hostilities of some description appear apparent: when Scott duels with Matthew Patel (Bhabha), it is at a battle of the bands meeting; when he fights film star Lucas Lee (Evans), it is immediately prior to having watched him shoot a violent scene in his latest movie, whereas the altercation with Todd (Routh, lampooning his Superman role) is a result of the fallout of an argument that they share. Depressingly, the fights largely consist of Scott up against specific groups or individuals of a marginalised sort; flitting from fighting an Indian (complete with out of place mock-Hindu dance); a bi-sexual; a vegan and two synthetic musicians of Japanese nationality, in what is itself a horrid pastiche of the wondrous sequence involving certain antagonistic harpists in Kung-fu Hustle, a film by the aforementioned Stephen Chow. Gregory's Girl it isn't; a film about grounded people with specific interests at important times in their lives coming together and desiring to interact with the opposite sex. The interactions for those people were nerve-wracking; the film subverted gender roles in ways that were refreshing: boys enjoyed culinary and girls wanted to play football. Wright's coming of age film is an abusive assault on the senses; a piece due to play like a horror film to those aged between 12 and 18 whom are yet to have much contact with the opposite sex, which means it has missed the point by a wholly unforgivable margin."

","My family and I just watched this film and within the first few minutes, I could see why this movie bombed at the box office. We forced ourselves to watch it to the end, and we all agreed that we just lost a couple of hours of our life that we will never get back. To try and describe just how much this movie sucked is difficult. I like Edgar Wright's films, and I like Michael Cera, and Jason Scwartzman, so to see them in this ridiculously stupid film was especially painful. Nothing about the movie made any sense, and there is nothing even remotely redeeming about it. I have posted on Twitter and Facebook about how terrible this film is in order to hopefully save my friends from having to endure this mess of a film. Sometimes films tank at the box office and they are good films, but this time the audience got it right by not paying to see this disaster in theaters. Lucky for us, we got it via Netflix so the dollars we wasted on this nightmare were minimal. Avoid this mess and you will be glad you did. You are not missing anything and nobody, but nobody, is going to be talking about it around the water cooler at work. Save yourself and avoid this train wreck!"

","Outside of the razzle-dazzle effects, which grow old by battle #3 (Brandon Routh), the movie has no substance. The effects and direction are interesting but the movie is so concerned with these components that the creators assume that their presence alone can make up for a lack of engaging characters and story. I never cared one iota about any of the characters; as they, like the story itself, were never developed in any meaningful way. The movie also felt really long and by #4 I couldn't wait for it to end; not to imply that I was engaged in seeing a resolution, as a conflict or substantial challenge demanding a resolution was never developed. This of course is largely due to the characters, which never moved beyond one dimension and their relationships, particularly the main one, which was grounded in absolutely nothing. I'd say it's the most baseless romance since Anakin & Padme pretended to like each other despite more evidence of dislike between those characters. There were a few laughs here and there but over all this is a hollow stinker with sprinkles on top."

","Though I could probably rave for hours tonight, I'll try to keep this short. After Kickass and Inception, I thought that for sure, 2010 would be plumb out of good movies. But oh boy. Like the other reviewer said, as the Universal Logo appeared in like an 80x50 resolution accompanied by a midi track, I knew this was going to be good. I somehow managed to make it through the seizure inducing beginning credits, then the movie took off. It was maybe a little slow for a few minutes, but now I realize it was only preparing me for the awesomeness to follow.<br/><br/>Anyways, the acting was superb, and I completely have a new lovecrush on Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She could_not_have_been_hotter. In fact the whole movie is overrun with a cast that would steal the show in any normal movie, but here it's just a big collection of great young actors, which we rarely get to see. I think inevitably, and very unfortunately, this will be compared to Kickass, and that almost makes me sad, but also makes me happy that I'm getting to see both in the same year.<br/><br/>So basically, if you've ever been into random games such as say, Zelda, Final Fantasy, well, you REALLY might not want to miss this one. It's not the perfect movie, but I think the director would shoot himself if it was. It's an entertaining movie, and while on one hand, the nerdier you are the more you'll get it, I think there's a lot to laugh at here for everyone. It gets my utmost endorsement."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","15","38","25 August 2010"," Arguably Edgar Wright's best film to date
","""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is Edgar Wright's third film, following the well-received British comedies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"". This film is a comedy as well but, rather than a genre parody, it's an adaptation of a series of graphic novels.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple: When the title character meets the woman of his dreams (literally) he soon discovers that if he wants to win her heart he'll have to defeat her seven evil exes. The story plays out in video game style with battles interspersed among the more realistic elements of the plot.<br/><br/>Wright's direction is consistently impressive as he throws all sorts of colourful, energetic visuals at the viewer. I don't know how much of that comes from the graphic novels but, regardless, he did a fine job of translating it to the screen. I can honestly say that I have never seen another film that looks quite like this.<br/><br/>The music is good, too. For the fictional bands, original songs were contributed by Beck, Metric & Broken Social Scene. I also liked the apt usage of ""Under My Thumb"" by the Rolling Stones.<br/><br/>As for the cast, it's expertly assembled with no one seeming out of place or giving a weak performance. Michael Cera brings his unique charm to the title role and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's Ramona Flowers is truly a woman worth fighting seven evil exes for. Kieran Culkin stands out in support and the evil exes are deliciously villainous.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" may not exactly be 'an epic of epic epicness' but it certainly is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours. However, I doubt that most viewers above a certain age group (say, 30 or so) will really 'get' the film. I think that's a shame, though, since the story is deeper than the video game-inspired plot and visuals might lead you to expect."
"Leofwine_draca","5","6","12","5 January 2013"," Great fights, but...
","...like a lot of Hollywood movies these days, SCOTT PILGRIM feels very insubstantial. So much money has been put on-screen to make it look good, with special effects popping out at you all the while and all manner of technical wizardry, that real, grounded storytelling and 'meat' has been left by the wayside. I appreciate the constant homages to geek culture and video games, but at the end of this film I was left feeling curiously unsatisfied.<br/><br/>The fight scenes, which pop up with an almost routine regularity, are spectacular. The choreography is often brilliant and the addition of the special effects is the icing on the cake. The film is colourful, fast-paced and quick witted with it. But what is there beyond the visual spectacle? The humour isn't all that. Michael Cera, who I've never seen before, is intensely irritating with that whiny, lispy little voice. It is possible to make geeky leading men likable (it happened with KICK-ASS) but Cera remains an irritant from beginning to end. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is much better as the object of his affection, but if you're expecting romance you'll be disappointed; such moments are non-existent.<br/><br/>This is a flashy but ultimately unrewarding movie, something that jettisons proper plotting and character work in favour of a self-knowing, video game-style atmosphere throughout."
"sirpy20","10","6","12","27 January 2011"," Four words : The Game is never over. That would be 5 words.
","I saw Scott Pilgrim vs the World in the most inappropriate way possible. But there is no way I am going to mince words, reviewing it. It is one of the most brilliant way a movie can be made; something which makes you want more. More than you will ever want.<br/><br/>To start off with, there are multiple, subtle underplayed one-liners. ""It is Scott""; ""What has he done""; ""No. It is Scott"". ""Oh. What have you done"". These are teasers. The scenes which don't have awesome kicking-ass scenes; there are rip-roaring dialogues. Over and above this, there is the screenplay that is so convoluted that would make want to tear your hair out in sheer happiness.<br/><br/>Secondly, the fights. All the fights are reminiscent of typical game scenes which nobody who has not had a chance to even see, don't deserve to see. But those who have, will enjoy them to the hilt; with pleasure. It is worth it, trust me.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the acting. Michael Cera has done justice to the not-so-suave looking but yet cool guy. Kim has you in splits with her sarcasm and of course Ramona Flowers is too cool for her own good.<br/><br/>Fourthly, the music which is an inevitable spoiler is replete. To the core and reflective of the recent culture. It is way beyond what an average movie-goer can imagine.<br/><br/>Last but not the real least, to one of the most visionary directors - Edgar Wright. The story and the screenplay is slick with an s-l-ick. It is too awesome with the visuals and the screenplay. Editing is typical of an EW movie with everything choppy thrown in for good measure that started off with 'Spaced'. He is brilliant, no doubt.<br/><br/>In summary, beg; borrow; steal - watch this movie. It is way beyond any art piece that you have ever seen simply because it is contemporary to the extent of being blasphemed!"

"patsavestheday","9","18","48","27 July 2010"," Scott Pilgrim v The World is the Sex-Bob-Omb!
","I was lucky enough to get into one of the Scott Pilgrim vs The World screenings at the San Diego Comic Con (the 3rd screening Saturday night specifically). Thought I'd chime in and give a review. I first need to start off by saying a movie like this was tailor made for a guy like me. I've grown up playing video games (Zelda, Final Fantasy, Street Fighter, Mario, etc.), I used to be big into comics, and I loved Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. I also am a huge Arrested Development fan, and even though Michael Cera is type cast, you gotta love yourself some George Michael. And Superbad is awesome. And I'm a fan of a lot of the other cast members too. ANYWAY, with a background like that it would be hard to not like a film like Scott Pilgrim.<br/><br/>On top of that, the crowd at the Balboa Theater was pretty much filled with like minded people, 1,800 comic con nerds/geeks/fan boys/girls. All of whom had been waiting in eagerly in line for hours for the screening. And on TOP OF THAT, Edgar Wright came out to introduce the film and the entire cast of the movie (Michael Cera, Mary E Winstead, Kieran Culkin, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick, Brandon Routh, Jason Schwartzman's mustache, Ellen Wong, Satya Bhabha, Bill Hader (he does the voices), Mark Webber, Mae Whitman (her?) and...I think that's it, I might be missing someone, idk). They all came out one by one throwing swag into the crowd getting everyone even more excited (M. Cera threw out a mask of a monkey which my friend caught, I believe he was wearing this on the Con floor incognitosneaky).<br/><br/>So, suffice it to say that they warmed the already geeked out crowd up pretty well. And when you get a group like that together it can cloud your judgment, for example when the Phantom Menace when it came out I saw it filled with a bunch of Star Wars honks dressed up and waving light sabers. The movie seemed awesome at the time, but it was more just the atmosphere and nostalgia (we all know that movie sucked). After a second or third viewing you come to realize that. So that is the WARNING on my review. It could possible by skewed. However, I am going to go out on a limb and say that even though the atmosphere at my viewing was amazing, it did not cloud my judgment and that this movie truly does KICK ASS!<br/><br/>From the second the Universal logo game out in 8-bit with a midi style theme song I knew I was going to enjoy what I was watching. SPvTW starts off strong and doesn't really let off the gas. And that's part of its charm. The whole movie has ADD. It understands what type of movie it is and doesn't take itself too serious, quite the opposite in fact, like when the Seinfeld theme song kicks on out of nowhere with accompanying laugh track, or how the exes turn into a pile of coins when they are defeated. This movie has a lot going on, from outrageous fight scenes, awesome music to amazing visual effects. It's really quite ambitious. And Edgar pulls it off.<br/><br/>I'm sure you all know the plot (Scott hearts girl, much defeat exes, gets to pick up coins) so I won't go too much into that. The acting I thought was really good. The actors all have great chemistry and I Keiran Culkin steals some scenes (and boyfriends) as Scott's gay roommate. Michael Cera isn't too overly Michael Cera in this movie and I actually believe that the character could score a Ramona Flowers played by Mary E Winstead. I think this could be Michael's best role. <br/><br/>What surprised me the most is how cool the fight scenes where. They were very fun, especially the fight between Ramona and Roxy played by Mae Whitman (her?). And I loved how people just burst into outrageous Street Fighter-esqe fights and no one really thinks it is odd.<br/><br/>OK, this review is getting long so I'm going to just start listing off awesome parts – Brandon Routh as dumb vegan ex = so funny, Zelda song during dream sequence = win, Final Fantasy bass line = awesome, Beck doing a song in the film = sweet, Jason Schwartzman wielding an 8-bit Katana blade = badass, Soundtrack = a must download. <br/><br/>Really, this movie is just stuffed to the brim with fun. Epic fun. I've never seen a movie like it to be honest. So despite being catered to by the cast and director (they came out after the show as well, this time with Thomas Jane). I believe I would have enjoyed the movie either way. I'm excited to see it again when it comes out with a normal crowd to see how they react. I'm also really curious to see how some older critics view the film as this is definitely aimed to the 30 and under crowd. I have a feeling some aren't going to get it."

","I hadn't seen the Scott Pilgrim comics before and completely missed the marketing and launch of this movie and therefore had no idea what to expect before seeing this film. All I can say is that I was blown away when I finally got around to watching this masterpiece. I absolutely adore this movie, Edgar Wright is a definitely a director whose films I seem to love wholeheartedly. <br/><br/>It's a heavily stylized film so it's definitely not going to be to everyone's taste but here the style definitely helps with the substance. If you're older or don't have any history with video games, you'll more likely hate this film. It has a very distinctive style and you're either going to love it or hate it, it definitely hasn't been toned down for mass audiences. I thought it was fantastic, funny, charming and full of energy. It has a freshly inventive and boldly unique approach to film, there definitely isn't anything like this out there. From the very first shot of the SNES Universal logo and midi music playing, you know you're going to see something special. The editing and the effects were superb and appeared very seamless. The movie is endlessly creative and delightful with an impeccable focus on detail, I was grinning like an idiot the whole way. The fight scenes are brilliantly over-the-top and hilarious. The movie's pace was relentless, Edgar Wright sure knows how to use transitions properly and keep the movie going. For pretty much any other movie he pacing would likely feel way too ADD but here it fits perfectly. <br/><br/>The visuals aren't of course everything and this movie combines it with a really clever script. The jokes are very funny, there's a lot of them and they come at you fast. The dialogue is hilarious and witty. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were very good in this and they had some good chemistry together. Cera's character was very awkward but you could really tell he means well. The love story is also very nice and sweet in a way and you could really see growth in Michael Cera's character by the end of the movie. Ellen Wong was also adorable as Knives Chang, a girl who is obsessed with Scott Pilgrim. The supporting cast is also uniformly excellent, the evil exes were especially memorable. <br/><br/>This movie gets a definite recommendation from me and gets a full 10/10."

","I have read reviews about Scott being a geek and it being impossible for him to attract these cute girls. His big break-up with Envy. She's gorgeous right? Knives, is cute as a button right? Now Ramona. So what is it about Scott that makes him so desirable. We find out in the movie that Scott has super powers. Super powers often corrupts the mind and turns you evil. It is so easy to abuse power but Scott is not like that. Scott is just... well... so Nice! Almost too nice. Don't get me wrong he does have a breaking point but that doesn't make him bad. I mean look at the end when he faced his ultimate foe. His Evil self. He just ""shot the sh*t"" and he said to the girls that Mega Scott was a real nice guy. So what is it about Scott these girls like? There is a pull about him a sense of rightness. He has these ""mystical"" powers you could say that draws them to him. It is so easy to see.

The story follows like this: the ""sexy"" girl had 7 ex SUPERboyfriends with SUPERpowers, though I would call them the seven dwarfs: Doc, Happy, Grumpy, Sleepy, Dopey, Sneezy and Bashful (all of them grouchy, noisy and stupid).<br/><br/>So, for some reason I don't even give a flying rat's ass, the ""sexy"" girl says to the main character (the 22 y.o. punk): ""you have to defeat my 7 ex boyfriends to date me, and blah"".<br/><br/>Why in God's name would a girl ask his date to beat the crap out his ex-boyfriends? There are more important things in life to look at when looking for a boyfriend.<br/><br/>We have to add the fact that Michael Cera is the most insipid, flavourless, unidimensional, emotionless and irritating actor that has recently been on screen in the last years.<br/><br/>Movie is unbearable.

","""An epic of epic epicness"" was the catch phrase of the movie, and really the best way to describe the movie. SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD fully delivers on all the hype that it's built. From the 8-bit Universal logo to the video game form of Scott beating up the ""THE END"" after the credits, the movie is just sheer entertainment. <br/><br/>At first, I wasn't sure. I saw Michael Cera's name and immediately shrugged it off. I've never been a fan of Cera and he wasn't the selling point for me in the least for this movie. What were the selling points for me were Edgar Wright (Director of SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ) and the visual style of the whole movie. <br/><br/>SCOTT PILGRIM is the first, true comic book/video game movie. I want to say that it's more of a live action comic book/video game than a movie. Everything from life bars, ""WHACKS!"" and ""SMACK!"" coming up in giant letters in the back ground, it is the most unique visual styles I've seen in years, probably ever. <br/><br/>At its core, SCOTT PILGRIM is a love story. What I love about this love story is that neither of the main characters are perfect. Both are extremely flawed characters. Scott is kind of a douche as he falls in and out of love with multiple girls, while Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has major commitment issues. And while I found myself disliking Scott from the get go and being fairly indifferent about Ramona when she comes on, they have very good arcs that made me rooting for them when the time came to really care. <br/><br/>I also really like the supporting cast is nearly flawless. I'd say the highlight would be Kieran Culkin as Scott's ""Cool gay roommate"" Wallas. Every scene with him is gold. He's got this off beat charm and great comedic timing that just feels extremely genuine. While at times it can be a bit stereotypical, it's never offensive. Just slightly exaggerated for the sake of comedy. <br/><br/>Along with him, Julie Powers (Aubrey Plaza) has one very memorable scene that I don't even want to hint at. It's used just enough to get substantial laughs without overstaying its welcome. I do feel that other supporting actors were underutilized like Anna Kendrick who plays Scott's sister. She's not in the movie much, but she's always a pleasure to see. <br/><br/>The story alone is great, and without that, the rest of the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective. Now I could have seen this as another mindless, hack 'em slash 'em, action fest event movie, but the effective story just makes the fun parts of the movie so much more to invest in. And when this movie gets fun, it holds nothing back. It may be a turn off for some to see the over-the-top action set pieces, but if you've seen the trailer, you know what to expect. <br/><br/>Edgar Wright is a masterful director. If a lesser director had this project I doubt it would have been half as fun. Every set piece and fight sequence is extremely well shot with the camera far back enough where you can actually see what's going on. And there are shots long enough to see several moves be thrown back and forth between 2 or more characters. I can't recall any extremely close up and quickly cut fights in the movie. <br/><br/>What's also cool is that you can actually see that some of the actors throw a portion of the moves themselves. Yes, there were doubles for the flips and stuff we all know Cera can't pull off, but it's not in the least bit distracting. We can buy it because of the universe that's set up for the film. <br/><br/>SCOTT PILGRIM's world is as if they were actually in a comic and/or video game. It's got this surreal vibe and style to it that's fully entrancing and immersive. It helps tremendously with the ridiculous set pieces with high flying maneuvers and normally impossible moments. Really, the best way to describe it is ""f***ing awesome!"" It's a geek's paradise world. Small things from a ""pee bar"" and ""ding dong"" text appearing in thin air or being able to put a hat on that you didn't even have in your possession instantly on a moments notice to being able to leap 15 feet in the air and remain up there for several seconds as you pound the 65 hit combo or survive being thrown 70 feet into the side of a tower falling 5 stories. <br/><br/>I can't really do the film justice for the experience it delivers. Both INCEPTION and SCOTT PILGRIM have given us true innovation. As for which is better is really up to taste. I think INCEPTION is probably a better movie, but I think SCOTT PILGRIM trumps it in pure entertainment value. It is an intelligent, geek fueled movie. I will say INCEPTION does have the greatest single set piece in recent years, but SCOTT PILGRIM has one of the coolest worlds created since TRON. <br/><br/>""F**k yeah!"" were the words that I said when the credits came up. SCOTT PILGRIM was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a theatre. While I'll wait until further viewings to place this in my favorite movies, I can definitely see this making it in my top movies of all time as far as how much I enjoyed it. It is my favorite film so far in this disappointing year. It's definitely something I'll watch at least 3 more times in theatres, and I suggest everyone see this in one, with a crowd."

The only flaw is that anyone who is unfamiliar with video game and comic culture may not enjoy the film as much as those who are familiar.

","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a film adaptation of one of the most successful teen novels of all time. The story and film have gained an almost cult like following, and I had to see what all the fuse was about. The truth is, that this particular films represents everything that is wrong with our society and youth culture in general. Scott Pilgrim is the kind of guy who likes to label everyone and everything, but worse than that, he rants in circles, using constant innuendos, that only a fourteen year old would understand. The story isn't even that unique or special, as the film moves at lightning speed, which is slightly slower than the speed at which it's star, Michael Cera, delivers his lines. I really felt as though my head was spinning, with a mix of slang and new terminology, that simply didn't make any sense to me. As far as the story goes, it's just another modern love story, featuring a lovable loser in love, which was completely unbelievable. The reason is Michael Cera, who seemingly plays the exact same role in every film. He's this nerdy, uncomfortable guy, trying all these awkward ways to get girls to fall for him, and it never works, possibly because he is one of the most feminine and closeted actors out there today. I generously gave this film 1 star, because I actually did enjoy Scott Pilgrim's band, but aside from that, this film is a complete waste of time. It's star is unbelievable, it's story is overly complicated, and the dialogue is arguably the worst I have ever heard. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World may be your teenage daughters favorite movie, but if you're older than sixteen, you're going to want to skip this one."

Every side character is full of wit and charm.It also boasts an incredible soundtrack! It stays true to its comic book origins in the way its shot and plays out. Very funny and very original! I don't thing anybody should attempt to copy! You should definitely watch! 10/10!"

","I was not expecting this movie to turn into a fantasy type movie, but that's what it did. I thought it was a comedy like Michael Cera's other movies since he yet again plays the same character. But at least he's good at it. I didn't like how the movie started off like it was supposed to be about real things that could happen, then it turns into a video game as Cera, aka Scott Pilgrim, has to defeat his new girlfriend's (Romona) 7 evil ex's in video game style. They even explode into coins after being defeated. It just made the whole thing silly. I really liked the movie before it started getting silly. Scott's high school girl, Knives, was a cool character and even turns ninja at the end. But it was better when she acted all stalker-esk.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I didn't like this movie. I also don't play video games so that could have something to do with it. Also, I think this movie's target audience is teenage boys, so I don't recommend it unless you fall into that category."

","You know those YouTube videos where you get a laugh and they are really wild and crazy, but shitty? The ones made by young college kids that are into theater and entertainment and have the nerd skills to produce short little movies and publish them on the internet? Well this movie is like a long version of one of those. I can't say I enjoyed the movie though I did get a few laughs out of it. Unfortunately the movie is mostly boring and is peppered with cheap special effects that only a stoned person could appreciate. It looks like the writer(s) had this idea of making a movie play out like a video game, and just scribbled down the first story idea that came to mind and molded the movie to fit idea. I suspect they were high when came up with this movie. It was a good effort, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are really really bored and have nothing else to watch (like me). Enjoy...or, whatever."
"BadlandZ","6","5","10","2 January 2011"," Who's rating this 9 or 10 stars?
","I really wanted to see this, because I thought Hot Fuzz was one of the best done total joke of a movie that I just couldn't stop watching and loved. So maybe my expectations were to high? But, I really don't get why this movie is rated so high, or any of these comments. It's just not that great.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, but it's hardly ""mind blowing"" or ""ground breaking"" like so many of the reviewers keep saying. My guess is all those reviews have to be from 16 year olds who have not really seen a lot of movies.<br/><br/>It's cute, but some times boring because they spend time trying so hard to do something ""special"" and usually it's just a modern special effects take on stuff that's been done 30 years ago or more. Most of it reminded me of the old Batman TV series with the ""Bang"" and ""Pow"" with funky camera angles. Sorry teens, that's not ""mind blowing"" or ""cutting edge"" or ""super trendy"" or whatever great things you try to pretend it is. It's all been done, and it's only new to YOU who haven't seen it, it's not new to most people even.<br/><br/>The bisexual thing, or the lesbians, or the gay guy? Sorry, that's not the slightest bit shocking to anyone over 14 years old, that is a big part of far to many modern movies to name. The ""Bang"" action sequences are straight out of Adam West's Batman TV series, and Gamer or Crank have already updated the theme with video game style in the serious action to totally goofy cartoon directions. And the story? Wayne's World had a deeper plot... Really? ""mind blowing"" ? Not even close.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not bad, it has it's moments, it's sorta cute sometimes. But it's maybe SLIGHTLY above average, not a ""Mind Blowing 10 star movie."""
"bobscott","10","15","41","28 July 2010"," One of the best video game movies ever made... and it's based on a graphic novel!
","For starters, I'll say that I have read the first few graphic novels in the Scott Pilgrim series by Bryan Lee O'Malley and had seen a couple of trailers, so I thought that I had some idea what to expect as I went to a pre-release screening in Omaha. Still, my expectations were blown away. To bring such content to the big screen from a graphic novel is always a challenge, and with the content being so video-game centric, perhaps even more so. However, Edgar Wright clearly overcame the challenge with great casting, good pacing, and what I can only call appropriate special effects.<br/><br/>From the appearance of the Universal logo and music at the beginning all the way to the end (well, the start of the credits, at least), I found the movie an incredibly fun experience, with many laughs at sight gags, one-liners, and the random geekery that the people who made the film obviously knew that their target audience would be looking for. Additionally, a good soundtrack surrounds much of the on-screen action.<br/><br/>I know that there are people who just think that Michael Cera is the worst thing since unsliced bread, and these are people who should clearly avoid this film for the sole reason that it contains Michael Cera. I think he works well in this role. There are times where the actor can make or break a film, but I don't see Cera breaking this film.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim probably won't be breaking any box office records, but I'd like to think that word of mouth can help this film get the attention it deserves from the audiences that would most appreciate it, which would be those who enjoy classic video game culture and the interesting characters in this film who live in a world which many a Nintendo Power subscriber could only dream of.<br/><br/>Just don't go in thinking you're going to see Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, as you'll likely be disappointed. This is a very different film, but I would say that it's trying to have as much fun as either of Wright's other two most popular films."
"alexdelliott","1","10","25","2 November 2011"," Tragic
","I will firstly say i had never read the book or comic or whatever it was prior to seeing this movie and i went to see it on the recommendation that it was a refreshing teen comedy like nothing seen before.<br/><br/>I'm glad i had never seen anything like it before or after, i can honestly say that it is the worst film i have ever seen in my life and probably the worst i ever will see. I can deal with strange films that are at least entertaining with some good characters. This, however, did not in any way allow engagement with the unbelievable characters and instead left me detached and outraged at such a dire storyline. <br/><br/>It features a regular (ish) boy who manages to find himself not only with two girlfriends since he seems too pathetic to tell either of them but also having to fight off a number of evil ex's in a comic book/video game/power rangers style set of battles which occur completely out of the blue, almost as if the developers forgot they weren't designing a video game. That's as far as i care to explain the plot as there really is nothing else to it. For anyone obsessed with terrible corny Teen dramas and Tekken with a slight flavour of Pokemon i guess it would be a dream come true. <br/><br/>I'm not trying to have a go at the many users who have rated this movie so high and have indeed reviewed it so positively but i just don't understand the attraction. I feel the same way Tom Hanks did in Big when he made the insightful comment: ""I don't get it"".<br/><br/>I would not see this movie again even if you paid me and it is the only film in which i wanted to walk out of the cinema, demand my money back, and forget i ever saw it. <br/><br/>Truly the worst film i have ever seen, not entertaining or funny but pointless and immature; thus i don't feel i can recommend this film to any audience. would give it 0 if i could."

Despite the fact that those engaged in battle are hurled into walls and beaten again and again, no on is ever really injured; not even a scratch. It's like a cartoon where a character can get flattened by a steam roller, then pop right back up. The only good lines that came out of this were Rainbow Girl's ex gf saying that she was bi-furious and calling her a hasbian. The movie comes across like Sucker Punch on acid. I guess that there are some movies that are so incredibly bad that they appear to be good.

","I love film. I watch many films, many genres, from the most experimental to the most formulaic. And good or bad, I always enjoy the experience, because most movies, whether they execute their ideas well or not, revolve around some aspect of the human experience. No matter how fantastical its world or characters might be, there are always anchors to reality; usually a theme central to the human experience: love, war, despair, happiness, depression, hopes and dreams, regret, etc.<br/><br/>I also love videogames for the experience that they offer. They are fun and engaging, and they can be a fun social experience in the right amount. And although narrative wise they usually don't offer much, that has been changing the past few years.<br/><br/>Why this introduction in a review? Because ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" offers none of what is great about film and none of what is great about gaming. It's like a video game you don't get to play. It is, in one word, boring. I actually had to turn it off the first time, because I was bored out of my mind. The second time I watched it in full, but I didn't enjoy it.<br/><br/>It is a technically well made movie and it has some solid acting, but not only is the script completely devoid of anything interesting, other than childish word play and the regular sarcastic jokes that are so overplayed these days, but it actually doesn't even has a finished story. There is nothing behind it and the characters are so limited in their interactions that they don't even feel like people. They feel like characters in a video game, but since I'm not playing it, I don't care what happens to them.<br/><br/>This is a flashy movie, that moves fast and will please a lot of(young) people, but that ultimately offers nothing to dwell on or appreciate.<br/><br/>I rarely give any move less than a 6 rating, but for sheer boredom and mind numbing action, I give this a 5, and only because I love Edgar Wright's earlier work and hope he will get back on track."

","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is the purest example of a Great Idea, Gone Wrong. Come to think to of it, the idea, The hero has to defeat the heroine's 7 ex-boyfriends, in order to win her heart. It has tremendous potential and the film begins with a roar, but as soon as the film passes 60-minutes, you know that something has started to go wrong.<br/><br/>'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' has some terrific moments, super stunts, lively music and memorable performances working for it, but where it falters, is it's writing. The writing is of top-grade in the first hour, but as soon the hero meets opponent to opponent, it gets monotonous and dragging. Even the climax for that matter, leaves no impact.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's Screenplay loses pace, while his direction is no hot-shot. Bill Pope's Cinematography is good. The Editing is fine. Performance wise, all the actors have done very well. Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, is excellent. The youngster gets into the skin of the character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good. Ellen Wong is fantastic. Kieran Culkin is outstandingly funny in his part. Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzman, Envy Adams and Mae Whitman are memorable as well.<br/><br/>On the whole, like mentioned from the very beginning, a great idea, gone wrong.

","This movie is a dream to all gamers it's everything I've ever wanted to see in a movie I've never loved a movie so much and the fact that it didn't do very good in the box office makes me sick. The movie is about Scott Pilgrim falling in love at first sight with a girl named Ramona Flowers and after going on one date Scott is entered (without even knowing it) into the League of evil ex's and now Scott has to fight Ramona's seven deadly Ex's so that he can go out with Romona. At first the movie seems like an awesome comedy with some game references like Scott's band name (Sex Bob-omb) and some talk about Zelda, but when Scott gets into his first fight you come to find this movie isn't just a comedy it's the most epic action comedy of all time! The Saying an epic of epic epicness couldn't describe this movie any better just when you think it can't get any better it does the fights get even more epic and the jokes get even more hilarious. The only part of the movie I didn't like was the credits cause it was over, I strongly suggest you see this movie if you like games epic fights great characters awesome story lines and Hilarious jokes than this is probably the movie for you.

","The extent of the comic book influence in Ang Lee's Hulk were lines intersecting and dividing the frame into panels just like the source material would. Not exactly a novel or inspired idea, and it added exactly zero to an already mediocre film. Scott Pilgrim is another one of those rare occasions where merely adapting a comic's story is not enough; the essence of comic books and their unique elements must be integrated into the film itself. Are these decisions fully justified? Many of the effects, while pretty and neat, don't contribute a whole lot, but are there to satiate the fans of the source material and those familiar with comic book tropes; flashy visualisations of sound effects (the crash bangs, bells ringing, bass notes), presenting conversations by splitting the frame instead of your conventional shot reverse shot, text boxes with introductory information, and so on. There are a few instances of Wright's innovation with these elements - a powered up Todd demonstrating his strength by smashing Scott through the panel's barrier comes to mind. But most of it is just unnecessary nonsense. <br/><br/>The film also lifts liberally from video-game mechanics. The plot itself is positioned like a game's plot; seven exes, or bosses, each with their own special abilities and backstories, needing to be defeated to gain the final prize. The action sequences are delightfully exaggerated as they would be if you were controlling Scott as the protagonist and hero; appropriately timed speed ramping, flashy power-up effects, the aspect ratio shrinking and enlarging to capture the intensity of a critical hit. But to what extent do flashy effects cover up the lacklustre narrative that indulges them? I guess it's cool to add a glowing sword and tell us Scott's stat increases at a crucial part of his growth; he gains the powers of love, and then later self-respect. What this does, however, is make his characterisation almost entirely reliant on these gimmicks and prevent the film from truly getting to the heart of its characters and motivations. Could you ever imagine Citizen Kane with a little bar at the bottom of the screen that indicated Kane's level of regret?<br/><br/>What Wright does is cover almost every facet of his film with a visual gimmick or effect so that the actual characters are scarcely allowed to breathe. Much of the humour comes from the script rather than the characters; when Scott breathlessly indicates his willingness to do ""all of the drugs"" to impress Ramona, all it sounds like is an actor reciting a line. Cera taps into his usual persona; the quiet, unassuming teenager who speaks almost exclusively in deadpan, so it seems baffling that so many girls could ever be attracted to him. The same applies to Ramona Flowers, the self-described Manic Pixie Dream Girl: she claims ""I change my hair every week and a half, dude. Get used to it."" as if this is a substitute for an actual personality. Winstead is pretty and has an air of vague vulnerability to her, but Ramona is nothing more than an airy plot device to serve Scott's coming-of-age story. <br/><br/>The worst offender is the seventeen year old Chinese schoolgirl named 'Knives Chau', who speaks and acts like she has jumped straight out of a nerd's wet-dream. Wong does a brilliant job, nevertheless - Knives is ever smiling, bouncing and on Scott's arm, like a girlfriend created in a lab (or a video-game), and conveniently does not ever seem to notice or address any of his flaws. In the end, she is tossed aside for the happy hopeful ending, and the film cares more about their synchronised jump-kicks than Scott's quick apology. This is the crux of the film's problem; there is clearly an arc written for Scott's redemption, to realise the error of his ways, his selfishness and the self-doubt that comes with the constant comparison and clashing with Ramona's exes. But it is all hidden under intentional silliness and camp, and when we try to closely scrutinise his actions, they don't make any sense. Scott finally gains enough self-respect to stop measuring himself next to the exes, and meaninglessly chase a pretty enigma. But it turns out that his dickishness didn't have any consequences at all; Knives is still the bouncing stereotype that is more than happy to endorse the dream pair, and Ramona is there to welcome him with open arms. It goes for the cool ending, instead of one bound by common sense."
"mike-wright-1","6","3","5","12 February 2013"," It just didn't work for me
","Much like the infinitely different and otherwise incomparable Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, I get the impression that Scott Pilgrim's biggest failure was in trying to remain too faithful to its existing fans.<br/><br/>The character of Scott may well have worked in the graphic novel – it may even have worked in different hands although that assumption would be unfair on Cera. In movie form though, I just didn't buy it. He is, quite simply, completely unlikeable. I cannot think of a single thing he does to make Ramona like him. At the start he is dating a 17 year old who is going on 13. It's an odd ""romance"" that tries to speak of the emotional damage he has suffered at the hands of his own ex. In truth though, the wonderfully named Knives is probably the zenith of what Scott could realistically achieve, girlfriend-wise. Then as soon as Ramona turns up with her roller blades and pink hair, he pretends his current girlfriend does not exist and starts to ditch his band mates even though they're nearing a big break.<br/><br/>He is needy and pathetic, and even if Ramona is after a ""bird with a broken wing"" to look after for a while, she will very soon get very bored of it. There's nothing wrong with a likable nerd - and Cera pulls this off believably in both Juno and Superbad to get the hot girl. But here, he's an unlikeable nerd and the best that will get you is a barely legal fan girl.<br/><br/>Unlike some of the other detractors of this film, I have no issue with the physical appearance of Cera or the fight scenes as they are so clearly fantastical - although I was struggling to find anything allegorical about them. They did seem to be designed more so as people who already spend their entire time in front of the TV could put the controller down for two hours and still get the same experience. I wanted to like it, in fact I've actually watched it twice. There are probably half a dozen laugh at loud moments which, together with a superb turn from Culkin, invoking an early Robert Downey Jr, and the gorgeously punky Winstead, made this film by means a wasted two hours. However the rest of the ideas fall pretty flat. It probably just tried to be too faithful to its source."

","""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a youth-oriented comedy that is destined to divide audiences into two diametrically opposed camps: those who see it as a brilliantly creative and satirical take on modern adolescence, and those who see it as a migraine-inducing, insufferably pretentious exercise in self-conscious self-indulgence that has desperation written all over it. The movie is definitely an acquired taste, but one thing is for certain: very few who see it will be indifferent to it.<br/><br/>Based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is a highly stylized, non-linear account of a 22-year-old geek (played, as always, by Michael Cera) and his surrealistic adventures with his friends and band mates (the cast is indeed enormous) – who are a combination of dorks and Goths and just about everything in between – as they do battle against evil forces, most of them former boyfriends of his current flame (Alison Pill), in snowy Toronto. <br/><br/>Writers Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright's attempt to transfer the look and style of graphic literature to the big screen meets with only modest success here (Wright also directed the movie), and it's not too long into the film's nonstop assault on the senses that we're compelled to holler ""Uncle!"" purely out of self-defense.<br/><br/>The is-it-a-dream-or-is-it-reality? narrative framework, the frenetic editing, the robotic line-readings, and the words constantly flying all over the screen have a certain novelty and charm at the beginning, but they quickly wear out their welcome – as well as the audience's patience – and all we're left with is a profound sense of relief once the whole thing is finally over.<br/><br/>Despite the best of intentions in wanting to do something a little bit different for a change, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" still comes across as a ""cult classic"" trying just a little too hard to become a ""cult classic."""

","We caught a midnight show of this, and it was the most original and enjoyable movie I've seen in a very long time. For those not familiar with the general plot: Scott falls for a cute girl named Ramona, and later learns that he can only date her if he defeats her ""seven evil exes"" in battle.<br/><br/>The movie effortlessly and playfully moves between reality, video-game surrealism, dream surrealism, and media-based effects (e.g., mimicking a sitcom or a ""Pop-Up Video"" effect). One moment the characters are walking, the next they're passing through a metaphorical door into their conversation, and as they return there's a clearly-labeled video- game leveled challenge. This is ballsy -- if done poorly, it would've come across as gimmicky and stupid, but Wright pulls it off brilliantly, transitioning seamlessly between styles as if he were merely recording alternating lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely hilarious, with plenty of internal self- reference, tons of classic tropes and clichés (with ""lampshades hung"" on them to make it clear that the homage is out of love), and some of the best deadpan deliveries I've seen (though, oddly enough, not from Cera). Wright's expert sense of comic timing shines through here -- I never thought I'd hear an entire audience laughing so hard at a guy pausing to tie his shoe.<br/><br/>The comedy only pauses for the fights, which are SO insanely over-the- top that you can't even attempt to take them seriously. Seriously, even for a video game, these are pretty crazy! Just sit back and accept that keyboard riffs can become dragons, that veganism gives you super powers, and that you can hit a guy hard enough to turn him into shiny coins. (Ooh, neat!

Usually with video game movies, they strive on trying to be as realistic as they can. With Scott Pilgrim it is the opposite. The film welcomes the surreal, and the further it shifts from reality, the better it gets.<br/><br/>It's quirky graphic novel style is a colourful work of art and looks absolutely stunning. Kudos to Edgar Wright on bringing this comic book style to life on the big screen.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is full of an amazing cast, fun music, and plenty of 90's references for 20-somethings to enjoy.

"geniuskentyk-1","10","11","30","16 August 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs. The World has everything you could possibly want in a film!
","Director Edgar Wright ('Hot Fuzz', 'Shaun of the Dead') has given ""the world"" something truly special. He's given the cinematic-world a visually appealing, eye-candy, adventure of a movie! 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is truly a unique film, and one of the best this year!<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22-year-old guy with relationship issues. His last serious relationship ended with his heart broken, and now he's dating a 17-year-old high school student, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). However, we're never sure if he truly likes Knives, or if he's just desperate. But when he meets the girl of his dreams, literally, his world is forever changed. This girl is Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), and for some reason, Scott has a thing for her – he thinks she's the one. However, to truly be with Ramona, Scott has to defeat her ""Seven Evil Exes;"" he literally has to fight and battle with each one.<br/><br/>The most exciting moments in the film are these seven battles. The film keeps these battles interesting by having a variety of characters, each with their own unique personalities. Before seeing the film, I knew that the battles would be video-game-esquire, but I thought that the battles would all be similar, and eventually get tedious. However, I was gladly wrong. Each and every one of the battles were unique in their own ways, depending on who the ""Evil Ex"" was. One is Bollywood inspired, one music-inspired, and more. Some battles are more memorable than others, but each is visually stunning, and unique.<br/><br/>I loved the personalities of each of the ""Evil Exes."" All of them were hilarious in their own way; one was a vegan-powered jerk, another was a Hollywood actor. They're all so unique; one was even a girl! Ramona's female ex, Roxy Richter (Mae Whitman), was totally badass and had a slightly special speech pattern. I loved how some of these battles required Scott Pilgrim to use strategy to defeat the exes, and not just simple brute force. Some of the battles required Scott to use what he knows about his opponent's background and personality, and it's gratifying to see how Scott pulls off some of these victories. These ""Evil Exes"" are, for the most part, portrayed by unknowns. The most popular, to me, were Chris Evans ('Fantastic Four') and Brandon Routhe ('Superman Returns'). However, the celebrity-status of the actors in the film didn't technically affect the way we viewed their characters. For example, Chris Evan's character of Lucas Lee was, to me, the least interesting of the ""Evil Exes."" 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' had many, many characters, each different, and for the most part, are likable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Scott has a gay friend and roommate, Wallace, played wonderfully by Kieran Culkin. Culkin's portrayal of Wallace truly stole the film. Culkin's character was funny in almost every scene, and many of his lines were quotable-worthy. Knives was a crazy character that could have been portrayed in two different ways – annoyingly or awesomely. Ellen Wong does a great job at making Knives appear obsessive and crazy, while at the same time innocent and lovable; her character could have easily been seen as annoying, but Ellen Wong pulled her off the right way. Also, Knives is totally badass by the end of the film. Aubrey Plaza ('Parks and Recreation') portrays a memorable minor character, Julie Powers. Julie is one of Scott's friends and has the unique ability to censor her speech, which is hilarious.<br/><br/>The film has so many different characters that are so different and unique, that it's hard to choose a favorite. However, there are some characters that could've been better. To me, Ramona Flowers seemed too distant and not-right for Scott Pilgrim. Her character just had a straight-faced, uncaring personality throughout the entire film. I didn't sense any chemistry between her and Scott Pilgrim, but hey, maybe that's what her character's supposed to be like. The twin ""Evil Exes"" barely had any screen time, and had a short battle; they literally didn't speak one line.<br/><br/>'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' has an extremely fast pacing, and it works great. Straight from the beginning of the film, you can tell that everything happens fast in the film. The dialogue is even fast at some parts. This fast-pace requires fast transitions, and I felt like the transitions were well-done. The visuals in the film were also amazing and well-done. I loved how well the film managed to pull off a video- game feel, and make it not cheesy. The film had ""pee bars,"" ""coins as rewards,"" ""health points,"" and so much more. All of these things fit naturally in the film, and they're awesome. The weapons were amazing, and the fights were all well-choreographed.<br/><br/>'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' has everything you could possibly want in a film! It has wonderful actors, memorably unique characters, an interesting plot, quotable dialogue, a unique style, spectacular visuals, and so much more! It's truly, truly unique (I know I've said that a lot, but it really is!) and is definitely a stand-out film from most that are currently out. No other film this summer, or this year, has been this stand-out since Inception. Both films are definitely on the top of my ""Best Films of 2010″ list, for sure!<br/><br/>PS: Who doesn't like Michael Cera? He's such a lovable actor, and has that unique ability to be ""liked"" in any film he does! He's awesome.<br/><br/>PSS: 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is ridiculously awesome. Go see it! You don't have to be ""nerdy"" or ""geeky"" to like or understand the film's concept and unique style. I went with a lot of friends, and most of them surely weren't the gamer-types. The film's appealing to males as well as females, for sure!<br/><br/>PSSS: Once again, go see 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World!'"
"chelano","10","11","30","15 August 2010"," Beautiful from start to finish
","It has been along time since I enjoyed a movie from start to finish. This was that movie. This film was jam packed with action, laughs and just lovable characters you want to see more and more of. Michael Cera was a pretty good choice for Scott. I mean usually Cera only has one type of way to act and somehow it really did fit for Pilgrim. It will take me forever to explain how much I liked the cast, so I will only pick a choice few. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great as Ramona. She had the look you could picture from the comic itself. Then you have Ellen Wong as Knives. The way Ellen acted in this film really brought out have Knives really was in the comic. Out of the evil Ex's, I really enjoyed Jason Schwartzman. He just had an overall cool yet kept feeling and at a point you really wanted him to fight more against Pilgrim. The other Ex would have to be Brandon Routh. I really cannot stand him as Superman, but this role he got to act more like his personality. I mean every actor has a dream to act as a crazy character, because then they can be more comfortable. I think Brandon was very comfortable in the role. The movie had a beautiful look to it with great nerdy CG throughout. The movie did have two problems though. The fight scenes were not long enough. This is because the movie was almost two hours and it is hard to fit seven fight scenes in to seven Ex's. But even though they were short, the look, feel and graphics to them still really made them exciting. The other problem is that I know this film will never has a perfect rating overall because it really only fits to a certain type of people. Luckily there is a lot of people who will love this movie like I did, but in the world today, this film will probably not win an academy award; and that is sad."
"JackTLovesJackD","9","7","17","13 August 2011"," Edgar Wright knocks it out of the park...
","Let me start this review by saying that I did not see this film at the cinema, it didn't draw me in, and I was foolishly unaware that it was directed by Edgar Wright at the time of cinema release.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of Spaced (TV show directed by Wright) but I wasn't an enormous fan of Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz. I did think they were exceptionally made films, but for me they lacked something, a heart a sense of substance. The comedy was there, but it still felt like as a feature film director Edgar Wright was cutting his teeth, still working with Simon Pegg et al (no complaints, but you would always compare the work with Spaced and that would be hard to top). I always felt like Edgar Wright would do more once he left his Spaced roots behind.<br/><br/>Then came Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, like I say I didn't know it was a Wright film, and I wasn't drawn in by the marketing of it and didn't see it until it arrived in my living room on a movie channel. But I have never been more surprised, amused, filled with joy and just ****ing entertained by a movie. It was one of those moments, like seeing Fight Club for the first time. You didn't know it was going to be that good. And after that it becomes one of the films you always consider to be exceptionally good and a milestone in cinema. <br/><br/>I believe this film will be entertaining and a joy to any audience over 12 but perhaps Scott Pilgrim will appeal in a particular way to anyone who grew up with Nintendo games. Being in my late 20s (and a boy, although girls play Nintendo too I'm told :), I'm the perfect audience for this film. The Zelda, Mario bros, Street Fighter etc references are wonderfully placed and never feel like they're getting in the way of the plot or the characters. <br/><br/>What this film does in a way in which I've never seen a film do before is seamlessly blend the real world, computer games and young romance, and the conflict, struggles and bliss that it brings into a cohesive and endlessly entertaining couple of hours. It's just the most brilliant fun, and I am extremely cynical about modern films.<br/><br/>I don't use my words lightly when I say that the last film that impressed me this much and reminded me of how incredible films can be, was Fight Club. Though in tone, subject matter and style they are different beasts altogether, they really both share the same frenetic pace and sense of limitless imagination. Edgar Wright has come into his own with this film, pitching special effects, stylistic combat, humour and pace to near perfection. Usually you would sacrifice humour or depth or a sense of human emotion through the use of such fantastic and supernatural elements, but Edgar Wright pulls it off. Exceptionally cast, with Kieran Culkin stealing every scene he appears in... The music couldn't be better (Beck wrote the songs that Scott Pilgrims band plays throughout the film). The dialogue is relentlessly funny, with too many one liners to quote here. It's hard to find fault with this film, although I'm trying to. If I had read the comic books the film is based on (I haven't) I'd probably have some fan boy gripe about a missing character or a misrepresented event, but I have not. <br/><br/>All I can say is, if you haven't seen this film, see it as soon as possible. It's one of the best films of the past ten years and I can't wait to see what Edgar does next. I never give ten out of ten because perfection in anything is impossible, but please see this 9/10 as my version of a 10 for Scott Pilgrim vs The World. It's quite simply awesome."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","10","10","27","2 September 2010"," Everything I wanted it to be - Heartfelt, Original and Cool As Hell!
","As proved by Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, Edgar Wright is a great filmmaker. His techniques may not have the polished precision that Christopher Nolan normally brings to his films, but Wright's energy and love for the material that he is directing and the way his enthusiasm floods the screen, in my opinion, makes him a great filmmaker. Never has this been more evident than in Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, his best film to date. It won't be for everyone (my dad hated it), but I loved it. It's what (500) Days of Summer would have been if it was filtered through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>22-year-old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a slacker. He lives with his gay roommate Wallace (the hilarious Kieran Culkin), goes out with a 17-year-old with the awesome name of Knives Chau (the adorably quirky Ellen Wong) and spends a lot of time rocking with the fellow members of his band, the Sex Bob-ombs. One day, his life is turned upside down by the arrival of mysterious Ramon Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Drawn to Ramona to the point where he dumps Knives, Scott discovers that if he is to win the hand of this fair maiden, he has to overcome one little obstacle. Well, seven, as Ramona has seven evil exes who will do anything to destroy Scott and his relationship with Ramona. Finding his lazy lifestyle under threat, Scott must prepare to battle for Ramona and bring out the ""L"" word; no, not that one.<br/><br/>What I love most about Scott Pilgrim is the way in which it constantly surprises and delights the viewer. This isn't your typical, generic romantic comedy; this is a smart, very funny romantic comedy spliced with the genes of a bad-ass martial arts flick. The screenplay scores big time; the dialogue is sharp and hugely entertaining enough to keep even those who've just gone to this movie for the action spellbound, and there are too many memorable characters to count with your ten fingers. When the action arrives, it is phenomenal. Each of the villains have unique fighting styles, assets and weaknesses, making each fight scene interesting. Plus, even though the men outnumber the women in this movie, the women don't just stand on the sidelines; they kick ass with the best of them, too. The action is right up there with the Kill Bill movies and The Matrix, but did those movies have Michael Cera fighting off a bunch of goons with a flaming sword? I think not.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the performances, which are terrific across the board. Whilst Cera has made a career out of portraying awkward, dopey characters, his goofy charm fits the role of Scott Pilgrim perfectly. He also brings a darker, often unsympathetic edge to his character; Scott is cowardly (observe his reactions in the scene where Knives, still in a relationship with Scott, and Ramona, having just started a relationship with Scott, first meet), whiny and manipulative (I love how he tricks some of the exes into their own defeat). Also on a different note to his usual performances, he becomes an unexpected champion warrior in the action scenes. As Ramona, Winstead is appealingly street-wise and sympathetic; she's a girl who is trying to flee from her past, but who must confront it if she wants any hope for a future. Culkin and Wong steal their scenes, whilst more strong support comes from the likes of Twilight's Anna Kendrick as Scott's sister Stacey, Alison Pill as Sex Bob-ombs drummer Kim and Aubrey Plaza as gossip Julie. Out of the evil exes, Chris Evans AKA The Human Torch/Captain America and Brandon Routh AKA Superman are especially fantastic as movie star Lucas Lee and vegan - powered (!) bass player Todd Ingram respectively. However, my favourite of the exes has to be the ace Jason Schwartzman as the big, bad and oh so cool No. 1, Gideon Graves. He is an awesome character, with one of the coolest lairs that I have seen, and yet he's such a sneering weasel that I couldn't help but laugh at him.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is never anything less than amazing to look at. The cinematography by Spider-Man's Bill Pope is magical, moving between gritty realism and gorgeous style (a scene where Scott and Ramona simply walk through the snow is captivating). The visual effects, as I said before, are just perfect. Whilst some people may find the film's style difficult to adjust to, I loved it from start to finish. As with everything else in the movie, the visual effects are original, hysterical and pitch-perfect. All of the details, such as a pee bar appearing as Scott goes to the toilet and depleting as he does his business, or when Chau's love for Scott floats through the air in pink lettering that he brushes aside, are just right within the context of this movie. The movie isn't bad on the ears either, with wonderful sound design and an electrifying soundtrack.<br/><br/>I adore this movie. I couldn't have asked for more from it; it manages to be something entirely different, whilst also striking truthful emotional notes. Under all of the mesmerising visual effects and mad fight scenes, this is essentially a journey of self-discovery for its main character, a chance for him to develop as a person and right his life. It is this journey which gives Scott Pilgrim the ever-crucial humanity it needs to succeed. The final shot is unexpectedly beautiful, a truly poignant comment on how the uncertain future is better faced together. Everything about this movie is so spot-on that it isn't just one of the best movies of the year; it is a great movie, full stop, and will, without any doubt, come to be regarded as a classic. For me, Scott Pilgrim is a definite K.O."
"KingKongWhopper","5","4","8","20 June 2014"," While it delivers to fans of the graphic novel, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World fails to help those new to the story enjoy it.
","Please note that I am new at writing reviews, so if I was completely wrong on something just message me and I'll correct it for future ones. :)<br/><br/>I want to love ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World."" When I saw the trailer back in 2010, I thought the concept was both hilarious and clever. The trailer was quite catchy as I remember, but due to school and no free time I procrastinated going to see it, and eventually forgot about it all together. Then, this summer, while I was making my IMDb account and creating a Senior Year Summer watchlist, the film came up in a list of suggestions. Remembering how awesome it had seemed four years ago, it flew to the top of my list. After watching the movie, however, I can say that I was rather disappointed. I will preface what I am about to say with this: I have never read the graphic novel series that the film originated from. I went into this like any film go-er would that just wanted to see it for what it was: a movie.<br/><br/>My first problem with Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World lies in its reliance on its source material. Now, before you send me that scathing PM, hear me out. I LOVE it when movies stick to the material they are based on. Time after time I have seen movies say, ""Based on a true story,"" or ""Based on the books by blah blah blah."" Almost never is the movie that follows that claim anywhere near its actual origin. So, it is great to see Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World follow the graphic novels so closely. However, just because a certain plot or style makes sense in that form DOES NOT mean it will translate well for all audiences in movie form. Many of the scenes in this movie are done in exactly the same methods as the graphic novel, which results in some ""oh, that's a book reference"" moments. Again, this is great for fans of the novels, but just downright confusing for everyone else. And this is primarily where Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World fails for me. Its attempts to make the movie as close to the book as possible makes it really like watching the book, but with less of the details that give a book the ability to flow.<br/><br/>There are some positives to this movie, however. Kieran Culkin's performance was the best, in my opinion, followed by Michael Cera. I give them a lot of credit for the acting they did in this movie. Even as someone who hasn't read the books, I felt as if I was seeing exactly the characters they wanted me to see in their performances. Everyone else was rather hit or miss, but these two stood out as the best. There are also some funny jokes, no real knee slappers but some quirky humor that I kind of expected going in.<br/><br/>Overall, I know a 5/10 may seem like a harsh rating for this movie, but I think it is an accurate representation. 50% of you have probably read the graphic novels, and you will therefore enjoy it. 50% of you were like me, just seeing it because it looked cool, and it will be a confusing mess. My suggestion would be to read the series and then watch this movie. I know I will be giving the books a shot, and then returning to this movie again."

"Turfseer","4","5","11","27 March 2011"," Pacman meets Tarrantino meets MTV meets Batman, the 60s TV Show
","For those who have been trying to figure out which media influenced the scenarists of 'Scott Pilgrim', how about MTV, old 80s video games, comic books and Quentin Tarrantino? There's one other that may only occur to the older population watching this film: Batman, the 60s TV show. Remember all the zany titles which would appear whenever something dramatic happened (titles such as ""Sock!"", ""Pow!"", ""Bong!"")? A similar technique is employed here with Scott Pilgrim but the titles are often inserted for a more farcical comic book effect (for example, when a phone rings, the title ""ring"" zips across the screen). One or two word titles are also utilized to describe each character (so if the narrator mentions someone is 'clueless', it's also mentioned again as a title description). 'Pilgrim' wins points for its original visual style, featuring nifty camera work and spectacular special effects which often makes one feel as if one is inside of a crazy video game.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Pilgrim's story is as bland as the title character. Michael Cera (playing another geeky role) is awful as a 22 year old garage band musician who first dates a perky high school student (""Knives Chau"") but then dumps her for the more mysterious Ramona Flowers (winningly played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Cera's Pilgrim can do nothing more than act like a love sick puppy dog opposite the much more aggressive Flowers from beginning to end.<br/><br/>In real life, the enigmatic Flowers would never go for the wimpy Pilgrim who always seems to be kow-towing to her during their many platonic interactions. Somehow, Flowers decides to give Pilgrim a second chance after he defeats her 7th ex-boyfriend Gideon (Pilgrim's ex-bands' new sponsor) in a long-winded fight scene (Flowers is not really 'attracted' to boyfriend #7; actually, he's planted a micro-chip in her brain causing her to fall for him!).<br/><br/>That's basically the crux of the Pilgrim plot—our 'hero' must go toe to toe with all of Flowers' evil exes before he can win back the object of his infatuation. The seven confrontations (which include a woman, one of Ramona's bi-flings) are nothing more than a device to stage a series of silly fight scenes reminiscent of Tarrantino's stylized sword fights in ""Kill Bill"". None of it makes any sense, especially when perky and cute Knives attacks Ramona out of jealousy over her relationship with Pilgrim. Should I also mention that Pilgrim is stabbed to death, goes to limbo but discovers he has an ""extra life"" that enables him to return to earth so he can do battle with Gideon all over again.<br/><br/>None of the supporting players exhibit any charm. Pilgrim's gay roommate, for example, puts Pilgrim down when he advises Knives not to get involved with him during their first meet up. And then there's Pilgrim's drummer and ex-girlfriend Kim Pine; why exactly does she have a dour expression on her face throughout the film? There's also little humor in the film—one attempt (if you can call it that) occurs with Ramona's third ex, Todd; he's stymied when he's stripped of his 'vegan psychic' powers by the 'vegan police' who have discovered that he's been putting half and half (non-vegan milk substitute) in his coffee.<br/><br/>In the end, one can only conclude that 'Pilgrim' is a pointless endeavor. Should we regard 'Pilgrim' as an honorable character after he engages in these violent confrontations with a group of one-dimensional, comic book villains? Even worse is how emasculated Pilgrim comes off as he is led around on a leash by a much more hip Ramona. This is a film strictly for teenagers. Its failure to appeal to an older, more sophisticated crowd spelled doom at the box office in the American market."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","25 June 2017"," A really bold premise and smart execution, but also some major weaknesses
","""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2010 written and directed by Edgar Wright based on the graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley. This is the story of Scott, a young man who falls in love with a girl, but has to defeat her seven evil exes for them to be together. Fittingly with these mission, you can see the film is divided into 7 levels almost and this is where the video game component comes into play. Not only do the characters frequently look a lot like video game characters, but there are also effects and movements in here that really make it obvious that this film is as much of an interface between gaming and filmmaking as it gets. And I must say I enjoyed a lot of it. The antagonists were fairly interesting and the ways in which Scott beats them were just as exciting to watch, but it also needs to be said that the film itself when it does not focus on the video game connection has some fairly weak moments. The major mistake here was casting Michael Cera. He proves without a doubt that he is not lead actor material. He may have been tolerable on Arrested Development, but he simply is not bearable in this film we have here and the fact that he is in basically every scene is not helping matters at all. Kieran Culkin is just as bad in my opinion, plus his character added virtually nothing. Wes Anderson regular Jason Schwartzman was better playing what you could call the big end boss.<br/><br/>Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character however, the object of desire, is really great and perhaps the most memorable aspect about the entire film. Aubrey Plaza and Ellen Chau add some solid scenes too, even if the latter's character is definitely overdone a bit. Anna Kendrick is one of the finest actresses of her generation, but has simply too little to work with here playing the protagonist's nosy sister. Back to Cera, his presence, line delivery and also the way the character was written makes it incredibly difficult for me to cheer for him get together with Ramona to be honest. I personally also found it really strange how she indeed developed some kind of attraction for him despite being completely out of his league. Then again, looking at all her ex-boyfriends, she clearly had a tendency to go for losers, so this explains it perhaps. And some of them are almost as unlikable as Scott. So Scott Pilgrim is definitely not Cera's typical role as a likable loser as there is absolutely nothing likable about him. You could quote a dozen scenes for that. It's also one reason why I find the ending so highly unrealistic where it is he who picks her and not the other way around. But yeah, it is another universe and that's how things work there. This is not a Planet Earth movie. I know it is a desperate explanation, but lets just leave it like that.<br/><br/>Back to the video game component, occasionally they overdid it in terms of Street Fighter jump and kick moves for example, but apart from that honestly these scenes and gimmicky aspects are the heart and soul of the film. Highly enjoyable for fans of video games as the movie is packed with references to the world of (online) gaming and many of the supporting characters elevate the material by quite a bit. Like these effects I just mentioned, there are also other weak moments, like the device reference towards the end, but it's all no negative deal breakers and it is certainly possible to see the good surrounding all the bad as I believe the good moments are more frequent. However, it is essential that you watch the entire movie exclusively as a fantasy film and do not expect any great romance or relationship comedy. From that perspective it is a failure. I will still be generous and give it a thumbs-up because I remember liking it more the first time I watched it years ago. With a better lead actor, this could have been one of 2010's best, the way it actually turned out it is just one of 2010's better films."

"create","9","2","3","6 May 2015"," Scott's Generation
","Scott Pilgrim V. The World<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a young-ish (maybe 23) bassist of an underwhelming garage band, Sex Bomb...err, Sex Bomb-omb...with a lifelong hobby – no OBSESSION – of video games. His life is secure. He is involved in a sexless relationship with a minor: video game enthusiast, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). And his hard working roommate, Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) pays for everything, including their apartment. <br/><br/>Pilgrim's life is basically unchallenged till, one evening, he dreams that some mysterious girl is out there. And, a bit later, it turns out that she is! Her name is Ramona Flowers, the American with no money worries, a big apartment, and no significant other hanging around.<br/><br/>Scott sees this as a chance to upgrade his relationship status. Besides, Ramona and he seem to connect. But, the illusion of Ramona's trouble-free availability changes as quickly, and as often as her hair color. Soon, Scott learns that he must overcome Romona's exes...err, SEVEN EVIL EXES...as well as his naïve world view in order to hook up with the girl of his dreams.<br/><br/>But, alas, life is a video game!...so, anything is possible. That naivety thing is tough, though.<br/><br/>This is a touchstone film. It speaks to the generation of the characters it highlights as well as bespeaks of them. (For this article, I'll call them the GENERATION.) It joins other touchstones such as Love Story, Brian's Song, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Clueless...and, much further into the past, Les Quatre Cents Coup. As with the first three of those films, it got very little critical acclaim when it was released. And unlike all of those films, it was a financial dud when it was released, during the middle of the Great Recession. But it garnered much critical mention as time went on from original viewers, as they learned to speak for themselves...as well as many DVD buys.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim V. the World was directed by Edgar Wright, the English director of Shawn of the Dead. It's based on the unfinished – at the time of the film's release – graphic novel by Canadian Bryan Lee O'Malley. How much this has to do with O'Malley's personal life, I am uncertain. (But that is a major topic many of the GENERATION debate.) It does seem to be a collaboration between O'Malley and Wright, however. The supporting characters have a lot of substance to them...a substance that isn't present in other Edgar Wright films. <br/><br/>These characters have a Scorsese feel to them. Chris Evan's Lucas Lee, one of the Seven Evil Execs, generates enough interest to have his own film, much less the minor role he plays here. Mark Webber's Stephen Stills, is also a stand out as a supporting character, the leader of the band.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a drama-edy/fantasy. While Love Story, Brian's Song and Quatre Cents had more social perspective, Scott Pilgrim shares with Clueless the success of replicating the language of the GENERATION. And the video game world that Scott Pilgrim created puts it up there with Ferris Bueller as showing a lifestyle that the GENERATION wants to lead. (The REAL question is if THE GENERATION is caught in the same delusion that Pilgrim is...not if they can IMAGINE their way out of it.)<br/><br/>Of the bunch, I liked Quatre Cents and Clueless the most. But I haven't sat down to watch any of them in sometime. This is the first time that I've seen the Scott Pilgrim in awhile. As with all touchstone films, you need to be in the mood to see it. And, no matter how well it's made, these films always lose their immediacy after the first year.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, two co-workers from the GENERATION had viewed V. The World the same day that I had, and it became the topic of conversation that workday. They had seen it a month prior, too. It's obvious that this film will be the topic for the rest of their lives - as all touchstone films should be."

The references to Zelda ( its at the start, and throughout ) and other video games add to the likability of this movie. Well, for me it does anyway, since I grew up with games and more specifically the games they play. Let's not get off topic here, this review is about the movie. I personally rank this movie number 1 ( better than The Dark Knight AND better than Shawshank Redemption ).<br/><br/>Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.

","Edgar Wright is one of my favourite directors working today. His films are oozing with creativity, style and innovation that I don't think anyone else can replicate. Only a visionary like him can make a movie like Scott Pilgrim work.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about Scott Pilgrim who falls in love with the beautiful hair dyed Ramona Flowers but has to first defeat her seven evil exes in order to win her love.<br/><br/>This is a movie that could have EASILY gone wrong but thankfully Edgar Wright manages to pull it off. This is one of the most entertaining films to ever be made. Everything in terms of the film's presentation is extremely creative. All the battles between Scott Pilgrim and the evil exes never become boring or tedious due to the variety of fighting styles each one possesses. Not only does this film feel nostalgic but it's also refreshing to see something different and unique. This doesn't feel like a studio-led movie but one that had a lot of effort put into its story, dialogues and craft. The visuals provide for some really hilarious moments and the subtle nuances in the dialogue add to the creativity of the movie.<br/><br/>Michael Cera essentially plays Michael Cera in this movie but it's effective as it perfects reflects the character of Scott Pilgrim. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is terrific as Ramona and has great chemistry with Cera. Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzman, Brandon Routh and the rest of the evil exes fit their roles perfectly and look like they're having the time of their lives. Kieran Culkin is really funny. The cast is generally fantastic.<br/><br/>A staple in Edgar Wright movies is the fast paced editing which is no different here. The movie does not contain a single boring moment. Just by watching the film you could see how well thought out every element was. The constant X symbols and numbers telling you which evil ex Scott is facing are a few examples of the clever cinematography. The fights are really well choreographed and are directed with such grace and style. There really is no film quite like Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.<br/><br/>If you are someone who loved playing video games and watching anime or martial arts, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is for you as I believe it has the perfect blend of all of these."
"q-12932-31486","9","1","1","22 January 2020"," The girl of his dreams
","The girl of his dreams<br/><br/>
video games, comics and anime are the perfect words for describing this 2010 Edgar Wright directed, graphic novel adaptation of Scott Pilgrim vs the world. Just under two hours of shot for shot entertainment and unique style of editing, Edgar's creative brilliance eases you into the dream like life of a Somewhat shy Scott pilgrim re gaining his self esteem by being forced to fight the evil seven exes of the girl he's falling in love with. This action packed comedic love story is a great choice for your next Netflix watch.<br/><br/>The lovable Michael Cera plays scott pilgrim, an innocent 22 year old Canadian who plays bass in a band with his friends Kim and Stephan. The First thing we find out about Scott is that he's dating a 17 year old high school girl named knives chau, which is pretty much all the information you need to know about Scott to understand who he is. She comes over to watch them play and is mind blown by how good they sound. The griddy hard rock music gives an unexpected jump start to the movie straight out the gate. They continue to play while The camera slowly zooms out and the inside of the room stretches into the title screen. Then the opening credits roll and a montage of flashy patterns and colors go off in the background setting the edgy tone for the rest of the movie. After watching that intro I was instantly hooked and genuinely excited to see what other Elements they'd bring in throughout the movie. And Let me just say That I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The main element that stood out to me was the use of camera angles and play between foreground and background. Even on my third viewing the film I'm taken by surprise by how much effort must have gone into the visuals and planning of every frame. Behind the creative video game edits and the marvelous comic book layouts I found little Easter eggs and references to the inspiration that was used in the making of this film. For example scott is seen wearing a plumtree shirt which is a nod to the band that Made the song scott pilgrim, or how throughout the movie are hidden letter x's that foreshadow the seven evil exes he must defeat before he can be with Ramona. It's details like those that really add to the rewatchability of this film.<br/><br/>But that's not that's going to have you wanting to rewatch this movie. It's everything else that's amazing about this film. like the quintessential acting by each of the characters that at times it may feel a little unrealistic but makes up for it with the unrealistic editing that makes it all blend effortlessly. From the first moment we're introduced to each of the characters were attached to their personalities and are given a clear sense of their motives. We can tell that Edgar Wright made sure that no individual in this film was put in without a purpose. The dialogue in this film, in my eyes is another standout factor. bringing out the characters authentic personalities throughout every line. Giving the villains humorous yet clever one liners that fit perfectly with each of their personalities.<br/><br/>From beginning to end scott pilgrim vs the world was an attention grabbing visually amusing piece of art. In fact the amazing music mixed with the artistic composition was so compelling that it shines light away from the many meaningful messages within the story but leaves you to interpret them in your own way. The heartwarming ending scene ties the movie perfectly and will leave you with what can only be described as happiness."
"questl-18592","9","1","1","3 January 2020"," Edgar Wright vs the World
","There is no other movie quite like Scott Pilgrim. It's like watching a comic book video game put to screen. The action is insane, over the top and super high energy with wonderfully creative framing and visual cues.<br/><br/>Going back and watching it again, it's amazing how many people are in this before they were huge. Brie Larson, Chris Evans, Anna Kendrick just to name a few. The visuals still hold up, as does the pointed commentary on hipsters.<br/><br/>Great music, great action, great performances. It's all around a fantastic experience. The only real downside to me is that it's based on something with a lot of content and in an effort to put a lot in here there are some moments that feel... Off. Areas where the graphic novel likely went into great detail yet the movie has to just sort of pop it in and run with it. These are mostly minor but it still prevents this from being absolutely perfect."

I love his unique style of film making and Scott Pilgrim doesn't disappoint. Everything in this film works perfectly. I must have seen the film over 50 times by now and I still find something new every time. I've seen scenes frame by frame and finding out brand new camera techniques and editing choices. On the surface the story of this sounds silly but it has such deeper meaning of getting in a new relationship and facing and sharing their past and trying not to become an ""evil ex"". I don't go so deep into it but if you have seen this film and didn't like it just please watch it again and I promise you'll find something new and look at the YouTube channel ""Cinema Wins"" and watch their Scott Pilgrim video.

Scott breaks up with his younger girlfriend to date someone he thinks is out of his league. He now must battle, in a mix of video game and comic book styled battle scenes, her seven x-boyfriends. Will he advance to the next level or be KO'd? Along with a slew of humorous and cringe worthy boy/girl dialog and interactions, this was produced with strong creativity.

","When I decided to watch this movie, I was planning on stopping after 10 minutes, but immediately got glued after the engaging graphics ensued. Although some may think of the graphics as extra, they were comical, well executed, and not distracting. The cinematography was also superb and really exemplified an excitement that Wright seems to bring out in all of his works. Cera's classic innocent character works perfectly with Winstead's scandalous behavior and both manage to keep the movie's realness while in their one-on-one scenes. The Scott vs. 7 exes scenes could have been different variations of any marvel fight, but Wright makes each encounter unique with very unconventional qualities. Overall, the acting was strong, cinematography outstanding, and directing amazing, but the script was not perfect. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue seemed like it was taken out of the movie script I wrote in 5th grade, but was ultimately overpowered by the consistently strong relationship themes.

The one issue I have is just that Scott and Romona aren't particularly good together. It never feels like they have real chemistry and the big revelation at the end about their relationship and who they are as individuals doesn't feel like it was built up to very well.<br/><br/>But overall it's an amazing experience to watch this crazy awesome movie!

The movie's visuals are the main highlight because Wright uses them to his advantage, and making a very unconventional movie. Not every movie has to be conventional.

"CinematicInceptions","9","1","1","14 September 2018"," Please re-release this in theaters.
","I can understand how people thought this movie thought this movie was overrated, or dumb, or lacking in substance. But I thoroughly enjoyed it and find it quite charming, a word I don't think I've ever used to describe a movie. It had a surprising amount of heart and even a message, which I was totally not expecting. <br/><br/>What the ""message"" is might be up for debate, but I think the main theme is that everyone has baggage and it can be dangerous to let our baggage taint our view of other people. You could make an argument that such a theme is meaningless, lame, or even wrong, but I thought it was explored in a very good way that contributed to the style and humor of the movie rather than bog it down. Fighting the evil exes feels like kind of a meaningful parallel to real relationships. A person kind of have to defeat-not just fight but defeat-the baggage of whoever they're dating in a symbolic sense. Even if one or both people have never dated anyone else, there are demons to be defeated. Defeating your significant other's baggage may not be as fun in real life as it is in this movie, but in accepting the challenge I think Scott is proving that he is willing to grow beyond his past mistakes and ignore those of Ramona. In the words of John Watson, ""The problems of your past are your business. The problems of your future are my privelage.""<br/><br/>I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the stylization of the movie. When I use the word ""trippy"", it is never in a positive context. Except when I say that this movie was trippy in the best possible way. The fight scenes and power-up moments are thrilling and almost empowering in a way that few if any action movies are. Every time Scott defeats an evil ex, I almost feel like clapping. And the action is just plain good, even without the 8-bit effects. And with the enhanced stylization, they are some of the most fun action sequences to watch ever. They really did a bang-up job on the editing, because the constant sound effect words popping up and the flashes and all of it could have gotten annoying if it were done wrong. But thankfully it was not. Though I think it deserved to make more money, I'm kind of glad it didn't because if it had, studios would probably have tried to copy it's style in lesser ways. As good as the stylization is, somehow it feels better that it stands as one-of-a-kind rather than the best of a sub-genre.<br/><br/>The editing also mixes excellently with Edgar Wright's clever, low-key comedy style. The jokes are not laugh-out-loud funny for the most part, but they make you smile at every point. There's a lot of quotable lines, and the jokes are so frequent and different in style and tone that it isn't that big of a deal if some of them fall flat.<br/><br/>The characters could be called stereotypes, I didn't find this to be true, but one could definitely make a good case for it. However, it is incredibly impressive from both a writing and directing standpoint that the movie contains something like 20 minor characters that are all seamlessly easy to keep track of, even by name. The evil exes are all very distinct from each other, again contributing very well to the baggage theme. Scott's friends are somewhat less distinct, but they all get a decent amount of attention considering how many of them there are and all are fun to watch and are given good performances. Kieran Culkin should definitely have gotten some more big roles from his performance, and most of the other actors have had great success since this movie. The two most important characters apart from Scott and Ramona are Gideon and Knives, and I want to talk briefly about each of them here. Honest Trailers were enraged that Scott chose Ramona over Knives, but I think it totally makes sense. Knives is clearly possessive of Scott and seems like she also might be taken with the fact that he's five years older than her, which doesn't seem like the ingredients for a relationship that's going anywhere. I loved to hate Gideon as the villain. It was weird to see Jason Schwartzman play basically the opposite of his character Max Fischer in Rushmore, but I thought he did great with it. Also, as someone who is a little intimidated by hipsters, it was refreshing to see a cocky hipster king be the villain. The movie as a whole kind of celebrates hipsters and nerds but also points out the problems that often come with both stereotypes.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to almost anyone. I can understand that if you're older than 25 or 30, it might seem kind of stupid and childish to you, so it's respectable if you take a pass. But anyone in high school or college will probably love or at least mildly enjoy this movie. And even if you don't, you might get something out of watching it anyway. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","1","1","30 April 2018"," An energetic, inventive and visual comedy that delights on every viewing.
","While not quite as good as the already classic 'Cornetto trilogy', this perfectly and distinctly directed comic-book adaptation uses its energetically unconventional editing, fantastically unique framing and wonderfully written, often terrifically tangential screenplay as pure extensions of the narrative instead of just tools with which to tell it, representing the perfect combination of behind-the-lens talent and pre-existing source material. This extends to the point where the endings of both were written independently and differ greatly but still adhere directly to the style and tone of their respective pieces, strangely both feeling wholly canonical and appropriate. 'Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World (2010)' is funny in a very low-key kind of way and the jokes come so fast, subtly and visually that it is often hard to keep up with them, but every frame is packed with something to appreciate and that makes this a joy to re-watch (as is usually the case with Wright) and a blast every time you do. 7/10"

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World was such a silly and quirky movie that it worked. This was one of those movies that would not make any sense to most people you explained it to. If you tried explaining it and why you like it then you'd look stranger and stranger the more you explained. <br/><br/>I found myself either laughing-out-loud or smiling approvingly the entire movie. I enjoyed just about all of the movie from the relationship quandaries of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) to the animated fight scenes. It was all so odd but yet so right. <br/><br/>Michael Cera is so plain and deadpan that it makes his character (a heartbreaking serial romancer on the rebound that plays bass in a band) all the funnier. This is an excellent relax-and-enjoy movie."

"CinemaClown","Null","1","1","3 July 2017"," Funny, Fizzy & Freakish In All Ways Imaginable.
","Sprinting at such high velocity & packing so much dynamic energy that it feels like being hit by an express train, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World travels from its source to destination in just one gear: top. A highly charged & vividly animated roller-coaster ride, it is as exhausting as it is entertaining, as frustrating as it is amusing, and as nonsensical as it is high on adrenaline.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World tells the story of its titular character, a 20-something slacker musician who is yet to recover from his previous breakup, is dating a high-school student & falls in love with the new girl in town. Soon after, he learns that in order to date his latest crush, he will have to fight & defeat her seven evil exes, each seemingly more powerful than the other.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Edgar Wright, the movie picks up speed almost as soon as it begins and then rides on this swiftly gained momentum for the remainder of its runtime. Wright unfolds the story as if swiftly skimming through a tale, and the only way to enjoy this ride is by allowing yourself to be swept by its tide. It's full of life, full of vigour & full of passion but it isn't a film for all.<br/><br/>Set pieces are utilised in a way as if breathing life into comic book pages, the swift manoeuvring of camera & exuberant use of colours only ends up adding more vibrancy to its images. Music plays a key role in every segment and keeps things alive at all times. But there are also times when it ends up overdosing itself with too much oddity, plus not all its attempts at humour hit the right spot.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the film packs a colourful cast, many of whom would later go on to make a name for themselves. The eponymous character is played by Michael Cera but he's easily overshadowed by others, namely Mary Elizabeth Winstead & Brie Larson who chip in way better as his future & ex girlfriend respectively. Best of all, however, is Kieran Culkin who play his roommate.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is funny, fizzy & freakish in all ways imaginable, and is guaranteed to garner a devoted fan following but its uncontrolled zest & sharp tonality may turn out to be either too much or too less for those who are looking for something bit more meaningful here. While I wasn't blown away by its quirky nature & zany wit, its wild, vigorous & ebullient delights cannot be downplayed."
"genemorrissey","10","1","1","18 May 2017"," This is the best movie ever!
","It took me too watches of this film to settle on my opinion of it. I knew i liked it when I first watched it but i had to watch it a second time to find out if it was the greatest movie every made, and i've settled on an answer, and that yes. I could say this movie was incredible in every way and should be worshiped, but that would be doing it an injustice. Edger Wright uses screen transitions and shoots fight scenes will make your mouth drop open, there's not a single scene in this movie that isn't interesting or one that won't make you laugh. The dialogue is so amazing and clever and there's no jokes that go to waist. I always love it when a comedy movie or TV show takes every single chance they can to be funny and Scott Pilgrim definitely does. the way characters talk, the way the camera moves, the sound effects, the fight scenes, the first thing you hear in the entire film will make you laugh its incredible. Not only that but every single performance is great. You can tell that everyone on set was having such a good time and they really got into there roles. Anna Kendrick as Scotts sister, Kieran Culkin as his gay room mate, Chris Evens gives his best performance as an arrogant actor (wonder how he got into character), and of cause Michal Cera as Scott pilgrim himself. I understand that this movie may not be for everyone, it's a little weird and might come across as style over substance but for me, no movie i've ever seen has come close to being as good as it, its the best movie ever made."

","I was very impressed with this film. I really like Michael Cera as an actor and also the movies he has work on. I loved the edition of the film because it is original and different and off course very well done. The screenplay is awesome because first it starts normal and as it goes on there is a plot twist and then at the end you finally understand everything. Also the idea of them having a band, and the girl with rollers and changes of hair color. Each scene that came, things become weirder but in a very good sense, I loved it. Personally I recommend everyone to watch this movie; specially if you like color full details and originality."
"pennyelenabooks","6","1","1","8 August 2015"," Good enough
","Scot fells in love with Ramona, but he has to defeat her seven exes first before finally getting her. The movie has an odd way of showing things and the time line is so messed up, that it easily get from one scene to an entirely different one. But that, I think, was the best part of the movie. The film combines music, with comics and video games. There are graphics, even voices, coming from the graphic novels. Of course, after the first few scenes, you start to realize that this is not a non fiction movie, as exes with special powers start to appear. One thing that I didn't like was the cliché of the action scenes and maybe some parts of the story. But all in all, it was quite funny and entertaining, so 6 out of 10."
"Semisonic","7","1","1","29 July 2015"," Unexpectedly good and inexplicably funny
","All i knew about this film prior to watching it is that he has Michael Cera doing the main role. It may mean nothing to some, but those who had seen movies starring Cera before might get a clue or two. And i don't mean it strictly in a good way.<br/><br/>Actually, since i first saw Michael in Superbad, he had one stable trait about his characters... they are all the same. Literally. He's always this kinda shy and awkward, nerdy but at the same time sorta streetwise type of guy of undefinable age, the one you wouldn't hate straight away but who you still wouldn't envy even if he got the hottest babe in the show. And if we add his constant grimace of a puppy who just sh@t himself a moment ago and is all sorry about that, i would expect his puppy charms to wear off rather quickly and the frustration to take over.<br/><br/>But at the same time, no matter how single-dimensional Michael's characters are, this ""i'm shy and gentle"" trick almost never fails to work. It definitely worked in Superbad, where Michael Cera and Jonah Hill duet played some Kyle&Eric sort of magic which, with help of other characters like legendary McLovin, made the film equally fun, deep and touching. In Juno, it was Ellen Page's turn to fill Cartman's place, which she did brilliantly, which also added to the film's overall success.<br/><br/>Here, in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there's no single teammate whom Michael Cera's character of a guy with a complicated approach to relationships could play along. Instead, there's a whole bunch of friends, foes and love interests who swirl around him in a sick (in a good way) mix of garage rock, 8-bit games and comic book extravaganza. Which means, this time Michael has to prove that he can be a single locomotive for the big show.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes of the film weren't too reassuring on this account. They are without a doubt visually creative, and this is probably the first time after Sin City that style does not only overcome substance but becomes a source of it. Yet, the character of Scott Pilgrim itself is what looks like a main drawback. I mean, our guy is still cute and naive, but there's something missing, some driving force that could turn that series of awkward and silly moments into something substantial.<br/><br/>And then the miracle happens. Once we finally get to know Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character of a femme who's literally fatale, the story gets a major kick up the butt, and apparently Scott's personality too, because he starts demonstrating will, determination and skills we never got to expect from Michael Cera's fragile and semi-vegetative characters. Can't say this transformation looks very natural, but naturality is the last thing one should expect from a movie that looks more a comic book than a typical cinema.<br/><br/>Maybe this visual surrealism is the main defining point of Scott Pilgrim vs the World. Because what might otherwise be somewhat bland and boring transforms into a unique sort of fun, something i never had a chance to experience since Kick-Ass and The Green Hornet, which was years ago for me. The action scenes are equally intense and bizarre, which makes them all the more unpredictable and satisfying.<br/><br/>Yet there's more to this film than just the action, visuals and the raw energetics of the whole performance. There's this trademark Canadian approach to life that this movie teems with: from the little comedic episodes, sketches and phrases to the characters to the whole entourage. Not as self-absorbed as the typical American everything, more willing to have a joke on itself, maybe even insecure in some ways, but still with enough soul to incur rather sympathy than abasement. As if the film plays its strengths and weaknesses open but relies on your good will to expect forgiveness rather than judgement.<br/><br/>This is the main message this movie sends us by its ending. That whoever we are and whatever we've done, the most important thing is to be able to accept ourselves and those who surround you. Not that big of a philosophical breakthrough, but still satisfying enough to leave a generally pleasant aftertaste. The same could be said about the movie as a whole. Very solid, with both the unique sides and the touching moments. Maybe not breaking enough rules nor touching enough sore spots to really stand out as a film to be remembered across generations. But aiming for that would be too pompous and pretentious, which isn't how they do things in Canada. After all, there's nothing wrong with just good ol' entertainment."
"RbDeraj","6","1","1","10 June 2015"," Really Plays to the Teen Generation of the New Millennium
","Michael Cera is an awkward genius as he has proved before in many of his other works with best example probably being Superbad. This movie was no exception and his and the others' acting was all something to be proud of. The story held very true to the comic. A few details were shifted around and a few minor ones omitted but it still worked well. The graphic novel had a little more depth and character development which would have been nice in the movie adaptation but it also would have extended it to an undesirable length. The whole video game feel worked much better in the film medium rather than the comic. The music and bands were pure brilliance with songs that I think could be actual catchy hits. Bryan Lee O'Malley definitely created a strange but fun type of story that plays a lot to the teen generation of the new millennium. It combines elements like hipsterism, 20-something unemployed slackers with their fates resting in the success of their band, the music scene, fads like veganism, making fun of pop culture, and is really aimed at a generation raised on video games and the drama that goes on with dating and young life. One thing I found unexplainable was that the characters were grounded in real life but when the insane fights happen they seem to be no big deal. Also the subspace highway was never really explained same as the book. It was a fun, laughable, and entertaining 112 minutes."
"Botsu","7","1","1","2 March 2014"," Modern-day Love Story Will Conquer Your Heart
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, based off the excellent graphic novel series is a spot-on roller-coaster of flash AND substance for fans of video games, the Scott Pilgrim comics or strip culture as a whole alike. The story of Scott Pilgrim's struggle for glory fighting his new girlfriend's seven evil ex-boyfriends to continue dating her doesn't have much going for it per se, but Scott's charming character, growing increasingly confident throughout the movie saves the movie story wise, as you really care for him. What's left is flashy, comic-book/video-game style action: if 1-up's and grotesque ""POW"" sound effects and a sick garage rock OST sound like your cup of tea, the whole movie will probably be worth its while for you, if not, don't even bother."
"diac228","9","11","32","13 August 2010"," True Gamers, this film is for you.
","Excellent soundtrack? Check. Great attention to detail? Check. Excellent visual effects? Check. Plethora of funny moments and witty dialogue? Check. Zelda reference? Check, and check. Scott Pilgrim easily ranks as the greatest video game film of all-time. In a cinematic world full of video game movies that fail to capture the detail, pacing, and magic of gaming, we have Scott Pilgrim showing how its done. Superbly directed by Edgar Wright and followed by a great cast of actors and actresses, this film is perfect for the gaming culture, and the deeper you are embedded in the cult world of video games, the more you will enjoy this flick. Word of warning, if you aren't that much into the sub-culture of video games and all its glory, you may not see this film as epic as it truly is.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is about a slacker bassist of an underground band (Michael Cera) bouncing around depression and attempted recovery after a tough break-up. While messing around with a high school girl (Ellen Wong), Scott discovers the woman of his dreams, the beautiful, mysterious, and hip Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But she comes with baggage: a slew of evil exes that Scott must defeat. Based off of the successful underground comics of Bryan Lee O'Malley, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is unlike anything you've ever read; and with the thanks of Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz), unlike anything you've ever seen. It is tough condensing multiple volumes of a detail-frantic comic book into a movie, but Wright and Michael Bacall did a great job translating the energy, speed, and silliness of the comics into film.<br/><br/>Michael Cera gets a bad reputation for being a one-trick pony, someone who does the same type of performance. This is both incorrect, and not really his fault. His scrawny, thin, deadpan look can only get him certain types of roles in Hollywood (he reminds me of the slew of Italian actors that are seen in nearly every mobster/mafia flick of the 90s and 2000s---good actors, but typecast because of the way they look). But if you look at Youth in Revolt and Nick and Norah, you'll see a different side of Cera. In this case, we see a more desperate, less charming, not-as-likable but more ass-kicking Cera taking the spotlight. Then let's not forget the great scene-stealing performances of Ellen Wong, Chris Evans, Aubrey Plaza, and especially Kieran Culkin.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie reflects a video game better than any video game movie ever crafted. The 1960s Batman-like sound effect visuals are all over the place, the fights are exaggeratingly fast and epic, the hilarious subtle details are all over the place, the screen splits into multiple frames constantly, and even the slower sequences flow like cut-scenes of a game. Edgar Wright is perfect for the directing because of his kinetic-style of editing and direction (ex: Hot Fuzz). Perfect for those with ADD, the flick moves from one scene to the next with such quick pacing, entire days can pass through your eyes without you noticing. The battles themselves are so fast, only those with trained eyes (in the art of fast-paced gaming that is) can follow the insanity without giving up.<br/><br/>Now, with the movie being made specifically for those that dwell their lives into the culture, it might be an intimidation for those that don't appreciate the art of video games and the slackerish laid-back society it creates. If you don't know much about video games and all they have given us over the years, you'll see this as loud, crass, immature, and pointless. But, for those that have experienced 8-bit Mario and Zelda, enjoyed their Street Fighter II (and allllll their spin-offs), fumbled through Battletoads and Streets of Rage, and know the satisfaction of leveling-up to the ultimate level, you'll get a kick out of this, guaranteed. Just like Fight Club and its counter-culture anarchist ways, and Seinfeld and its New York City post-modern ideals, the more Scott Pilgrim represents you, the more you'll understand and love it.<br/><br/>Of course, with the fast-paced style of the movie and the calmer character-developing moments of the comic book, there is bound to hit a contradictory snag. Scott Pilgrim works best when it's fast-paced and with multiple witty jokes waiting right around the corner. So, whenever the movie has a small slowdown to give the characters time to grow and reflect, it really, really feels slow. And while it doesn't destroy the movie, it does slow down the third act, even with an epic final battle and light-hearted ending. After two strong acts, the third act had a tough time catching up. Wright's best is usually saved for last, with Hot Fuzz's final shootout being an excellent example. Luckily though, it isn't too much of a distraction thanks to the wonderful cast and the strong visuals that remain fun to watch throughout the rather-long running-time (for a video game movie that is).<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a perfect movie for gamers, and a perfect movie for those that appreciate the culture, diversity, insanity, and randomness of video games. The cast was great, the editing was flawless, and the directing was grand. While the third act left me desiring more and failed to live up to the strong first two acts, it remains a movie I strongly recommend if you own any type of old-school gaming system. Just like the comic book, Scott Pilgrim is epic, hilarious, fun to watch, and an absolute delight. Yet as previously stated, if you are not trained in the world of gaming, then this flick will unnerve and perhaps even scare you. Visually stimulating, insane, and out of control, Scott Pilgrim represents gaming on the big-screen like nothing I've ever seen before."

","It's sometimes career suicide when making a film based on already produced, cult-adored material because the material (TV show, comic book, video game) has a rabid fanbase. I'm not familiar with the six-volume, American manga series, ""Scott Pilgrim"" by Bryan Lee O'Malley, but its' cine-adaptation, ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World"" by Brit fanboy director Edgar Wright (""Shaun of The Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"" and the TV series ""Spaced"") is enough to make me a convert because it has the pulse of a heroin-addicted jackrabbit. Keep up, people! <br/><br/>No doubt Michael Cera (""Arrested Development"", Superbad"", ""Juno"") is geek-familiar in the title role, a twentysomething, struggling indie rocker in Toronto who either jams with his buds Stephen (Mark Webber), Kim (Allison Pill of ""Milk"") and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons of ""Jennifer's Body), hangs with his sharkish gay roommate Wallace (sly Kiernan Culkin of ""Lymelife"") or avoids the great buzz surrounding his ex-girl/rocker Envy Adams (Brie Larson of ""The United States of Tara"").<br/><br/>Barely legal high schooler Knives Chau (lively Ellen Wong) captures Scott's heart, but the relationship's deader than a corpse. Enter bright-haired, American immigrant and Amazon delivery girl on rollerblades Ramona Flowers (cute, deadpan Mary Elizabeth Winstead of ""Live Free Or Die Hard"") in the pictures, and it's ""Knives Who?"" in Scott's head. Ramona returns his ""love jones"" but her seven ex-lovers (two are twins and one's a girl!) show up, mean and super-powered, forcing our hero into wild anime/video game duels, complicating his already shaky love life.<br/><br/>If you understand the visual languages of anime, American and Japanese comic book, video games and indie rock, which are jam-packed in the script by Wright and Michael Bacall (co-wrote/starred in ""Manic""), good for you because the average moviegoer would get a brain aneurysm. The co-writers know all the fringe pop culture storytelling tricks and hugs them: speed lines during battles; side commentary; captions introducing characters and locales, illustrating audio effects (a la the 1960s ""Batman"" TV series) and noting life points; limbo-like dreams; characters changing hairstyles and costumes; facial wild takes and enemies turning into coins after defeat. It's an assault on the eyes and ears, but film begs and deserves multiple viewings, especially on DVD.<br/><br/>Nobody has a gray hair, sagging chin or an AARP membership card in the cast, but they have old souls, especially the two leads. Cera may be a typecast victim, but his role has a backbone, attracting Winstead's dour but colorful heart. The aforementioned supporting players are damn good gonzo; no cast of a TV teen drama could defeat them! Even the ""sane"" ones, popinjay-like, steel-eyed clerk Julie Powers (Aubrey Plaza of ""Parks and Recreation"") and Scott's hard-fact older sib Stacey (Anna Kendrick of ""Up In The Air"") fit in the madness. Bill Hader (also of ""Superbad"") is interesting the unseen voice.<br/><br/>You also can't forget The League of Evil-Exes, a bunch of self-loving nut-jobs, Scott must handle one by one. Standouts include Chris Evans (who's been in a lot of comic book cine-adaptations since 2005) as a cocky action movie star; Brandon Routh (""Superman Returns"" and a unfairly controversial-by-fan guest run on the geek spy series ""Chuck"") as a strict vegan guitarist/ Envy's current beau; Mae Whitman as a feisty lesbian with a metal whip and Jason Schwartzman (""Rushmore"", ""Bored To Death"") as a slimy music industry power broker/the gang's leader.<br/><br/>Like ""Sin City"", ""Watchmen (The Ulitmate Cut)"" and ""Kick-Ass"", ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" is another true-blue cine-adaptation of a comic book/graphic novel that gives the finger to conformistic, maturity attitudes while being mature in the process. Not a lot of people will ""get it""(thanks ADD!!!), but give it time. Until ""Tron Legacy"", the film's probably the most video game-centric around. If they see this, hard-core gamers will refrain from drowning their sorrows in Yoo-Hoo, after being exposed to drek like ""Double Dragon"" and the ""Street Fighter"" films (not the Sonny Chiba films, mind you)."

"PopcornJury","7","6","15","29 November 2010"," Nerds unite...Scott Pilgrim is one of the most fun movies of the year, barring you're a 16-26 year old male who likes video games and Asian Catholic school girls.
","Scott Pilgrim is one of the most fun movies I've seen all year. Sure, it's marketed towards nerds, gamers, and comic book geeks, but that doesn't mean it's not accessible to the average movie goer, or at least the average male movie goer ages 16-26. It's cute, energizing, and entertaining with good music, hot chicks, and some hardcore, sword fighting, skateboard slinging, karate chop chopping battle scenes that look like they were ripped out a Street Fighter vs. Speed Racer online battle. Enough with the nerd lingo though, let's get to the plot.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim got his heart broken. His rebound is a 17 year old Asian Catholic high school girl. It doesn't get anymore cliché than that. She's cute, but annoying, and when he meets the new girl, with enough pink hair and indie outerwear to make an emo boy drool, he undoubtedly falls in love. The problem? For some reason, the new girl has seven evil exes, all bound to make an appearance on the battle field when Scott least expects it. What follows is hot, hilarious, and, at times, outrageous with scenes that give any recent action flick a run for it's money when it comes to entertainment.<br/><br/>Regardless of the high energy adrenaline that runs through Scott Pilgrim, you've got to wonder, is it funny? I can say wholeheartedly that I laughed, at times, out loud. It's little nuances that Michael Cera has down to a T, that truly make the movie. I can't necessarily say why he's so funny in this film (and I didn't particularly like him in Juno), but he is. Rather than model the character after the comic book, it seems like the character was almost carved out of Cera himself. What results is very frequently funny.<br/><br/>So what are the negatives? For one, the film is a little bit long. Not only are there seven battle scenes, but some of them are drawn out way too long (especially the final scene). There is such a thing as too much of a good thing, and in Scott Pilgrim, we see it. Also, there isn't always enough differentiation between battles. By the end of the movie, things feel a bit stale and fall a bit flat as opposed to the opening scenes that set the stage. Lastly, as much as I praise Cera for his spot on performance in the film, I also have to give him a slightly negative critique when looking at his character because he is such a loser, yet he manages to score some really sexy chicks. I know it's a movie and anything is possible, but seriously, Scott Pilgrim wouldn't be in the running for any of these girls regardless of what band he's in.<br/><br/>All in all, Scott Pilgrim offers some good, fun, mindless entertainment. It's smart, funny, cute, and cuddly, and I'd especially recommend it for teenagers and males ages 16-26. Would I recommend it to my parents? No. The indie guy down the hall that watches foreign films? No. The film student who prefers documentaries? No. Anyone looking for a fun tribute to video games, heartache, and progressive rock music?

","Scott Pilgrim is an amazing, funny, action packed, physical and over all hysterical new approach to cinema. After seeing this film again and again i still keep saying to myself ' Just once more..'! The plot follows the story of Scott Pilgrim played by Michael Cera, an average music and girl loving Kid. He gets with a girl 5 years younger than him called Knives Chau who soon becomes his and his bands number one fan. When he is at a party he meets Ramona Flowers played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. After finding out she works for Amazon Delivery he orders a package and asks her out. Then one night at his bands gig he gets confronted by Matthew Patel otherwise known as, 'Evil Ex No.1' Then Ramona tells him in order to have a relationship he must defeat her seven evil exes. And from then on Scott Pilgrim is nothing but a hilarious action packed thrill ride NOT for all the family i must say.<br/><br/>Favourite Quote: 'You're Bi-Curious Now I'm Bi-Furious!!'

","Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is directed by Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) and stars Michael Cera ( Superbad, Arrested Development) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Death Proof, Live Free or Die Hard). The film takes place in modern day in Toronto, Canada and the genre I would say is a fantasy/rom-com AKA fantaromcom.<br/><br/>The film is about how a boy, Scott Pilgrim (Cera), who is depressed due to the fact that he still really likes a girl who broke up with him a year ago and currently is dating a 17 year old high school girl. But then he sees a girl, Ramona Flowers (Winstead), who he instantly is attacted to and is obsessed with. Little does he know though is that in order for him to date Ramona Flowers he has to defeat, not fight but defeat, her seven evil ex boyfriends (and one happens to be a girl, ooh my). As the film goes on he has to balance his romantic life with his band and also has to have many fights (who new Michael Cera was the next Arnold Schwarzenegger?). Don't forget about his high school girlfriend though, who in my opinion is the best part of the film.<br/><br/>The first aspect of the filmmaking I want to talk about is the writing. It is an extremely traditional storyline with a little spice in it. It was boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Extremely predictable. The only thing different is the obstacle Scott Pilgrim had to go through was to defeat the seven evil ex boyfriends and that was pretty straight forward (just extremely stylized). This film was not very funny. The only funny parts of the movie were with Scott Pilgrim's Asian girlfriend. Also, it was very unrealistic how Scott Pilgrim just happened to be such a talented fighter, at least if after the first fight he made a little joke that he used to take Karate it would have been better. Edgar Wright's previous films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were much better written because they were so clever, but then again those films had actual funny people, not Michael Cera. Maybe Wright should stick to spoofs when he writes.<br/><br/>The direction of this film was the strongest part of the film. While the writing was boring and the comedy was weak there was some very interesting special effects to watch during the fight scenes and all the little captions that came up were interesting. This film was extremely stylized and it truly overpowered the writing of the film. Edgar Wright proves that he is a noteworthy director, but has not yet proved that he is a great one.<br/><br/>The acting in this film was subpar, Cera proved that he can only play one part for the rest of his life and will stick with it. Winstead did nothing special just reading her lines with a not caring tone. Chris Evans gave a good performance for his minor role as Lucas Lee, the second evil ex-boyfriend, being like a Steven Seagal like actor. All the other supporting characters acted decently no one really stole the movie maybe the Asian girlfriend did a little better than decent.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is not very good a weak 5/10 I give it. The only reason I don't give it a 4 is because of the direction by Edgar Wright, he was very good at that.

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is FANTASTIC. I love the comics and could not be happier with how this turned out. Now, it must be said that when it comes to retelling the story as it is presented in the comic, it does not directly follow it. However, I had absolutely no issue with the things they changed. When it comes down to it, this movie does the best job staying true to the ATTITUDE and the FEEL of its source material out of every movie I have ever seen where I was also familiar with both the book/video game/graphic novel/comic. All the characters are spot on.. from Scott to Knives to Ramona and everyone else. Precisely how I would have envisioned them while reading the comics. The various video game reference are spectacular, and there are even some other great surprise references that I won't mention because it make it all that more exciting when they come up. If you think the idea of demon hipster chicks and vegan police sounds pretty funny to watch, or if the thought of an epic of epic epicness (great tagline that captures it perfectly) sounds pretty wicked, I would say you need to check this out."

","'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is at first joyous, sweet-spirited, funny and speedy, and looks to be one of 2010's most enjoyable films, but sadly I quickly found all the sounds, music, snappy editing and dialog tiresome and wearying. Michael Cera plays his ordinary self well, and some of the early scenes with him are very good, but his comic timing and charm gets bony as the packed story starts going. In a fantasy world like Scott Pilgrim (Cera) lives he fights for love, a love that seems like a teenage daydream-crush, and it becomes a problem when I as a viewer really can't root for the girl he falls in love with, and so forth their relationship. The story becomes quite confusing throughout, mostly because the characters are one-minded drawn out in single scenes, before quickly adapting and moving along in the adventure. When Scott faces all the evil ex-boyfriends of his love to fight, he challenges them all in battle-scenes which are too long, noisy and alike, and although I know it's just a childlike film full of wonders and crowd-pleasers, I have to question the twisted plot which involves a supposedly right-minded main character who dumps a genuinely sweet girl and treats her harshly, or the mysterious rock girl who entangles Scott into a web of 'my dad is bigger than yours' games, or that messed up ending? This film feels like it was written by some pop-cultural geek who's been sitting too long in his room fantasizing flashy about fighting big battles for this dreamy love that he hasn't totally figured out who actually is."

","i had a lot of fun watching this movie, so i'm giving 10/10 without any hesitation. it is a very ""today"" movie - very flashy and very pop - and if you wanna let go any back thoughts and simply enjoy it, very much live you'd enjoy some new music band even if someone says it plays along many clichés, but you like it despite that. to me, of course, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" was very innovative. the comics-like format, the funny lines, the likable characters...everything built up am experience that true cinema should provide. we live in times when it is very hard, if not impossible, to create something truly new. so you often find yourself building on what essentially is a stack of clichés. but as in chess a new superb game can be played following a known pattern, in any art, you can still be innovative and creative and productive. ""Scott Pilgrim..."" achieves this. it somehow reminded me of ""Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0194530/) which was also fun, and also with and original format. ""Kick-Ass"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1250777/) is also close in presentation and an attempt for novelty. hope for more of these...of course too many would soon create a line of clichés, which we would have to escape by looking for another art, and maybe then you'd look back at these movies and label them pointless clichés, but here and now...the search for love continues :)"

"pyrocitor","10","7","19","27 August 2010"," Audiences: No Clue (what they're missing) → Edgar Wright: Gets It
","It is always truly delightful to see a major motion picture take a real chance, blending a daringly new angle into a familiar template and culminating in a doubly enjoyable final product. Director Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is such a triumph, undertaking a cocktail of manic energy and charm, dazzling visuals, unassumingly quirky humour, while still boasting an unmistakable (albeit pixilated) heart. Nonetheless, the film's poor box office suggests that many audiences and/or distributors are finding the idea of the film alienating (too nerdy? Too stylized? Too young and hip? Too Canadian?). However, at the risk of being excessively blunt, such concerns are largely unwarranted and, for the most part, missing the point. For while Scott Pilgrim may seemingly the tailor made film for those old enough to remember classic Zelda yet young enough to still have played it, the film's true genius lies in its fundamental accessibility, hitting all the right notes to delight fans of Brian Lee O'Malley's graphic novels without alienating those unfamiliar with any variety of geekdom. <br/><br/>While video game and comic book adaptations have become quite common multiplex fare of late, there is still something that feels so fundamentally unique and crisp about a film set in a more overt overlap between 'reality' and the physics and credulity bending of the aforementioned media. Even just by considering how much astronomical thought and care were invested into the minutiae of the production (the film opens with an 8-bit, classic video game style Universal logo, and throwaway references to any number of cultural texts abound – watch for 'Launchpad McQuack'), the film boasts such a determined earnestness that it is nigh impossible not to love. Wright, expanding upon the same wild yet harnessed hilarity he exercised in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, strikes a perfect tone and pace, with quick cutting, hip dialogue and a potentially disjointed and episodic story flowing without a single stumble or hitch. Equally, the whimsical visual effects (ranging from electric bolts dancing across the screen when Pilgrim's band, Sex Bob-Omb, play, to visual sound effects punctuating brutal Evil-Ex battles, to throwaway touches such as a ""pee bar"") never threaten to overwhelm the story. <br/><br/>Yes, story. For, while the film may be an admittably hard sell (the protagonist must battle his love interest's Seven Evil Exes in wildly choreographed video game style fights to be with her? !), Scott Pilgrim is as far as can be from mere hyperactive, flashy cinematic noise. Instead, Wright continually draws the focus back to the emotional heart of the story, paradoxically seeking intrinsic realism through fantasy and achieving both the most and least believable film in ages. Tapping into the obsessions, neuroses and hang-ups of a lovelorn, confused, whiney, aimless, occasionally downright dislikeable yet always lovable 22 year old and vibrantly letting them loose on screen, Wright's film proves far more resonant and truthful than first glance would suggest. The film's set pieces, the battles with Ramona Flowers' evil exes, apart from being exhilarating blends of blinding choreography and visual trickery, ultimately prove cunningly symbolic vehicles for the characters' largely unresolved emotional conflicts being hashed out with the sort of gleeful violence any frustrated young adult is bound to want to wreak on their nearby environment. Between the stomping, hard rock score (much of it performed by the cast), Scott Pilgrim could prove one of the most cathartic movies ever. <br/><br/>Also, on a personal note, it is rather heartwarming to see an unabashedly Canadian big budget action movie, for once set in Toronto and not 'Toronto posing as New York'.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, all considered, it is the ensemble cast who truly elevate the film to its triumphant heights. Michael Cera, finally provided more nuance than his usual neurotic misfits, is perfectly cast as Scott Pilgrim, his nearly unmatchable comic timing and ability to bleed charm and charisma even at his most whiney, clueless and unsympathetic making Scott a supremely relatable and enjoyable emotional foil. Mary Elizabeth Winstead does a remarkable job of humanizing her idolized Ramona Flowers, as every time Flowers appears too aloof and distant to truly take to, Winstead's eyes radiate a heartbreaking sense of empathy and self-regret, culminating in a beautifully understated yet effective performance. Similarly, Ellen Wong alternates between irresistibly adorable, hilariously obsessive and quietly tragic as Scott's scorned high school girlfriend Knives, the three forming an unorthodox yet perfectly pitched romantic triangle. <br/><br/>As Pilgrim's 'supporting characters', Kieran Culkin just about steals the show as Scott's bemusedly detached gay roommate Wallace, Anna Kendrick chatters with comical scorn as his sister, and Mark Webber, Johnny Simmons and Alison Pill are side-splitting as Pilgrim's meager yet impressive band (Pill, in particular, being graced with one of the most hilarious deadpans in cinema history). On the opposing team, each Evil-Ex in turn chomp the scenery with delicious aplomb, with standouts being Chris Evans' unforgettable Hollywood meathead, Brandon Routh as a snappy vegan with mystical powers, and Jason Schwartzman epitomizing sleaze as a smarmy record producer, though Satya Bhabha wins extra points for delivering one of the most unexpected song and dance numbers in recent memory as Flowers' vindictive first boyfriend. <br/><br/>Apart from being effectively the most satisfying translation of O'Malley's graphic novels any fan could hope for, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World proves the film to beat in terms of fusing a bravely niche approach into good, old fashioned, accessible entertainment without ever sacrificing on edge, hilarity or even complexity and never compromised by its genre trappings. Near essential viewing and better on ever watch, Wright delivers a true KO of a film, if ever there was one. <br/><br/>-10/10"
"michaelthonger","10","7","19","27 August 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs the simple minded (box office)
","When talking about Scott Pilgrim vs The World, there are two topics to cover:<br/><br/>1. This film is sublime. It is the best possible adaptation of the comics (done with real love and respect for the source material, unlike corporate shill like X-Men origins: Wolverine or Spider-man 3), done by a director who is still perfect in his quality track record. The soundtrack and cinematography naturally blend to keep you entertained, and the strong script and compelling performances keep you invested. All this, and it is hilarious! Every actor plays their part perfectly (especially the evil exes- a huge feat when you take their relatively small amount of screen time into account. IMO, Brandon Routh was the funniest, and Jason Schwatrzman was the best villain). Michael Cera delivers easily the best performance of his career, Mary Elizabeth Winstead serves as far more than eye candy, and the comic relief is pitched at just the right level. I am not a hipster at all (Hipster music isn't usually my cup of tea at all!), but this has to be the most entertaining soundtrack of the decade- fun, bombastic, and surprisingly immersive (I was inspired to learn Beck's acoustic ballad 'Ramona' immediately!). The visuals and choreography are incredible and never become too intrusive. This is one of my favourite films of the decade, and I have seen it twice since its release (I hope to see it a third time. The last time I was this keen on rewatching a film was 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'- I must have a thing for movies with great direction, comedians playing relatively serious roles, and girls who dye their hair!!), which leads me on to the second topic;<br/><br/>2. As I left the cinema with my friend (she loved it as well), we met up with her friends. When we told them what we'd just seen, they said 'ugh, please tell me you didn't see that. It sounds so stupid!'. Needless to say, her friends aren't the brightest people, as they couldn't grasp the concept of parody (to them, Vampires suck is parody!) or tongue-in-cheek premises. I imagine this is the attitude of most people who didn't see it, and why it has flopped commercially. While I'm sure it will have a healthy run on DVD with its critical praise, and will build a larger fanbase over time when people get over the ridiculous 'OMG Hipsters!' mindset, it's still mildly disappointing to think that The Expendables, Vampires Suck and Grownups will gross more worldwide. We finally get something really refreshing in the film industry- something that isn't a pathetic Oscar hopeful or a bloody 80s remake, and the public doesn't care! It seems stupid and really unfair. However- a word of encouragement to the fans; those people are idiots! Is it really such an unexpected tragedy if someone chose Vampires Suck over this? if they chose Vampires Suck, do they really deserve decent cinema? Do they sound like the type of person who would really appreciate the amount of love and skill poured into Scott Pilgrim vs the World? The people who wanted to try something different and enjoy a great film did- the loss of money's a shame, but the film is better than I could ever have wished for!<br/><br/>In short; see the film if you haven't, don't fret too much about the box office (Spaced, another Edgar Wright directoral effort, took years after it first aired to become popular, and it is now regarded as one of the best sitcoms of all time), and a colossal 'Well Done' to everyone involved!!!"
"timoburke","10","7","19","25 August 2010"," Industry Lesson
","Question: How do awful ad-campaigns (such as for this great film) get studio-approved, much less paid for? I would really look into that, Industry Folks. <br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes = 80+ score, with great Comment: ""In 20 yrs the other summer movies will be forgotten but this movie will still be watched"".<br/><br/>Clearly the people creating the ads didn't know what to do with this cutting-edge gem of a film, so they just stuck a quick pic of a kid on an electric guitar then tried to sell it as 'Iconic' or some shite. Really, I am trying to imagine the gazillions of better images to more successfully capture movie-goers attention, that could have been presented, rather than what they ended up using.<br/><br/>The problem is there needs to be hipness in the eye of the beholder which marketing staff clearly often lack, but what's up with the studio decision-makers approving uncompelling ads?"

This is a cult classic to me and should go down as such. This is one of the best live, video game flicks ever. And BTW, it not only covers gaming. It covers geeky/nerdy/hipster/pop cultures and so much more. I haven't found one person yet who doesn't love this movie. And the music was fantastic. I'm in my 40's, a geek, and I LOVE this movie. I wouldn't change a thing. Everyone played their role perfectly, the fighting and effects were great! This was an all-around fantastic flick.

","Take every genre that can be adapted into a film, then slightly go beyond that, and you will find this film categorized under that utterly creative and unique blend. Mixed with a visual style that moves like a video game but captured into the theme of a comic, while amplified by musical exchanges that resonate like a live concert, this film is a rare compilation that manages to reach every level flawlessly, without becoming too cliché or complicated that a wide audience cant appreciate the subtle nuances that make it so imaginative. With a young cast that is superbly led by Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead but wonderfully supported by Allison Pill, Ellen Wong, Kieran Culkin and so many others, every character is essential to what makes this film so fulfilling. Yet, underneath this cinematic marvel there is also meaningful insight into relationships and love, its capacity to fail and in those rare instances succeed, even when it feels like every obstacle is in the way."

","Hello everybody who likes to read excellent reviews! well done to you. From the opening credits to the end scene, this film is one of my all time favourite comedies. It is some of Edgar Wright's finest work, it is almost certainly some of Micheal Cera's finest moments, and it really is a change of style to the gross out comedies that seem to have inflicted cinema and TV screens over the past few years. I am not going to bore you with going through the plot, as nobody reads reviews for that, they read them to canvas the viewing audience's opinion. Instead i will merely say this to you.<br/><br/>IF YOU WANT TO SEE ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, WATCH THIS.<br/><br/>Wow that was a bit much. Anyway, if you are still reading this and haven't been scared off by the angry text i previously displayed, then let me talk you through why you should see this, or more to the point, why I saw this.<br/><br/>I missed this whilst it was at the cinema, and wasn't to keen from the reviews i had heard from it. I expected it to be another let down like most comics that have been converted into films (apart from Sin City, love that film.) A few weeks after it had been showing on Sky, my girlfriend at the time said that we should watch this film. As we had just began to start dating, everything was fresh and exciting, and as we could barely keep our hands off each other, this film blended into the background at first. But as i moved my now ex girlfriend aside to focus fully on the film (ohhh maybe thats why i am now single?) i wish i hadn't of wasted all that time at the beginning by heavy petting (yep, definitely why i am now single!) <br/><br/>This film is hilarious, in every way a film can be. Excellent fast pacing, with some truly great performances along the way. Micheal Cera is at his best, but also the one liners from Alison Pill (who plays drummer of Sex Bob-omb Kim) are pure comedy gold. Also, the performance of Scott's roommate Wallace (played by Keiran Culkin) is one to watch out for.<br/><br/>This film should be watched by everyone on the planet, a pure work of art from everyone involved!"

I'm 13, but I'm a huge cinephile, so I watched lots and lots of great and acclaimed movies, and by far this is one of the best I've ever seen. The edition of this movie is the best ever. I just can't believe you guys disliked this film. Come on, the way Edgar Wright turned the graphic novel (that you should read, by the way) into a movie is incredible. I felt like I was in a video game, or inside a comic book. The songs, the battles, everything! In my opinion, this movie is the new Blade Runner... In 10 years you'll all regret what you said about it. I can't write much more than this, because this movie is just indescribable.

"thefonz750","10","4","9","25 January 2011"," Great action/comedy with a love story thrown in. All for the Nintendo generation.
","I, for one, was not impressed with the trailer for this movie. I had never heard of the graphic novel at the time. Basically, I never planned to go see it at the theater. I don't know if it was the lack of marketing or maybe bad timing.<br/><br/>I will never base another movie off of just the trailer alone. This is an amazing movie and I feel like I missed out on an amazing experience by not seeing it in a theater. Edgar Wright(Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz) does an amazing job while completely changing gears from his normal style of directing.<br/><br/>At the beginning, the story itself isn't that unique. Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) has a girlfriend and he's in a band. He's kind of a jerk. He finds a new girl that he likes better. It's when he goes out with this new girl, Ramona(Mary Elizabeth Winstead), that things start getting interesting.<br/><br/>I'll admit, it starts off fairly slow at the beginning. That changes all too quickly as the usual stumbling, bumbling Michael Cera(Superbad, Juno) turns into a martial arts expert that has to fight off Ramona's seven evil exes. The visuals are extreme, as well as the soundtrack which revolves around a lot of the band's songs. Anyone from the Nintendo generation will get a kick out of these, as there are multiple times when various scenes will include an homage to classics such as Mario.<br/><br/>These fights are all done in a unique manner and surprisingly well choreographed. Each of the evil exes are type-casted perfectly, in my opinion. From Chris Evans(Fantastic Four, Captain America) playing the over-the-top bad boy, to Brandon Routh(Superman Returns) and Jason Schwartzman playing their roles perfectly. Great supporting roles done by Anna Kendrick(Twilight) and Kieran Culkin(who is hilarious in this). Ellen Wong makes her major motion-picture debut and impresses. <br/><br/>If you are a member of the Nintendo generation(or just a fan of video games in general), or if you like music, or if you like comics, or are a fan of pop culture, or if you want to just have a really fun movie experience done superbly by the director, Edgar Wright, then you need to check out this movie."
"movieevangelist","10","4","9","25 January 2011"," Review: Scott Pilgrim vs The World
","The Pitch: The Young Person's Guide to Love. (Insert 1 x 50p to play)<br/><br/>The Review: Cinema as a medium is threatened, if you believe the popular press. We now prefer to watch movies in our comfy home cinemas and IMAX and 3D are touted as the last hopes of cinema chains keeping people seeing movies where they were meant to be seen. But the thing that will actually keep people coming back is good storytelling, and what the great movies of 2010 are starting to show is that it's the layers of depth of storytelling, and indeed of many other facets of the production, that will get people engaged and keep them returning.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright's first two movies have had that feeling of layers, working so well at a broad level but also with the finest details polished and then joined together in often unexpected ways. Other than the obvious directorial touches, though, it's been difficult to tell exactly who contributed what in the two Edgar Wright-Simon Pegg collaborations, so seamless has the join been. What's now abundantly clear is that Wright can blend just as seamlessly with the right material of others as well, and has honed from Bryan Lee O'Malley's comics something that actually feels a level up (if you'll pardon the pun) from his first two movies, unlikely as that may seem. Wright's had a slightly ADD directorial style at times, but one that still fit the vast majority of the material at hand, but here the flourishes are subtle, and ramped up over the course of the running time.<br/><br/>What's truly inspiring about Scott Pilgrim is how many different cultural themes are composed into the greater structure. Where Shaun took references from the zombie / horror genres and Fuzz raided action movie lockers and thrillers (with a smidgen of horror thrown in), Pilgrim is a love story to video games, comic books and indie / rock music, among others. As Ang Lee's Hulk proved, translating the visual style of a comic book directly to the screen can go wrong in the best of hands, but the comic book sensibility is retained very effectively, on-screen writing and captions giving a well-structured feel. Somehow, the video game aspects of the comic books form the basis for a visual frame of reference on top of that; as anyone who's played them will know, keeping your interest is nigh on impossible if you can't follow what's happening, but the action is well staged, always clear and progresses effortlessly up through the gears.<br/><br/>Through it all, character development is weaved in effortlessly to the tightly plotted but flowing story, and of course O'Malley's titanic contributions should not be understated here, having provided much of the meat, but the central pairing characters get to work through as many relationship issues and combinations as a whole Friends box-set, but in a way that feels refreshingly honest and ultimately powerfully cathartic for anyone that's made any mistakes in the past – which, let's be honest, should be most of us. That Pilgrim the movie covers so much ground in storytelling terms while successfully mining so many layers of modern culture is nothing short of breathtaking.<br/><br/>The cast, meanwhile are all pitch perfect and uniformly brilliant, but Cera, Winstead and Culkin should all be proud of what they've done here. Much is always made of Cera's seemingly repetitive performances, but he continues the trend of Youth In Revolt of twisting that persona just a little further each time, to winning effect here. Of the exes, Brandon Routh is a twisted highlight but you'll wish nearly all of them had about three times the amount of screen time, so enjoyable is the company of the characters and the performances. But more than the acting, Wright and his production team have assembled an embarrassment of riches in the craft departments; from musical collaborators including Nigel Godrich and Beck, through Brad Allen's stunt coordination to Bill Pope's cinematography, everyone has raised their game and the final product somehow manages to exceed expectations, which started pretty high.<br/><br/>It's the emotional depth, though, that takes this all the way up to the classic level. By the end you'll find yourself rooting for the characters and their eventual fates, and there's a delicious irony that this movie is about growing up when the cultural fabric it's woven from wants us to remain young at heart for ever. Overall, this is just another affirmation that Edgar Wright, in his own way, ranks alongside Christopher Nolan as one of the finest British directors of our times. Continue? Yes, please.<br/><br/>Why see it at the cinema: Despite all the above, there is one reservation; as with Shaun and Fuzz, there is probably an entry level for required knowledge to get from it as much as I did, in that knowing nothing about video games or comic books that aren't Spider-Man could hamper your enjoyment here in the same way that not knowing something about zombies or action movie clichés may not allow you get the most from those other movies. But the game-mimicking aspect ratio shifts and extraordinary level of detail really do deserve to be seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>The Score: 10 / 10"

","There is something to be said for movies with a tight plot, a realistic approach to the material being filmed, and perhaps a clear message..., or for movies that make us think deeply about certain topics or situations... (as long as they don't devolve into drab, monotonous affairs)<br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"", however, has nothing to do with any of those movies, instead it embraces and combines decades of pop culture with a fresh, insouciant approach that never fails to dazzle and entertain from the first minute to the last.<br/><br/>The recipe for this particular movie is pretty simple, one part video game, one part comic book (especially manga), one part adolescent comedy, and one part Honk Kong action movie. Add an array of visually stunning special effects, a generous amount of quirky jokes (that at times lovingly satirize the same pop culture the movie celebrates), time it to a steady beat of very enjoyable rock and pop songs, frame it all with creative, well above average camera work and you'll have a final product that plays like a breezy, silly romp through not only pop culture but also the subconscious of generation X survivors.<br/><br/>While other visually stunning movies, for instance Avatar, add a ponderous, clichéd, predictable morale, fortunately nothing of the sort interferes with the sheer, mindless fun of this amazing pop opera.<br/><br/>Now, it's true that this movie would probably look like an artifact from some distant alien civilization to people in their fifties or older, but I'm in my early forties myself and I could relate to all its elements, as I grew up enjoying all of them, and watching this film was a fun re-visitation of themes that accompanied my childhood, adolescence and maybe even early adulthood, adding a bittersweet element of nostalgia to the viewing experience. Kids still immersed in present pop culture obviously will not experience that, but I seriously doubt they'll fail to enjoy it, as it brings together so many themes they will be easily able to recognize..<br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim"" is not for people who somehow managed to grow up unaffected by pop culture, or high brow connoisseurs that want more than fun from films...... but if the elements of the recipe hold any attraction for you this gem of a movie will surprise you, thrill you and amuse you like few others ever do."

","I heard many good things about this movie before I went to see it. Even so, I didn't go in with too many expectations I wasn't disappointed. This was probably the most enjoyable movie I've seen so far this year. I walked out of the cinema with a smile on my face and there was even a spring in my step as I went over the preceding 112 minutes in my mind.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old living in Toronto, Canada with his gay flatmate, Wallace Wells. Scott plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-Omb which consists of Scott (of course), Kim Pine on drums, Stephen Stills on lead vocals and guitar and Young Neil as hanger-on. The band has ambitions to be famous and so have a gig coming up at a Battle of the Bands show. At the start of the film he is dating a seventeen year old schoolgirl called Knives Chau. Things seem to be going along quite well until Scott has a vision of a girl called Ramona Flowers. He becomes besotted by her and they end up hanging out together and eventually dating. Unfortunately Scott soon learns that if he wants to date Ramona he must first defeat her seven evil exe's! Can Scott defeat these evil exe's and win Ramona? What will Knives think of his infidelity? All these questions and many more remain to be answered until you've seen the film of course.<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, this was probably the most enjoyable film I've watched so far this year. I found the quirky mix of live action with comic book elements quite refreshing and it gave the film an interesting look and feel that I liked a lot! Great performances all round, especially from Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona Flowers, Kieran Culkin as Wallace Wells, Mark Webber as Stephen Stills, Alison Pill as Kim Pine and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau.<br/><br/>This will most certainly feature in my best of the year awards in December. It did start to lose me a bit towards the end, but I won't hold that against it. A really well made film which deserves the praise it has got (IMO). Well worth the entrance fee and very highly recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 8.3/10"

","Michael Cera films are close to home for me. Cera always plays a nerdish sort of loner character that I can relate to. Superbad and this are both films by him that I can put my shoes in his position. Scott Pilgrim is a graphic novel series that I never heard of until a few months ago after seeing a trailer for this film. Apparently, Scott Pilgrim is the character in his self titled graphic novel series in which five books were made with the first one being made about five years ago. Im unaware if this one focuses on just the second book (since both the second book and the movie share the same title) or if the movie is just an all around overview of the series. Whatever it is, its an excellent, 80s style, comic book movie combined with likable characters and a mindblowing soundtrack.<br/><br/>The standout of this movie is the soundtrack. The music by Scott Pilgrim's fictional band, ""Sex-Bab-Omb"" stands out totally. The music is so intense it shakes the screen whenever played. The music literally causes drawn lightning bolts and jittering of the camera when played which is awesome and gives you the feeling you're in the environment. Its a unique, almost indescribable feeling. Its so fast moving and energetic by the time you realized what happened a new scene appears. Its a feeling that can be had, unless you watch the film yourself.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty two year old slacker whos life activities are playing video games and in a band. Hes dating a seventeen year old High Schooler named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) in which he's gotten a lot of hate for by his sister and fellow band members. He frequently sees a girl in his dreams whom he saw at a record store not too long ago. He meets the girl who is Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Ramona is a quiet, shy woman, who is known for her frequent disappearances and mysterious personality. Her and Scott go steady for a while then after a random fight at a concert, Scott is told by Ramona that he needs to defeat her ""seven evil exes"" to continue dating her.<br/><br/>The film plays out like an arcade style game from the 1980s and various references to the video game ""Pac-Man"" confirm that as well. Every time one of the evil exes is defeated various coins explode out like a video game causing Scott to collect them which is strangely amusing. Director of this adventure, Edgar Wright has proved to be more than just capable of British Comedies doing Shaun of the Dead in 2004 and doing Hot Fuzz two years later. He is now shown to have a talent in graphic novel adaptations of other series he didn't start as well.<br/><br/>From the 16 bit like Universal intro I knew this was going to be a great film. It has some strange moments and sometimes the text on screen becomes annoying and somewhat tedious, but its definitely a teenage movie. Its a movie that should be enjoyed by people between the age of thirteen and thirty and by male audiences. Anybody with a knowledge of classic 80s and 90s video games will like this and the movie does a good job introducing the characters and their personalities to newcomers to the series (as am I). I will hunt for the graphic novels as I am interested in other events held by Scott Pilgrim.<br/><br/>One more thing that bothers me though is the film made a mere $10 million in its first week. It may seem fair, but with an estimated $80 million budget its abysmal. More people should see this because it's probably the most original movie in a while. It almost jumps off the screen without the use of the RealD technology which more movies should use. Movies shouldn't use 3D to jump off the screen. If they want to find a way to bring the audience suspense and feel like the third dimension without making them where glasswear, watch Scott Pilgrim and it'll show the way and the possibility of the action.<br/><br/>Starring: Michael Cera, Ellen Wong, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Directed by: Edgar Wright."

","This movie is strange. It is not going to be good if you can't accept that it isn't supposed to make sense. Scott Pilgrims alternate version of Toronto runs on video game rules. Everyone seems to be some sort of kung-fu master or have superpowers/magic weapons. At one point, Scott's band summons a giant ape made of lighting simply by playing really well, which then does battle with two giant energy dragons. Yeah. <br/><br/>The thing is, the movie is so good because this weirdness is hilarious once you accept it. The fight scenes, even though they were really good action scenes, had me laughing more than any of the jokes because of how ridiculous they are. Speaking of, the jokes are hilarious. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The action scenes are also freaking awesome, especially the final battle.<br/><br/>the weirdest thing about this movie is that beneath all the jokes and battles, it is a totally serious and mature movie. It has a lot to say about romance and relationships, but it is kept fun and accessible by processing the serious bits through filters of video games and comic books. Although it slowed down a bit at the end, this movie is meaningful without taking itself too seriously, and I love it. I definitely recommend you go see it. It would be a shame if a movie this good didn't do well."

","Touted as a cult-classic-in-the-making, I decided to check this out – despite being lukewarm on the director's popular earlier effort SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) – on the strength of the not dissimilar but far superior KICK-ASS (2010). This, in fact, concerns a geeky young man turning unexpectedly into a hero; still, it is not a typical comic-strip adaptation – what it is, I am not really sure, except to say that it epitomizes the film-as-video-game mentality! <br/><br/>Mind you, it is all somewhat enjoyable (especially the incongruous camaraderie –including Scott's gay room-mate and members of his rock group being named Stephen Stills and Young Neil!) yet too silly to leave much of a lasting impression. The plot involves the titular character falling for a mystery girl (winsome Mary Elizabeth Winstead, whom I had watched in four previous films yet only now did she catch my attention!) but, in order to be with her, he has to first defeat her seven former flings and also drop his own current lover, an underage Japanese girl! <br/><br/>The villains include special guest stars – the term is to be used lightly here – like Chris Evans (an ex-Fantastic 4 and soon-to-be Captain America!) as an arrogant movie idol, Brandon Routh (the most recent Superman) as a vain alien(!) and Jason Schwartzman as the evil boss of the lot, the very music mogul to whom the hero's outfit would be signed if they were to win a battle-of-the-bands-type contest; three other opponents were fellow participants (two of them twins), and yet another a lesbian!"

","This was one of the best, freshest moves in a long time. Despite the fact that we've seen the visual style in video games still it seemed really original and refreshing. The humor was subtle, there were no laugh at loud moments, but it kept the humorous pace from beginning to end. This is my first review, but what can I tell you the movie was slick, well packed, full of fight scenes, action wise and adventurous.<br/><br/>The visual effects were amazing, nothing overdone or less effects where needed. Can't believe it didn't go so well on the box office, but I'm sure it'll bank on DVDs or BRDs. maybe the story could've been a little better, but i can't really say there was anything wrong with it. <br/><br/>BTW Cera plays his usual ( which fits the story), Winstead is OK, it was a pity Anna Kendrick's character (Scots sister) has a little screen time.<br/><br/>All in all, you have to watch this!"

","(Synopsis) Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is an unemployed 23-year-old bass guitarist in an up and coming garage rock band who is dating a cute 17-year-old high school girl, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is having fun in life and rolling along at a nice even tempo until one day Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) rollerblades into his life. Ramona moved to Toronto from New York City to find peace and quiet and leave her past behind. No one knows what her past is, but Scott will find out very soon as he tries to make Ramona his new girlfriend. Before Scott can begin dating Ramona, he must prove himself by defeating the league of her seven exes who controls her love life. They will do anything to get rid of and destroy any new boyfriend Ramona may consider. If Scott wants to find true love with Ramona, he must defeat all seven, before the game is over.<br/><br/>(My Comment) Scott Pilgrim is a comic book/video game and love story fantasy/comedy all in one movie. Scott is kind of a geek who falls in and out of love with many girls and Ramona has commitment issues. Putting them together only made for an incredibly funny experience with many laughs at one-liners and sight gags. The movie has a lot going on, with a love story, outrageous fight scenes, to awesome music, and visual effects with points and coins when Scott wins. The fight scenes are non-bloody and you don't have to take them too seriously. Each fight scene is more outlandish than the last one and some of them are used just for comedy. I was surprised to find myself enjoying the movie, because I am not the target audience for this. This is definitely worth watching, but I'd recommend it for the younger crowd (20's & 30's), it may even become a cult film. (Universal Pictures, Run Time 1:52, Rated PG-13) (8/10)"
"betweenthebarsxo-1","9","12","40","28 July 2010"," So much fun to watch!
","I saw Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World with my boyfriend tonight at an advance screening, and we entered with pretty average expectations. We didn't think it'd be awesome but we didn't expect a bad movie, either. And having never read the comics, all we knew about the film came from the trailer. Nevertheless we were blown away by how incredibly original the movie was from start to finish, and how genuinely funny it was. The story follows an unemployed 22 year old bassist called Scott, who falls for a mysterious girl named Ramona. To win her heart, he must defeat her seven evil exes. Along the way you meet Scott's bandmates and roommates (Kieran Culkin's character might've been my favorite, every single thing that man says is brilliantly funny) and of course Ramona's old flames (and the battles that ensue).<br/><br/>This is a great comedy not to be missed. The performances were all fantastic, and as for all of those who doubt Michael Cera's acting abilities, yeah he does his Michael Cera shtick as Scott Pilgrim but it's truly refreshing to see him kick some serious butt for a change.<br/><br/>There wasn't a dull moment. Judging from the audience's reactions throughout the movie, I wasn't the only one who felt this way. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is constant entertainment in a way you haven't experienced it before. This is definitely worth watching, but I'd recommend it mainly to a younger crowd."
"Laserwolf65","Null","10","32","21 August 2010"," Bar none, the worst film I've seen all year
","To anyone who is thinking about seeing this movie, I tell you to not waste your time. This film is an utter travesty. It is a film crafted for people with thirty second attention spans. If you think that that's a joke... it isn't. Every thirty seconds or so the scenes change and we're in a new location with new people talking about boring things unrelated to the previous events. This film's mere existence is alarming to me. How can this be passed off as entertainment? Apparently though, all the teens in my showing loved it death. No wonder our students are failing to keep up with the rest of the world.<br/><br/>So Scott Pilgrim falls in love for a girl (for no good reason) and has to defeat her seven evil ex's to continue dating her (again, for no good reason). You'd think that this would be all about fighting wouldn't you? Well no, because almost all of the fights end on complete deus ex machina anti climaxes. Nothing is riveting, and nothing is exciting. Apart from that, the movie has no sense of internal logic to it. Does this take place in a video game? Maybe it's a comic book world. Do people just always turn into coins when they're murdered? To quote the Nostalgia Critic: ""EXPLAIN MOVIE! EXPLAIN!!!!"" It also doesn't help that the whole affair is so lifeless. None of the actors emote. Never. They just stare into the camera delivering their lines as monotonously as possible. How can we possibly enjoy a movie where none of the characters/actors appear to be having any fun themselves? All in all, this film is a plague. I sincerely hope that it does not do well, because if it does we will have to sit through many year's worth of films imitating this travesty. I hated this movie, and if you go to see it, don't say I didn't warn you.<br/><br/>*/*****"
"KnightsofNi11","9","10","32","13 August 2010"," Just can't get enough
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a movie based on comic book series that takes place in a video game world. This world is the imaginary wonderland of Toronto, Canada. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22 year old bassist for his garage band, Sex Bob-Omb. He's a simple minded and laid back kid without a whole lot on his mind. That is until he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He immediately falls head over heels for her, as she is (figurativley and literally) the girl of his dreams. However, as soon as he starts dating her, he learns that this love comes with a price. In order to date her he must defeat her seven evil exes. And so the fun begins, treating the audience to an outrageous and hilarious ride.<br/><br/>From the get-go we learn that Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is not a serious movie, yet its not a joke movie. The gags in this film are used so artistically and so creatively that every moment will have you smiling at the hysterical new reality created within this fantastic film. The director of this film is the British genius Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). The entire movie is ripe with Wright's trademarks and does not at all lack the blend stylistic and comedic brilliance seen in his other films, even with the absence of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has a very specific style to it, and even after almost two hours of it, it never gets old. The movie never loses focus on what it is and stays at the same level of quirk and charm the whole way through.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is based off of a comic series written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. I wasn't familiar with the comics at all, and there were points in the film where I thought it may have been funnier if I had read the comic, but overall it does a fantastic job of not alienating people like me. Instead of being a panel by panel adaptation of the comic, it creates its own style that anyone with a broad sense of humor should be able to enjoy. It is so rare that a comedy is released these days that brings something new to the table. Scott Pilgrim finally breaks this trend and delivers on all levels and absolutely amazes. It's also not often that I never want a film to end while watching it. Scott Pilgrim broke this trend as well. I was so transfixed and entertained by this stunning piece of satirical art that I couldn't get enough. There wasn't a single moment where I thought the film lagged or lost touch with me, and that level of consistency is something you don't see enough of today.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is an excellent blend of everything you could want from film this day and age. Its fun and entertaining, while also being meaningful and captivating. It interweaves hilarious jokes, played up in all sorts of fashions ranging from sight gags to social commentary, into an actual story rich with character development and a plot that excites and entertains in its own way. The story is also a great blend of being action driven as well as character driven. There is quite a wide array of characters in this film. The cast is really an ensemble led with full force by Micael Cera. Each character has some odd and funny quirk to them, always leaving you wondering what they could do next. I know I'll be coming back to this film many more times, not only for the entertainment value, but also the great and relevant story it tells in the midst of hilarity and absurdity.<br/><br/>Visually fantastic, and all the while attention grabbing and imaginatively grand, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a must see for this summer."

","Scott Pilgrim has met the girl of his dreams, Romona Flowers. Now, he must face her seven evil exes if he is to keep dating her. Now imagine this love story is taking place inside a souped up Nintendo Entertainment System with some of the finest indie music the world has to offer, lovingly directed by the world's biggest geek and edited to perfection by joy pad wielding insaniacs intent on blowing up your eyes with colours.<br/><br/>This film is the pinnacle of everything an immersion in pop culture can be. From the parody of the typical 'love against adversity' journey of any typical film, 'Scott Pilgrim' takes the idea of the journey and turns into an epic QUEST. What's more, it's refreshing that the hero of the piece is fundamentally flawed: pursuing a girl while in a relationship with another, however tame that relationship might be, is a basic rule of social villainy- and yet Scott Pilgrim is that awkward hero; not following the laws of what is right, rather going for what he wants and ignoring the consequences. That the protagonist is imperfect, selfish and thoughtless makes him more identifiable as a genuine human being rather than a pastiche of unachievable ideals, and anchors the film's emotional core against the absolute insanity that unfolds.<br/><br/>Michael Cera is at his finest here. He is one of those comic actors who has an act and usually sticks with it- even reverting back to it in ""Youth in Revolt""- but here, Cera is not the meek nice guy. He still looks and sounds like Cera, but he's not the smart, sensitive boy we've come to know. He's fatally flawed and does bad things to good people on impulse. Like real people tend to on occasion. Further grounding comes from Kieran Culkin, a revelation as the straight man (so to speak) of the piece and one of several excellent supporting roles peppered throughout this character-packed story (Brandon Routh and Chris Evans can battle for the title of the best evil ex, but Tom Jane showing up as a member of the vegan police for about 20 seconds just blew my mind). Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Romona Flowers is so inexplicably cool you go against your gut and start pushing Pilgrim to fight for her (she even manages to flex some acting muscles, too- ranging from hardened introvert to heart-on-sleeve vulnerability to giant Thor-hammer smashing aggression).<br/><br/>Everything about this film is effortlessly cool, from the fantasy fight scenes straight out of Tekken, one of many video game references that the film is saturated in (a dream sequence involves a flourishing arrangement of music from Zelda to great effect). The use of video games within the film could arguably be suggested a critique of our obsession with electronic influences on our lives, but I'm just guessing that the reason they used all of that stuff is because it just looks amazing- it sounds amazing too, probably one of the best contemporary soundtracks I've ever heard (thanks to contributions from Metric, Beck and uber-producer Nigel Godrich).<br/><br/>On a technical level, this is Edgar Wright's finest achievement, harking back to the the heady days of sitcom 'Spaced' but with a few million dollars to really push the limits- and I don't believe he wasted a single penny.<br/><br/>From the devastating reaction to sunlight (blissfully over the top comic-book framing) on an early morning, and the scuzzy bass that centres the film's soundtrack, you'll come out of this still not believing you just saw this movie. Your brain won't let you believe it's real. Well it's not, but it is a film. It has been made, with loving devotion to its source material- which as to why anyone would even try and commit that to the screen is beyond me, but Edgar Wright just did it. I think he can safely assume his place as one of the most unique and brilliant filmmakers in the industry right now, with this film as a portfolio promising what visions will come next.<br/><br/>This film is perfect. There is literally nothing wrong with any of it. As far as the genre of 'comic-book adaptations' goes (which itself is ridiculous, you would throw every film based on a book into the same section at HMV- Jaws and Pride and Prejudice aren't the same now, are they?) this is one of the finest, most standout pieces made. As a fantasy adventure it's even credible, remaining resolutely laid back and lo-fi despite it's impeccable visual style.<br/><br/>Just... outstanding."

Going in I didn't really know what to expect because I avoided the hype as much as I could.

The fast-paced action-packed visual style of the film and it's humorous, witty and catchy one-liner dialogue will keep anyone with a Goldfish's attention span up-right in their seats, drool leaking from their mouths and eyes firmly planted on the screen for the full duration of the film! <br/><br/>Geeks, nerds or just anyone with too much time on their hands and lack of social-life will delight in the many video game and pop-culture references spliced throughout the film. The films slick editing and cartoon/comic book visual style is superbly executed and despite the film being outlandishly random, it all seems to make perfect sense in the fictional world it is weaved in. <br/><br/>Michael Cera plays a slight variant on his ""Arrested Development"" persona as the title character, Scott Pilgrim - a nerdy, awkward bass player and video game enthusiast who's had his fair share of bad luck with the ladies. Yet the real star of the film has to be Kieran Culkin as 'Wallace Wells', Scott's gay room-mate. He is hilarious and gets all the films best lines. I couldn't help think throughout the film just how much he resembles Mike Patton! If they ever do a film on 'FNM' - they should most definitely cast Kieran as Patton!!! The music is also pretty good and all the tracks performed by Scott's band; ""Sex Bob-Omb"" were suitably composed and arranged by the genre bending artist 'Beck'. <br/><br/>Though it may not be everyone's cup of tea (herbal/green/sleep, etc) - the film never ceases to entertain and it's humour, stylised visuals and fight scenes pack more punch than most films out this year (excluding 'Expendables' which I have not yet seen). There are also some amusing cameos thrown in as a bonus in an amusing scene involving 'Vegans'!"

","I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy this film but when a couple of people I know raved about it I though I should check it out; I'll have the thank them as it was a lot of fun. It is essential to know that this film is not meant to be in any way realistic in one scene the hero gets punched through three brick walls and is barely hurt! That is part of the fun though; it is a live action film that has the same rules as a Loony Tunes Cartoon; it could so easily have been terrible but instead it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>One day Scott Pilgrim spots a beautiful girl with bright pink hair, called Ramona, and he is immediately smitten; he must date her even though he is already dating a seventeen-year-old schoolgirl called Knives. At the time their relation starts he doesn't realise that he will have to battle each of Ramona's seven evil exes if he wishes to keep her... and live. The fights aren't normal scraps; they are like something out of a video game, complete with sound and visual effects and when he wins he gets points and just as his vanquished foe disappears money appears in their place. As he works his way through the exes Scott learns a bit about himself and realises that he hasn't behaved all that well to his exes.<br/><br/>Director Edgar Wright did a fine job bringing the story to the screen; managing to make the cartoon-like elements seem fun rather than just a gimmick. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead were great as Scott and Ramona; the fact that he isn't the typical action star made it easier to root for his character even though he was clearly flawed. It wasn't just comic-book fight scenes there were also some good laughs; frequently provided by Scott's sharp-tongued gay roommate. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film and heartily recommend it to anybody looking for something a little different."

","Scott decided to come out to the world during the worst possible year. The general public, rightfully so, was so put off by such idiocy thrown at us this year, that many stayed away from the little films that, in the creativity field, dominated the large pieces of crap. Too bad.<br/><br/>First they missed the great Kick-Ass, followed by Michael Cera's other wonderful release: Youth in Revolt. Come to think of it, one of the best comedic talents we have out there barely has a hit to his name (aside from, maybe Superbad) and that's regrettable. Just as nowadays we not only hardly have any music group that has multiple #1 albums, like in the 1990s and before, we have too few great and talented stars, like Cera.<br/><br/>I could say SEE: Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World a hundred times, and just about no one will listen. And no, it's not because I'm not a respected critic – who really is? It's probably more to the skeptic viewer who's been burned for far too long.<br/><br/>But, at any rate: SEE THIS MOVIE. It was funny, wildly original, fantastically shot, had an awesome soundtrack and deep acting. Nicely, it took what worked with Zombieland and Kick-Ass to the next level. Heck, throw in a little of the original 1960s Batman series to boot.<br/><br/>Scott, 22 (Cera) is a nerd and is dating a high school student until he dreams up his dream girl, Ramona V. Flowers. As always, she's got baggage: seven ex's he has to defeat to keep the girl.<br/><br/>Okay, that's the (very) basic premise. In between, he comic-book-ish fights them with powers that no one seems to question. The bad guys fly and sling video-game flame balls and Scott equally rises to the occasion with an air knock out. While all this is going on, there's a stalking ex-girlfriend, a battle of a different sort involving a band that Scott's attached to and a gay roommate played perfectly with excellent timing and comedic lines from no other than a Culkin (Kieran.)<br/><br/>In fact, Wallace (Culkin) was one of the best characters of the story. It's refreshing to see not only two best friends/roommates be gay and straight and even non-sexually sleep in the same bed – but also of the two, the gay friend is the dominate one. In 99.775% of all films involving the ""gay-sidekick/friend/comic relief"" they're played small, weak – though sometimes all-knowing, but at the same time, it's the straight that has everything together. It's the opposite here. The only other film I can reference here was the relationship in My Best Friend's Wedding, but that, like Will & Grace, was, like always, a homosexual male and BFF female. Here we have a perfect male-male-non-sexual gay/straight friendship.<br/><br/>But, I digress; this isn't necessarily a gay-themed movie. This is about action, romance, fantasy, a whole lotta fun and great special effects. In between, you'll meet and love Ramona who has more depth than her hair colors. You'll get inventive ways to fight each of the seven nemesis ex's. Butthat's also a complaint of the movie.<br/><br/>Despite the comic book it's based upon, why couldn't it have been 3 or 4 ex's max? The movie dragged a bit, and though each challenge (or battle) was exciting to watch for superbly choreographed action sequences, it just kept going on a little too long after awhile.<br/><br/>Eh, just sit through it. Have a great time. It's not for the mainstream – WAY unfortunately – but it's for those who just want pure fantasy, it's for those who grew up on both comics and video games and it's for those who truly believe the geek can get the girl. Doesn't Cera always? SEE THIS MOVIE."
"tavm","9","7","22","25 August 2010"," Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of the most uniquely enjoyable movies from this summer season
","Since opening opposite Sylvester Stallone's The Expendables and Julia Roberts' Eat Pray Love, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World hasn't had a chance to hit it big at the box office. I guess that's because the two pictures I just mentioned have something of a pre-sold audience while this one only has an appeal to those that have read the graphic novels this movie is based on. I'm here to say that despite not having read the source material, I very much enjoyed this movie! Oh sure, it took a while before I got into it but once I did, I never allowed myself to question why things happened the way they did, I just let myself-as one character said-""be in the moment"". Director Edgar Wright put all his creative stops here both visually and dialogue-wise that there were times I wish I could've rewinded some passages just so I could hear and see certain scenes again. So on that note, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World comes highly recommended."
"preppy-3","9","10","35","4 August 2010"," I'm not quite sure what to make of it but I had fun!
","Slacker Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) falls in love with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winsted). However, to get her, he must battle and defeat her 7 exes.<br/><br/>I expected the worst when I saw how this was advertised (An Epic of Epic Epicness) but I had a free pass so I thought ""What the hell?"" I was surprised (actually kind of shocked) to find myself enjoying it. I'm not the target audience for this (I'm in my 40s and most of the kids in the theatre were in their 20s) but I still enjoyed myself. It's bursting with ideas, jokes, action...you name it. There are constant times that little words or phases pop up on the screen to tell us things...but they'll all funny and had me laughing. For example: at one point somebody says ""You don't think I know what that means?"" and the words ""He doesn't"" appear next to him. Also there are plenty of fight sequences but they're non-bloody and go so far over the top that you can't take them seriously. Also when people are killed they dissolve into coins! I know that's obviously pointing towards video games--in fact a LOT of this plays like a video game! When Cera kills somebody points appear on the screen and when he goes off to face the final and 7th ex ""Level 7"" pops up. Also Cera has a gay roommate (played to the hilt by Kieran Culkin) who is shown in a positive way and even has a fairly hot guy on guy kiss. He also sleeps in the same bed as Cera and WITH his boyfriend.<br/><br/>The acting is good across the board. I never really liked Cera but he's perfectly cast here. Winsted is charming as Flowers. All her exes are well acted but my favorite had to be Brandon (Superman) Routh with blond hair as a mighty vegan. So I'm not quite sure what the point is here (if in fact there IS one) but I was never bored and found myself laughing quite a bit. I give it a 9."
"richard-wilkinson-611-564989","10","6","18","29 October 2010"," Quite brilliant
","I am going to keep this to the point - Scott Pilgrim vs The World is an incredible roller-coaster ride of emotion, laughter and mind blowing special effects that will leave you with an enormous smile on your face.<br/><br/>Michael Cera brilliantly plays Scott Pilgrim - a bassist for unsigned band Bob-bomb, who while trying to get over his ex by dating high school student Knives, meets Ramona Flowers - a pink haired sullen beauty and instantly falls in love. After spending the night with Ramona, Scott discovers he must now defeat her seven evil ex boyfriends if he is to continue to date her - a task made all the more difficult by the fact that they each have special powers. Luckily, Pilgrim is no shy wallflower and unleashes devastating martial arts, special moves a-la video game beat-em ups and each evil ex who is destroyed turns into coins in a brilliant effect.<br/><br/>The special effects that litter the screen are a brilliant homage to the video game hall of fame from the on screen visual prompts each time someone is hit (thwok, biff - similar to TV series Batman)to the cute sound effects from such titles as Mario, Sonic The Hedgehog and Final Fantasy. Video game and comic fans alike will love the geeky overtones of the film and the effects only heighten the excitement further and leave you incapable of anything but smiling.<br/><br/>One particular favourite moment is where Scott faces off against one of the evil exes who happens to be a young woman. Ramona's dismissal of her as ""I was bi-curious"" is met with the hilarious response of ""well I'm bi-furious"" and the resulting fight is very funny. Scott's reluctance to hit a girl is only met by Ramona using him as a fight puppet to brilliant effect.<br/><br/>Particular praise must go to Mary Elizabeth Wanstead who not only plays a sultry, mysterious and impulsive character in Ramona - she also looks absolutely gorgeous and you can understand Scott's attraction. Jason Schwartmann is also excellent as the ""boss"" evil ex Gideon, with a certain air of charm mixed with cunning.<br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend any comic book or video game fans to watch this film - a brilliantly funny and enjoyable comic book romp that will leave you with a huge smile on your face and remind you why you love films."

The performances of the actors are all wonderful and you can't help but think that Edgar must be really good at allowing actors to relax and feel free to give it there all.<br/><br/>Really blew me away this film.

"Legendary_Badass","9","10","36","29 July 2010"," Too imaginative, too funny
","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is the bass player for the aspiring rock band Sex Bob-omb. He's not a lady killer but one day Scott meets the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Instead of a typical dating ritual, Scott is plagued with challenges by Ramona's seven evil exes. Despite his lackluster physique, Scott can go toe to toe with most of them in hand to hand combat. When that fails he turns to the powers of his noggin or guitar.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most video game-esquire movie I've ever seen. There are stats, one-ups, power-ups. Coins even appear when a foe is dispatched, suggesting that the audience/player continue the movie/game. These are all referential gags that build a fantasy atmosphere and make it difficult to question the feasibility of plot. Just about anything can happen, and when it did I was able to accept it.<br/><br/>There seems to be no bounds to the inspiration that can be drawn from underground geek subculture. Most of the film has effects that bring to life the popular formats of manga, anime, and video game staples, but out of nowhere sounds and laugh tracks are lifted from Seinfeld of all places. It's not for the sake of being silly, everything adds to the style and tone of this fantasy/romantic comedy. Each battle is unique. Some elements carryover (the outlandish style of hit anime series Dragon Ball and video game inspired points system) but Scott is always able to apply a new approach for success, resulting in the frail Pilgrim outsmarting some of his tougher foes. Sometimes he's able to turn their egos against them, but my favorite outcome came when he tricked psychic vegan Todd (Brandon Routh) resulting in the appearance of the fabled vegan police. <br/><br/>Michael Cera is famous for his typecasting as a soft-spoken slacker. Here he brings the usual to the table, trying to play the everyman while chaos erupts around him. But I suppose not every man is able to leap into the air to deliver a punch or survive being thrown into a castle. It's a far cry from the comedic action found in other works of director Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead); trading blood for lens flare and superhuman durability, it's a friendly but intense PG-13.<br/><br/>The outlandishness doesn't end there. Every secondary character has a clearly defined role and personality. There are many and each is memorable. Among my favorites is Wallace (Kieran Culkin) who periodically states the obvious. He'll interrupt a fight to inform Scott that he's fighting someone. Drummer Kim (Alison Pill) is low in lines but with each her cynical delivery garners a laugh. Lastly, newcomer Ellen Wong brings a comedic, expressive sensibility to Knives Chau, Sex Bob-omb's biggest fan.<br/><br/>Its strength is a minor weakness. There isn't broad appeal to be found in the in-jokes and should you understand the point of reference you may find yourself laughing over another punch line—like a gamer, an audience member must be well coordinated.<br/><br/>I would not be surprised in the least if Scott Pilgrim vs. the World endures in popular conversation for years to come. It's a generational film that will be looked back upon with all the nostalgia of Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is too imaginative to be farce, and too funny to be forgotten."
"willhaskew","3","3","7","6 November 2015"," Scott Pilgrim is a shallow, superficial wimp
","I found myself with mixed feelings about this movie after viewing it. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) the titular character is dating a high school-aged girl named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), whom he treats badly before cheating on her and breaking up with her to go out with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). He's unemployed and lives with his roommate Wallace Wells (Kiernan Culkin, the most talented Culkin), whose generosity seems to be the only reason Scott isn't homeless. Scott's band Sex Bob-Omb seems like they're on the verge of a major break with a spot in a local Battle of the Bands contest but he doesn't take this too seriously either. <br/><br/>Scott learns quickly that Ramona has a spotty dating history with her embittered former significant others being labeled The League of Evil Exes. Scott's own history of bad break ups has caused him to accumulate his own League of Evil Exes. So now two people with obvious relationship and people problems want to date each other. That's besides the fact that I found the Scott and Ramona characters really unlikable, they were both manipulative and selfish with Ramona seeming really emotionally disconnected. It seemed like they were unconcerned with using and discarding people after becoming bored or meeting someone new. <br/><br/>This is really sad, because otherwise this is a pretty well made movie. The characters of Scott's bandmates and friends, in particular drummer Kim Pine (Allison Pill) and his roommate Wallace, are really interesting and funny. The movie looks great and the fights are well done looking like something straight off the screen of a next generation console game. I can't the past these two main characters though. Scott and Ramona are jerks and deserve each other, ironically, since they'd break up in less than a week in real life."
"captainbanana16","10","3","7","28 November 2011"," Awesomely Surreal Hilarious Comedical Thrill-Ride
","This film is amazing. With great characters, surreal special-effects and total randomness, it's packed with jokes, quotes and numerous cultural references (mostly to do with gaming.)<br/><br/>I felt that every single part of the film was well-timed, well-placed and well-laughable (if that's a word...) Everything about it was ludicrously amusing, and I'm pretty sure that there were a couple of deep metaphors. The lines are very memorable, and off the top of my head I can quote most of the movie (I can't say the quote for fear of writing a spoiler in the review.)<br/><br/>Having said this however, I do know some people who didn't quite get it, so I reckon it depends on your taste of humor. Someone who likes a very idiosyncratic, haphazard craziness will love this. Those who want something normal and mundane will not. A couple of moments in the film do require the viewer to ponder a little, or wonder why on earth something happened, but not in a way that makes you completely lose track; it's good or bad depending how you view it.<br/><br/>As for comic book adaptioning, I saw the film before reading the comic (The film encouraged me to do so) and thoroughly enjoyed both of them. Some thing's are missing from the film, but most of it, down to costume, lines and special effects, is relatively the same.<br/><br/>So, overall, watch it. You'll either love it loads or just think it's slightly weird, but only by watching it will you find out."
"carter-veteran","10","3","7","27 November 2011"," A movie that created its own insane world and loved every second of it
","Scott Pilgrim vs the World is one of those rare movies of today that actually tried something new and original in today's movie market of formula and repetition. It may not be a film everyone may enjoy but for those who can get by the ridiculous idea will have one of the most enjoyable movie experiences out there.<br/><br/>The plot behind this bizarre tale is based on the seven volume independent developed graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O Malley in which Scott Pilgrim runs into the girl of his dreams Ramona Flowers but Ramona is carrying more baggage then Scott is used to. Baggage in the form of seven evil exes; ( I say exes since Ramona had six ex boyfriends and one ex girlfriend this is the 21st century after all) So Scott must defeat all her exes in order to be with Ramona and this is where it gets weird.<br/><br/>For reasons unquestioned and unexplained by anyone Scotts world seems to inhabit the world of video game logic. All said characters seem to have some sort of super power or magical weapon, they go head to head in video game boss fight / fighting game style, with a system that keeps score gives one ups and where the loser bursts in a shower of coins.<br/><br/>All this may sound like it panders to a certain audience, and it does on top of the evil ex fights the movie is filled with references and sound effects thrown in from a generation of video games. But I still feel that this a movie that people outside the video game trend can watch. What I find to be Scott Pilgrims biggest strength is how self aware it is with its absurd premise; It continually knows through out that this is a silly prospect for a movie so it plays more for laughs then to be taken straight faced. Almost every line of dialogue is building up to a punch line or just being intentionally funny, even the fights are there for comedy rather then tension. But I don't mean to undersell the fight scenes they are still awesome to watch amongst all the hilarity going on.<br/><br/>My only real problem with this picture is while good taking a seven volume graphic novel and condensing it to just under two hours really doesn't do the work justice. Some of the characters don't get as much screen time a lot of the story has been cut down not to mention the change in the ending. However even with these flaws I still give the movie a perfect 10 cause the scenes and characters we do see are still well developed. Besides I don't think you can do much better for a seven volume comic book condensed into just two hours."
"simon-171-26278","10","3","7","7 October 2011"," Crazy. Amazing. Retro and Funny.
","This movie really deserves to be watched at least twice to appreciate it even more. I'm glad I'd never heard of this movie because it didn't give me any prejudice. I saw a preview and thought ""that looks silly"" which is probably why it didn't do well at the Box Office. First of all, this is visual art at its' best. For a movie buff, this movie highlights some really creative approaches to telling a story in a nutty but entertaining manner. Secondly, many of the retro sounds, characters and effects were an enjoyable throw back to my childhood with remnants of Donkey Kong, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Mario Brothers and more. The pace varies between mostly fast and brief tidbits of slow which made a mockery of typical film presentation and this was a bonus.<br/><br/>Overall, this is unique, visually impressive, presses retro buttons, heaps of fun and I've got to say, musically rocks."
"thepsychocritic","9","3","7","11 September 2011"," Video games, Fire Balls, Action; Mama Mia!
","Scott Pilgrim is a 20-something small-time Canadian bass-guitarist living with a gay friend. He is dating a seventeen year old Asian girl, Knives C, much to the chagrin of those around him. Scott is smitten by Ramona Flowers, a mysterious girl with occasional tendencies of appearing in his dreams. But in order to get her, he has to battle and defeat the seven people she last dated or as they prefer calling them - her seven evil exes.<br/><br/>The story is not very intricate or clever. A boy loves a girl and must do something extraordinarily difficult (you know, fight someone dangerous people, climb Everest on his hands, listen to non-stop Justin Bieber for forty seven days) to win her over. But the way it has been portrayed is rather brilliant. It has been told in a nonchalant manner you can almost hear it saying 'who cares?' In a world where every movie is trying to outdo the other in terms of complicated plot lines and overwhelming stories, SPVTW comes like a burst of breath air. It doesn't make you think very much. The director Edgar Wright keeps things simple. However, unlike most other no-brainers, it gets the concoction right. Nothing has been overdone and the film falls strictly under the walls of sanity. The detached light-heartedness, the comic-timing, the ease with which the story flows all makes it delightful. It is the kind of film that you can watch multiple times yet not get tired of.<br/><br/>All the characters in the film are well-rounded and the actors play their parts with ease. The upcoming Michael Cera does an endearing job of being a cross between a bass guitarist with a penchant for pink- haired girls and a video-game uber-nerd. He makes a good lost-in-the- dark kid as creepy men repeatedly try and mash him to pulp. Scott isn't your stereotypical 'oh-he-is-so-nice' hero. Chicks won't swoon over him. They simply won't see how fighting seven incredibly powerful lunatics (most with superpowers) is being a better boyfriend than stalking, ditching and vampirizing your girlfriend. Alas, he can't glow in the sunlight; maybe that's the reason.<br/><br/>Though the film has plenty of side characters to toy around with, it manages to get them all right. The exes, Ramona, Knives, Scott's gay roommate Wallace, among a plethora of others, are all distinctly characterized. You don't get confused between any of them, remembering each of them by their individual personalities and idiosyncrasies. They carve their own identities within whatever little screen-time they are given. Many great movies have fallen in this trap, but Scott Pilgrim doesn't, making it all the more commendable.<br/><br/>The movie has a noticeable retro-gaming touch to it. It shows that the little things matter most and define the quality of the film. There are pee-bars, bass solos, anti-gravity stunts, bold subtitles, a Vegan, one- ups, KOs and plenty of other things that remind you of antiquated games. Defeated villains explode to coins. The action is very Matrix-like. Each villain enters like fighters in Street Fighter, or Mortal Kombat if you prefer. The action sequences are fast-paced with lots of fancy animation, effects and impact-verbs like 'whack!' or 'slam!' There is tons of eye-candy which also makes it a visual treat. Since it has been adopted from a comic, they are like a tribute to the original, glossy paper-back version. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, not much of the audience enjoyed it at first go. It proved to be a sleeper, blazing onto #1 on Blu-ray after its unceremonious exit from the theatres. The reasons were plenty and obvious. The sense of humour is impeccable. The jokes are funny, dark, caustic, satirical; yet always funny. The romance isn't mawkish and is one of the best I have seen in a while. It is refreshing. It doesn't make pretensions or allusions to something it could have been. Everything is right in front of you. Video-games, comics and cartoons truly make a spectacular movie.<br/><br/>It also teaches a very valuable lesson. Before you decide to date a girl, know if she has any ex-boyfriends with superpowers you might want to be careful off."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","3","7","25 May 2011"," Scott Pilgrim vs. the Classics.
","Scott Pilgrim has to be one of the top 10 most entertaining movies ever made. It is fast paced, full of humor, and has the most insane action sequences in a comedy. Anyone who likes video games will love this little under-rated masterpiece.<br/><br/>It is clear that this movie was inspired by comic hitting sounds like ""Kapow"" and ""Thwack"", but actually shown in the movie like the original Batman TV series when it showed those kinds of words; also the biggest inspiration was Nintendo 8-bit games. This was inspired by video games but not based on video games, so it's safe from a train wreck of a video game movie like Alone in the Dark.<br/><br/>Michael Cera actually acts in this movie and makes his role seem like the same character he always plays, but a thousand times better. Cera plays Scott Pilgrim who falls in love with a beautiful girl named Ramona. However before he can be Ramona's proper boyfriend he has to defeat Ramona's seven evil exes. A linear sounding plot but grade A+ ++ entertainment as a result.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the most entertaining feel good movie since Back to the Future. No one should miss out on this now cult classic as it has romance (good and not boring romance), great and funny characters, great action, great dialogue, great comedy and most of all, an unforgettable experience.

I am getting older (not old yet) and though I have a wii, I am not video game dude nor am I a comic book junkie. However, this movie had great acting, an interesting premise, was well done and extremely creative, and very enjoyable from start to finish. My one complaint is sometimes it was a little too much. What that means exactly is it moved like a video game, fast and with constant activity and no time to breath. But then again that may be the point, but then again this is a movie, not a video game. This is a movie for hipsters,video game freaks, and comic book guys (and gals). The fight sequences are very refreshing and there is both great humor and several good love stories. This movie seems very youth oriented, but as I said I am not as young as I once was and am no longer this movies key demographic, and I had a blast watching it.

"TheDoctorfromOz","10","3","7","11 April 2011"," In the land of pixels and make believe...
","One day, I saw a headline about the trailer to 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' being released. When I watched it, I was entranced by it. It was fast, flashy, and funny and when I finally saw the movie, those three words are exactly the way I'd describe the final product. <br/><br/>The film starts with about 15 minutes of quick cuts and snappy dialogue and if it makes you nauseous, shut the film off. But really, that's two of the many things I must praise the film for. Its editing sets the film at a break neck speed and stays that way throughout the film. There's no down time and the director, Edgar Wright, packs every second of it with references so small yet so effective that one must be hyper aware if they want to catch them all. The best part about all of these references is that they all fall into the script flawlessly. They never strain it. The other thing that could turn you away is that most of the characters are very cynical but if you're like me (a somewhat cruel teenager,) you'll find it very funny. <br/><br/>Another thing this movie does brilliantly is how it juggles genres. It has action, comedy, romance, and even a scene that has a musical number and the cast pulls it off perfectly. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is beautiful and tough as the mysterious Ramona Flowers and the evil exes are all delightfully despicable. People have been heaping praise on Ellen Wong with her portrayal of Knives Chau, the insane stalker ex-girlfriend of Scott Pilgrim. For a new comer, she's very good, but I was annoyed by her, maybe because I know all too many people like that in real life. However, that's the idea with the character and she does it very well. Personally, I think the best actress in the film is Alison Pill as the drummer Kim Pine. Really the biggest problem with the cast is Michael Cera. Yes, he's playing only a slightly more animated version of the character he's played in every other movie he's done. While this isn't a huge gripe as it does kind of fit the role, he just doesn't offer much new and it leaves us annoyed.<br/><br/>Okay, I got off topic back there. As I was saying, the movie juggles genres perfectly. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, this film has it. If you like action films, this movie's got it. Hell, if you're a fan of anime, musicals, or flashy effects, this film has it! It's Edgar Wright at his best, as before he's handled three genres at the most. Now he's handling every genre but horror, although if you like his style, there's his past film 'Shaun of the Dead' that covers that. It's just one of those films that anyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>I also suggest the comic series. They expand on the story that the film has. Really, you watch the movie to get the basic idea of the concept of Scott Pilgrim and you read the series to learn more about it. I'm saying you shouldn't watch the film. Quite the opposite, really. One should read the books for the story and watch the movie for the artistry that went into the film making.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is a fantastic movie. It has beautiful visuals, a lightning fast pace that you either latch on to and follow for the whole thing or just can't catch up with, and a lot of energy from all who are involved.<br/><br/>And as a side note, for anyone complaining about the ending, GUYS, it's a fairy tale. How else would it end?"
"zachperez87","2","62","319","20 July 2010"," Horrible
","Don't bother wasting your time or money on this film. The movie was terrible from start to finish. Michael Cera hasn't done anything good since Superbad and this is no exception. On top of that the story is stupid and chiched.<br/><br/>Basically Scoot Pilgrim (Cera) meets a girl he falls in love with. But he has to battle seven of her ex-boyfriends to get her. The jokes were lame and the comedy just wasn't there. The film had many pointless scenes that just seemed to waste time. The characters were one-dimensional and silly.<br/><br/>I won't be surprised if this is a straight to DVD movie. The tagline is: ""an epic of epic epicness"". Need I say more?"

","Scott Pilgrim is a normal boy living in Toronto, recovering from a devastating breakup by bouncing off of a high school Chinese girl, when suddenly he becomes captivated by the newbie in town, Ramona Flowers. However, after he suddenly discovers the league of seven evil exes set on controlling Ramona's future, their love lives become tangled, convoluted, and everything gets messy.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is its incredibly unique style. There's never exactly been a movie like this in the past, and with a visionary like Edgar Wright at the helm, that is nothing to be ashamed of. The movie is entirely based off of the ""Scott Pilgrim"" graphic novel series; but wherein this is the film's greatest feature, it is also its greatest weakness. It's based off the comics- you can tell. And not necessarily in a good way.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright has achieved a fantastic way to bring a comic book to life. If you've really been searching for a live-action, 3D, moving version of a comic book then you'll want to pat him on the back. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World gets as close to bringing the ""graphic novel"" style to the big screen as Speed Racer was in successfully bringing the ""anime"" style to the theaters, which in my opinion is pretty darn close. Scott Pilgrim fans will get a kick out of this one; the film pays homage to the graphic novel in more ways than one. The problem is, you're fitting multiple volumes of this series into a 112 minute movie. The characterization is rushed, the relationships are sorely underdeveloped, a load of character history is barely (if even) explained, and you can't shake the ""there's-more-to-this-story-than-they're-telling-us"" feeling that only the hardcore Pilgrim fans are probably exempt from.<br/><br/>The acting was solid, the humor was definitely a strong point, but the tendency for the storyline to feel rushed often got in the way of fully enjoying this movie. All-in-all, it WAS a fun flick to say the least; it just wasn't all there.<br/><br/>If you're looking for another round of Michael Cera jokes and an intriguing comic book-style, then by all means check this one out. If that doesn't float your boat, then don't bother. Although style is a strong suit here, sometimes it teeters on the brink of being bizarre and immature. Re-watch the trailer- that will be enough ""style"" to suffice for one night.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The film centers on Scott Pilgrim (Played by Michael Cera), the bass guitarist for a band, and an overall slacker living with his gay roommate Wallace (Played by Kieren Culkin). His life is suddenly turned upside down when he falls in love with the mysterious Ramona Flowers (Played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Not only does he face the problem of currently dating a clingy teen four years his junior (Played by Ellen Wong), but in order to date Ramona, he must battle, and defeat her seven evil exes (Played by the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, and Brandon Routh), and along the way learns how to be a less selfish person.<br/><br/>It's not hard to see why the film, based on the series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, might turn some away. The novels' built in fan base will love the film I imagine, but it might be pretty divisive to those who aren't familiar with the source material, this includes myself. As for the overall product, I loved it.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Edgar Wright, who you may remember best for directing truly original, energetic, and hilarious comedies like Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. Like those two, he does this film beautifully. The comedy is wonderful, his direction is great, and he makes this film a visual and audial spectacle. He smartly presents the film in the style of video games, making great use of graphics, and audio, as well as providing some inspired sight and sound gags. Unlike myself though, it could prove exhausting to some, even to the point of Terry Gilliam exhausting, but Wright knew full well what he wanted to make, what he wanted the tone to be, and he hit it right.<br/><br/>As for the talent, I do think Michael Cera is getting majorly typecast in this sort of geek role, but he does a good job and provides some good laughs, and fans of his will be surprised by how much ass he kicks. Mary Winstead's character, and performance is great. She adds some clever nuances to her performance, and the mystery of her character makes her all the more interesting. The rest of the cast which includes Kieran Culkin, Ellen Wong, Anna Kendrick, Allison Pill, and the exes who I won't list individually, are fantastic as well, and get some great laughs.<br/><br/>Now for the action. There are a few directors who do action better than Wright, but there's no one who does action quite like him. He's simply a master of scene build up, and pacing, and how he shoots the film, matched with the brilliant efforts of his film editors Johnathan Amos and Paul Machliss is simply inspired. Every cut, every transition, every change in frame rate is a pure masterstroke of ambition for a film that is fast paced, hilarious, visually stunning, exhilarating, and brimming with great talent in spite of the film's few imperfections.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is one of the year's finest films, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****"
"Davidhowlandfx","9","6","19","25 August 2010"," Wonderful imaginative experience.
","To start out, I'd like to say I am 21 years of age, grew up playing video games on the NES, and SNES, and still play games to this day. I gave you that information because this movie is very demographically focused. This is not to say it isn't appealing to all ages, but to get the full experience you need to have played Zelda, Street Fighter, and Mario and been entertained by them. The whole film is a satire of high- school type drama and immaturity. Those who claim they didn't like the movie failed to see the satire and humor in the briefly disappointment and the randomness in the dialog. The acting was way over the top but again, it is a satire meant to be cheesy. If you go into this movie to find some serious drama than you are going to be let down. Since this is not a real downfall I will not mark the movie down like many of the negative reviewers. Michael Cera was obviously type-casted wonderfully as always. The part fits him like a glove and I don't wish for one second they cast someone else. Scott Pilgrim is meant to be an unfit, scrawny, and awkward nerd, which is presented beautifully. Wallace (played by Kieran Culkin) is another notable character being the source of many jokes about Cera's character and light, non-offensive gay jokes. Now on to the love interest. Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is perfect for the role. She is quite cute and of course quite ""anime esq."" with her colorful dyed hair and dangling split bangs. Carrying a fair amount of emotional baggage from her many break-ups with the ""Seven Evil Ex's"" is aloof and casual about her cautious love interest. She is loved a great deal by Scott and provides good reason to fight the 7 ex's. The fight scenes are visually stimulating and peppered with references to games like Street Fighter II, Super Mario, and Zelda. Such is prevalent in the enemies of Pilgrim (Michael Cera) spurting coins with every hit and erupting into a fountain of metal when defeated granting Scott points. The first enemy also makes reference to a n annoyance many of us gamers had with Street Fighter. The Man sang about fireballs while levitating in the air and didn't stop until he was silenced by a symbol to the face (what I would like to think is a reference to ""spamming the hadoken""). People are saying the fight scenes get repetitive but I see little repetition. My favorite fight is the one with Evil Ex #3, Todd Ingram (played by Brandon Routh), who is a super vegan. This battle is the second Scott participates in and the first he tries to mix up the action with (I'd add more detail, but I might spoil it). Effects are amazing. Both audio and video come together to make you feel like you are in some sort of Arcade/ Comic book hybrid. The experience is exclusively unique to this movie. Basically, there is no doubt people who love over the top action, Comic books, and especially video games should go and see this movie."

","Do you love video games? Do you read comics? Listen to indie/alternative music and find Michael Cera tolerable, then you're going to love this! The plot revolves around Scott Pilgrim, a 22 year old bass player who falls in love with a girl with a dark past that comes a'knocking soon after she responds to his courtship. The past consists of 7 evil exes that would like nothing more than to destroy Scott and pound him into dust, Scott must fight all of them in order to survive and ""get the girl"".<br/><br/>This movie isn't for everybody, it caters to a certain audience (""Kick Ass"" lover and ""Zombieland"" fanatics who drink Redbull or Gatorade). It has a unique style that captures a video game/comic book style perfectly. Visually speaking, this movie is top notch, with many fine details to go around and an electric soundtrack to go with.<br/><br/>Michael Cera steps out of his comfortable shell and gives a slightly different performance as the lovable Scott Pilgrim. He is funny, quirky, but not as neurotic and he looks believable as he pommels through Ramona's beefed up exes. The supporting cast is solid and there are a couple of cameos and Pop culture references for the hardcore fans out there.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fun, action packed comedy with solid visuals, great soundtrack (done by Beck), and it's made for an audience that most likely will wait for the DVD since they haven't been outside from the days that World of Warcraft came out, and that's a shame!"
"JimBobBTVS","10","5","15","22 August 2010"," Brilliant cult, comic book movie that hits its target audience on the dot!
","Seriously? Reading some of these reviews (I started from 1* upwards to see what people actually thought) it's become apparent that people have totally missed the point in this film. The world that constantly crops up to these imbeciles is 'emo'... How the hell is this film emo? Its fun, witty and action packed to the brim. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is purely because of how the ending slightly differs to the better comic book original.<br/><br/>Cera does a great job as Scott. I had my doubts as 99% of Cera's roles are the same character... he really changed his ways for this. My hats off have to go to Winstead who plays Ramona... just fantastic. And wow, did she look good.<br/><br/>I'm not one to waffle so I'll clear things up quickly. This is a great movie. Don't listen to the idiots who just don't get it, I expect they won't get any of the music or cult references either. These same people probably liked Kick-ass but again, not get the quirky little cult jokes (as a brit seeing Durham Red on a poster in Kick-Ass made me laugh and be proud at the same time). One review for this film said something on the lines of 'It focuses too much on video games yet never mentions Scott been into video games' ... I laughed at this.. again missing the point. He's not imagining the video game stuff.. It's that world, that creation of Bryan Lee O'Malley.<br/><br/>If you have read the Scott Pilgrim book series, you WILL adore this film. It does it justice. If you haven't read them or never read a comic or played on video games in your life, and/or are over the age of 35 and have no imagination... then avoid it because your only putting on stupid reviews that make no sense.<br/><br/>If you have any social and cult awareness, you will love it. Just... go see it... see it twice. Pre-order the blue-ray. Make them some well deserved money (seen as the terrible movie Expendables stole it all in the US)"

","I never thought i would put a pure 10 without hesitation to a new released movie. But yes, this one deserves it. I won't say anything about any scene or the plot. I will talk generally for this movie. Why? Because its an experience and if i talk i will spoil it. Stop reading reviews and go watch it. I started watching it, like ""what the hell"" and ended up with a permanent smile that i can't wipe out even after 3 days. This is one of the worst periods of my life people. I have broken up with my girlfriend, i am too stressed with my College, i am looking for a job and let's say that this is not the best time i had in my life. This movie gave me back the smile i lost, when nothing else could!<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best i have ever seen, because it touches you deeply. It is exceptional. It is fresh. It is genuine. It is mostly fun! It is for everyone. I can't think of a movie that i would enjoy more to watch at a cinema or at my living room, with friends. This was a revelation and i wanna share my opinion with the world.<br/><br/>By the way, i can see some people judge in a way they show me that they MISS THE POINT! A few examples:<br/><br/>""...forgets about keeping it real"" Oh, really? So in your opinion a movie MUST look like reality or what? Or 4/10? Can you really believe that people? Why then watch a movie? Watch reality from a balcony.<br/><br/>""...childish..no message that its trying to convey."" Aims also and mostly at adult audiences. Period. And i strongly disagree, it has plenty of messages.<br/><br/>""All flash, no substance."" Excuse me???? I strongly disagree. Did you actually saw the movie or did you people copy - paste something you just read about it?<br/><br/>""leaving his character seeming unlovable and unrelatable."" Another 2/10 that shows me that even he was sleeping before the movie ended, or he doesn't... oh forget about it....<br/><br/>Some guys (as i read at another review) even complained for making the audience laugh too much? REALLY? Isn't that a success for a comedy then? You got the picture people! The movie is EPIC! Stop reading reviews. Once again i recommend you, if you haven't seen it, you must!"

","*VERY LIGHT SPOILERS IN TERMS OF DESCRIBING SOME CHARACTERS AND JOKES*<br/><br/>The Scott Pilgrim graphic novel series is one of my favorites of all time. What seems to be just another love story quickly unfolds into the epic saga of a twenty-something that would apparently do everything to continue the love of his life: Ramona Flowers.<br/><br/>But this isn't about the comic! This is about Edgar Wright's interpretation of it. And knowing that he's the creator of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead (one of my favorite zombie movies ever), this couldn't go wrong for me. However, as a true fan of the franchise, I'm a bit disappointed at some points -- Wright seems to have completely reformed the book into what he thinks it should be, and for the most part this works exceedingly well, but sometimes, having read the book, you'll just scratch your head and wonder why he left THAT particular moment out, it being a significant moment in the book. So, as for implementing plot lines and key moments from the book in the movie, he does a pretty good job, although somewhat questionable for die-hards.<br/><br/>However: visually, this movie is amazing. The comic book/video game vibe Edgar Wright gave this movie is incredibly fitting. From the crashes and booms in true comic book style to the 1-ups: this movie breathes geekiness, in the most glorious way imaginable. The acting is decent, and most characters re-catch their typical personality and feel they got from the boos, however, there is one major flaw in my opinion on that behalf: Scott Pilgrim, pictured as an unsure, but pretty awesome guy in the comics, turns into some awkward teeny fellow here: come on guys, Michael Cera is a decent actor, but he's NOT Scott Pilgrim!<br/><br/>As for the jokes, it does what it does pretty well. Some of them are taken from the book, so they couldn't mess that up. Some of them are implemented by the makers though, and most of them are pretty funny (the other L-word!) but some of them are just weird and feel kind of forced to break the fourth wall (the censorship girl).<br/><br/>Even though this movie has its flaws, I've had a great laugh with it -- and so will you, especially if you're a fan of the graphic novels and always wanted to see it on the white screen! If I had to describe this movie in one word, I'd call it ""light"", but give me two words, and it turns into ""... also awesome""!"
"rusher-5","6","2","4","22 February 2012"," Fresh Take on Teen Films but Fails on Other Fronts
","I'll admit that I've never been neither much of a gamer nor an avid reader of comic books aka graphic novels. So, while I understood the gaming world references, there was little nostalgic value in the film for me personally and I had no idea about who Scott Pilgrim is.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely an achievement in teen movie genre that faces some problems with identity in the 21st century, IMHO. Michael Cera will definitely make you laugh, he's probably one of those characters you start to laugh at already seeing for the first time in the movie, the jokes are not as funny as Cera's characteristic stupid face and mannerisms. And that's a big problem with this film. You find yourself laughing not about the jokes but about the movie itself. Now, there's nothing wrong with it as Wright obviously intended ""Scott Pilgrim"" to be a stab at stupid action movies and video game clichÃ©s, among other things, but the attempts at serious drama just get lost in this CGI and Kung Fu or whatever extravaganza...<br/><br/>I remember ""Watchmen"" as I had a problem like this with that movie too. You might call it ""style over substance"" as nowadays, at least for me personally, ""Sin City"" like stylized comic book adaptations go far too over the top and it wouldn't be bad, it would be great if only they wouldn't try to attempt serious drama among all the CGI battles and explosions and Ddddddd's running on the street. <br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"", as I said, is not a bad movie as it entertains and gives you a good time. But it's nothing more than that. It doesn't feel as revolutionary in the visual area as Avatar was and the plot, while it could work despite all the massive ""why?"" questions about everything on the screen (why is Scott sleeping in the same bed with a guy who's having gay threesome at the same time), is massacred by empty characters you cannot relate to and who either bore you or are utterly repulsive.<br/><br/>It's not a bad movie- it brings new things to teen movie genre, like interesting and clever visuals and cool battle scenes, it entertains and is funny, even if drags a bit at the end. But it isn't particularly good film either, as it's inhabited by ""style over substance"" in all areas and over the top/ exaggerated characters you cannot and don't want to relate to. In this way it's similar to already mentioned ""Watchmen"""
"gigan-92","5","2","4","4 January 2012"," Ugh...Eh
","D+ <br/><br/>I don't see why one would praise this movie. It starts off as a teen melodrama, though its video game-like visuals I must admit were amusing. Michael Cera plays the same role he plays every damn time he's handed a role; the pathetic loser. Christopher Mintz-Plasse, not to go back to the all-too familiar McLovin role, is a general sense a likable nerd niche character. Cera's roles are just annoying. He ranges from a sniveling coward to a stuttering and indecisive would-be sweet talker. It's not a case of the same sh*t, which I can take, it's a case of the same annoying sh*t.<br/><br/>After a while into the film, after meeting the no doubt adorable Mary Elizabeth Winstead, out of nowhere comes Satya Bhabha flying thru a wall and then a very lame fight scene takes place. I love the colorful cinematography, I really do, but the action just isn't all that amazing. The whole movie, its trailers and various articles all seem to anticipate these grand and elaborate fight scenes with the ""seven evil exes"". It captures the comic book feel, yes, but only in a childish manner due to the gentleness of the fight scenes. Put in short I never feel our main protagonists is any real peril. I whole heartedly believe in disowning realism in the name of poetic license (being an avid fan of Godzilla here, enough said), and yet this film goes so far over the top they kill any possibility of creating tension. The cast had some very promising stars, such as Brandon Routh and Chris Evans, but their roles are so over-the-top there's no real threat. Sure, some of the comedy is sort of funny, but over-all the script was absurdly weak. The best joke in it all would be that the ""power of love"" got Cera's character killed, but the ""power of self-respect"" leads to victory.<br/><br/>About the only real theme I took to heart was the growing simplicity of contemporary music, akin to the twins' techno vs. the hardcore punk band scene, but it just doesn't hold up. I've read some graphic novels in my day, among them ""The Dark Knight Returns"", various Deadpool comics, Hellboy graphic novels and yes the Kick-Ass and Watchmen graphic novels, but if the Scott pilgrims are really as pointless as the movie then I'd sadly say I'd have to pass."

","A fresh burst of comedic brilliance mixed with the comic book genre that left a mark on my movie loving heart. Edgar Wright leaves every jaw dropped with this peculiar masterpiece of a flick. In combination with: the impressive use of letterboxing to enhance dramatic scenes; flawless VFX that although never realistic, added to the overall style; clever, childish (for lack of a better word) sound sound effects; and Edgar Wright's brilliant scene transitions that merged each and every action; the constant cartoonish style was amazingly executed and gave plenty more than it took. In addition, the pacing was sensationally expeditious, being vehemence and in doing so fashioning the final 'boss battle' and most of the movie to feel that of a video game. Dialogue was seamless and overall clever, sentences streamed from one to another as witty remarks were thrown from character to character. And with help from that, the characters felt perfectly entrenched in this world far before the plot called for them. All characters were perfectly casted, Michael Cera of course nailing the performance of Scott, who although nerdy and odd, had a strange charm that aided in connecting to him as the protagonist. The humour was absolute comedic genius, a joke never overstayed its welcome and every humourous moment could either give you a small smile, a slight chuckle or send you bursting into tears of laughter. The fight choreography put modern day fight scenes to shame as every battle handled more as a dance than a conflict, giving the audience more to enjoy rather than to endure. This movie is a complete masterpiece in my eyes, bringing a fresh take to comedy and bringing something we never knew we needed on film."

","I think that this movie was good and it is really worth the watch. It is funny and everything is just put together well. I will definitely watch it many times. I like how there are many different types of bands. I also like how there are a lot of different actors in it ranging from Anna Kendrick, Bill Hader, to Chris Evans who plays Captain America. It is cool how it shows many different types of style and different interests. I like how it focuses on both video games and bands. The music choice and the album that they made from the movie is really interesting and the music is really good. This is a cool mashup of games, music, drama, and comic books. This movie is very original and it took a lot of time to make it, but they did a good job. There are a lot of funny jokes and gags. No matter what it is, they are always able to keep the video game theme going. It is a fun and lighthearted movie. The editing and the effects are also very well done. By watching this movie, you can tell that it is a unique movie. I really like the storyline as well because it is such an old-timey movie. Edgar Wright brought this comic book to life. There is a lot of comedy and action. I feel like they should make a second one. It was put together well the first time, and I can only imagine what it would be like if they were to make a second one. I like how they have a battle of the bands. Scott is trying to get a girl by defeating all of her ex's like they would in a streetfighter video game. Scott stalks Romana Flowers because he has a crush on her, but she is very hard to talk to and get a hold of. The script was also perfect. I like how Ramona is not afraid to be herself and she is out there because people consider her to be the ""coolest person."" I also like how they have vintage things throughout the movie and just the whole aspect of it. Another thing that I like about the movie is the style and how they have the perfect grunge and band type looks. Another thing is how well they put the stage and the battle of the bands together. I like how they made the venue just like a regular concert venue. I also think that it is cool they have a girl drummer for the band. I like how Ramona tells Scott that he has to defeat her seven ex-boyfriends. I also like how Knives supports his band and how she loves him, but it is complicated for him. This movie is just full of quirks and it is all around a great movie and the acting and directing are amazing. The graphics and the editing are also great. If there was a second one, I will definitely watch it. One of my favorite movies."

","Creativity in comedy is rare to find from the genre in today's film landscape. Edgar Wright is one of the few working director's whose films are filled with so much passion, personality and energy; this is particularly true for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Like his other films, Scott Pilgrim excels at showing why comedy needs character and heart. Actors like Michael Cera and Audrey Plaza are perfectly cast in their roles (absolutely adore Chris Evan's cameo), allowing for the intented comedy to be delivered effectively. He even manages to get a good performance out of Brie Larson for heaven's sake. On top of this, Edgar Wright uses every tool at his disposal to squeeze every ounce of comedy and fun out of this wonderful script, by making the most of his editing. The way objects and characters enter the frame, the way sound edits are used for comedy (the use of the apple delete noise always cracks me up), the way he transitions from one scene to the next are all examples of how he uses the cinematography brilliantly. This adds so much to the entertainment value it baffles me that other comedy directors don't use similiar techniques. The pace and wit is relentless, the film is weird and quirky, hilariously sharp and entertaining from start to finish.

"volcanolam","9","0","0","9 February 2020"," Ingenious, clever, yet emotionally resonating. Edgar Wright is at the peak of his powers with Scott Pilgrim vs The World.
","Edgar Wright's magnum opus. An exceptionally ingenious, yet surprisingly heartfelt film about the struggles of relationships and themes of commitment, change and self-belief. The film delves into an troubled young adult's psyche and puts him in a bizzare world of magic-realism, which fosters Wright's typical blend of visual comedy. It is an exhilarating and awe-inspiring watch that showcases Edgar Wright creativity, humor and deft direction, whose endless improvisations and defiance of conventional filmmaking points to him being the INFP soul that his protagonist is.<br/><br/>The film opts for the usual light-hearted and fast paced approach to tell its story. It is impeccably scripted with great comedic touch, filled with cleverly layered callbacks and foreshadowing. The pop culture references are genuinely hilarious, especially the part concerning veganism, while it also subtly covers broader social themes such as racial inclusion. Still, the film never loses its way in all the visual spectacle and frivolity, and packs an emotional core that is both relatable and meaningful.<br/><br/>It is one of those films with so much clever details in both its visuals and its dialogue that requires rewatches to fully appreciate, a quality I feel shared with many of my favourite films of the 2010s, Birdman, The Grand Budapest Hotel etc. It is one of the highlights of this decade made by one of modern cinemas most unique and talented auteurs."
"Offworld_Colony","9","0","0","7 February 2020"," About as a good an adaptation as we could have got at this budget and this length.
","No doubt this would have been a Netflix series now if it hadn't been made already but at least it was choraled and helmed by the most appropriate nerdcool zeitgeisty visionary in Edgar Wright.
It's edgy, subtle, sublime video gamey, comicy stuff. A decent and clever adaptation even if some of the magic and spirit of the comics is lost, but I guess something else is gained; The cast for example and the creative editing and the library of sound effects and visual references from my past.
The film manages to say something about possessive ex partners, baggage, the human condition and growing up. Pilgrim is like no one I've ever seen on film; a narcissistic, weak, lucky, sneaky, cowardly, loveable sociopath and I've met and befriended a ton like him. Not all of them learn the self respect to treat other people better like Scott does.
It's a shame that the whole movie leads up to the deleted ending and they bottled it and went with something a little contrary to the themes. Still, damn good fun."

","The movie has no real parallels. It is Napoleon Dynamite quirky, and slightly reminiscent of 60's acid films (which may be the best way to watch this movie.) Scott Pilgrim is in a band with Stephen Stills and a guy name Young Neil waiting in the wings. He is currently dating a 17 year old Chinese school girl who wears Catholic school uniforms. Her name is Knives. They play video games together. Scott has a dream about a girl, then meets her in real life. They start to date and now he finds out if they are to continue dating he must fight (literally) her 7 ex-boyfriends. These fights take on the characteristics of video game battles complete with Batman like ""Zonk"" words, special effects, and magical weapons. The humor is at times laugh out loud funny. The dialogue is extremely clever and witty. Scott also lives with (shares a bed with) a gay roommate (Wallace), although Scott is not gay. Wallace has the ability to immediately text message Scott's sister whenever something happens in Scott's life. He can even do it passed out drunk. If you liked this film you might also enjoy ""Kick-Ass"" which also boasts quirky humor and special fight effects.<br/><br/>No nudity. No foul language. Adult situations.

","It's crazy to think about how many Hollywood stars were in Scott Pilgrim just before they really stepped into their primes as actors. This was a year before Chris Evans played Captain America for the first time, Aubrey Plaza had just begun Parks and Rec, Anna Kendrick was just nominated for an Academy Award that year, Brie Larson hadn't done Room or Short Term 12 yet, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead was finally getting cast in bigger budgeted films. Knowing all of that now, makes going back and watching the film a little bit more fun than it probably should, though it is certainly an entertaining film on its own. That's putting it mildly. For all intents and purposes, Scott Pilgrim is a balls to the wall bonkers comic book adaptation, the kind of film that almost certainly inspired Tim Miller when he adapted Deadpool years later, just purely for its irreverent humor mixed with a heartfelt romance. And much like Deadpool, you either buy into the stylistic choices early on, or you don't.

","I have always loved this movie, I really have. During the summer after my freshman year of college in 2014 I actually went on a road trip to Tornoto with 5 other friends. We watched the movie the night before we left and drank a bunch of cheap beer like the hipsters we were. In Toronto we visited pretty much ever noteworthy location from the movie (not kidding in the slightest...). I always related to this movie because I played in bands and was part of that ""hipster"" scene/culture the movie pokes fun at. I loved the way it made fun of that culture and incorporated music and jokes about music. Just everything about the first hour and change is perfect - I love it and it represents the life I was living, and the production and music is just absolutely hilarious and top notch!<br/><br/>But once it gets the the Katayanagi Twins Boss Fight (lol), I always felt the movie was kind of falling apart. Because I always feel unfulfilled with the ending of the movie when the credits come, I can't really put my finger on why. I guess it just feels unfinished in some respect and rushed (altough the two jokes ""comic book is better than the movie"" and ""their first album is much better than... their first album"" always crack me up). The rest of the plot of the movie had a good pace, but not the last half hour or so, which is a real bummer. A lot of the movie subverts expectations, which makes it pretty brilliant especially if you can somewhat relate to it. I did watch the movie before I read the comics though but the ending was very guessable and didn't feel very ""epic"" like the rest of it. Maybe that was the point, and if you liked the ending I envy you because this movie is a 10/10 for me until this part, hence the 3 star deduction. Otherwise this would be rated higher.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I think it's insanely clever and well produced and worth a couple watches! It is still one of my favorite movies of all time. For this movie to be awesome, I don't think it has to be perfect or a 10/10 because there is nothing else like this out there - but at the same time, there is a part of me that wishes the ending sequences were better. Not even that the ending plot changes (I can't remember how the comics end off the top of my head) but that it was more fulfilling. And I don't know if it could have been done any other way either.<br/><br/>But yeah, you should watch it! Even if you don't like it, I'm sure you'll catch references throughout it that the movie makes or that you have heard made about the movie!"

","The interestingly-titled 'Scott Pilgrim vs the World' is based on a comic book about a young man who has to fight his new girlfriend's seven evil ex boyfriends. No, seriously. And, if the first question you're asking is ""Why?"" then you're probably like me. First of all this is a movie (probably!) more for teenagers and youngsters (not bitter and cynical forty-somethings such as myself), therefore I'm guessing that most people will just go with it, rather than questioning every single plot point like I found myself doing.
I did enjoy the film - sort of. Once you allow yourself to get past just how ludicrous the plot is, you'll find that it is in fact quite funny. The titular Scott Pllgrim, played by the totally typecast Michael Cera, falls in love with a new girl in his town, only to discover that, in order to win her heart, he has to beat and pummel all her 'evil' exes one after another. And it's quite fun to watch, possibly because it knows how daft it is and therefore plays on it, deciding to shoot the film almost like a computer game from yesteryear. Expect 'life gauges' to appear on screen every time Scott picks a fight with someone new. Plus plenty of visual comic-like clues as to the fact that it wants you to know that it's based on a comic book, such as written text on the screen to emphasise sounds and feelings.
I'd probably forget the film quite quickly if it wasn't for the fact that it's co-written and directed by Edgar Wright, best known for working with Simon Pegg on various film collaborations. I think it's fair to say that Wright has a visual style that really works with this type of film. Every scene he emphasises silly little things in order to draw your attention to little details that most films overlook. I found myself enjoying how the film looked even more than the actual film itself. Sorry for the generalisation, but I do think that younger cinema audiences will enjoy the story aspect, however it was funny enough to keep me entertained and had a visual flair that is often missing from mainstream Hollywood. Just a pity Edgar Wright never got to do his vision of Marvel's 'Antman!'
If nothing else, it's worth watching Captain 'Chris Evans' America take the beating that even Iron Man himself couldn't manage!"

"Screen_Blitz","9","0","0","10 April 2017"," For a sweet, funny video game-style action thrill ride, Scott Pilgrim makes the score
","It's funny, it's clever, it's undeniably sweet, and it all comes from the pages of Bryan O'Malley's hit graphic novel series of the same name. This romantic action comedy is not your average romantic comedy, it is a subversive action comedy that shuttles far from the usual rom-com conventions. Director Edgar Wright, following the success of 'Shaun of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', orchestrates an electrifying love story with a style that echoes the works of comic books. Blending the action with subtle humor, clever pop culture references, and video game-style elements; this movie pulls viewers in for hyper-kinetic, stylized fun from beginning to end. And the main figure in the film's spotlight is charming comedic star Michael Cera, stepping in the shoes of the eponymous character. Set in Toronto, Canada, this film star Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, a 22- year old slacker who's life consists of playing guitar with his band known as Sex Bob-Omb and sharing an apartment with his gay roommate Wallace (played by Kieran Culkin). While dating an underage Asian girl named Knives (played by Ellen Wong), Scott fantasizes about a hot American girl named Ramona Flowers (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Upon meeting her at a party, Scott forms a relationship with her while dumping his Asian girlfriend in the process. Their relationship quickly becomes disrupted however, when Ramona's seven evil ex-lovers are targeting him. With his relationship with Ramona at stake, Scott must defeat her seven ex-lovers in a series of comic book-style battles in order to win her heart.<br/><br/>This movie is a sweet romantic comedy that takes its genre and polishes it with a shockingly creative twist that is likely to win the hearts of a much larger demographic. Unlike most romantic comedies which often nowadays slip in the cracks of formula and corniness, this entry pedals on a radical execution that transcends an average love story into a cartoon-style battle of good versus evil. As eccentric as this concept sounds, Edgar Wright makes diligent effort to make this one work. Opening with the Universal Pictures logo pinned an 8-bit fanfare, this film sets the character in a world incorporated with video game elements including a soundtrack from the 'Legend of Zelda' series which makes it way a dream sequence. The concept however, plays a major role in the hyper-kinetic fighting sequences when the titular character is force to face down against the former lovers of his new girlfriend. With animated heads-up display popping on screen and retro video game sound effects playing, these action sequences deliver pulse-pounding thrills that not only intend to keep viewers glued to their seats but serve as love letters for the video-game nerds. The sequences and the story itself move at a solidly fast pace, and there is rarely a moment that is wasted here. Although the caricature style of the action will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea, it sets out to be entertaining and not be taken seriously.<br/><br/>Michael Cera makes a reasonable impression in the eponymous role. Suiting in his typical awkward teenager typecasting, Cera gives a charismatic portrayal of the titular character, sparkling the role with charm and humor. His quirkiness makes a match for his lover Ramona Flowers who is beautifully portrayed by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. While her bold performance stands well, the real driving force behind her romance with Michael Cera is not their cold chemistry but his desperate will to win her heart no matter what it takes to do so. The duo share a good amount of comedic bond with humor and dialogue that veers in the realm of subtly. Easily one of their most witty scenes takes place when Ramona metaphorically says ""we all have baggage"" and Scott responds ""Yeah, well my baggage doesn't try to kill me ever five minutes"", lines that shed small light in each of the characters's pasts with ex- lovers. Meanwhile, the story is driven the action between Scott and Ramona's ex-lovers which include a cast of Chris Evans, Jason Schwartzmann, Mae Whitman (Yes, a girl), Brandon Routh, Satya Bhahba, and a duo of Chinese actors -- most of which get a nice swipe at some clever humor. The rest of cast including Johnny Simmons, Kieran Culkin, Mark Webber, Anna Kendrick, and Alison Pill make good use of their screen time; nothing more, nothing less. <br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is a sweet, funny, video game-style comedy polished with plenty of stylized action and brainy humor, and makes for an entertaining testament to Bryan O'Malley's source material. Edgar Wright embraces an over-the-top cartoony style, and makes surprisingly good use with it. And for those who believe only video game fans or teen rom-com fanatics will find appeal out of this, think again!"

Yes, the movie is weird and especially the first fight scene with Indian music and dancing will make some people say what the hell, but if you make it through the while movie, you'll get one of the best comedies in existence.<br/><br/>Hell, i love Edgar Wright and i can't wait to see Baby Driver this year."

","A comic book adaptation which doesn't shy away from its geeky roots, Edgar Wright's imagining of his titular hero - played expertly by Michael Cera - is as campy, over-the-top and teenagery as you would hope for the portrayal of an unemployed, 20-something who plays bass and has a 17-year-old Asian schoolgirl beau.<br/><br/>In a world in which any and everyone seems to be superheroically enhanced, our nominative hero battles the League/Guild of 'Seven Deadly Exes' of new crush, Ramona Flowers. The quirky feel of the film is what makes it so enjoyable though, from a visual 'pee bar' which drains with the character, to hugely enjoyable snappiness of characters such as Kieran Culkins' roommate, Wallace or Anna Kendricks' sister, Stacey who really add to the film's frantic and frenetic rhythm. The battles/fight Sequences themselves do leave something to be desired, but it is clear to see that these are simply the window dressing, nerd-bait designed to appease more ardent fans. In reality, the best moments of this film come in the form of character development, growth and pathos which is not-so-subtly reflected via meta visuals on screen (""Scott just earned his self-respect Power Up!"") Overall, it's an enjoyable enough romp with enough enthusiasm and vigor to keep you interested for it's very reasonable runtime."

","This is my first IMDb review, and for these, I plan on writing about my favorite aspect of the film at hand (...even if I don't like it...). In the case of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, it was Edgar Wright's direction.<br/><br/>Adapting novels to the silver screen can be a struggle for many directors, but that task gets even harder when the novel is one that already comes with a visual element - as is the case with Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. However, Edgar Wright retains the magic of the graphic novel, while being able to put his stamp all over the film. He makes great use of quick cuts throughout the film in order to string together both the progression of time and often humorous transitions. He also refused to abandon just how absurd the story of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is and the film is all the better for it. Wright is also quite a good director of action scenes as well. The fight scenes aren't always so much intense as they are a lot of fun to watch - matching the experience of the entire film."

","WHAT'S SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD ABOUT? A geek must battle his girlfriend's exes for her heart. Literally battles them.<br/><br/>IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: B) Director Edgar Wright has directed and co-written two of my all-time favorite comedies, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. The appeal of his work lies in both the originality of his direction (even the film editing is funny) and in the sharpness of his screenplays. His latest, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, represents a step up for Wright as a director, but sadly, it's also a step down for him as a screenwriter. In terms of visuals and sound, Scott Pilgrim is one of the most creative films of the past decade, and I don't mean merely in a ""Wow, that CGI looks cool!"" kind of way. The film-making itself is endlessly inventive as Wright blends the styles of comic books, video games, and rock n'roll into a charming love letter to geek culture.<br/><br/>Michael Cera (Arrested Development, Juno) successfully stretches a bit beyond playing the affable, clueless nice guy role he's made a career out of. Those elements are still there, but so is an edge of selfishness and, ultimately, growth. What's more, he impresses with speed, flexibility, and coordination in the film's many fight scenes. He also really plays the guitar in the musical scenes, impressively shredding it up.<br/><br/>The plot, as it is, finds amateur guitarist Scott Pilgrim having to battle the ""seven evil exes"" of his new girlfriend, who is quite literally the girl of his dreams (played by Live Free or Die Hard's Mary Elizabeth Winstead). In the mix are a gay roommate, an Asian high-school girlfriend (one of the film's highlights), a movie star (Captain America's Chris Evans), a super-powered Vegan (Superman Returns' Brandon Routh), a trail of broken hearts, and a battle of the bands. It's fun stuff, but a film this intentionally silly needs two things to blossom: more laughs and a shorter running time. Scott Pilgrim clocks in at nearly two hours; it should be about 20 minutes shorter, and the pacing lags in spots.<br/><br/>What's more, while the film is quite funny, it is neither as clever nor as packed with humor as Wright's previous movies. Too many jokes fall flat, perhaps because too many revolve around Scott's roommate and his sex life. I have no problem with sympathetic portrayals of LGBT characters, but the character isn't well-rounded. His sexuality gradually becomes his only defining characteristic. Also, Scott's relationship with the female lead goes from zero-chemistry awkwardness to physical intimacy without any transition in between. I know the film wasn't striving for realism, but even by movie standards, that was a stretch. Though there is entertainment and ingenuity to be found in Scott Pilgrim vs the World, there are also some flaws and, depending on your tastes, potentially offensive content."

","Based on a popular series of graphic novels, this elaborate action comedy focuses on an unemployed youth who finds his life turning into a video game in which he has to 'battle' an attractive girl's exes to secure her heart. Director Edgar Wright uses several dreamy scene transitions to establish a blur between reality and fantasy early on with characters in one frame seeming to interact with the action in the next frame. The film is also populated with eye-popping special effects, ranging from info graphics to words and lines that jump off the screen to comic book style punches and blows during the fights. In short, it is visually arresting motion picture through and through. The universe in which the film exists does not always ring true though. Much of the fun comes from how lead Michael Cera is absolutely baffled by the superhero-ish powers of the exes, but nobody else seems to think anything of comic style fights breaking out in the middle of concerts or on movie sets. None of the fights come with much sense of danger either as Cera bounces back being dropped and whacked unscathed like a cartoon character. Never to mind, the film offers a sufficiently engaging parable of the issues facing young adults today with everything that occurs in the film highly metaphorical. It is about Cera standing up for himself (and to himself!), getting over his old girlfriend who he is still pining for, and going the extra mile to win the heart of a girl he fancies. Whether he ends up with the right girl is debatable, but the journey alone is worth experiencing at least once."

","This movie is great.<br/><br/>In my opinion it is not a good as the books its based of, this is because a lot of character development for both main and side characters is missing so the movie can have a suitable run time.<br/><br/>A lot of jokes which were originally from scenes in the books which are not present in the movie have been given new context, this means there are more laughs packed together keeping the movie funny throughout.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to people of the ages 12-25 mainly as the comedy, style and references seem to be more aimed towards that audience. If you have read the books the movie may seem slightly disappointing simple due to the previously mentioned lack of side plots from the book. If you haven't read the books don't worry about being lost in plot as the movie makes perfect sense alone."

","Scott Pilgrim Vs The World (2010): Dir: Edgar Wright / Cast: Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kieran Culkin, Ellen Wong, Jason Schwartzman: Perhaps the most original film of the year, this fantasy comedy regards proving oneself. Michael Cera stars as Scott Pilgrim, a failed musician who answers a breakup with a musician by dating a 17 year old high school Asian girl. Soon he has visions of the purple haired Ramona who manifests into his own life, however, he is confronted with her seven exes whom come at him with an array of powers. Director Edgar Wright previously made Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz and here he creates something even more unique. While sometimes repetitious, the film is visually stunning and ridiculous with hilarious references to video games. Cera is best as his usual insecure loser who goes from a breakup to an underage relationship to a new relationship that he will fight for. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Ramona who represents relationship baggage yet a genuine affection for Cera. Kieran Culkin is hilarious as Cera's gay roommate who steals every scene he is in. Ellen Wong steals her scenes as Pilgrim's 17 year old Asian girlfriend. She brings a sense of confusion and joy demonstrating her loyalty to Pilgrim and naïve nature with regards to his relationship with Ramona. The Evil Exes are hilarious and led by Gideon, played with great comic extremes by Jason Schwartzman. A send off to 80's video games and society's dislike for competing factors. It is as funny as it is clever sending Pilgrim ahead to his ultimate battle where Scott Vs soul searching. Score: 9 / 10"
"calvind-4","9","0","0","4 August 2015"," Profound.
","If there's one franchise that's been hanging over me for the last five years, it's Scott Pilgrim. I'd always taken a liking to the art style of the books, and I vowed that I'd get to reading them one day. Since the last colourised book came out in May this year, I don't think I could've come up with a more appropriate time to get started. I bought the first volume, read it - couldn't put it down! It was a real page-turner! So I bought the rest, and thoroughly enjoyed it. For those unaware, Scott Pilgrim is a guy who has to fight his girlfriend's seven evil exes over the course of a year in a Toronto where RPG and video game elements are the most prevalent aspects of those who live in it, what with levelling systems and extra lives and save points and what have you. It's an epic in its own right, very well written - but I'm not going to deny that it has flaws, too. In spite of them though, it's at heart a story set in late-80s early-90s pop culture, with Bryan Lee O'Malley's distinctive style defining it. The movie came out a mere month after the last volume, in August 2010, which probably would have meant that the ending of the books was still being written when it was being filmed, I guess? The director is Edgar Wright, who also directed those movies with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, so I think we're in good hands.<br/><br/>So... wow, is this movie deep. Particularly toward the beginning, it follows the books particularly closely, while still allowing room to deviate into its own plot line. It does start to derail toward the end, to the point where there are TWO endings to the film! (I've only seen the theatrical one at the time of this writing.) Also, instead of playing out over a year, it plays out within only a month, which is kind of a shame since I think to take anything from the Scott Pilgrim books would hurt them, but what're you gonna do. For what we have though, I'm happy with how faithful it is to the source material.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright really brings the conventions of comic books to the screen what with experimental camera movement and the interplay between fore and background, and as a nod to the multitudinous Easter eggs to be found in the books, the movie has a multitude of his own. You know how each evil ex are assigned a number? Their scenes have that number in the background somewhere. On top of that, the letter X is played among them (you know - X, ex?) See how many you can spot! Even if the RPG elements are abandoned, the video game elements are not, carrying over from the comics and scattered in spades, turning up in even the most mundane of situations. Which also leads into its use of typography, invoking onomatopoeia every which way where and when suitably evocative.<br/><br/>As with the books, the story follows Scott and his battle with the League of Evil Exes. He's willing to go through with it, accept it as inevitability on his path to a relationship with Ramona Flowers. Having watched David Chen's video essay on this movie before watching it, I understand that the battles are metaphoric of the battles we go through in our own lives, attempting to overcome obstacles and emotional baggage, which seems daunting and sometimes feels just not worth going to the trouble of. Something like that. Anyway, each battle has their own distinctive vision, and Scott uses various methods to conquer them, including assistance from Ramona, and his own ex, Knives Chau. Speaking of which... I think her story's switched around a bit, she doesn't use hair dye as part of her battle costume - she uses it to mimic Ramona's when she's trying to hook up with Young Neil. I... am not sure how this works, but I'm not going to question it. The Katayanagi brothers really don't get much of a part either, unfortunately. They just come and go. Which, unfortunately, is what comes of having to cram six books' worth of material into 112 minutes. To that end, if you're expecting characters like Lisa Miller, Joseph, Mobile, and Gideon the cat, you won't find them. They're not here.<br/><br/>While we're on the subject of subtractions... the Subspace doors are only ever used twice in the film, even though it was a concrete element in the books. This causes a few truncations to some scenes which, while not having a major effect on the story, still do give rise to some unfortunate implications. Ramona also mentions a computer chip on the back of her neck, which I don't remember from the books, but that has some meaning too. Gideon represents how a significant other's most recent ex still has a hold on them, and still has a possibility of reclaiming them (which probably explains the sub-dom fantasy thing seen in Subspace/the Chaos Theatre).<br/><br/>So, after all that, where does this whole thing leave Scott? He realises he needs much more than love and infatuation: he needs humility, contrition, self respect... and apparently, Balls +8. But by now I'm probably giving away too much detail, so I'm just going to wrap things up.<br/><br/>This movie speaks a truth - and David's essay pointed me towards it: when you intertwine your life with someone else's, you share their burdens, struggles, and the ghosts of their past - and when you emerge from the battle with the past, the best thing you can anticipate is the doorway to an uncertain future, with the reassurance that we can walk through that door together. That's what makes Scott Pilgrim - both the books AND this movie - so sublime."

","As I went out of the movie theater after watching this film, two things happened. The first - my mind exploded. The second - coins fell onto the floor while making exaggerated gaming-like sound effects. This movie is by any definition, and especially visually speaking, a work of art. The scenes, the edit, the characters, the sounds and music, the special effects and pretty much every single aspect came together to form something that has never been made thus far in a live action motion picture. Gaming geeks are the main audience for this movie, because... well, the plot is very bizarre, and is based on a comic novel that is based on the idea of how it would be like if life was like a video game. a retro one. So yeah, a heath of warning: if you're the kind of person who looks for logic in whatever he sees, raising an eyebrow when something doesn't really makes sense or fit in, stay darn away from this film. But if you're open minded, a little bit geeky, and enjoy awesome scenes involving a ton of special effects, non-realistic one-on-one fights and many many MANY gaming and comic references, this funny and cool movie will indeed, blow you're mind.

","By nature, I do not care for rom-coms in the least, but for Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, I'll make a rare exception. It's unique, funny, and oddly romantic in parts, mixing your traditional romantic comedy with video game and comic book elements.<br/><br/>While calling a movie a video game is usually a derogatory thing, here it's part of what makes Scott Pilgrim so much fun. The fight scenes are what a video game movie should be: colorful and completely over the top in every way. Imagine if the Super Mario Bros movie from the early 1990s had been shot like Scott Pilgrim-- or most any video game adaptations which try way too hard to cram their sources into realistic and traditional cinematic narratives. Another plus is the way this movie subverts rom-com clichés, from the character types seen in these pictures to the way the plot goes.<br/><br/>I had to borrow the DVD from a friend, but I totally need to get this one as soon as possible.

","The story is nothing special, just another story that revolves around romantic relationships. But what makes it interesting is that it caters to the appetite of the majority of the population of the movie goers, the youngsters. The movie tells story in a very hyperbolic way with all those comic styled written sound effects and all those game style detail notifications. But what make it even more hyperbolic are those battles with the exes. It's a great homage to Kill Bill movies in my eyes, as well as a great tribute to the more geeky youngsters who are in the band scene and the other youngsters who are gamers. The finale gives a very nice twist in line with the all too common gaming culture of save points and redo lives. The acting is just standard overall fr me. No one in this movie offers anything special with their acting parts, even having Chris Evans doesn't really help at the acting. But the whole movie feels very much entertaining, and that should be enough to cover for it."

","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a fairly regular guy who lives with his gay friend Wallace (Kieran Culkin). Scott has dreams of hitting the big time with his band. He's a 22 year old man who's in a relationship with a 17 year old Chinese catholic girl (much to the dismay of his friends). Scott's world turns on its head when he meets the girl of his dreams (literally) when he meets Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who has moved from New York to Toronto and works as a delivery girl for Amazon. Scott becomes obsessed with Ramona and a relationship begins to blossom between Scott and Ramona. However, Scott quickly learns that Ramona's love comes at a high price and finds that he must defeat her seven deadly exes in order to have the privilege of 'dating' her. Will he be successful? <br/><br/>The thing I really liked about this film is that it's a lot of fun, but it's also really clever as well. A lot of humour comes from parody, but the way that this film creates the parody is wonderfully inventive. The writers could have been lazy and spoofed a lot of films which if done right could have been funny, but not terribly original. With Scott Pilgrim vs the world it combines two great things - originality and humour. The laughter track between Scott and Wallace was clearly a parody of sitcoms (it is used in British sitcoms, but I believe that it's far more common in the US). The battle sequence where Scott is battling the evil ex that is a Hollywood actor and then ends up battling a load of stunt doubles which was very clever and very funny. The genre of Computer Games are the biggest focus for parody and that is where the most fun can be found in this film. I'm sure that there were countless others, but these are just a few that have come off the top of my head.<br/><br/>The film is also very stylish and the visuals are great; the battle sequences are also very impressive and again a few surprises are thrown in to hold the audiences attention - these surprises are funny and they also help to keep things fresh and unpredictable.<br/><br/>Acting wise we'll start with Michael Cera; I'll be the first to admit that I'm not a big fan of him and haven't always found him that appealing in other films that I've seen him in, but I actually thought he was good in this film and wasn't annoying for once. I wish the same could be said of Ellen Wong, but for the most part she really got on my nerves. I think Alison Pill gave one of the best performances as Scott's ex Kim. Her moody teenage character was probably the most believable and she gave a nice understated performance.<br/><br/>The films throws in some moralising towards the end, but Wright and co even manage to make the moralising aspects of the film to be funny and clever - such as Scott's 'self respect' moment at the end. Whilst I don't believe that this is the 'masterpiece' that many claim it to be it is a film that made me laugh several times and it was a film that I found to be wickedly clever on many occasions. Great fun!"

For fans of the comics, it is almost word-for-word extracted from the books, which is pretty rare for a film. A lot of love went into the making of this movie, and it shows. <br/><br/>The pace is near light-speed, but it has to be because it packs an entire comic series into a single movie. It also makes the humour non- stop and sets up for some really unexpected laughs and transitions. There are some great cameos in the film, like the 'vegan police', Chris Evans as a 'pretty good action hero' and Aubrey Plaza in particular is really fun to watch as a cranky, jealous girl who swears like a trucker. <br/><br/>There are no deep themes or revelations to be found here. It just manages to be very, very entertaining if you like offbeat, semi-ADHD humour."

After meeting her, he asks her out. Shortly afterward, Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha) shows up and claims that in order to continue dating Ramona, Scott has to defeat him and the other six ""evil exes"".<br/><br/>Right from the opening Universal studio logo shot this movie is just wicked fun. It's hilarious right from the start, it's like watching someone play a video game, and not to mention, the action is pro-kid! Bring an two-year old to this because when people are killed or damaged, they don't bleed, they burst into coins. It's romantic at times and the story is quite simple to follow.<br/><br/>I simply loved the way that the text appeared on screen at certain times. I enjoyed all the comedy and it's nothing brilliant or deep about it which makes it all the more intelligent. The fact that Edgar wasn't trying to be a big blockbuster hit makes this movie that much greater! I find this movie to be a sleeper hit. It might not make as much as Inception or The Expendables, but in my eyes, this is a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>I think another great addition to Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is that the f-word is bleeped out and they work that fact into the storyline and make it even funnier. Michael Cera's delivery is spot-on and I love the look of Mary Winstead as Ramona. I remember Winstead from Final Destination 3, but she's never looked as hot as she does here, especially with the pink hair.<br/><br/>Even parents who go with their kids to this film will have a good time. It's a fun movie, and shouldn't be viewed as anything else. I don't care about the physic errors or anything because that's not what the story is about.

He is damn funny (without having to default to humor centered around bodily functions) , has a visionary style and you can just tell that he makes the movies he wants to make, the way he wants to make them, without compromise.<br/><br/>Part comic book, part video game, part dream... the cinematic language here is excitingly unique, daring and fun and reminds me of how I felt about Moulin Rouge, Amelie or Fight Club upon first viewings.<br/><br/>What really makes the premise work is that no one ever questions the impossible reality of what is occurring. It seems as if they should be asking themselves ""Why can this guy fly and shoot fire from his hands""... but no one ever does. It's just taken as this universe's truth. It achieves the rare balance (these days) of suspension of disbelief and genuineness, prolific use of CGI FX and retention of character and heart. <br/><br/>The entire cast shines brilliantly. Everything works exactly as it should. You care about the good guy, you like his sidekicks, you fall in love with the girl, you loathe the bad guys. <br/><br/>Some folks may feel they are tiring of the 'Micheal Cera' character, so they may decide to skip this film - and they would be doing themselves a disservice. Micheal Cera has this thing that some actors have in Hollywood which sometimes works for them or against them. Woody Allen is a great example. Woody Allen perfected the 'Woody Allen' character, a character no one else could possibly play, and that character would reliably show up in any movie he appeared in. If you like that character, you are always happy to see him. If you don't, then you'll never like a film he's in, because unlike character actors, he never disappears into a role the role disappears into them.<br/><br/>Such is the role of Scott Pilgrim - which seems to have been written with Micheal Cera in mind, because it fits the Cera character to a 'T'. But I think that is where Cera's talent lies. He has the ability to make every moment seem fresh, every word seem as if they are really his words organically pinched from his thoughts in that very moment. He is like a true Zen master, in which whatever arises in every moment is new to him, like a naive young child experiencing things for the 1st time.<br/><br/>Great indie band soundtrack including a great new song from Beck, and a geekgasm inducing score based on old 8/16-bit video game music. <br/><br/>Go support this movie at the box office so that Edgar Wright can continue to follow his vision wherever it takes him.<br/><br/>This is my favorite movie of the summer, maybe even of the year... maybe even of longer than that."

The movie is very heavily influenced by video games, and it appeals mostly to those of us who grew up on Nintendo. Even if you're not one of those people, the film really doesn't completely rely on these references to survive. Edgar Wright, the writer/director of two of the funniest movies of the last decade, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, is a great comedic director, and the film is full of great comedic timing and detail. The movie is also blessed with a fantastic cast, almost overstuffed with great performances, really. There are so many great characters in the film, some of them get short shrift. My favorite character was the girl whom Scott dumps before moving on to Ramona, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), a Chinese, Catholic high schooler who obsesses over him for the rest of the movie. I also loved the sarcastic drummer from Scott's band, played by Alison Pill. Last year's Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick also co-stars in a far too small roll as Scott's younger sister."

","In an age of comic book blockbusters around every corner rarely do we get to experience the piece's film adaptation how the original visionary, the comic book write, saw it. Scott Pilgram vs. The World Changes that. It gives you the humor, excitement, visuals and rapid pacing commonly associated with comics during 2 of the most enjoyable hours you will spend in a theater this summer. The writer and director of two of the better comedies of the past decade, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Edgar Wright takes on this interesting piece and does an incredible job. And casting Michael Cera was perfect. He may get a lot of hate for having the tendency to play the same role, but I believe that is because he is so talented he makes you feel like he truly is that character, a skill that is many times overlooked in comedies. At times it may fell lengthy, but that is due to the pacing of this movie. There is absolutely no down time. One scene blends directly into the next and so on. It is a very unique concept that many other comic book movies should consider in the future too. The only thing that is going to hold this movie back is the HORRIBLE advertising. If I hadn't won free tickets I can honestly say I would not have gone. Whoever is in charge of these advertisements should never be given another job."

The movie on a purely visual stance is breath taking, the over the top fight scenes are done extremely well and all the little words and status bars throughout are cleverly placed. You do not need to be a nerd of epic proportions to enjoy this movie. You do however have to enjoy silly humor and suspend your disbelief. <br/><br/>There is nothing realistic about this movie, characters are knocked through four walls before being punched in the face. Through hundreds of feet and have wall speaker dragons coming at them.

"ced_yuen","Null","5","16","5 September 2010"," A love letter to the wired generation
","Let's get one thing clear: 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' will not be a universally-loved classic. It will not be well-received by the majority of the cinema-going public. The reason for this is that it is a niche movie. It is a celebration of all things geek, and is far too quirky for an audience that expects its summer flicks to be conventional. That it has not done particularly well at the box office is an indication of the power of the advertisements, which have successfully alienated the mainstream. With that out the way, let's get talking about marmite.<br/><br/>After the success of 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz', Edgar Wright found his foot in the Hollywood door. When he made it big, it was easy to assume that he would follow the same formula that's worked so far: more Simon Pegg and Nick Frost; more blood-and-Cornetto Brit-com genre-mockery. Not in a million years would anyone have guessed what his next big project was: an adaptation of an unknown Canadian comic book, inspired by Manga and videogames, about twenty-something year-old geeks struggling with love and life. It was certainly an odd choice, but a damn good one. One thing is certain: Wright has successfully avoided director typecast syndrome.<br/><br/>'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is a love letter to late-20/early-30-year-olds, the generation who grew up with video game arcades, Nintendo and MTV. This is a movie built on retro appeal. Throughout the film, the audience is treated/subjected to a myriad of lovingly- crafted pop-culture references. This is a world where absurdity is something to be proud of, where anything is possible. It is a story about a 20-something year old loser who falls in love with a girl, but has to defeat her 7 evil exes in order to be with her. It sounds like the premise of a video game, and it is no coincidence that the film is structured like one. To call it a 'geek movie' would be an unfair oversimplification.<br/><br/>The film perfectly merges 'reality' with the worlds of videogames and comic books. The visual style is unique: while Zack Snyder's '300' and 'Watchmen' were visually spot-on *translations* of their source comics, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is literally a moving comic book, complete with split frames and spelled-out onomatopoeias. This is geek comedy vs. Street Fighter vs. Adam West-era Batman, a combination that works surprisingly well. Action sequences haven't felt so fresh since 'Kill Bill', Quentin Tarantino's own pop-culture cocktail.<br/><br/>It would be very easy to dismiss this film as gimmicky, but the film doesn't rely on the visual style to hold it up. This is a funny movie, with an endless stream of sharp dialogue delivered by a great cast. Keiran Culkin almost steals the show as Scott's gay roommate. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a layered performance as Scott's love interest, nicely balancing a tough, mysterious side with a sad vulnerability. Michael Cera plays Michael Cera again, but he has expanded his repertoire slightly, convincingly adding depression, anger and optimism to his default awkward insecurity. The editing is particularly impressive, with the occasional sleight of hand demonstrating just how far Wright has come since 'Spaced'.<br/><br/>Weak points? Not many. The film struggles to maintain its momentum, getting a bit repetitive towards the end, but it ends before it outstays its welcome. The music might be a bit hit- and-miss for some. The film's biggest 'flaw' is that it is so very geek-centric. Pop-culture references and quirks are fun and a great source of humour, but only for those who get it. Non-geeks will most likely find this film one-dimensional and repetitive. Still, blaming the film for catering to geeks is like blaming Picasso for catering to Cubists. Bottom line: this is a well-written and stylishly-presented film. Literally POW!-packed and full of win, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' stands to be the most unique film of the decade."
"Stampsfightclub","9","5","16","29 August 2010"," Fantastic unique comic book actioner
","Edgar Wright has been very quiet since hitting the headlines 3 years ago for the outstanding British hit Hot Fuzz and in that time he has managed to conjure one of the most original and exciting comic book adaptations ever.<br/><br/>Considering the recent successes of The Dark Knight, Iron man and Spider-mans amongst others that is rather bold but somehow the director and writer has taken a simple love story and made it thoroughly entertaining, humorous, diverse and tantalizing it is quite necessary to see Michael Cera stars as Scott Pilgrim who falls for Mary Winstead's Ramona Flowers, a frivolous newcomer whom he would like to date. Only he has to defeat her seven evil exes to do so.<br/><br/>What ensues is some of the finest action comedy romantically enhanced comic battles ever to be shown on the big screen. That is to say there are many flashing battle stances with ""vs"" being screened centrally and split screen shots, as if watching a comic book literally come to life.<br/><br/>We are soon in the groove when the Universal logo pops up and then we zoom straight in to the battle of the bands, the life of a love struck teenager and his affection's terrible past. There is a lot going on which boasts the excitement and intrigue to maximum velocity and before you know it the film has ended and you will immediately want more.<br/><br/>The music is a worthy mention as all the way through there are many knockout hits (no pun intended) and one in particular that stands out.<br/><br/>The Clash at Demonhead's rendition of Metric's Black sheep is a fantastic moment for plot and sound and encapsulates the moment significantly.<br/><br/>Regarding the fights there are some great cuts of direction by Wright, brining the action to life. The flying words are terrific and often bizarre. There are moments when you wonder what is going on, particularly the vegan police and the dancing skeletons but regardless the context of the moment is always spot on.<br/><br/>A few minor hiccups include the viewer's emotions when the film draws to a close and the situation fixating on the final evil ex boyfriend.<br/><br/>These are immaterial considering what we have been treated to by surely the best director to come out of Britain since Guy Ritchie."
"aspaceman","10","4","12","27 December 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs. the World
","You know when you go into a film with high expectations, and come out with those expectations passed more than you could ever imagine? Maybe you do, but it's quite possible that you don't. After all, this isn't exactly something that happens often, for anyone. This is especially true when it comes to a film adaption of something you're already a big fan of. These are generally, big, huge, massive, and whatever other synonyms there are for big disappointments for everyone. I didn't expect that Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, the adaption of Bryan Lee O'Malley's popular graphic novel series Scott Pilgrim would be the same; in fact after what I had heard, I was almost certain it was going to be a great film. Maybe not as great as its source material, but I was pretty sure it wasn't going to suck. However, it did more than not suck. It pretty much blew me away.<br/><br/>I watched it with a group of friends, and although only one of these friends was another fan of the comics, the atmosphere of the room as fictional band Sex Bob-omb begin to play and the opening credits began was a great one. Somehow, we all already knew we were in for a great ride. One friend commented ""even this is entertaining"" as the credits played in front of strange and colourful effects, and he was right. We were introduced to Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, and although I was always sceptical of this choice in casting, it wasn't long before I was happy with it. He didn't remind me of the Scott I knew from the comics, and this didn't change as the film continued; however, the Scott that he portrayed was quick to grow on me. It's most likely due to the fact that I already knew of Cera before watching his portrayal of Pilgrim that I saw him the way that I did, but this way that I saw him didn't take anything away from the film. The 'Michael Cera Scott' was funny, endearing, immature - everything that made the original character, he was just a different version of this character. Soon enough this version was making me laugh just as much as the original, and just like with the comics, I actually cared about the fate of this immature, 22 year old Canadian slacker.<br/><br/>Cera was not the only one who gave a good performance here, not by a long shot. All of the funny and likable characters from the comics that were represented were represented well, definitely important in a story far more character than story-driven. Mary Elizabeth Winstead deserves huge props for her performance as Ramona Flowers. Although Ramona was never one of my favourite characters, not only did Winstead almost seem to look just like the original character (not sure how this works with such a cartoony source material, but it does), but this combined with her performance made me feel like I was watching the character I'd come to know in the comics. It was uncanny. Everyone else gave entertaining and funny performances that really brought a smile to my face. In summary: the cast rocked.<br/><br/>What else rocked? The special effects rocked. The fight scenes were exciting, funny (video game and comic references errywhere), and packed with original effects. If they wanted everyone watching to stop caring that none of what was going on on-screen made sense, then they sure did a good job of this with both fun and mesmerising action scenes. Having listened to the soundtrack before seeing the film, I was wondering how they'd incorporate all those songs well, but I didn't really have to worry about that either. They did.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this would have been more or less fun for someone who didn't already know and love the comics, but as a fan, I can safely say the film-makers basically did a perfect job of incorporating both elements from the source material and new material to create a funny and consistently enjoyable experience. The quick cuts where Scott is getting ready to go out and fight the enemy, ending with the tying of his shoelaces, is simply one example of a hilarious element unique to the film, showing the film-maker's abilities to make the most of the film medium. They certainly stay true to the comics, but at the same time the jokes and events unique to the film only add to the experience.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World may not have the superb plot twists of some of my other favourite films such as Fight Club and The Prestige; it may not have the emotional impact of others like American History X and Atonement, however it doesn't have to have these elements. It is like no other film you will ever see, and it's exactly the way it should be, just the way it is. It is for these reasons and all of those listed above that it has become an instant favourite, and one of not many films that I would give a wholehearted 10/10 rating to. If you don't make it a priority to check this out, I personally promise to punch your life. In the face."

"MovieManMenzel","9","7","26","16 August 2010"," ""Scott Pilgrim"" is truly an epic, original, and unique movie experience, in other words, it's a MUST SEE!
","I have been seeing the trailers, television spots, and internet advertisements for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" for several months now and I have to admit they have gotten me super excited for the film. I kind of worried, however, if this film would gain an audience. Sure the concept looked original and unique but Michael Cera, who I particularly like, doesn't seem to have the star power yet to headline a big budget film. This didn't matter to me because I knew I would see the flick right away regardless of how it did. So this past weekend, I grabbed the girlfriend and we ventured into the local theater to see just how epic ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" would truly be.<br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" tells the story of Scott Pilgrim played perfectly by Michael Cera. Scott plays in a rock band and has a high school girlfriend named Knives (Ellen Wong) because he still hasn't gotten over a woman from his past who broke his heart. One day, Scott Pilgrim sees a beautiful woman at a library and lets just say its love at first sight. A few days later, Scott runs into this mystery woman again at a party and learns that her name is Ramona Flowers (the beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and she is from New York. Scott is now determined to win Ramona's heart, which is easier said than done. He soon finds out that the only way to truly win Ramona is to defeat her seven evil exes. A lot of epic awesomeness ensues...<br/><br/>While I have seen some pretty great flicks this year, ""Toy Story 3"" and ""Inception"" probably being the best, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" hits theaters and pretty much finishes out my top three films of the 2010 list. That's right I am actually going to say that ""Scott Pilgrim"" was one of the best films of the year. Why you may ask? Well there are several reasons. The first reason is because it's a fun filled ride. This movie hands down is the most fun I had at a movie in years. The next reason is the way it's shot and the overall look and feel of the film. Like ""Avatar"" it truly was a unique movie experience. The third reason would have to be the fact that the film itself is wildly original and featured a unique story about a clichéd topic. The idea of a guy having to defeat his girlfriend's seven evil exes is original enough but the way Edgar Wright filmed it only makes it more unique and enjoyable.<br/><br/>With that being said, I guess I should talk about Edgar Wright, who to me is a fine director. Sure he isn't that big in the United States with movies like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" being cult classics in the states but he really does know how to direct a good film. I always enjoy how he brings the script to life and in this case, I really like how he brought the comic of ""Scott Pilgrim"" to life. No I never read the comics themselves but heard from fan boys that he literally did a near perfect adaptation of the book to film. I really like the way he shot the film, the weird screen angles, the action sequences, and just about everything was truly unique. It's like the new ""Sin City""/ ""Matrix"" from a visual perspective.<br/><br/>Acting was solid all round. The chemistry between Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Michael Cera was perfect. They both played well with the sweet and touching love story. It felt like a match made in heaven. The supporting performances by Rory Culkin and all of Ramona's evil exes are all note worthy especially Jason Schwartzman, who I always love seeing on the big screen. I really am amazed he isn't a bigger actor at this point. The casting was pretty much dead on with all the characters really playing off one another.<br/><br/>In the end, I really don't have anything negative to say about ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" and that's odd for someone who is usually pretty harsh on films. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is a movie that dares to be different. It's a fun filled ride that never becomes too silly or too serious. It's a truly unique movie-going experience not only because of the way it's shot but because it mixes a whole bunch of genres together including comedy, drama, action, video games, and music. The script is fresh and original. It features some great one liners as well that will be quoted by several fan boys and fan girls in the months ahead. Great one liners that include, ""I am lesbians for you,"" ""Let's both be girls,"" and ""I'm just a little bi-furious!"" Don't know what I am talking about, well than you haven't seen the epic awesomeness that is ""Scott Pilgrim"" and I highly recommend you venture out to your local theater to see it. Its definitely one of the best films of the entire year! <br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" is a solid 9 out of 10. It's a fun filled movie-going experience unlike any other you have seen."

","""Scott, if your life had a face, I would punch it.""<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is easily the most purely and totally entertaining movie that I've seen in ages. It's the epitome of video game culture on film, a great comic book adaptation, and just flat-out fun.<br/><br/>For a movie with so many flourishes, bells, and whistles, the story is quite simple and effective. It's even driven by love, awww. Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year-old video game fan, band member, and a nerdy version of a ladies man. He's also a little immature and selfish, as a lot of people in their early twenties can be. When he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he's instantly and totally smitten. So much so that he forgets his current girlfriend and pursues her with full fervor. And it's fortunate that he's so head over heels, because Ramona has seven evil ex's who are determined that she's either going to be with one of them, or no one at all.<br/><br/>And those conflicts are settled by fighting. Wild, kinetic, inventive fights that can only be summed up as epic. Like the rest of the movie, they're infused with video game culture in a way that's irresistibly appealing to me. This entire movie just feels like it was made for me and people like me, and I love it for that. <br/><br/>My only complaint is that a little under 2 hours in not nearly enough time to flesh out the myriad of cool characters. A lot of the side characters only get the minimum of attention, and that's unfortunate (but understandable). But hey, you're going to want to check out the comic after seeing this anyway, and then you'll get to see all the cool bits and characterization that had to be omitted to ensure a reasonable running time. <br/><br/>Other than wishing it was longer, I had no issues. The movie was consistently hilarious, Cera was a great Scott, Winstead was a great Ramona, the whole cast rocked, the music rocked, the fights rocked, and there was all the style and fun you could ask for. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is the best movie I've seen this year, and Edgar Wright is a genius for pulling this off so well. You may not love it as much as I did if you're not a part of its targeted demographic, but it's such an entertaining movie that anyone with an open mind has a strong chance of at least liking it."

","Maybe, I am getting too old, maybe, this is a part of subculture that I do not grab or embrace, maybe this is that comic book culture that we did not and largely do not have here in Russia, but one thing for sure and this is this: Scott Pilgrim is a really utter rubbish, awful nonsense and a terrible fetid crazy kaleidoscope of whatever which makes you feel tired, dizzy, angry and laughing at the same time. The film presents a very impressive crew of great actors, such Micheal Sere or Kieran Culkin, or a very sweet Mary Elizabeth Winsteadm but what we have is a headache and a very silly mix of all unimaginably poor comics and a very shallow plot that can appeal only to very young, green, immature and silly willy kids who know no life. This is a bright wrapping with no real candy underneath, nay, it is empty and vapid inside. Scott Pilgrim fails to entertain, to deliver message, to excite or thrill. Insread, we witness a bad, poor, shallow, mediocre broth with no meat, only thin layer of some fat on top. Poor and miserable"

","Every once in a great while, there comes a movie that makes you so thankful that you saw it in the theaters. Midst ""Inception"" and ""Kick-Ass"", ""Scott Pilgrim"" easily falls into this category for 2010.<br/><br/>I will admit. The movie has maybe one or two slight problems with it....in fact....they are so small, and somewhat meaningless, that they don't take anything away from the film at all. But even if you decided to dwell on these small imperfections, you must also admit that the movie is such a mental and visual feast. There are so many working parts to this picture, the cinematography, the editing, the soundtrack, and each of them is well oiled and moving at full speed.<br/><br/>Me being a prime candidate of the ""Y"" generation, i cannot remember the last time a movie made me recall my childhood on countless occasions. Mainly due to the never ending references and musical scores to classic NES and SEGA games dubbed in the background. It was enough to give me goosebumps.<br/><br/>Very seldom do i walk out of theater feeling more than satisfied. But that was just the start. The movie is like an addicting drug.

","By far my favourite movie ever. This particular movie did not get the best reviews by movie critics, but recently I have found that a good 50% of movies that critics rave about tend to be just awful while movies they claim are terrible are actually good.<br/><br/>Who should and should not see this movie? This movie is NOT for people who: do not like videogames, do not like dry or slap-stick humor, hate slightly sexual scenes, only find bathroom humor funny, and/or people who hate anything even slightly romantic.<br/><br/>This movie IS for: anyone who has ever played videogames and liked them, anyone who likes funny/silly movies, anyone who likes fight scenes, and anyone who enjoys a little romance in their movies.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with video game references. If you are a video game nerd (like me), you will love it. Zelda music is used quite a bit, as well as many other well-known music in the gaming world like Mario and Final Fantasy. A lot of video game themes are also used, for instance there is a part in the movie where one of the characters says to Scott, ""Where are you going?"" and Scott, after looking up to see a 2D cartoon-version of his face revolving in the air next to him, snatches it (the cartoon face disappears to be replaced by word ""1-UP"") and responds, ""To get a life."" Things like this are all throughout the movie and you will find yourself thoroughly enjoying their incorporation. This movie is also full of fight scenes, which are done in a very Street Fighter/Mortal Kombat fashion.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie was done extremely well. I can find no fault with it. It is just a wonderful movie. If you haven't seen it and you fit under the ""This movie IS for"" description above, go see it. You will not be disappointed."
"Quebec_Dragon","9","5","17","3 September 2010"," Fresh, hyper-kinetic and just plain fun
","I don't think a movie's quality should be correlated to box office success so I don't care one bit if Scott Pilgrim was a commercial failure. It's still a bold, inventive and very fun film to watch. I'm probably part of the target audience for Scott Pilgrim : male video gamer, geek and in his thirties. That being said, I don't think Scott Pilgrim will appeal only to us. Younger people and especially women will likely love it. Witness the characters who are in their late teens/early twenties yet are much too young to have known the old 8-bit games from the Nintendo Entertainment System era in their heyday (mid-1980s). It bugged me a little, but it's a very minor point. Most of the characters are also cool geeks and far from stereotypical nerds : they're part of indie rock bands or fans, not wearing glasses, more charmingly witty than socially awkward, and more often that not, amazing fighters.<br/><br/>This film is a very unconventional action/romance/comedy with strong pop culture sensibilities (video games, comics and mangas mostly). I don't think I've ever experienced something quite like this in cinema, so weirdly it gets major points for originality despite being riddled with references. I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish. It was a blast to watch and listen to. Visually, it's extremely fresh and dynamic with most sound effects being written on-screen like on a comics page. It might seem annoying, but it worked very well. It has lots of quick cuts (some of the funnier bits coming from stuff appearing out of the blue after a cut) yet everything is easily followable. The fights in particular were very very cool, exciting and spectacular (for geeks : more graceful like Soul Calibur 3 than static like Mortal Kombat). A big part of the humor comes from the one-liners and friendly (or not) banter. It succeeds in doing something very difficult : using intentionally corny lines, bad puns and, by delivery and context, making them sound witty or funny instead of dumb and trite.<br/><br/>I think it's my favorite role by Michael Cera, who inhabits that kind of nice, witty, slightly awkward, geek-chic role better than most. But I think the secondary characters are wonderful too and sometimes even steal the show. I loved most of them, especially the very likable and enthusiastic 17-year old Asian girlfriend (so likable you feel sorry and/or root for her) and the wise and promiscuous gay roommate. The main love interest and object of Pilgrim's quest is suitably enigmatic and fascinating. It shows she has baggage and is rather melancholy (almost never smiling). In a brilliant bit of casting, you also get the guys playing Superman (Brandon Routh) and the Human Torch/future Captain America (Chris Evans) as evil ex-boyfriends. I don't know if it's just me but I noticed that eyes in Pilgrim seemed bigger than normal, almost like manga eyes. Kudos to makeup (or special effects ?) for that. The flashbacks with actual drawings from the Scott Pilgrim comics I didn't like as much. They seemed a little out of place, a bit jarring. Scott Pilgrim was a success at entertaining and surprising me constantly. The action was better than expected, the humor was funny, the characters were a joy, the visuals were astounding and the writing was smart. The romantic aspects could have been a bit better, more touching, but were still quite enjoyable. All the geek references were icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Rating : 8.5 out of 10 (remarkable)"

Throw in some slacker friends, a gay housemate, a couple of previous girlfriends, plenty of computer game references and you have a very entertaining film. There are some really funny moments in this, it's really rare to find a film that makes me laugh out loud, but I did a lot throughout. It's also very clever story telling and adding to this are many more slightly less but still funny moments as well as an array of special effects which provide some great visual moments. Clever editing and quick cuts are used to move the story from place to place, effects are used to provide hints of the films comic book basis, but it never goes overboard or becomes repetitive.<br/><br/>There is a great support cast, including a very funny Chris Evans, but Kieran Culkin as the housemate and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau also provides some laughs. Michael Cera is a real standout here. He is a very funny actor, though many of his post Arrested Development roles have been, well his Arrested Development role. Here though, whilst he never quite breaks the mold fully, he is less Michael Cera. His timing and delivery of lines is perfect throughout.<br/><br/>My main qualm with the film is that it struggles with the story telling time frame. It starts quite slowly and the first few battles happen progressively, but suddenly the rest of the battles are grouped up together which then leads to an overly long finale.<br/><br/>However, these issues shouldn't be enough to put anyone off seeing this. It's a funny, visually great romp and you don't need to be a computer/comic book/superhero nerd to enjoy it.<br/><br/>More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com"
"sickeningjar","9","5","17","30 August 2010"," Just one word for you... Epic.
","Having never been aware of the Scott Pilgrim comic, I went into this film with no particular expectations. I was aware, from the trailers, that this was to be no ordinary teen rom-com.<br/><br/>And boy, was I swept away by what I discovered. For anybody who ever fantasised a life in a video game, or imagined their own mundane life retold in a comic book, then this is pure fantasy. Scott Pilgrim, the man, is a 22 year old slacker and bass player in ""Sex Bob-Omb"". He fall for Ramona Flowers, new girl in town and Amazon delivery girl, who appears in dreams as a result of using subspace highways through his brain... sorry, what? Yeah, you heard me. And if that's not weird enough for you - and certainly something you wouldn't see in Dawson's Creek - then how about Ramona's League of Evil Exes, whom our hero has to defeat before he can win her affections?<br/><br/>This film is a mix of genres, so really only Edgar Wright was the man to direct, and he does it brilliantly, injecting all the visual flair he demonstrated in Spaced over a decade ago, to bring Scott and his world to life, in a dazzling array of breathtaking fights, special effects and razor sharp wit.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, it's pure fantasy, so any notion you may have of keeping it real, you may want to leave outside the theatre, because you won't need it here. The fights - and there are plenty - are the stuff of pure fanboy dreams. Girls fighting with ENORMOUS hammers, 64 hit combos in mid-air, or flaming swords coming from nowhere, all brought to the screen with frenetic editing and the best soundtrack heard all year; all the while punctuated with visual and audio references to video games, which ties a bow on this marvel of a film.<br/><br/>The characters are superbly horrible to each other, the story is insane but always strangely familiar, and the action is incredible. <br/><br/>And there are so many ""WTF"" moments in this film.<br/><br/>In a word - Epic."
"crazydom","9","7","27","14 August 2010"," Edgar Wright does what most thought unthinkable
","When you read the Scott Pilgrim comics, it's not something that easily lends itself to the big screen. It's an eye-popping comic rife with idiosyncrasies that seem impossible at first glance to pull off in a movie. I'm happy to report that Edgar Wright did it. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a special effects tour-de-force full of all the charm that the comic books had in spades.<br/><br/>The movie begins as most know with Scott Pilgrim meeting the girl of his dreams(literally) Ramona V. Flowers. Scott eventually wins her over and the two begin to date. There are only two problems. One, Scott is still in a relationship with a 17 year-old Chinese school girl named Knives Chau. Two, he has to fight and defeat Ramona's seven evil exes in order to date her.<br/><br/>The fights with the evil exes are all mind-blowing sequences. The intensity and energy in these fights is kicked into overdrive. The fights are all absurd as you would expect but in such a way you can't help but love them.<br/><br/>Wright not only knows the source material well but he also revels in the culture of Scott Pilgrim. The movie is full of references to various video games like Tekken, Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Pac-Man. The entire underlying storyline between Knives and Scott is itself a parody of your average harem anime. There's even a hilarious spoof of Seinfeld at one point.<br/><br/>The only problem with the movie is that it feels rushed towards the end. The movie has a brisk pace throughout but near the end you can tell that Wright is sort of rushing towards the conclusion. It's understandable that not every part of the comic books can be included in a two hour movie. It is disappointing though how two of the evil ex battles turn into what are virtually afterthoughts.<br/><br/>One thing that must be mentioned about the movie is how amazing the cast is. All of them work and don't feel forced or out of place at all. Much hoopla was made about casting Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim but he does a great job. Cera is not playing Cera in this movie, he really is playing Scott Pilgrim. Special mention must be given to Kieran Culkin and Ellen Wong. Culkin steals almost every scene he's in as Scott's gay roommate and best friend, Wallace Wells. And then we come to Ellen Wong who is simply mind blowing as Knives. I've always felt that a character like Knives can never be translated into live action. It's incredibly hard to portray the naiveté and enthusiasm that Knives has without it seeming forced or awkward when done by an actual actress. Wong pulls off both. She plays Knives in a way that will make you view her as an anime character brought to life.<br/><br/>Is Scott Pilgrim a perfect film? No, it most certainly has it's flaws. It is however one of the most inventive, visually appealing, and unique films you'll see this year or any other. There is no other film that Scott Pilgrim can be compared to. It proudly stands out as a new experience whether the viewer ends up liking it or not. In an age where retread after retread is filling the theaters that is something to be commended."

","So I've been a fan of Edgar Wright since his first film Shaun Of The Dead. It's one of the funniest films I've ever seen and it's one of my favorite films of all time. I always love watching this movie.<br/><br/>Hot Fuzz came out in 2007 and for some reason despite how much I loved Shaun Of The Dead I never saw either in theaters. I saw a huge poster for Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World a couple weeks ago after coming out of seeing Inception. I personally like Michael Cera and decided to look at it for a sec. I noticed that Edgar Wright's name was in the ""Directed By"" spot and that was that. I was seeing this film day one if I could. Well I just got back from a midnight showing. How's that for not missing out?<br/><br/>I saw a trailer for this the first time this afternoon oddly enough (August 12). The trailer looked awesome and I HAD to see it tonight. <br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is the ultimate boss of all nerd movies. There is no beating this one. Edgar Wright once again brought fantastic comedy writing to his newest film that his first two had. If you didn't like the comedy of those films, you probably won't here either. But then again you're an idiot go watch Epic Movie.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is about the titular character finding a complete hottie named Ramona Flowers played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead. He wants her and goes for it. Unfortunately for him she has 7 evil ex's who are in an Evil Ex's League. Scott has to fight and defeat them all if he wants to win and keep the heart of his lovely Ramona.<br/><br/>This film is insane. The nerdgasms come at you along with the laughs one after another. There's no stopping them. If you have played videos games or have any type of understanding of them in almost any form, then this movie shouldn't be too hard to follow. Characters fight in crazy game like fashion and get points and level up throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Cera is usually known as ""that awkward kid"" in pretty much everything he's in. That's still here in the beginning however once he finds his purpose as the film goes on that really fades away. The action scenes always show Pilgrim VS someone else in typical fighting game fashion. There's Zelda music played throughout people have hearts and lifebars and seeing as how this film originated from a comic there are a lot of sound effects shown on screen similarly to how they used to do on the old Batman show...but not lame.<br/><br/>This movie is wonderful. Everyone gives a terrific performance and all the villains Pilgrim has to face give over the top awesomeness every second they're in the film. This movie is joy from beginning to end and really entertains front to back.<br/><br/>SUCK ON THAT MICHAEL BAY.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World gets **** stars out of four. Exactly what it deserves. You won't learn anything after watching this, but you'll still love yourself for it either way. I will say that after seeing this, while walking back to my car I realized this film is a reminder as to why I want to even direct movies in the first place. GO SEE IT NOW."
"wliia","9","7","27","13 August 2010"," An outstanding piece of work
","Edgar Wright is without a doubt one of the most creative directors working today. Having already done Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, he proves that he's still got the touch with Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, an adaptation of the graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley. In this film, Scott (Michael Cera) has found the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But unfortunately for him, in order for Scott to date Ramona, he must defeat seven of her evil ex-boyfriends who want him dead.<br/><br/>This film is a visual feast. Filled with awesome gags and video game music cues, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one outstanding piece of work, and that's saying something. The cast was awesome. Special props to Kieran Culkin who stole the scenes as Wallace Wells. He was hilarious. I never thought a film like this would make me smile, but it did, and I loved it. Highly recommended!"
"FilmCynics","9","4","13","12 November 2010"," A veritable zeitgeist of pop-cultures mashing up against each other.
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a veritable zeitgeist of pop-cultures mashing up against each other to deliver a romance unlike anything we'll likely see for the next decade.<br/><br/>A great comic book is made up of a delicate blend of artwork and storyline that leaps off the page. With comic books adapted for the screen already having made said leap, they must do more than simply use the source material as a storyboard – a vibe must be captured, some kind of sync between the creator and the director must be demonstrated, an evocation of nostalgia for the reader of the comic must be stirred and ideally, those not familiar with the material will be swept away onto the bandwagon. Edgar Wright manages to hit all of the above-mentioned notes to create a Torontonian experience unlike any other, blending elements of comic books, video games, indie music, and most importantly, movies.<br/><br/>Chances are, you've met a guy kind of like Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera); a likable slacker who is lucky and clumsy with the ladies, and plays bass in a mediocre indie band. Scott is taking some time off from serious relationships by spending his time with a high school girl 6 years his junior when he meets the girl of his dreams, literally. Ramona Flowers (the completely unrecognizable Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a roller blading courier for Amazon.ca, recently transplanted from the United States, has been taking a subspace shortcut through Scott's subconscious. When he finally meets her face to face, he is instantly smitten, and Ramona soon warms to his less awkward than usual Michael Cera-esquire charms. There's only one problem, Ramona's got some skeletons in her closet. Skeletons covered in muscles, flesh and clothing with crouching tiger kung fu skills in the form of Ramona's ex-boyfriends (and girlfriend, rrrrraow!). Turns out that if Scott wants to be with Ramona, he'll have to defeat the League of Evil Exesand maybe even clean up some of his own messes while he's at it. Fortunately, Scott is the number one rated fighter in all of Ontario, so he can handle them. (It might not say so in the movie, but trust me, it's in the books.) (Besides, the fights are just allegorical for the personal issues Scott and Ramona have to lay to rest before they can get together, so why does it matter whether this 98 pound weakling can nail a 64 hit mid-air combo?) The first thing you'll notice about this movie is the pre-credit Universal logo, rendered in glorious 8-bit like a Donkey King table top at your favourite seedy tavern. And with that, the tone is set for the next two hours. Just about everything hat unfolds on screen, from the bathroom breaks to the high scores in the aftermath of each skirmish is coloured with the same playful Nintendo brush. Edgar Wright, the mad scientist behind such genre benders/blenders as Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead has proved himself to be positively soaked in the language of cinema. And I don't mean the techniques of Orson Welles or Jean-Luc Godard, I mean every pop-culture gem of the last 20 or even 30 years. He understands exactly how we glean information off the silver screen and he's devised his own cinematic shorthand to deliver that information faster and funnier than anyone else. It's the kind of style that comes in handy adapting a book that tends to express itself in images in feelings more than thoughts and words.<br/><br/>What is at the heart of its triumph, besides its innate sense of fun, is the tension/conflict/torsion between Toronto's reality in which it is so cozily nested with locations like Lee's Palace, Casa Loma and Pizza Pizza, and the fighting flights of fancy as Scott engages in fisticuffs that are one half Street Fighter 2 and one half Dance Dance Revolution. The mundane and the magical collide with each other to a deftly handled soundtrack as only a music lover like Wright could deliver.<br/><br/>With all of this bombast going on, it's easy to forget that this really is a love story. And that is perhaps where I find this movie's only shortcoming. Even if it's Wright's scrambled take on the ""boy meets girl"" story, there needed to be a tender heart to this take, and that is what Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is lacking. Everything is just too neon & plastic – and perhaps that's the point. Perhaps Wright was trying to make a statement of the transitory nature of young modern love or perhaps Wright's directed a little too much bromance and not enough romance."
"Samiam3","7","4","13","11 November 2010"," Fiery show, a bit thin in plot, but enjoyable nonetheless
","The sheer exuberance of Scott Pilgrim Vs the World takes about twenty minutes to get used to, but afterward, it's fun....not quite great, but fun (no question)<br/><br/>This is a motion picture that relies almost entirely on the integrity of the post-production departments (Editing, sound, special FX). With all the fast cuts, split-screens, animated sound waves/valentines/lighting fight captions in a dozen fonts, and more Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a feast for the eyes and ears. It expresses a love for Music, Video Games and comic books alike. It is a spectacle that almost overwhelms story, which one could argue is the films Achilles heel. The plot line is a bit too satirical for it's own good. Most of it is played for laughs but when it does try to be serious, it feels like a derivative, half-fleshed teen romance (guy gets girl, looses girl, gets her back)<br/><br/>Being Toronto-born and bred, I had the pleasure of witnessing the crew shoot on four separate occasions. Not many movies are set in Toronto, but Scott Pilgrim is proud to do so, and is even written into the script. I wont argue that the movie sells the city in its full beauty, but it is funny to see a hundred million dollar motion picture working out of the library when you went as a kid. <br/><br/>times change fast, but maybe not as fast as the rhythm of Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. I'm not sure how the comic book lovers feel about the movie. I liked for what it is. Can't say I loved it but it is fresh and riveting."

","This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. The fast paced direction and witty one- liners make this an actual comic book movie, not just a movie based on a comic book. The second the movie starts, the viewer is bombarded with crazy sights and sounds. Video game- like music and hilarious banter between establishes what kind of movie this is. As the story develops, it gets more unpredictable and hilarious. Every single performance is perfect and hilarious, from Michael Cera as Scott to Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate. The only problem with the movie is that it has a fairly specific target audience, and I can definitely see people outside that demographic finding this movie. Go see it if you're below the age of 30, enjoy video game references, don't mind ADDish editing, and enjoy indie rock music. If fit in the target demographic, you probably won't be able to describe how awesome it is."

"DavidYZ","2","3","9","30 April 2017"," Ridiculous
","This comedy film is silly and ridiculous rather than funny. <br/><br/>The only character in the film who is likable is pretty girl Knives, whom the protagonist Scott dumps. How can the audience root for Scott, when he's not likable - and he rejects the film's only likable character? It's ludicrous that hot girl Ramona wants a dorky, skinny lad.<br/><br/>The story involves Scott having to physically fight off Ramona's seven evil exes. That's a ridiculous plot, because dating a single girl doesn't involve having to fight off her exes. <br/><br/>The fight scenes look like video game footage and are bizarrely out of place in a feature film."

"dylanthechameleon","10","3","9","12 August 2011"," One my all time favorites
","I loved this movie! It's original, hilarious, and I love Michael Cera to death. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was going to be just another quirky romance flick, but it proved to be so much more. The originality was stunning! It's not your average everyday movie where you can tell what's going to happen right off the bat. Cera's character faces challenges and personal demons just like you would in real life. Which brings me to my next point, the characters. All of them are far from cardboard cut-outs like you tend to see nowadays. The main character is perfect and has absolutely no flaws or debts. Scott is sort of dim-witted and frozen in time after his girlfriend dumps him, and ends up living across the street from the house he grew up in. Sad, right? It's those pathetic aspects of him that makes him into this believable, honest, even lovable character. SP vs. TW is a must-see."
"System72","10","3","9","7 August 2011"," High Score. (Yeah, I had to)
","I don't even know where to begin raving about this movie. Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is one of the best movies of 2010. Here's why.<br/><br/>I went into this movie knowing nothing about it except from seeing trailers and short clips. I hadn't read the comics or anything. Needless to say, I've now gone and read through them and while some people say that this movie doesn't hold a candle to the comics, I'm going to have to disagree. Unlike the Harry Potter films which are more of a companion to the novels than stand-alone films, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World can be viewed with no prior knowledge and still be enjoyed immensely. While certain plot points are skimmed over or cut completely, it doesn't detract from the final product.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a love story. With fights. Edgar Wright described it as a musical, but instead of breaking into song, the characters break into fights. That's a pretty good description in my opinion. To be with the girl of his dreams, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) must fight - no, defeat - Ramona Flowers' (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) 7 evil exes. What follows is a film filled with life and energy and brilliance.<br/><br/>I'm a huge Edgar Wright fan, he's one of my favourite directors (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz). The cinematography in Scott Pilgrim Vs The World is so well done that you'll come out of the cinema buzzing. The editing of shots seamlessly really puts you in the zone. Even the rapid fight scenes that have new shots every few seconds never make you feel disoriented like in movies such as Transformers, where it's just 5 minutes of robots fighting each other in a blurry mess of steel.<br/><br/>Maybe for a viewer who isn't 17 like me, the bright colours and video games references might not do much for them, but for someone who has grown up with video games and comic books, this movie was so good. And it wasn't just cheap shots either. There was no ""Oh look! Now we're putting in a sound clip from Zelda. Intertextuality for the win!"" No. It was done so subtly and reflected the film, the dream sequence particularly standing out for me, but I won't say any more for those who haven't seen it. The start of each fight with the 'VS' in between the characters and all the tiniest sound effects was enough to make this another great piece by Edgar Wright. The sheer number of The Legend of Zelda references alone was enough to win me over.<br/><br/>I want to talk briefly about the soundtrack and score. The soundtrack is filled with some great songs that really fit the feel of the movie - the pure acoustic guitar and the 8 bit elements are pure brilliance. This is also reflected in the score, a more dramatic set of music but still retaining the retro video game feel that really pushes this film along.<br/><br/>Michael Cera, who doesn't seem to age at all, gets a refreshing new role as Scott Pilgrim, and for once doesn't get to be 'that awkward guy' but rather 'that jerk who fights everyone for one girl'. He still retains his Cera-esque charm in the movie but it's great to see him become a bit of a badass. His supporting cast is fantastic as well, special credit goes to Kieran Culkin, Allison Pill and Chris Evans. Those three to me were absolutely hilarious, their comedic timing perfect. In fact, the whole cast does a flawless job of creating a great character list who connect with each other without stilted dialogue or awkward phrasing.<br/><br/>This film is so energetic and fun and re-watchable. From every crunch of a fist against a skull to every perfectly delivered punchline, it remains one of the best films of 2010 that should really have done better at the box office considering the reception it's received.<br/><br/>10/10"

The only downsides are the few parts that were in the comic book but not in the movie, like Ramona's cat Gideon. I'll give Wright credit for the ending where Scott gets an extra life and defeats Gideon, because the last comic came out after the movie. I love the special effects also!

","This movie really is the movie of the century, and I knew it the second the movie started with the epic 8-bit universal studios logo.<br/><br/>So Scott Pilgrim, a bassist in a ""terrible"" band, literally meets the girl of his dreams and instantly gets with her. But in order to stay with her, he must defeat her seven evil exes, who are part of what could be the most diverse love life one person has ever had. That's the basic plot line of the story, but there's all these other factors that slowly fit into the spaces and tie together to become an amazing movie, such as the band's adventures, Scott's own love life, his homosexual roommate's love life, etc.<br/><br/>Now, I was intensely surprised to find out that some people didn't enjoy and even HATED the movie, which was beyond me, but I guess everyone's entitled to their opinion. But (note that I am in high school at the moment) every single person that wasn't absolutely in love with the movie were the petty jocks that only cared about their varsity spots in football and cross-country. Every single one of them (nothing against that, I'm in several sports myself). I would ask people if they had seen this amazing masterpiece and they would respond with ""oh no, I heard it was dumb from my friend."" Which wasn't cool.<br/><br/>But this isn't about the haters. This is about the movie.<br/><br/>So, some people will read this and say ""oh you only like it because it has comics and video games and fight scenes and stuff. your just like every other high schooler out there"" but that's obviously not it. The movie mixes comedic phrases in practically every other line. Seriously, every other line you hear in this movie can go down in the ""Quotes"" section. And on top of that, the intense songs in the movie are EXCELLENT. I love how they make the bass such an important part in every song. I could literally go on and on about this movie to the point (and it probably already has for some of you) where it would be annoying. It's just a great movie that has everything that anyone could ask out of an action-comedy. 10/10"

I don't know that I have ever seen anything like it, and doubt we will see anything like it again soon. Unfortunately it didn't do well at the box office, but it is a masterpiece in all respects and sure to be a cult classic."
"yonasmic","10","6","24","15 August 2010"," Scott Pilgrim is the BEST blend of Comedy and Action in years!
","So, before seeing the film, I was in no way a fan. I hadn't read any of the books. I'm the farthest thing from a hipster. All I knew was that Edgar Wright directed it and the trailer looked pretty neat. But, after actually watching the film.<br/><br/>IT'S FRAKKIN AMAZING BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR FOR THE LOVE OF KNIVES CHAU!!<br/><br/>Okay, fan girl moment over. In all seriousness, Scott Pilgrim was a brilliant film that probably won't receive all of the attention or accolades it deserves. Not in years has a film been able to nail both hilarious, sharp dialogue and meticulous action sequences dead-on. First of all, the movie was hilarious. The lines were sardonic and tongue-in- cheek, and very much aimed for our generation.<br/><br/>Secondly, the director Edgar Wright probably went about adapting the comic/ graphic novel to film in the best way a director has ever adapted a comic to film - by having it play like a comic within the realm of live-action film. It was probably my favorite element of the film. At times, the scenes played out like panels on a page, with the zany transitions and narrative headings. Even the fight sequences - which were epic but still hilarious in their own right - maintained this video game feel, with use of the ""K.O."" and ""1-UP"" terminology. I'm not a big video game fan, but I really appreciated that approach.<br/><br/>And, lastly, the characters supporting Scott Pilgrim were so dynamic and lovable. Two words: KNIVES CHAU. The funniest little Asian high school girl ever. ""You knocked the highlights out of her hair!!"" Kieran Culkin's Wallace was also notably hilarious and I loved Brie Larson's Envy as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Inception was cool and super deep and all, but Scott Pilgrim is the most all-around entertaining film of the year. I know it's still only August, but no film has come anywhere near this one yet."
"Chris Knipp","7","6","24","14 August 2010"," Supernerd strikes again
","The premise is this: Scott is a 22-year-old bass player in a terrible Toronto band. He falls for a ""dangerously fashionable, roller blading delivery girl"" with punk hair called Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an American transplant who ""starts cruising through his dreams and sailing by him at parties."" He's smitten. His cheery band-groupie high school girlfriend (""and she's Chinese"") Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) becomes irrelevant. The cool Ramona likes Scott too. But it turns out he must fight off Ramona's seven ""evil exes."" This iron-clad, if inexplicable, rule is going to shape all the reels to come.<br/><br/>The dialogue is witty and smart, especially at first. A lot of cartoonish, video game captions in the air (""Pow,"" ""thunk,"" etc.) and other devices like scores and labels for new characters increase the feeling that this is a lively and quick-witted movie for and about the video game, texting, Facebook generation. Scott's intro line with Ramona is a silly factoid about the origins of the name Pac-Man, a bit of gaucherie he later denies. Cera has cool, quick delivery and good timing, which also help. So does the presence of Kieran Culkin (also a child star, from a child star family) as Scott's sarky, more mature gay roommate Wallace.<br/><br/>Kieran Culkin is aging convincingly. But Cera, what of him? The androgynous, squeaky-voiced Canadian has been acting since he was eleven: he's a pro. Paradoxically, he projects his insecure young men roles with utter ease and confidence: there's got to be an element of the passive-aggressive in this whole nerd-superman concept. Though Cera's character is 22, and seems to have had a string of girlfriends, it's logical that Scott's dating a high school girl. Cera seemed fresh and charming in his first big roles. He can project a wistful, romantic quality that came through nicely in 'Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.' Now he seems to be playing roles tailored exclusively for him, like 'Youth in Revolt,<br/><br/>based on a not-very-profound series of young adult novels (contrast the tougher, more honest writing of S.E. Hinton that produced a quartet of classic Eighties youth pictures). Youth in Revolt wound up rather limp as a movie -- and began to show Cera's lack of range, which is not disguised by the massive use of loud fast CGI for his duels with ex-boyfriends of his girlfriend here.<br/><br/>Actually in 'Scott Pilgrim' Ramona is the character who seems most real. Winstead's speech sounds more sincere and less arch than anybody else's. Her character perhaps is so cool she need not put spin on her words.<br/><br/>""They make movies in Toronto?"" So goes one of many cute throwaway lines in a movie that before it's burned up its cred brings many smiles, and plenty of full-on laughs too.<br/><br/>But then 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's' fortunes go south. Strangely, this little indie comedy turns into a noisy CGI-ridden feast of pointless violence that makes you want to hold your ears and look at your watch. Why does this happen? One reason is that Edgar Wright, the director, hitherto renowned for the already classic zombie comedy 'Shaun of the Dead' and the charming, energetic cop comedy 'Hot Fuzz,' is English. Both films are deeply rooted in Englishness. If Toronto has a native spirit, Wright isn't tuned in to it. 'Scott Pilgrim' tries to be about so many things and the fault is in the writing. Why should Scott have to battle all these exes to begin with?<br/><br/>Scott's forced battles become repetitious. The theme of repetition itself is forced on us. Not only is one of the exes actually twins. Scott himself is doubled at one point, and a movie star ex (occasion for that Toronto joke) turns out to have half a dozen stunt doubles who fight for him while he goes out for coffee. The climactic scene where Scott confronts rock impresario ex Brendan, played by Jason Schwartzman, another actor not aging well, seems heavy-handed. It's run twice, once with Scott's fighting strength empowered by love, the second by his need for self-respect. It's frankly hard to see much difference between these two versions. You may just wanted it to end. But it has to end twice, and the closing credits are very drab.<br/><br/>The fight sequences have flashy moments and it's droll to have an androgynous nerd battling Superman (Brandon Routh) and, as the movie star, a champion skateboarder (Lucas Lee). Music for Scott's band, Sex-Bob-Omb, was written by Beck. A lot is going on, and many of the invasive visual tricks work because they speed up the action (all very youth-ADD-text messaging friendly). Nothing here is for slow people. If anything the trouble is not that Wright is a slouch, for he is anything but. It's that he tries too hard. That was true to some extent in 'Hot Fuzz.' And most of the characters introduced at the beginning who contributed to the feeling of being in a real place are thrown away, ceasing to matter, except for brief visual recognition, toward the end.<br/><br/>At moments the wintry exteriors of Scott Pilgrim's Toronto and his too-cool, geeky, slightly depressed young friends will bring to mind Terry Zwigoff's 2001 'Ghost World,' also made from a graphic novel, also populated by slackers. Probably 'Scott Pilgrim' could have got by with a measure of its Pow! and Thunk! labels and cyber-world air battles, and still created something of the atmosphere and feel of real young lives as 'Ghost World' quite hauntingly does. But that didn't happen, and all I got was a metaphorical lousy T shirt saying I've seen another Michael Cera movie."

","I don't know the comic books, so I'm writing only about the film. In most cases, titles such as this should be viewed with more understanding of the source material in order to not only to assess the story as it is, but also take into consideration the transition from one medium to the other. But when you are not aware of the source material, the only thing you are left with is film, its story, its characters, etc. And these, should at least provide you with some kind of entertainment.<br/><br/>So I came unprepared, anticipating a light-hearted high-school comedy about relationships but instead got an emotionally empty story about adolescent heartbreak, but without a heart of its own. I'm sorry to admit this but I didn't find one likable character in this movie. <br/><br/>The protagonist is a funny guy that plays bass in a band and doesn't give a damn about other people's feelings. He finds himself a younger girlfriend just to fill the void that his previous partner left behind her, but dumps her at the first sight of someone more interesting than her. Said girlfriend – Knives – is a walking Chinese stereotype that constantly delivers cringeworthy lines and in the end – (spoilers!) – agrees to let Scott go so that he can follow his dream girlfriend. How generous! How believable! The aforementioned femme fatale is a cold and empty plot device, emotionally undeveloped, and because of being so transparent, completely out of place as the protagonist's love interest. The band is non-existent. <br/><br/>And there come the exes. Don't get me wrong, I totally buy the crazy video game fighting, but these scenes could be so much better if they were at least imaginative. If we take away the life bars and coins popping out of defeated enemies we are left with uninspired fight sequences – the ones you have already seen a thousand times.<br/><br/>But the unlikeable cardboard characters and their improbable emotional behavior isn't the biggest sin of ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"". For me the only thing that, despite its numerous flaws, could put the film back on track, but ultimately puts it to the very bottom of my deepest ""Never Watch That Again"" drawer is the humor, or lack thereof. There are many films that are lifted from the ashes by merely a couple of hilarious lines or an energetic acting of just one of the characters. Just like with books, a good writing can carry a weak plot, never the other way around. This movie falls flat not because it depicts emotions in an unbelievable way, but because it fails to evoke any emotions. Maybe in the beginning you will hear some lines that sound fresh and maybe you will find the numerous references to popular culture enjoyable, but as soon as you get used to the film's peculiar editing, it will instantly lose momentum. <br/><br/>In conclusion: if you are already past your adolescence and have a basic understanding of how human emotions work, do yourself a favor and skip it. Or play a video game and then watch Juno/500 Days of Summer/Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind instead."
"cnycitylady","10","2","5","1 January 2013"," A new refreshing style of movie
","Scott Pilgrim vs the World is based on the comic series ""Scott Pilgrim."" And although the movie uses one of the comic sub-titles (vs. the world) and all of the character names, it does not use the original storyline. They condense the whole comic, which takes place throughout a year into a week and a half. Now knowing that you may expect the movie to lack in all of the vitals and signature ""Scott Pilgrim-Esq"", but it somehow keeps it together in a way that lets you enjoy everything you love about Scott Pilgrim in a two hour movie.<br/><br/>The characters are brought to life with the best casting of the year as Michael Cera (everyone's favorite underdog) takes the role of Scott, the hero who has to fight for the woman he wants. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (seemingly an odd choice, but who delivers wonderfully) fulfills the character of Ramona, the sensual girl who brings trouble for her new boyfriend and Ellen Wong, who breathes life into Knives Chau, the jaded ex girlfriend who will have her revenge. All of the Exes and enemies and friends are also perfectly casted and portrayed by the all star character actors such as Allison Pill, (The drummer of the Sex Bob-oms and ex girlfriend to Scott) Chris Evans, (Ramona's second Evil Ex boyfriend turned famous actor) Anna Kendrick, (Scott's somewhat annoying little sister) Brie Larson (Scott's big ex ""Envy"" who ruined his life) and others. The songs and tunes that the bands play are very hipster but not so annoyingly. One or two might even catch your fancy. The movie has excellent flow and despite the one week time-line doesn't feel rushed. Between each evil ex fight you get adequate storyline and character development. <br/><br/>The movie also keeps true to all of the video game moments and quirks. It masterfully utilizes the ""K.O."" sounds, arcade punch sounds and the Seinfeld entrance noises. The acting and writing is also superb. The lines will have you laughing, and leave you thinking. The abnormal way of this ""Video game life"" that these characters live is startlingly similar to the lives we live everyday, and the language they use is true to the young man's language of today. The actors all also have excellent comedic timing, something essential to this type of movie. Each eye roll, glance, and fidget is perfectly placed and helps with the uniqueness of the movie and all of its characters. Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is a new brand of movie that will leave you satisfied the rest of the day, and wishing your life was a video game."
"Vartiainen","Null","2","5","5 December 2012"," Horrible morals, cool execution
","I recognize and admit that this is a good film, arguably even a great one. It has a very unique sense of humour, a visual style that's one of the few I've seen that manages to capture the essence of comic books and a character cast that's certainly memorable if not identifiable. That being said, I still loath this film. I do not like it. However, I have given it seven out of ten, because I can admit that the reason I don't like this film has nothing to do with its quality. Rather I hate its roster of characters, especially the main cast, and its morals.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a movie about a young man. The youngster in question isn't even that interesting. He's in a band, sure, but otherwise he's kind of a wimp. The kind of a nerd that other nerds will feel superior towards. Plus he's kind of an asshole, cheating behind the backs of his girlfriends just because he's too much of a coward or perhaps just too lazy to break up with them. He's not an admirable man, yet the whole movie revolves around him and his decisions. His ""heroics"". Now, some might claim that Scott is a perfect main character because of this, because he's the perfect everyman. Perhaps a bit of a pessimistic version of one, but still, he's very bland and normal, only the circumstances into which he is thrust upon are extraordinary. I however argue that a) he's an asshole and not at all likable, and b) movie's are supposed to inspire us, to show us something that we don't see in our everyday life.<br/><br/>At this point someone will argue that not every film has to be all about moral triumph and the nobleness of human mind. And that person would be right. I'm not claiming that my viewpoints have any kind of superiority here, they're only my personal take on this film. But I think that my viewpoints have relevance as they're one way to look at this film, a rather rare way from what I've gathered, but a way nonetheless. And sometimes the more extreme opinions, the rarer ones, are the ones worth sharing.<br/><br/>But as I've said, this is not a bad film. It has style, its actions scenes are some of the best there are, its dialogue is very fast-paced and brimmed with jokes and double meanings. And while I think that most characters in this film aren't pretty loathsome human beings, I cannot claim that they do not feel realistic. Their behaviour is sometimes very outlandish and caricature-like, but beneath all that they're still just like people that I've met and known in real life. The morals and worldviews of this film are pretty horrible, but perhaps the reason I hate the film so much is because the message hits so close to home. It's quite possible that I just don't want to face the truth.<br/><br/>So yeah, in the end I feel that I have to recommend this film to you. I personally don't like it, but it's just me. Love it or hate it, you at least owe it to yourselves to see this film and form your own opinions."

","I honestly did not know this movie existed until my cousin suggested we watch it one day. I'm honestly thrilled that day happened.<br/><br/>I was certainly not expecting this movie to be how it was. The premise of it was ridiculous - so much so it was amazing. If you don't look at this movie from a ""WTF? What kind of reality is this?"" kind of way, you will think it is amazing too. The fight scenes are incredible, as are the actors. Michael Cera is, in my personal opinion, his best in this movie. This is the movie where I fell in love with him. Everyone else was awesome as well.<br/><br/>I suggest to everyone to watch this movie - adults and younger ones as well (although not too young, there are some small sexual scenes...). Younger ones will enjoy the action and adults will also enjoy the video game references from way back when. Make sure to actually watch this movie because it moves fast and requires one hundred percent attention. otherwise, things will be missed. Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as i did!"

The visual aspect from this movie was very good too, all the action scenes were incredibly well made and were funny to watch at the same time.<br/><br/>The love story between Scott and Ramona was the best element from this movie, and it was the main reason of why this fantasy flick was so enjoyable.

"hellraiser7","10","2","5","4 January 2012"," Video Game Warrior
","One of the rarest things to ever happen to me, is finding a movie that has about everything I want, or even as a fan of a comic book for an adaptation to live up to my expectations. This film does that just like the graphic comic mini series it was derived from it is a film I feel was made for me.<br/><br/>This film just has so much that one watch just isn't enough. The action is great it is well filmed just old fashioned style (which I prefer) where you can see the hits as well as who's hitting who. It is well choreographed, it really looks like a video game or even comic book/anime come to life. From the visual effects and sound when we see the attacks delivered down to the power moves. Just seeing this makes me wonder why the hell the live action ""Street Fighter"" movies couldn't of pulled this off. <br/><br/>This also creates sort of a fantasy world, kinda like with the show's ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" and the underrated ""Community"" or even the video games ""Earthbound"" and the ""Persona"" series. It's a world that is one foot in reality but also just one foot away, everyone acts as though what is going on is all a part of everyday life. I love those kinds of fantasy worlds because their more accessible and feel as though anything to even a random everyday person is possible. The music is also great most to all of the songs are memorable, two of my favorites are the theme song and Threshold. But what really gives this movie power is in it's dialog and characters.<br/><br/>The dialog and humor is just hilarious, this film is one of those rare movies where sometimes by re watching you can uncover something new, sometimes I find a joke that might of went over my head, that just makes the film all the more funnier. There is also a great amount of reference jokes much like in ""Futurerama"" and ""South Park"", from video games like ""Street Fighter"", ""Double Dragon"", movies like ""The Warriors"", you name it it's there.<br/><br/>Characters even the minor ones are all great and I felt cast just right. Even though for the record I'm not a fan of the actor, Michael Cera I thought did very well as the character, I really felt like he was Scott Pilgrum. What I love about Scott is just how relatable he is, Scott is a bit like myself in real life; he's shy, insecure, ill confidant but not short of courage, loves video games, and trying to find himself. I also love the fact that Scott looks like any other everyday person, he's not some stereotypical pretty boy, this helped in the relatablity.<br/><br/>Mary Elesebeth Winstead is perfect in the role of Ramona Flowers, I've always imagined that actress's voice when I read the series, so her playing Ramona is a dream come true. She is hotter than hell (in my book anyway)and capable actress to boot. Ramona is feisty, fiery, spontaneous, rebellious, bitchy (I mean that in a good way) despite these things she's capable of warmth and mature, and like Scott is also trying to find herself (heck her changing hair color reflects that).<br/><br/>I love the chemistry between the two it's one of those rare examples of a romance when done the right way, because it feels true to what I've been though with my significant other. Like the moment both first met in an awkward conversation, that's happened to me because what do you say to a girl you've just met, it's not like there are guidelines. The conversations they have with one another and the time they spend together, it just feels right you know both are right for one another and you want them together.<br/><br/>Like the minor character Knives Chaou played by Ellen Wong whom is also hotter than hell and a capable actress hoping she gets more in the future. Knives is 17 (though in reality the actress is 25) she's young, full of energy, sweet, has some fire in her which we see in the final fight, a bit immature though I don't mind. The way the film handled her I could of gone either way (though on a side note I like Ramona even more but that's just me) but we know who the right one is so it makes sense who Scott chooses in the end.<br/><br/>The villains are all colorful, just like in a ""Street Fighter"" video game each have different abilities to do serious damage. However all of them are unlikeable, their just all dirt bags with a capital D, their the kind of people that have pushed me around in my middle school, man did I hate them; all the more reason we want Scott to win.<br/><br/>The film has multiple themes, in a way the film is a bit like a Howard Hawks film as the situation progresses Scott becomes more of a man and Ramona becomes more of a woman. For Scott it's doing things for yourself as well being more than what you are if you want things to get better, Scott's life has always been on hold because he wasn't doing what he should be doing, but once he stepped up to plate that's when life got better. Ramona it's finding what she needed as opposed to what she thinks she wants. All of her evil exes had one thing in common they didn't give her what she really needed, Scott was able to give her what she needed which is kindness, warmth, and understanding. All the more reason why he's right for her.<br/><br/>Well that's all I have to say, Scott Pilgrim is an epic, well sort of.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

Although I don't know that I laughed early in the movie, I thought all of it was interesting and once I was drawn into this world, I laughed hard.

"misterembryo","10","6","25","16 August 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. Scott Pilgrim wins. Flawless Victory.
","The movie opens with an 8-bit recreation of the Universal Pictures company logo, complete with a new rendition of the studio's fanfare done in nostalgic MIDI format. Ah the good old days of fat video game cartridges that never work until you blow into the microchip slot. For me, this was love at first sight as Edgar Wright (Director, Shaun of the Dead) prepares you for a crazy ride through the trying times of Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), a young romantic determined to literally fight his way into the heart of his one true love, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). You will find yourself entranced by the dazzling visuals backed by a score made up of head-thumping punk rock and classic video game themes. This truly is an epic of epic epicness.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is adapted from a popular series of graphic novels written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Inspired by punk rock, Manga comics, video games, and Kung Fu classics, this movie is a modern telling of a classic love story, catered to the MTV Generation. That's not to say anyone born outside of this generation won't enjoy the ride. No joke falls flat. Instead they fly at you in vivid color. The movie reads like a comic book and plays like a video game. Like a comic book, the text is an integral part of the storytelling. A series of D's flies out of Scott Pilgrim's bass guitar in rhythmic fashion as he prepares for a killer solo. An occasional onomatopoeia flashes across the screen with a THWOMP or THUNK of someone's head, reminiscent of the Adam West Batman. Like a video game, every bad guy Pilgrim kills spontaneously bursts into coins, accumulating a score that serves no purpose. It's a wacky game of Whose Line is it Anyway where the points don't matter but you find yourself rooting for a winner.<br/><br/>I was reminded of Tarantino's Kill Bill. The hero has a list of people to kill, but unlike the Bride, Pilgrim isn't out looking for trouble. The trouble finds him in the form of The League of the Seven Exes, a dark alliance formed by Ramona's latest ex, Gideon Gordon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), whose sole purpose is to challenge any romantic soul brave enough to seek the heart of the impulsive, attractive, and elusive Ramona Flowers. Every ex that Pilgrim encounters offers a different kind of fight, a new challenging way for Scott to win, and another chance for Wright to bring you an entertaining display of light and sound.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World introduces you to a wild ensemble of characters. Scott Pilgrim himself is a scrawny, unassuming young man who seems harmless at first until you discover the impressive track record of broken hearts he's left along the way. One of those broken hearts belongs to the girl drummer in his indy punk rock band, the Sex Bob-Ombs, another endearing Nintendo reference. Knives Chau (Ellen Wong) is his Chinese high school girlfriend, head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend and completely obsessed with his band. Pilgrim's anal sister (Anna Kendrick) and his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin) also offer big laughs.<br/><br/>Like Tarantino in Kill Bill, Wright is given a playground with no rules. The fourth wall is almost nonexistent and nobody ever asks why, not the people watching the movie nor the people in the movie. You sit back, suspend all belief, and hope that Scott Pilgrim beats the game. Like Miyamoto's Super Mario Brothers, Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a game you will want to play again and again and again."
"Troy_Campbell","9","6","25","13 August 2010"," Massively entertaining.
","The fact that Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz director Edgar Wright has crafted a tremendously stylish flick isn't all that surprising. That he managed to match that style with just as much substance is quite extraordinary though. Scott Pilgrim may be live-action anime complete with hyper-chic, arcade-esquire visuals, but these awesome effects wouldn't carry your interest for two hours if it wasn't for the intelligent and meaningful tale underneath. That a story of how difficult, and rewarding, love can be is packaged in monumentally fun set-pieces and biting humour is exactly the reason why Pilgrim is one of the year's best films to date.<br/><br/>After seeing the trailer I was unsure whether or not I would enjoy the computer game feel of the movie, however, any ambivalence towards the film was dashed immediately once it began. The action – and there is a lot of action – is infused with a unique streak of rambunctiousness that only heightens the experience, most splendidly realised in the clash between Pilgrim and rival bassist Todd Ingram. Furthermore, in Wright's capable hands the subtle tics and icons that are littered throughout the picture stay inventive and amusing, never veering into overbearing or unwelcome territory.<br/><br/>In his first feature film without regular acting duo Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, Wright has assembled a pitch-perfect cast, starting with his leading man. Not exactly playing against type, but certainly unleashing his action chops more than ever before, Cera proves yet again he's the go-to guy if you're looking for 'geeky-cool'. Pilgrim's effortlessly likable thanks to Cera, he's outrageously funny without ever playing it up and he wears his heart on his sleeve in a manner that doesn't become whiny or annoying. Put quite simply, if he doesn't win over Ramona by the closing credits you'll be as heart-broken as him.<br/><br/>He may be the eponymous hero, but this isn't a one-man show for Cera. The eclectic supporting cast are superb and at times even steal the show. As the hair colour-changing Ramona, Winstead is strangely intriguing and attractive, her enigmatic attitude all the more enticing. Of the numerous splenetic exes, Routh and Evans are the pick of the bunch, the former's vegan guitarist and the latter's egotistical movie star both offering up plenty of laughs. Elsewhere Culkin is hilarious as Scott's gay roommate who'll say what no-one else will, Wong makes for the ideal love-struck high-schooler swooning over Pilgrim and comedienne Plaza provides more of the straight-faced comedy that made her stand out in Funny People.<br/><br/>Massively entertaining, Pilgrim delights with its mixed bag of mesmeric goodies.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)"

","OK so I got round to watching this. Ai dos mio so much intellectual masturbation here. Not to mention emasculation. The protagonist is essentially a twink whom we are meant to believe has a circle of friends who love him despite him having no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The script is overpaced and insincere, trying desperately to reflect a generation it is not a part of. There are no funny moments. Just a lot of arrogant assumptions, and second rate wordplay.<br/><br/>He then ""falls for"" some random chick at the library whom we are meant to believe is six shades of awesome, and digs him simply because he's a scrawny twerp.This is essentially an update on the theme of the 80s movies that had geeky guys scoring with hot women, except the update is terrible, because the women are terrible. She's essentially a really annoying self obsessed child, and is not attractive at all. But neither is he. And so I watched two unattractive and annoying people interacting for an hour and a half. If it was a house party I could have just walked out.<br/><br/>Seriously, if this is taste, then I'm glad I have no taste. Because this film is garbage."
"jon.h.ochiai","7","5","22","16 August 2010"," On the Journey Style Rules
","In life it is all about the journey. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is about the journey, and then some. Director and Writer Edgar Wright creates a visually exciting approximation of life in this slacker gamer world where Michael Cera is avatar Scott Pilgrim. The screenplay by Wright and Michael Bacall is based on the graphic novel by Bryan Lee O'Malley. Being neither familiar with the source material, nor the twenty-something gamer demographic ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" occurs as a familiar Disneyland ride jacked on ecstasy and steroids. Wright creates TV homage from the campy 1960's ""Batman"" with ""Pow!"" to the more contemporary ""Seinfeld"". Wright generates one of the most visually inventive movies—though not along the lines of Chris Nolan's ""Inception"". However, here style over substance is not necessarily a good thing. <br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim"" is a video game fable with our hero Scott played by Michael Cera at his dweebish best. Scott is the 22 year-old slacker bass player for his band Sex Bo-bomb. He lives with his charming gay roommate Wallace (funny Kieran Culkin). He is rebounding from a break up with his rock siren girlfriend Envy Adams (devilish diva Brie Larson). He is dating 17 year-old high school girl Knives Chau (bubbly Ellen Wong). In the midst of a band competition for a record contract, Scott sees the girl of his dreams in his dreams—Ramona Flowers (fiery and beautiful Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Later Scott sees Ramona at a party, and realizes that she is the One. However, before Scott can date or make out with Ramona he must defeat, as in to the death, her 7 Evil Ex's. Note there is a reason why it is not the 7 Evil Ex-Boyfriends. Do the math. Needless to say, both high jinx and chaos ensue. <br/><br/>Michael Cera is still playing the same freaking character—as he does in all his movies. However, here the good hearted nerd gets to kick ass in martial arts style. The saving grace is Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona. Winstead has a self aware charm, and stunning screen presence. She is going to be a star. Chris Evans as egomaniac action star/ skateboarder Lucas Lee, also an Evil Ex, is hysterical. Jason Schwartzman is funny in small doses, but is light years beyond annoying as record producer Gideon Gordon Graves—also a Ramona Ex. <br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim"" is an eclectic narrative kluge. The fact that 22 year-old Scott is dating 17 year-old minor Knives, even if they aren't having sex, is very creepy. What is creepier, the screenwriters proceed as business as usual here. Perhaps, statutory rape laws are different in Toronto? The kung fu fight choreography is flashy and comical—the intended effect. Being a martial arts snob, I enjoyed the fight choreography of ""The Expendables"" way more. <br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim"" runs about 20 minutes too long, with about 3 too many Ex's, but fortunately ends right. Beneath all the pop culture glitz and indulgent idiosyncrasy ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" is romantic comedy after all. Romantic comedy is hard to do. I think ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" often loses track of this thread along the journey."
"nathe28","1","3","11","3 June 2014"," Worst movie I have ever seen
","The storyline for this movie, could be told in much less than 30minutes yet it is dragged out over almost 2 hours.<br/><br/>The comedy in this is not even remotely funny and half the time it was to hard to figure out what was actually going on. If you like over Edgar Wright movies (such as Shaun of The Dead or Hot Fuzz), and are looking for similar comedy, this is NOT the movie to watch! I cannot actually recall one funny moment in the whole movie. Edgar Wright tried to make something 'different' and although in the past this has worked out for him, in this case it has truly let him down.<br/><br/>This movie is boring, has a lack of storyline and is set out in a very strange way which makes it hard to follow. Would not recommend."

I'm sure if you grew up in the 80's, you'll absolutely love this film. A bass guitarist for the band ""Sex Bob-omb"" named Scott Pilgrim begins to slowly fall in love with a woman named Ramona Flowers.

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (1:52, PG-13) — other: comedy; 2nd string; crossover<br/><br/>This flick was a hoot!<br/><br/>""Not so long ago, in the mysterious land of Toronto, Canada, Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler"", we learn in the opening scroll. You get a clue where things are heading when you find that Scott (Michael Cera) is the bassist for the rock band Sex Bob Omb, and that 2 of his bandmates are named Stephen Stills (Mark Webber) and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons). But perhaps you've never heard of Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. Not to worry! More in-jokes are on the way, and screenwriters Michael Bacall and Edgar Wright are shooting at the entire side of the barn, so some of them are bound to hit a window you're familiar with.<br/><br/>For example, you can still relish the performance of Alison Pill as drummer Kim Pine. Director Edgar Wright gives her almost nothing to do besides glower and provide a downbeat, but she does it with flair, verve, and perfect timing. This is typical of a cast studded with tiny, exquisite short appearances.<br/><br/>Sex Bob Omb appears thruout the movie as a framing device, as it is participating in a battle of the bands, and each performance is occasion for some fireworks (both literal and figurative). But the main storyline isn't about this band, or about the other, more successful one, The Clash at Diamondhead, featuring lead singer Natalie ""Envy"" Adams (Brie Larson), one of Scott's ex-girlfriends.<br/><br/>No, front and center is the girl of Scott's dreams — she rollerblades thru one — Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), recently arrived from New York with her brilliantly colored hair, gothy good looks, big-city standoffishness, and relationship baggage. She has 7 evil exes (""ex-boyfriends"", Scott keeps calling them; ""exes"", she promptly corrects him) whom he must defeat in hand-to-hand combat if he hopes to win her hand. Ramona has taken a shine to Scott — a typical Ceraesque sweet, slender, minimally talented kid who means well but keeps bumbling and tripping over his own tongue — but, like an ensorcelled princess, she's not a free agent.<br/><br/>Complicating things is that Scott has never been particularly adept at relationships. His younger sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick), acting as a kind of Greek chorus, introduces him ""This is my brother. He's chronically enfeebled."", and he's currently taking a lot of ribbing for being 22 years old while that high schooler, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), is only 17. She's clearly smitten with him and tends to cling adoringly; Scott's ready to move on, but Knives isn't, and she's got that nickname for a reason.<br/><br/>And so it goes — POW BIFF BAM WHOMP — each development, detail, deranged improbability, and delightful turn of phrase (""flaming katana of love"") coming at you like a herd of stampeding bon-bons. The screen is awash in imagery from comic books and video games, including a digital counter racking up Scott's point totals each time he punches out a foe to the accompaniment of campy freeze-frame BOP words (straight from the Adam West Batman TV series) and a shower of coinage at each victory.<br/><br/>It's a never-ending stream of laff-out-loud moments, and anyone who's inclined to take it anywhere near seriously should probably see it only with the benefit of pharmaceutical attitude adjusters.<br/><br/>Kudos to the entire fun-filled team, and especially to Bryan Lee O'Malley, who wrote the graphic novels this joyride was based on."

I had read the comic books, which are great, so I (sorta) knew what I was going to see, and I got all my expectations fulfilled. Though the movie itself looks and feels exactly like a comic book, the movie takes different turns than the comic, for example, all the battles in the movie are different. It's completely stuffed with geeky references, and is absolutely the funniest film I've seen this year. Though I strongly recommend that you read the comic before seeing it, or else you might be completely lost. I can't possibly think of any director that would turn this comic into a better movie, Edgar Wright has just the amount of craziness needed. Overall, a total nerd-gasm, if you read the comic, or if you're a geek looking for a pleasant afternoon, quit WoW, get off your lazy ass, and GO SEE SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD!

"neazy","5","1","2","15 February 2018"," Just...fine
","There's just - just - enough to this film to keep you watching, but no more. Visually, it is interesting. In fact, the inventive mixture of comic-book, video game and live action is the film's biggest plus. I particularly appreciated the fact that there was no attempt to confine the vivacity of the world to any tedious real-world logic. It is over-the-top, it is impossible, it works. Unfortunately, the settings and the generic urban colour palettes are just a bit too blank, sapping some of the character from the scenes.
There are also a handful of good laughs, although much of the humour didn't really fly with me. I could, however, appreciate the artistry of it - it was well-written, just not to my taste.
Unfortunately, there's not much else to commend. I am not familiar with the original story, but the film's adaptation of it is paper-thin. There is so little in the way of nuance, and it feels very one-paced. The middle hour of the film made absolutely no impression on my perception of the characters, and the formula quickly became tedious and repetitive, meaning that the ending, devoid of all tension by what precedes it, was a damp squib. This is at least in part down to the emptiness of the characters. A simple story can be mightily effective with some charismatic leads, but they're just so dull. The band are soulless, the exes might as well all be the same person for all the scope they're allowed, Michael Cera sleepwalks through playing himself as usual, and Ramona is a husk of utterly conventional unconventionality. The only one who I developed any interest in was Knives.
All in all, a bit of a disappointment - an interesting experiment let down by an uninspiring story and a strange lack of spark."
"willcundallreview","7","1","2","8 March 2014"," Quirky comic comedy
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a fun comic book action film with bags of great fights, weapons and quirky costumes meaning it is truly like reading a comic. The comedy is fast and so are the sequences as well making my opinion on this film, a just about good one, it is not all plain sailing though and here is what I thought about Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.<br/><br/>The story is very fast and all together the fighting is solidly fun but also has a more serious side as Michael Cera in the lead role has to deal with Romance on one side, and all her ex's on the other making for a rollicking action film. The story moves a long nicely and by the end you do feel a certain amount for the characters within who constantly support Cera and make you feel like he has his own groupie's, well in a way anyway.<br/><br/>Cera act's it well but I found his portrayal maybe slightly bland and as if he was trying to hard to be much more comical than action like. The cast around him like I say do support him and do a good job in doing so with the character of Knives(played by Ellen Wong) giving off an insanely obsessive performance which made the film even more quirky than it already is. Finally of you enjoy comedy with a dabble of violence similar to say Kick-Ass, then this film is for you for sure.<br/><br/>The fight sequences are great and make the film really awesome with it's comic book style sets and the brilliant effects used, it makes for an interesting but slightly strange battle film. I think the set's as I say are great and serve the film well to make it appeal to it's obvious audience(teenagers) and makes it bright and colourful even amongst all the darker violence in the film, but nothing in this is too dark. Overall the film looks great and for what kind of film this is then it is top grade, budget used was well worth.<br/><br/>I felt the film although good, had some slightly pointless fight scenes and the way some of them(not all of them) were done was cheesy and some were over in a flash. I said about Cera being kind of flat but some of the other cast members such as his love interest Mary Elizabeth Winstead were underused and made to look like they just didn't care about performing in this movie.<br/><br/>I think many film watchers will enjoy this and I can't really see why it wouldn't excite anyone, definitely a must see for comic book fans who also like comic book adapted movies. If you don't enjoy violence then maybe don't watch but there isn't too much blood really, also if you hate teenager centric films then also stay away as this film(even though using actors in there 20's) is completely just made up of this. Overall would recommend to anyone really though and go see for yourself, it will divide opinion I think.<br/><br/>I give it a 7/10 overall meaning a just about good movie and maybe in hindsight could have been given more but also less, I did feel it lacked the comedy genre that it claimed to represent. This is the sort of film where you can sit back with some popcorn, or an air guitar and just enjoy it, I know for a fact someone will love this movies quirkiness and awesome visuals +the little action we get dabbled in too."
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","2","23 November 2013"," An interesting take on the rite of manhood.
","I describe this movie as a love story for geeks. While it was amusing, and different, there is really little to set this movie apart from the standard, run of the mill, Hollywood love story. I know many people will disagree with me on this one, but this movie is actually very ho-hum, and is certainly not of the same standard as his previous movies (such as Hot Fuzz). Still, this movie is different and does have a number of elements that impress me. Oh, this movie is also based on a series of graphic novels.<br/><br/>To say that Scott Pilgrim is a loser is an understatement. He is the bass player in a fairly ordinary band (sex ba-omb) and at the beginning of the movie is dating a high school girl (Knives Chow), which is emphasised. Obviously this emphasis is because he very quickly meets the girl of his dreams (which is more true than not because he dreams of her the day before he meets her). He lives in a bunker on the other side of the road from where he grew up and shares his bed with a homosexual (though is not gay himself, much to his housemate's disappointment). However, when he meets Ramona Flowers he decides that he must start dating her, and does everything in his power to make that happen. However, she has seven evil exes which are determined to control her future, and that future does not include Scott Pilgrim, so Scott must defeat these exes to win her heart.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a very allegorical movie. Scott does not come across as actually being a warrior type, yet when he confronts the evil exes he becomes a very capable warrior, video game style. I mention this because the film runs like a video game. Whenever he defeats an ex, he gets points and the ex bursts into a pile of coins. As the movie progresses, the points get higher and the coins become substantially more, in line with the exes getting progressively tougher. However, more importantly, it is a film about how Scott goes from being a boy to being a man, and it is through his desire to have a relationship with Ramona that he is forced to become a man. This is key right at the end when Scott gains the 'power of self-respect'. No longer does he measure himself based on other people but rather on his accepting himself for who he is. Self-respect is not necessarily gained through 'fighting your enemy for yourself' but rather the realisation that you are not doing what you are doing for somebody else, or to impress somebody else, but rather you are doing it for yourself.<br/><br/>Obviously self-respect is a very nebulous concept and can be very individualistic in many cases. I do things for my brother, but does that mean I lack self-respect? Not necessarily. I do things for my brother because I love my brother and know that if I do not do them, then it is unlikely anybody else will do it. Do I grumble about it? I try not to because I know that my brother is totally dependent on other people. However, self-respect is something that is very hard to come by. I remember talking to a pastor about it once, and to be honest, I disagreed with his line of reasoning. He talked about it as accepting oneself for who one is, however it did not sit right for me because once again the concept was self focused and individualistic. If I was a creep and accepted the fact that I was a creep and continued to be a creep then that is not a good thing.<br/><br/>However I viewed it more likely as God-respect. God loves us and accepts us despite what we have done in the past. There is no being a good person to get into God's books because none of us are able to do enough to impress God. God accepts us as we are, usually in our total weakness. However, by accepting God, he gives us the power to turn our lives around and become better people. I know because that has happened to me."
"hmmmeh","6","1","2","9 September 2013"," Good, but could have been *so* good.
","This is a difficult film to rate.<br/><br/>Stylistically, it is stunningly imaginative and bold. The renditions of magical realism are some of the best, the aesthetic beauty of which simply cannot be put into words. It is worth a look on this alone.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the film also suffers from problems. It comes down to doing too much in too little space and losing metaphorical coherence. By the middle of the second act, it is no longer clear which parts of the film are to be understood literally but farcically, and which purely metaphorically, and that detracts from the central redemptive message.<br/><br/>The story itself is simple, in a way that all universal and human stories are at their core, so it truly has great potential. However, in the film it is rushed into the third and final act without producing a full punch despite a great deal of action. The long middle act is again the downfall. It inexplicably explores the external manifestation of conflict in near exclusion to the internal conflict. Or perhaps it puts too much burden on the viewer to infer deeper (and anyways strained) allegories. As a result, what could have been a transformative film is saddled with an emotional and philosophical content only shallowly elicited. This is unfortunate and even unfair, but it is the only way to explain this unsated feeling."
"rus_ty","6","1","2","22 August 2012"," Scott Pilgrim VS my review...
","Scott Pilgrim VS The World, based off the Oni Press graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O Malley, has had a mix of opinions. Some people love it; however, other people completely hate it. When I first watched it, I didn't view it with a critical mind, so my verdict on it was that it was awesome. Having watched it again with a critical mind, I'm starting to think: Was it really that awesome? <br/><br/>The graphic novels were great, but the 6 books had so much in them, character wise and story wise that seemed way too much to pack into one film. But, with the bad points in the film, it has its up sides. Edgar Wright did a great job at staying true to the source material. A lot of the scenes in the movie looked just like they did in the books, and the comic effects that came on screen made us feel like we were watching a moving graphic novel. The casting also helped a lot also, as most all the actors looked very similar to the comic's characters. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winsted defiantly suited the roles, especially Jason Schwartzman, who made a great Gideon. Another good thing was that it had the same quirky humour that the books had, and I found myself laughing at what was funny in the graphic novels. But the films flaws are what brings it down from being as good as the books. The thing with the 6 books was, it had A lot going on. There's a lot of characters' that have their own back-stories, ranging from the evil ex-boyfriends to Scott's fellow band members and friends, and I felt that pretty much none of them were explored enough in this film.<br/><br/>The whole back story between Scott and Kim was briefly mentioned but not fully explored; the Envy Adams story was also brought up, but only left us asking what happened between them in the first place? The ex boyfriends had very little screen time each, and although that is the case in the books, at least the books explained a little more about them. Mathew Patel had his story explained, but then we are given the same cheesy singing scene that was one of the first books low points. The Twins were completely wasted due to neither of them having any lines to say, and there was no real confrontation between Ramona and Todd and how Todd is, basically, a cheating scumbag. <br/><br/>The relationship between Scott and Ramona didn't work at all. It took 6 books to develop the love story and the conflicts between them, but, like a lot of other factors in this film, that part seemed rushed through also. Ramona had the same habit she had in the books, she was quite the confusing character whose personality goes from annoying to very annoying after some time. I didn't buy the romance between Scott and Ramona either, and even towards the end when it's all over, I still don't see how they manage to make the relationship work together. Everything seemed to be summed up within a few minutes that leaves us asking things like: ""Wait, what happened between those two?"" or ""Well that got summed up a bit quick"" or even ""They have TOTALLY missed that part out!"". Understandable, movies can go down a different route from their source material, but this movie tried to fit everything in that resulted in it being quite a mess of a film. And Ramona had the same habit she had in the books: She was quite the confusing character whose personality go very annoying after some time. <br/><br/>Whereas the films CGI was often quite decent, some fighting scenes were a little glitchy. I'm not too sure if that was their intention to make fight scenes glitchy like a video game, but I don't think the whole video game effect appealed to me. Another thing that I'm unsure of is, are these characters' actually in a video game? The lives, the fighting and the sound effects, is it set in the real world or an actual video game world? Whereas in the books Bryan managed to get away with it, for a film it doesn't work all that well. <br/><br/>The verdict is, Scott Pilgrim VS the World is an enjoyable film if you don't pay too much attention to details. However if its details and a proper structured story you are after, I doubt that you will enjoy it."
"aimless-46","6","1","2","28 December 2011"," Good Fun
","If you are thinking about viewing this film, imagine if Richard and Danny Elfman's expressionistic film ""Forbidden Zone"" (1980) was effectively blended with ""Napoleon Dynamite""(2003), ""Malice In Wonderland"" (2009), and ""Sky High"" (2005). If you liked any or all of those three films you should enjoy ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"". American audiences have historically been highly resistant to expressionism and it is interesting how that style is now finding an audience in the gamer and comic book crowds, apparently computer generated special effects have effectively kicked down the barriers that have long kept us trapped in the realism style.<br/><br/>I came to this film as a fan of Alison Pill and was not disappointed, she appears to be having a lot of fun playing a variation of Mary Stuart Masterson's ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" (1987) character; although Alison gets to deadpan much funnier lines.<br/><br/>And Mary Elizabeth Winstead should get some credit for putting herself out there in some unconventional stuff like this and Tarantino's ""Death Proof"" (2007). It is rare for an actress to take these kind of chances but it is a good way to avoid type casting.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that much of the $60Million budget does not seem to make it to the screen, the film would probably have worked better as a more minimalist production. The computer generated stuff simply has no charm and you just want to fast forward through the silly fight sequences.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has Michael Cera fighting the evil exes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead. It's a fun idea but one that doesn't quite work in movie format. I'm sure with the exes spaced out over a series of books, it allowed for a lot more detail, but here it's very rushed and repetitive. By the time we get to the final fight, it's all a bit samey. The film also fails by having very unlikable characters as the focus of the story. Neither one is interesting enough, nor do they have any real emotional connection. Luckily there's a long list of supporting characters to brighten things up. Evans hams it up as a skateboarder turned movie star. Culkin does a good job as the gay roommate, and best of all is Ellen Wong. She brings a bubbly naivety to a role that could have easily been very annoying. The film certainly has some great moments, such as the Vegan Police, but there are only so many obnoxious sound effects, computer game references, and terrible one-liners I can take."
"Robert_90","7","6","31","11 August 2010"," Extremely flash
","Few films have filled me with equal amounts of anticipation and dread as Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. The anticipation came from the marriage of an intriguing premise and a director that had shown immense promise through having a hand in some of the best comedy of the past 10 years. On the other hand, the over-the-top style and hipper-than-thou vibes looked to be a double-edged sword that could bring the whole thing crashing down in bright computer-generated flames.<br/><br/>Let's get the plot out of the way - for those who haven't heard anything at all about this, the titular character is an unemployed musician living in Toronto who ends up meeting the girl of his dreams one night. As he gets involved with her, he discovers that she has a hell of a past - she's left behind ""seven evil exes"". For no adequately explained (or particularly necessary) reason, they each come after Scott and engage him in ludicrously over-the-top battles. In between fights, Scott still has to deal with the various ups and downs of his relationship and how it affects the rest of his life.<br/><br/>Right, let's move on the film proper - well, those feelings I mentioned in the first paragraph? By and large justified in both respects. On the good side, stylistically the film is sublime. Despite having never read the source comics, I still enjoyed the film's heavy-handed usage of comic-book conventions such as visible sound effects, split-screen panels...the works. That's going without mentioning the copious references to videogames, whether it's the subtle use of sounds from other games or the blatant references to such things as getting lives or winning points. The visual effects are also top-notch, going above and beyond expectations with colourful clashes and blistering battles. If nothing else, Scott Pilgrim looks a million dollars.<br/><br/>Now comes the bit where I follow up a paragraph full of earnest praise with a little bit of honest criticism...while the film is great visually, I'm not really a fan of everything else about the film. Michael Cera does his usual ""awkward goofiness"" schtick, while most of the other cast deliver undemanding deadpan performances. On the other hand, the hamminess of the exes comes close to making up for it it.While I don't deny that these different styles genuinely fit in the right sequences, sometimes it gels and sometimes it doesn't. The same goes for some of the references that the film tries to jam in, especially one scene that parodies a certain popular sitcom that really isn't quite as funny as it should be. I could probably rattle off a list of the stuff that falls flat, but I'd probably have to list the stuff that didn't as well, so the non-action sequences are something of a mixed bag for myself.<br/><br/>If you're familiar with any of Wright's other work, this will definitely amuse you to one degree or another. If you're not, well, I daresay all the promotional materials give you the right idea - it's a fairly lightweight romantic comedy plot wrapped in a few layers of unbelievable fantasy and cooked to a crisp. Ultimately it suffers from one very extreme case of style over substance, but what a style it is. Definitely worth seeing in theatres, if nowhere else."

","I expected a lot from this movie after seeing its IMDb rating.Actually this is a classic example for us that we should not believe IMDb ratings. This movie cannot be put into any genre i guess it can actually be put has a genre called video game as movie was pretty much like seeing your friend playing a video game with a really bad story. I don't understand the point of this movie as it was not fun to watch and it neither gave me any good message or something like that. So take my advice and avoid it and even if you start watching it most probably you will stop in the middle.This is the first movie for which i have rated 1 star as nothing is there below it to rate."
"shroyertour","6","3","12","4 November 2010"," Good - would watch it again sometime.
","This movie is a little difficult to categorize. It's part comedy/romance (ie chick flick) and part fantasy/spoof. The premise is somewhat far fetched in that the hero has to battle and defeat the heroine's past seven exes in order to win her heart. And the stars are not exactly well known, except for Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and possibly Michael Cera. And there are a variety of characters here. Besides the hero and the heroine, there are the gay friend (well played by Kieran Culkin) and his friends, the band members, the girl friend (Ellen Wong), and the ex-girl friend.<br/><br/>It's use of goofy, spoofy, textual, animated, and pseudo-video game special effects contributes to make it a movie you will either like or diss. I come down on the side of like partly because this is a film where the average guy (Cera) gets the hot girl. And by average guy I mean a really scrawny one who nevertheless seems to possess ninja-like close combat skills. And by hot girl I mean either Wong or the one with purple, blue, then green hair (Winstead).<br/><br/>To say this movie is a little quirky would be understating it. To say it is a good, above average, movie is not an overstatement. Quirky or not, the actors give performances that are genuine. They are believable even in their rather unlikely and artificial surroundings. Cera in particular comes across as open, honest, and unassuming. A person who is emotionally defenseless; who does not want to wear a mask, but wants someone to accept him as he is, with all of his faults. And an honorable mention goes to Alison Pill who plays the dead pan, straight faced Kim, the band's drummer and another ex-girl friend. Her performance reminds me very much of Christina Ricci's Wednesday Adams.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely not for everyone. But if you can give way to the bizarre physical reality and instead focus on the emotional, this is a movie you will enjoy and watch again sometime."

","I think it's sad that the movie did not do great business at the American Box office. I didn't know that up til a few minutes ago, when I saw it here on IMDb. I would have thought that more people got in and watched it. It is a very weird movie, that does not seem to care about conventions, be it story-telling wise (think the ending) or montage-wise (think ... well montage, where Scott gets ready).<br/><br/>But maybe that was too much and too daring. I can see that quite a few people wouldn't like what they saw, it is not what most people might expect from a comic book movie. Though the comic does not seem to be very ordinary either (haven't read it yet).<br/><br/>The cast is incredible and the jokes are really good. It might feel a bit distant and not emotionally grabbing, but that is on purpose. Which still might make you hate/love it though of course (depending on your taste). I did feel the movie a bit dragging after the middle, where it seemed like a video game, where you had to do/see another scene that was like the one before. It felt a bit like that to me, though that does not necessarily apply to any other viewer of course.<br/><br/>Give it a chance on Disc, if you haven't already watched it."

","Scott Pilgrim is a 22-year old bass player in a band which has some mild potential. Currently going out with oriental schoolgirl Knives Chau, he encounters the mysterious Ramona Flowers and she agrees to go out with him, only for him to discover that this means he must fight and defeat her seven evil exes.<br/><br/>I loved this weird and wonderful movie, directed by Shaun Of The Dead's Edgar Wright, and starring Michael Cera (playing Scott as his stock character, albeit less of a loser than usual) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona (and a couple of honorary mentions for Ellen Wong as Knives and Kieran Culkin as flatmate Wallace - both very funny). It doesn't conveniently fit any category. It's not a comedy, although it's very funny. It's not a teen romance, although there's a strong element of that. It's not a superhero movie or a computer game movie, although both of those aspects are well represented (without any explanation, which was another thing I loved about it). And it's not a comics movie, although it is sourced from a comic (sorry, graphic novel) and, again this is clearly a major influence on how it is delivered.<br/><br/>In short, it is that rarity - entirely its own thing, and an absolute delight.<br/><br/>PS I'm 58, so you don't have to be that young to appreciate it, thank you very much all you young ageist whippersnappers!"
"daryl42-1","8","3","12","24 August 2010"," A movie for my generation.
","8.4<br/><br/>The relationship between video games and movies is undeniable. Obviously, video games were originally inspired by movies. However, after video games' inception into our world, movies began to be inspired by them. You can easily find its inspiration in the films that are being developed today. There is a new generation of audiences, and thus a generational gap between film critics and today's movies.<br/><br/>It is almost written in stone that a movie based on a video game will be terrible, and that a video game based on a movie will be mediocre at best. This might be because most of these products are just that: products. There is little to no love being poured into it. It may just be produced by people who's main incentive towards the project is financial compensation. <br/><br/>The best video game movie ever made is Scott Pilgrim. It is a movie that is not based on a video game at all, though. It is based on a comic book that is heavily influenced by video game culture. So maybe Scott Pilgrim doesn't exactly qualify for this category. Either way, it's a movie made for those who love video games, and it's great.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright helms the directors chair and shows us that he understands my generation. Thanks, Wright. The editing is Scott Pilgrim is superb. The movie likes to use multiple camera angles on-screen at the same time. It also likes to put words and images on screen, such as onomatopoeias and symbols like lightning and even a pixeltated version of Scott's face, representing an extra life. All this works to the film's advantage, creating a style that's not exactly unique, but is used in a unique way.<br/><br/>The narrative in Scott Pilgrim is strongly targeted towards the 18-24 age group. Scott's experience with women, and life itself, is limited. However, he learns in the movie, and thus, the audience is presented with the opportunity to learn as well. However, if you are well above that age group, you might find Scott Pilgrim to be quite tedious. You usually get a more mature, experienced take on the situations presented in this movie. But in Scott Pilgrim, you let a goofy 22 year old take the wheel.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a great movie, but it is obvious to see the generation gap between its target audience and older viewers. If you are Scott Pilgrim's age, you must see it. If you aren't, you will probably find it to be a mix of cute and annoying, like children usually are. Scott Pilgrim gets away with what movies based on video games wish they could pull off: using actual references to video games in the movie. I don't know how much they payed for the Zelda music, but it was well worth it. Thank you Scott Pilgrim crew, for making a movie for my generation. Well, at least the nerdy/geeky side of it, anyway."

","This really was the surprise of the summer. <br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is easily the best comedy of the summer and I would say even arguably the best movie of the summer. The humor is very clever, but this was to be expected coming from the director of both Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The acting was also very well executed. Michael Cera is his usual character, but he is still hilarious, as are his friends and the evil ex's that he has to fight throughout the film.<br/><br/>Stylistically this movie is like none other that I have ever seen before, in the sense that it looks like a comic book/video game throughout the entire movie, but it does not go over the top. Because this execution was not over the top, it made for a very enjoyable movie. <br/><br/>Don't let the trailer fool you, this is definitely a movie worth seeing, and it's a true shame that it hasn't made more money in the box office. Great movie and I hope you all go see it."

","I wonder if you remember the short by Pixar named ""When day meets night"". There was a voice at the radio which said ""People are afraid of changements, people fear everything that is not usual"". I think this sentence perfectly fits the situation. Why hasn't Scott Pilgrim been a success at the box office? The answer's very simple: Because it's too different. What about a ""pee bar"" that empties little by little as the protagonist piddles? Mhm...too ingenious for we poor people that think Avatar is the maximum the world of cinema can give us.<br/><br/>I do not care what many people could think (and many reviewers, I outta add), Scott Pilgrim deserves (or maybe deserved) a great success. Because it is something new, something that anybody had never seen before then I'd award it even just for that. We shoulda go watching this kind of movies, because so doing we would show the Hollywood world that we viewers need something more than the usual Blockbuster.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'd give this movie a 10 stars rating. At first for its protagonist, Michael Cera. Oh my God, his performance has stroke me so much that made me think I'd be gay for him (lol). Even all the others characters, so fascinating, original and histerically funny. The character played by Chris Evans, who perfectly fits his role, is in my opinion the best of the seven evil exes. Elizabeth Mary Winstead adds a little drop that doubles the value of the cast.<br/><br/>There are a lot of brainwaves (Do you remember in the first teaser trailer ""What are you doing? - I'm getting' a life!"") which make this movie pretty precious. Colorful and funny even in its smallest detail, it reminded me of the graphic novel the story comes from, adding some elements we often find in videogames.<br/><br/>Finally, I rally in support of this movie because I think it deserved much more than what it is getting at the box office. Come on, go watching this movie or maybe someday the industrial world of cinema will be still thinking that another Avatar is always better than something new and then risky."

The reason it seemed he got carried away was because he did, the creator of Scott Pilgrim the book worked alongside him making it exactly like the book, that was his intention and it was spot on and i wouldn't change it for the world.<br/><br/>The Bonus disc is just a gift from god, The Making Of is unreal and even if you hate it please look at what kind of work went into making it because it's ridiculous and i'll say it again, it deserves so much more than it grossed.<br/><br/>Please watch this film, you'll love it."
"eric262003","8","2","7","17 May 2011"," Everything You'd Expect From An Adaptation To a Graphic Novel
","I'm not one enthused by reused romantic angles. You know the typical schmaltz you'd expect to find in teenage romantic comedies, where the awkward sensitive teenage boy falling smitten over the girl of his dreams, but can't get to her because she has certain obstacles that's getting in her way. She'll humor the boy in spite that her heart has been crushed several times before but through her own purposes. In films like this, the female is the one that does the dumping, not the other way around. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" has a very similar story structure, but the twist that comes with the story is very iconic, that it will inspire you so much, you can easily accept the formulaic plot that the movie delivers. The audience would be treated to an exhibition of spectacular special effects, and the film making techniques are truly original. <br/><br/>Michael Cera is back in full form as 22 year old Scott Pilgrim in another similar role he's played in other previous films as the charismatic geek trying to fulfill the girl of his dreams. Sure the plot sounds tiring and formulaic, but only this time a new format has changed making it more original than anticipated. <br/><br/>His character falls for an EMO type girl named Ramona Flowers who is played to perfection Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Her dry humor and cynical wit truly makes an engaging character to look out for. <br/><br/>What can you find in the plot? Simply put, picture yourself if you were living in a video game world, where you have the power to fly through the air, possess superhuman strength and to takes on all sorts of challenges to overcome all these assorted obstacles in your way. ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"" takes advantage of these features and adds a lot of light-heart humor that carries the film in a subliminal fashion that compliments the story immaculately. <br/><br/>So we have Scott Pilgrim, who's a 22 year old young man who's currently in a relationship with a 17 year old Asian girl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), he has a gay ally (Kieran Culkin) who has more manly features than Pilgrim, but is always there to lend him advice. He's in a rock band and at one time dated the drummer. One day at a party, he was in cahoots with this girl, but sadly for Pilgrim, this girlfriend has possesses seven deadly exes destined to destroy Pilgrim. The rest of the story is like a comic book come to life as Scott engages in battle with these miscreants with moves that resemble the classic video game ""Mortal Kombat"". <br/><br/>In order to like this movie you have to understand the quality of video games and to marvel at the brilliant lighting, the terrific sounding whenever opponents fall down in defeat. So to summarize, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. The World"", is quite refreshing and very hilarious. It continually entertains till the very end and will leave you with plenty to remember."

","Few movies take the chance of reinventing not only a story, but also the way of telling and shooting it. But Scott Pilgrim is a true effort in innovation for the late 80's, early 90's born generation.<br/><br/>The story itself is worthy of a video game. The mechanics are simple, with defined objectives and a fluid progression of challenges. Scott Pilgrim can only be steady with Ramona, the girl of his dreams, by defeating her 7 deadly exes.<br/><br/>The movie could have been made with symbolism, where the ""fighting the exes"" representing some debate or personal achievement for Scott Pilgrim with the opposition in real life.<br/><br/>However, the fights are part of the in-universe of the story, and so, Scott really is fighting to the death with the antagonists of the story, and they do pulverize into change. The score screens, the comic book sound effects and the ""ultra-rad"" voice over really are in the air. The movie is in itself fantasy, a contemporary set of mythology, and epic tale for this new generation.<br/><br/>Such kind of innovation may be alienating when you start watching, since you think it's somehow all in Scott's head, but once it sinks in, you can enjoy it's full potential.<br/><br/>The Visual Effects are the star of the show, along with the fights, resulting in some pretty cool scenes. The fight scenes, in particular, finally get it right, with some martial arts extravaganzas and stuff one would wish to live in one's own boring, pathetic reality.<br/><br/>The movie may not have the general appeal of Wright's Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, but it's still a solid, entertaining and innovating film. If your head doesn't spin with so many jumps from sequence to sequence and the almost constant appearances of title screens, it's a recommended thrill ride."

","I loved this film but, sadly, most people will be confused by it. Anyone who understands the basics of Japanese Anime and video games will feel right at home is this stylish mishmash of Manga, Nintendo, Kung-Fu, and Indy Rock. The plot is ludicrous, Scott Pilgim (Michael Cera), an unassuming Canadian geek that meets the girl of his dreams (literally) but must first defeat her seven deadly exes in order to be with her. The battle scenes are half video game, half Kung-Fu Anime, with each ex possessing a different power or ability that Scott Pilgrim must overcome, ranging from double duplicates to bass guitar telekinesis. The effects and choreography are very well done and even the most insane aspects of the movie make a certain kind of sense once you let go of your sense of rationality and go with the flow of the film.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is not for everyone but it was definitely for me, the music was cool, the directing was clever, and the story was original and entertainingly presented.

"brando647","8","2","7","17 February 2011"," A Total Geekgasm
","From the moment the movie opens with an 8-bit rendition of the Universal Pictures logo, you know what you're in for. This film is a major geekgasm, with constant references to classic video games scattered throughout, and anyone who grew up with the classics on NES, SNES, SEGA, etc. are going to love it. For those somehow unaware, the movie is based on the seven-issue series of graphic novels written by Bryan Lee O'Malley and it's directed by the awesome Edgar Wright (SHAUN OF THE DEAD & HOT FUZZ). Scott Pilgrim is the bass player for a struggling underground band and, as the film opens, is dating a high school girl. That is, until he meets the literal girl of his dreams: Ramona Flowers. Scott immediately pursues Ramona but, if he is to date her, he must defeat her seven evil exes. As Scott and his band, Sex Bob-omb, search for their big break and a record contract with the mysterious Gideon ""G-Man"" Graves, Scott begins a series of fights to the death with Ramona's exes while fending off the advances of his jilted ex-high school girlfriend Knives Chau.<br/><br/>The film is an absolute blast and one of the most fun films to come out in the summer of 2010. It might suffer a bit from those who aren't as in to the game references and doses of hipster humor. I thought it was a great movie, but it could've been better if broken into a series rather than crammed into one two-hour block. There is a lot of material for Wright to cover here and, as a result, the entire film feels rushed. There's a lot of characters to introduce and a lot of fights to get through and, since it was all done in one film, it's forced to skimp out on interesting backstory and character development. Before each fight, Ramona gives us a quick blurb of history explaining her failed relationship with each ex. It gets the job done but I can only imagine how much more we could've been given if Wright were given the opportunity to spread the seven-issues worth of material over three movies instead of one. The movie zips along from one fight to the next, oftentimes with little time to breath or watch the Scott/Ramona relationship develop.<br/><br/>You can tell everyone had a blast on this film and Wright has used some of the best young talent. Michael Cera doesn't really stretch himself as the titular Scott Pilgrim, but his meek personality is perfect for the character; Mary Elizabeth Winstead is beautiful as Ramona and she makes the perfect dream woman. My favorite performances weren't the key cast and instead came from some of the supporting players. Kieran Culkin was freakin' hilarious as Scott's gay roommate Wallace Wells and responsible for some of the best line deliveries. The exes, being the centerpiece of the film, were some inspired choices including Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, and Jason Schwartzman. There's even a great cameo from Thomas Jane and Clifton Collins Jr that I'm not going to spoil here, but it's the funniest part of the entire movie. It's really a shame this movie didn't perform well at the box office, but I guess it's aimed at a niche audience (comic and gamer geeks). In a sense, it's actually good Wright crammed all the material into one movie seeing as how the weak performance might not have warranted further movies to complete the saga."

","What to say, what to say? I had heard good things about this film for a while, an recently those good things reached a crescendo, with two of my most trusted movie advisers both recommending it. And, I am sad to say, as good as it was, it just did not meet the hype. Primarily because it was too long.<br/><br/>You have the dorkiest man in Hollywood, Michael Cera, and another arch-dork, Jason Schwartzman. And you have a female lead who I consider one of the top five hottest women in the world, Mary Elizabeth Winstead. So that is a great cast, not including all the bonus guest stars. (Sadly, I should be clear, Winstead did not look attractive at all in this film, being shown up by Ellen Wong.) <br/><br/>Another reviewer says the film is ""quite possibly the most original and fresh movie of the decade."" That is a bit extreme, but not without merit. I would be hard-pressed to find another movie similar to it. There are some ""Kill Bill"" moments, but the first is clearly more inspired by Beck, Nintendo (with some obscure references, such as Clash at Demonhead) and the original graphic novel.<br/><br/>The same reviewer says the film is ""not a perfect movie and hardly could be called a masterpiece."" I think this is true on a film levels. While the film clearly has great visuals and a sense of humor I appreciate, it spends too little time on character development and runs on the long side by having 7 evil exes. 5 would have been enough, and kept the pace more smooth. The fight scenes started to get repetitive.<br/><br/>The reviewer claims this is ""the ultimate love story: a guy fights an army for his loved one."" And that is a valid point, except I disagree. Scott Pilgrim hardly ever gets to know Ramona Flowers (again, little character development) beyond the fact she had seven exes... she is not worth that much trouble. And then you have his other love, whose only flaw is that she is in high school. They seem a better match.<br/><br/>I would love to respond to Roger Ebert's review, but he did not write one. (Apparently, he was writing his memoirs at the time.) <br/><br/>Some have tried to find a deeper meaning in the film, some criticism of pop culture. I do not know about that. Anyway: great film, full of nostalgia, and a really good concept. But runs on the long side, and if the fight scenes had been shortened to expand the characters a bit, it would have been an even better movie... as it is, a guilty pleasure but probably not a long-lasting film."

","I will first tell you this, this is better than Tron Legacy by a little but still better. The other thing is the film is a shot by shot adaption, it copy's everything from the novel (and I mean everything). Scott Pilgrim is about a man fighting for a woman while dating a woman (also way better than The Dilemma in so many ways). While fighting, Scott learns the error of his ways. The film is for the comic book fans, rock and roll fans, and moviegoers who are looking for a sexy adventure, but it's not for regular moviegoers who are seeing the film out of curiosity. Which is (and the weirdness) only played a little in the bomb-ness of the film but the main guy to blame is Edgar Wright, The Director of Scott Pilgrim. Edgar's last two movies were all R rating and probably tell parents not to see this film with their kids.

","What is the password? Umm... Whatever! That is the attitude of 23-year-old Scott Pilgrim. By watching thiz film, amazingly I feel like back to become a teenager again with my skate board under my feet and baseball cap on my head. It tells about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who has a new girlfriend, Ramona Flower (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Now, he must defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends in video game style duels. Meanwhile, Scott plays in a band called Sex Bob-omb with his friends. The movie is directed by Edgar Wright who brought us ""Shaun of The Dead"" (2004) and ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007). He is always able to make any comedy to look smart but it's also funny at the same time. On thiz latest feature, there are some unique and hilarious characters such as Scott's gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin), Scott's annoying ex-girlfriend Knives (Ellen Wong) and Ramona's Indian silly ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha). Even more, the movie is surrounded by fresh Cameo appearances from Anna Kendricks, Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, Thomas Jane and our last ""Superman"" Brandon Routh. Michael Cera seems to be a perfect choice for Scott Pilgrim. He does not even have to act so hard to become thiz character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also delivers a believable character with some punk girl attitudes. The movie is based on the first three series of six black-and-white comic strips by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The Art Direction is very attractive and colorful. They use comical fonts to emphasize the sound and the fighting scene is one of the main attractions. Most of the fight scenes are mind-blowing with those graphics and animations. Yeah it looks ridiculous sometimes, but surely it is well choreographed. Once again, the only way to comprehend thiz movie is by letting yourself being young again. Thiz movie reminds us of how we enjoyed adolescence by living in our own world. Once in awhile, all of us were Scott Pilgrim and there was only us Vs. the world. For me, thiz movie deserves to receive 1up and 1,000 combos! <br/><br/>Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com"

","Just saw this on DVD. It isn't the type of movie that I want to see on the BIG screen. The big screen to me is made for big block buster special effects movies. For movies of a more personal rom-com nature that could be really good, bland or stupid I prefer a smaller price tag. I do have to say that of I saw this in the theater, I would not have been disappointed and consider my money well spent. This movie is a creative imaginative out there kind of movie and it really hit me on most cylinders. Being that it is off-beat, not all people are going to appreciate it. I found it very funny and it was done in a comic book fashion that took a minute to get with the program. The dialogue was interesting and the plot unfolded well. The actors helped the movie in that they had the ability to make believe they were serious, even if the whole movie was not serious. It is a key ingredient to movies like these. There was only one that over played their part and that was G-man. I have only one issue with the movie and that is the ending. Afterall that it would seem Scott would be a bit more assured of himself."
"dvc5159","6","2","7","12 December 2010"," Stands out on its own with its unique blend of media genres, but not for everybody
","It seems to me that many people do not ""get"" this film. A friend of mind called this movie ""juvenile"" and ""immature"". I think he missed the point of the movie completely.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to waste my time commenting on all the performances, because for a teen/college love story they are perfect in their supposed way. Michael Cera, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, everyone in the film is perfectly cast and they fit into their characters like a glove, as well as the chemistry between them which is evident throughout. Scott and Ramona's chemistry in particular is kind of cute.<br/><br/>Nor am I going to talk much about the screenplay, which is not-quite- unoriginal, it's absurd, yes, but it is as it should be, and the openness with some Hollywood-taboo themes such as homosexuality and directly/indirectly cheating is quite a first, the screenwriters deserve commendation for that. Not forgetting the dialog which is hip and urban as it should be.<br/><br/>No, this film is purely about the visual style and this is where it succeeds. An amalgamation of multiple media genres, such as film to video game to music video to comic book to alternative rock music and then back again. It's really loopy but it's done in a tastefully and deservedly flashy way. There's changing aspect ratios, onomatopoeia (the ""WHAM"" and ""BAM"" in comic books in case you don't know), health bars, flying people, weapons coming out of nowhere, awesome rock music, virtual comic books, 1UPs, you get the idea. It's THE film for the video game generation, and it is very proud of it.<br/><br/>By using this, ""Hot Fuzz"" director Edgar Wright manages to combine the said teen love story screenplay above with this visual style, and using his frenetic and lively direction, he transforms what would be an ordinary teen film into an extraordinary visual experience. Note that this multiple genre mash can turn people off, as evidenced by the poor box-office returns this film has recouped.<br/><br/>I don't know whether it was Wright or Universal or both to decide whether to bring the film (based on a Canadian graphic novel, no less) to life and to this fashion but it was a solid, and to me rewarding, effort. It's as if you're watching a real video game come to life, and the hip soundtrack and unique visuals all help you enjoy the experience even more. I'd call this a successful experiment and let's see more from Wright and company.<br/><br/>Overall this will definitely be a cult favorite, no doubt. I surprisingly enjoyed the thrill ride (however absurd and surreal it may be, it's still exhilarating and hilarious) and this film is ultimately a unique one which has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 75/100"

","Take a blender, put a comic book in it, a dash of Tekken, the Hatori Hanzo samurai sword from Kill Bill and a full glass of awesomeness. Do not put the lid on, now press on and out comes SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD!!!<br/><br/>So in short the story is about Scott Pilgrim who meets the girl of his dreams, but to have her for himself he has to fight her seven evil exes. <br/><br/>I must say that I really enjoyed watching it. The characters are great and Michael Cera always delivers. Edgar Rivers has done a great job.<br/><br/>What mostly gives me a good reason to like this movie is the feeling of it pumping me full of adrenaline and just getting the urge to jump from my seat, take a guitar and put the amp volume up through the roof! <br/><br/>If you like Superbad and Bruce Willis action movies, well, then go watch Scott Pilgrim vs. the World."

","When Scott Pilgrim meets Ramona Flowers, he discovers he has to defeat her seven 'evil exes' to win her heart...<br/><br/>Edgar Wright, who made two of the most enjoyable films of the past few years, Shaun Of The Dead and Hot Fuzz, here tackles the ever-growing comic book film adaptation. And for the most part he has succeeded.<br/><br/>I will state now I've not read the comic books the film is based on. But taking the film as is, it is very enjoyable. The script is very funny, the supporting cast, lead by Kieran Culkin, Brandon Routh, Chris Evans and others are all very good indeed. But the key to the film working are Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the leads.<br/><br/>For this film to work you have to care about Scott and Ramona. If you don't then you don't care what happens to them. And while both characters have qualities that could make them unlikeable, thanks to the performances of Cera and Winstead, you do find them appealing, if flawed characters.<br/><br/>But the film itself is not without flaws, and these fall on some decisions by Edgar Wright. While it moves at a quick pace, with some excellent set-pieces, including the fight scenes, it's the use of visual aids on screen that at times is a problem. Because I've not read the comic books, it is possible they work in that format, if used there, but in the film I did find them distracting at times.<br/><br/>But this is a small issue. The film has a great soundtrack, and as stated, is very funny and full of energy, and while not up to the level of Kick-Ass, which I found more enjoyable overall, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is much, much better than Iron Man 2 in this years comic book films."

","Michael Cera stars in the dazzlingly brilliant comedy, Scott Pilgrim vs. the world. Scott Pilgrim is zany,and so is it's dialogue. And both work very well. While watching Scott Pilgrim, you will laugh, you won't believe your eyes, and it will blow your mind.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the world involves Scott(played brilliantly by Michael Cera), a nerdy 22 year old who begins to dream about a chick named Ramona Flowers(Mary Elizabeth Winstead). The two meet and hit it off. But nothing is what it seems. Scott has to fight off her seven evil x's(which include Chris Evans as an action star,Brandon Routh as a rocker with vegan powers, and Jason Schwartzman as a geeky freak who has powers of control.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim has many moments of hilarity and awesome. Scott Pilgrim vs. the world is a movie that will make it so then you can't believe your eyes. Scott Pilgrim is an unforgettable dazzler from director Edgar Wright(Shaun of the dead, Hot fuzz).<br/><br/>The characters are all very likably stupid. The dialogue is zingy and fresh. The special effects are pretty neato. THe film has the opposite effect of someone watching someone else play a video game. Because the whole movie is a video game.<br/><br/>This is probably the most fun, well acted comedy in years. Some of Scott Pilgrim is bizarre, but most of it is brilliant and fresh and unique. This isn't a comedy like The Hangover. Really, this isn't a comedy like any other. Scott Pilgrim vs. the world is dazzling, fresh, funny, crazy, and awesome. It could easily be one of the best movies of the year. See it. See it while you can. You'll have a blast.<br/><br/>3.5/4"
"technofunkie","9","5","28","13 August 2010"," An Almost Perfect Action Romance
","The opening sequences of a film are some of the most important in framing the audience's general opinion. If your film leads with a clunky start, then it is very difficult to win the audience back. Fortunately for Edgar Wright's latest film, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, the opening is nearly perfect. From the 8-Bit version of the Universal logo to our first encounter with Scott Pilgrim and his friends, the audience is won over and the film just gets better from there. <br/><br/>Edgar Wright's previous films, Shaun of The Dead and Hot Fuzz both take place in the same universe, and they are in certain ways connected. Scott Pilgrim, is Wright's first film outside of this universe and he demonstrates that he can shift from his stylistic comfort zone's quite drastically and still make a great film. <br/><br/>The most important part of the film, is likely its look. In this critical area, the film takes its cues from video games, comics, martial arts and romantic films. As diverse as they are, all these visual inspirations do mesh quite perfectly--proof that Wright is a legitimate talent. <br/><br/>When Michael Cera was announced you could almost hear the universal sigh across the internet (something I didn't share, as I think with the right material he is quite an enjoyable screen presence). While in this film he doesn't quite move past people's expectations, this material is perfect for him and he really shines. . <br/><br/>Across the board, the cast is quite good, with the exception of Anna Kendrick, who plays Scott's sister. Kendrick is quite unconvincing as a young bitchy teenage girl. <br/><br/>The stand outs are quite obviously the evil exes, especially the future Captain America, Chris Evans and the former Superman Brandon Routh, who are both hilarious and steal the show from Cera.<br/><br/>The film features also easily one of the coolest soundtracks in years, with original songs by Beck and Metric, with the score by Radiohead's producer Nigel Godrich. Godrich's score features many references to video game music as well as other films, however it doesn't just seem to be there for the sake of reference, as it taps your nostalgia to make you feel different emotions for the respective scenes. <br/><br/>Part of the charm of the film comes from all the surprises hidden within. However, with all Wright films, there is so much layering and attention to detail, I am sure I have only uncovered the surface.<br/><br/>To fully appreciate this will require repeat viewings, which in the case of this film, will not be a chore..<br/><br/>Audience expectations for this film couldn't be higher, but it seems that the gamble of extensive previewing of the film has paid off as hyperbolic praise was splashed out all over the Internet. <br/><br/>This praise, while mostly deserved, does ignore the films flaws, which while slight, do need to be mentioned. The film is fast paced, incredibly so and that is, unfortunately to its detriment. The main problem I had with the film is that it lacks an emotional connection, partially due to its hyper-paced action. <br/><br/>The film needed slightly more weight to it, more time to develop Scott and Ramona's relationship. After Scott's initial obsession becomes a mutual relationship, we don't see it develop and that is a large problem as we try to understand why he is kung fu fighting all her exes. <br/><br/>Having said this, I also share much of the universal enthusiasm for the film as it is a purely original creation It, like Avatar, has a quality very rare in film these days: wonder. Wonder, imagination and, not to mention, a love for filmmaking, which often transcends any flaws the film may have. <br/><br/>It is extremely rare for a film to be flawless—this film is not. However it is so easy to look past these and enjoy quite completely everything Wright puts on screen, yes, even Michael Cera.<br/><br/>If you liked the review, check out my film blog. http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com"
"bkoganbing","7","4","21","14 August 2010"," The World Awaits
","I give Scott Pilgrim a seven rating for its technical virtuosity and for the appeal of its youthful cast. It's a movie strictly for the MTV generation of which I am most certainly not part.<br/><br/>Having the film be based on a comic book character certainly allows you not to be bound by rules of reality and if this film is one thing, it has no rules. Giving a lengthy explanation of the plot would be a waste of time, but simply young Scott Pilgrim lives in a communal type dwelling where he plays in a rock band and hopes for a musical career. But before he can have that he'd better get out from under the girl friend problems he's having. A young Chinese Catholic school girl played by Ellen Wong is the current one he's dating. But Scott's got exes and the exes have exes and they're all for one reason or another bad at him. Before the film is over he has to deal with issues involving them all.<br/><br/>Michael Cera from Canada plays Scott and the film was shot in Toronto, another example of Canadian product mainstreaming right here into the American market. Cera is quirky and appealing in his own way. I did like Kieran Culkin as Scott's gay roommate and Brandon Routh as the action film star who is an ex of a Scott ex. <br/><br/>I admire the work more than I like it. But I'm first to concede that that's me, an old fashioned fellow regarding music who thinks Bing Crosby was our greatest performer. I think the MTV generation should enjoy Scott Pilgrim vs. The World."
"davewerty","7","3","14","22 August 2010"," Draged on and on
","Personally I don't think it was as good as Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead, but it was not bad. Very original and funny. There are clever scenes that only Edgar Wright could come up with. The fight scenes are extreme and awesome. I laughed a lot and had a good time, until the fight scenes just kept on coming.<br/><br/>After the 4th fight I began to wonder how I would sit through another 3 fights. The first 60 minutes are brilliant but after a while the movie drags and you wait for it to end. The 7th fight is redone twice, made the ending agonizing. And when I saw that Scott had to fight himself I was about ready to leave. The movie then saved itself and turned the last fight into a funny scene instead. <br/><br/>Go see it for the reason that there won't be another movie like this for a while. Experience the fights yourself and you can always leave when it begins to get too extensive."
"essanisaad","2","2","8","2 January 2020"," disappointing and over the top

"cherold","8","2","8","1 December 2011"," funny, very offbeat combo of kung fu movies, comic books and hipster attitude
","What to make of this movie? I really liked it, it's fun and funny and stylishly made. But what on earth is it? A love story? A martial arts parody? A living comic book? It's all of those, really. And a movie about nerdy hipsters (I know hipsters are supposed to be ""cool,"" but they all seem like nerds to me) playing indie music and coping an attitude. The movie is sweet and silly, but outside of that it's tough to categorize, because it just comes from some weird place I've never been.<br/><br/>Which is fine, except it kept me a little out of the movie. None of it makes any sense, the male lead is a bit of a jerk, even if his nebishy persona makes that seem less objectionable, and The Girl is just some girl with colored hair who acts mysterious but doesn't come *across* as mysterious. And of course, that's much of the point, that these ordinary people are involved in this bizarre alternate world that's not really an alternate world but just this world with fights the way musicals are this world with song and dance. But part of me wanted to care about these characters and I often felt the movie was getting in the way of that.<br/><br/>So I enjoyed it, and appreciated its cleverness, and would recommend it, and yet, part of me found it opaque, perhaps because I'm a middle-aged guy who isn't the right generation to have absorbed these varied influences to the point where they make sense together.<br/><br/>Worth watching."
"cerg-art","10","2","8","10 December 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs. The World
","Note: The original text is in Portuguese. I use the Google Translator to translate. I revised the text and I think there are no problems.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a unique experience. A metalinguistic film, based on a metalinguistic HQ. Everything happens so fast, and a slower blink is enough for the viewer to lose information.<br/><br/>The script (the director himself Edgar Whright and rookie Michael Bacall) is a great adaptation, the whole essence of comics is there, the rest was dried to fit into a movie of almost 2 hours. The story basically it is a ""hero"" facing ""villains"" in order to get the girl, a perfect game plot.<br/><br/>But what is striking is the fact that Wright created a film technically very sophisticated. As an example, the ellipses. Especially those after Scott see Ramona for the first time. First he is in the library, then in the band's rehearsal and ends in the street on their way to a party, all in just seconds. These type of passages of time are very recurrent in comics, but in the film are at a level above the more conventional ellipses. Another interesting technical device is used in a sequence where a breakup occurs, and all around is black, focusing attention to the characters. This black background is clearly based on the comic by Brian O'Malley, creator of the comic Scott Pilgrim. But cinematically is also an interesting alternative to conventional blur.<br/><br/>Michael Cera, star of the new crop of teen movies, which was also lambasted for being always playing the same character, shown here to be an excellent choice as Scott Pilgrim. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is Ramona Flowers, Pilgrim's new girlfriend and ex-girlfriend of the villains, three of them lived by well-known Brandon Routh, Chris Evans and Jason Schwartzman.<br/><br/>Besides the references to games and comics (energy bars, game score, pixelated character, soundtrack of classic games, onomatopoeia), there are also references to the fun of the 90s sitcom ""Seinfeld,"" the movie ""Superman Returns"" - which happens when the character of Brandon Routh (actor who played Superman in ""Superman Returns"") has withdrawn its powers through a gun that shoots green rays (Superman loses his powers when exposed to Kryptonite, a stone that emanates light green) . And it is worth mentioning also a tribute to Bollywood in the first fight of the movie where the evil ex-boyfriend, played by newcomer Satya Bhabha, who is an Indian, fight and dance at the same time.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of the most exciting films of the year and should be revered by every nerd that values himself."

"scarletminded","9","4","25","16 August 2010"," If you don't get any fun out of watching this, you don't have a pulse...
","This movie is fun. It's like a three ring cotton candy circus. It is colorful, graphically intense and also has an underlying deepness to go along with its humor and comic book action. <br/><br/>I haven't personally read the graphic novel so I don't know how it compares, but it is hard not to like this movie, unless you personally have a problem with Michael Cera or only want to watch ""real"" dramas like the Blind Side and can't get your head around younger fare.<br/><br/>I loved how the movie moved like a comic book, but not in the way Sin City, 300 or Watchman did, this one has a completely different feel. People laughed out several times at the jokes and even though I don't like action movies, the actions like people changing into coins and video game effects kept me interested. <br/><br/>The only way I could describe it is if you put Ghost World and Some Kind of Wonderful in a blender and baked it, then sprinkled a copy of Juxtapoz on it and frosted it with a Nintendo/Street Fighter glaze. It reminded me of all these things. The acting was very good, so good in fact, I wouldn't single out any of the actors, they were all outstanding and I am glad a lot of the characters looked and acted like normal kids and that made it more believable. OK, maybe a crazy Chinese schoolgirl and the hip, Gothic/indie girl are stereotypes at times, but at least they are stereotypes I want to see. And items like the ""bass off"" and fighting the dragon twin DJs in one scene (great use of fantasy in the picture) came off as original and fresh to me.<br/><br/>If you can't find fun in this film, then you don't have a pulse. If you are gloomy going to see this, I am sure you'll feel like you rode a roller-coaster before you get out of the theater. And I recommend seeing this in a theater too and not wait for video, because I think the constant graphics and jokes will be lost on a smaller scene or move to fast to be enjoyed fully. Even though it is an adaptation of a graphic novel, I feel the idea of this film is original and given the state of movies nowadays, originally and fun can be hard to find. This has both!"
"sanjay_varma","8","4","25","15 August 2010"," Best teen movie of 2010
","This is easily the best teen movie of 2010, and I think it also qualifies as Michael Cera's best role because of a strong script with lots of quips and natural sounding dialogue. Behind the movie's flashy production there are a number of relevant themes centering around dating and relationships. Cera's Scott Pilgrim is ready to start dating again a year after ex-GF Envy dumped him. But instead of dating someone his own age he aims low by dating a 17 year old high school girl, a choice that inspires both horror and pity among Scott's friends. Then he meets a girl with real potential, Ramona, who changes her hair color every few scenes, and has to fight her seven ex's.<br/><br/>Of course the main lure of the movie will be it's flashy production during the fight scenes. Michael Cera does a great job of performing matrix-like fight moves, while wearing a confused look on his face as 1980s arcade noises and effects commence. The fight scenes are all hilarious.<br/><br/>I might add that ""Knives"" Chou, the 17 year old high school GF, is probably the funniest east Asian stereotype since Long Duck Dong of 16 Candles. But Knives is portrayed in a way that is funny without being offensive."

"bob the moo","Null","2","9","18 November 2010"," Walks a very fine line but just about manages to carry the film with good laughs and a great sense of style and design
","I heard a lot of gushing about this film's originality and brilliance so I approached it with caution. At the same time I was aware that some hated it and that it had underperformed at the box office – and again I had tried to put this out of my mind and just see what it did for me. Having watched it myself I have to agree that I can see the arguments from both sides but only partial agree with either. The film is not awful, but nor is it brilliant – but what it does do is know its intentions really well and all parts of it work to that goal.<br/><br/>The end result is a film that will play strongly with target audience and maybe some outside it taken by its freshness, but that will leave many casual viewers cold and perhaps a little hostile to the meaningless bombardment that I imagine some will feel this film is. I understand this because the film walks a very fine line because so much of it is reliant on the style and energy of the delivery and to some, if this doesn't work, then the rest will fall flat. The entire film is wrapped in pop culture but mostly the influence on the design and delivery is that of Japanese animation, comic books and old school video gaming. While the gaming part of it speaks to me most, the rest is delivered with such consistency and energy that I found it refreshing and clever in how it is done.<br/><br/>What helps it a lot is that it is all done with real warmth and heart – it is not a cold exercise in mimicking styles, but rather a nice little romantic comedy delivered as such. It is frequently funny and light and, most importantly, the consistency allows it to convince within its own world. Had the film had moments outside of its approach (eg scenes specifically to move the plot forward) then it would have knocked the legs away, revealing that it is ""doing"" this approach rather than ""being"" it. Fortunately it doesn't do it this way and the consistent and note-perfect delivery is really well done, bringing the viewer in and keeping them in this world so those that ""get it"" will not question it.<br/><br/>The cast get this too and they are great at matching their director's vision for the film. Cera is strong in the lead and plenty of the material exercises the comic timing and smart wit that fans of Arrested Development loved him for before he became a bit of a pastiche of himself with his many awkward roles. Ramona is the type of girl that would annoy me in real life, but yet Winstead makes me like her (or at least not dislike her). The support cast are generally good and most of the seven ""ex's"" are colourful and bring a lot of fun to their parts. Wright's direction is great though – I would love to see the story boarding for this film just because it was so well done that it must have been planned out to the smallest detail to make it as steady as it was.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is not as brilliant as some would have you believe but nor is it as bad as others would try to convince you it is. For target audience it will be like catnip, for those totally removed from the world it uses then it may be awful apart from feeling fresh and energetic. Personally I felt that its short comings were compensated for with how inventive, consistent, enjoyable and warm it all was. Although it is mostly about the style of delivery, it has enough heart and comedy to avoid being a case of style over substance – it is perhaps close, but it is on the right side of the line."
"Crypter_Code","Null","3","17","22 August 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs. Crypter_Code
","I have little to say about this movie. I realize that I will receive a TON of hate mail about this movie, but I am just expressing my opinion.<br/><br/>I hate this movie. I hated every solitary frame of film on the screen. The characters were bland, the scenes weren't memorable, the jokes were weak, and the all around sense of humour was childish. In fact, if it wasn't for those random blips of swearing, and the random discussion about sex, this could have easily been a kids movie.<br/><br/>I've heard that this movie was based off of a comic book. Very recently, I took a look at said comic book and found that it was actually pretty good. I liked the style, the concepts, the story - it wasn't half bad. Now, it wasn't my favourite, but hell, I don't think the movie does it justice. Now, maybe this might sound harsh, but I'd compare this movie to ""Tank Girl."" Allow me to explain.<br/><br/>The main character is really irritating and shows very little scope of intelligence. Now, I love Michael Sera movies, but he's getting OVERKILL on this type casting. I want to see him for once in a role that isn't some sweet, innocent shy character. Don't get me wrong, he does a great job (usually) but he's got way more talent than anyone's giving him credit. If you take ""Youth in Revolt"" for example, he has to play his usual type-casted role as well as his psychotic alter ego. Personally, I want to see him play a psycho again. It was intimidating yet still kind of hilarious. Next point.<br/><br/>The constant rip offs. Now, I realize that these scenes were also in the comic book, and rip offs is probably the wrong word. But, again, allow me to explain. The references to video games like ""Dance Dance Revolution,"" ""Mortal Kombat,"" ""Street Fighter,"" ""Battle of the Bands,"" and even ""Super Mario Bros."" is incredibly clever. However, I think the director really crossed the line when they did the ""Seinfeld"" scene. That REALLY irritated me. I know it's supposed to be funny, but it wasn't. I felt like they were going to the lowest common denominator. It's like they had a recipe for this movie. But, for some reason I was so completely underwhelmed by all the genius of it. Maybe the trailer had something to do with that though.<br/><br/>For me, watching the 90 second trailer is the equivalent of watching the entire movie. Most trailers are designed to show you the beginning of plot development, the premise, and maybe a couple of quips. But that's the problem with this trailer - it flat out shows you what's going to happen the whole movie! Someone fights, someone says a joke, romantic scene, someone says a joke, someone fights, someone says a joke - I mean I was not surprised at all! There were no surprises in this movie up until the second last scene, when Scott gets killed. That's only half true still. He got a ""life"" from earlier, so it was obvious that he'd have to use it. But. later, the movie states that the power of ""Self-Respect"" is in fact SUPERIOR to the power of ""Love,"" which is not a bad lesson, but in the end I felt it made Scott Pilgrim to looking more like a jerk than someone that the audience might actually feel sorry for, which I kind of thought encumbered the character. And now my final point.<br/><br/>SCOTT PILGRIM WAS A JERK. He dates a high-school girl, sees some other girl, decides that he likes her better, CHEATS OB BOTH OF THEM, until finally his roommate forces him to break up with the one girl. And in fact, it talks about a HISTORY of Scott doing the same thing to lots of other girls! And does he change his ways at the end? Well, sort of. He admits the error of his ways, apologizes for his wrong doings and nearly goes out with his high-school-ex; that turned into kind of a nut case in the end but still. But then she realizes that he really wants to be with the other girl and is just going for her like a rebound girl! WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GUY?!?!??!!! Well, that's my review. And I think you'll Hate it.<br/><br/>I'm Crypter_Code, and I'm signing off!"

","I guess I'm not used to these weird types of movies considering it has gotten good reviews and ratings. I would say after the first 15 to 20 minutes of the movie I became disinterested and wanted to stop watching the movie because I knew I wouldn't like it. The only good thing about the movie for me was that I thought the action scenes were decent, but they were a bit too over dramatic. Personally, I mostly just like to watch movies that make sense and are realistic, so this movie is definitely not for me."

"leonardovavi","10","1","3","8 March 2014"," Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World
","A movie were comedy and action are combined is the best. Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is one of those types of movies. Michael Cera, whose roll is as Scott, falls in love with Mary-Elizabeth Winstead, who is Ramona V. Flowers. Edgar Wright directed the movie based on the comic books Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. The movie was released on August 2010. The movie takes place in the city of Toronto in a present time.<br/><br/>Scott is a 22 year old guy who is the bass player of the 'Sex Bob-Ombs'. Scott's closest friends are the members of the 'Sex Bob- Ombs'. The 'Sex Bob-Ombs' want to be famous someday, and they assist to many concerts. Knives Chau is a young girl who studies at high school. Knives likes to talk a lot. She's a Chinese girl and she falls in love with Scott. Ramona is a girl who recently moved to Toronto. She works at Amazon. Ramona likes to change her style every once in a while. Scott falls in love at first sight. Among the events of the movie, Scott has many battles against different people. Why are those people attacking Scott? Will Scott decide to be with Knives or Ramona?<br/><br/>Among the best parts of the movie's filmmaking is the background music. Every song that is played on the movie suits perfectly in each and every scene. This movie does not only consist in playing famous songs from famous artists, but it also uses video games' music. I really like how this movie has some parts related to video games, which the music is what gives this movie a special characteristic.<br/><br/>Another unique and special characteristic about this movie is its costume design. Ramona's style changes three times among the story. The clothes she uses goes very well with her style. Scott does not have dramatic changes in his costume. He always wears casual clothes. Every person who Scott needs to fight against has his/her unique and personal way of dressing. It is a very highlighting characteristic of this movie how there are many different costumes for every character.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is a great movie where action and comedy are found together. Scott makes all what he can do in order to get the love of his life. I really like how this movie is well developed and how everything in this movie suits perfectly. The actors, the music, the costumes and the story are the key that makes this movie so awesome. I give this movie five stars."
"michaeljhuman","9","1","3","24 February 2014"," Amazing
","After seeing some bad reviews, I thought this movie needed more good reviews to offset it.<br/><br/>I am a 48 year old person, so not a kid. I grew up with video games though. I mean, from Pong to the latest Tomb Raider game, I have played countless games. This would give the movie a favorable bias to me vs. someone who is not into video games.<br/><br/>It's not a teen movie, IMO. Remember, the guy is like 22.<br/><br/>Is is a movie about relationships gone bad, emotional baggage, insecurity and other important topics. Is the plot good? I thought so. Just assume the movie is a bit allegorical, and it makes sense, at least to me.<br/><br/>The main character is probably not to everyone's taste. The love interest is a bit blah - not sure why they did not give her more personality. But some of the support characters are amazing. His roommate was amazing - loved his character. The female member of his band did such a great job and had such a good character, I can't imagine her being better.<br/><br/>The fights are of course stylized and influenced by video games. You just have to accept that the movie is a fantasy of sorts. Don't try to insert logic into it.<br/><br/>There's some very funny scenes. Not all the dialog is amazing, but a lot of it IS amazing and funny.<br/><br/>The characters in many cases responded to situations realistically when the situation was something we all may have experienced. In cases where the situation was completely different than reality, the characters usually acted like this was totally normal - I found that to be a great approach. Their world was normal, except for the occasional video game style battle - why not?<br/><br/>I could understand some people won't get the humor. The movie dares to be a bit different, and as such won't fit into some people's conceptions, and that will result in them hating the movie. I don't think you can blame the movie.<br/><br/>There's a few things that didn't make too much sense to me, but didn't hurt the overall movie.<br/><br/>I found it thoroughly refreshing and enjoyable. I dare say there were even some lessons to be learned from Scott's journey."

","Based on a graphic novel by Bryan Lee O' Malley. Scott Pilgrim is an ordinary and regular geek dude who is into video games and music.<br/><br/>What amazes me is director Edgar Wright who directs Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead has made Scott Pilgrim a ""Scott Pilgrim"".<br/><br/>Combining visual techniques to blend a comic feel with such as using comic fonts to indicate a certain sound or music. The fight scene are very much like a video game.

"PopCulturedwithMovieMike","9","1","3","29 January 2014"," Cutting edge filmmaking.
","Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is an eclectic mash-up of comic books, video games and rock music. As soon as the film starts and the normal Universal logo is replaced with an 8-bit resolution version accompanied by digitized audio, you know you're in for a treat. <br/><br/>Pilgrim was made for this generation of short attention span, texting teens, that's why it's even more peculiar that it was widely ignored by the very demographic it was made for. This doesn't give me a lot of hope for today's youth; when they stay away from something that is actually good and original, for something sub-par and ill-conceived. <br/><br/>There is a lot to like about Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. It has a fast paced style and mixes the fight scenes with some surprisingly strong scenes about relationships. The special effects are top notch. A true feast for the eyes. The soundtrack is one of the better soundtracks I've heard in recent years. Then there are the fight scenes. After all, the whole movie is about Scott Pilgrim fighting off 7 evil exes. The fights are plentiful and pulled off to perfection. These are easily some of the better fight scenes you will see in an action film. <br/><br/>The film also boasts a talented young cast. We all know Michael Cera (some like him, some hate him), but he is joined by some really talented young actors including Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Alison Pill, Kiernan Culkin, Aubrey Plaza, Anna Kendrick (Oscar nominee for Up In The Air) and Ellen Wong. They are accompanied by some film vets in Jason Swartzman, Chris Evans and Brandon Routh. All on top of their game. <br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World might not be for everybody, but if you grew up on the video games of the 80's then you might enjoy this film. If you think it's not your thing, give it a chance, it might surprise you."

","This was a movie I wasn't expecting to be as good as it ended up being (and likely was all along). It wasn't the best movie ever. But it caught me off guard in a very good way.<br/><br/>For those of you (any of the four of you, really) who really like Michael Cera, you won't be disappointed. He play's his character basically how you'd expect him to—a little awkward/shy around girls, but bold at the right times. The only thing I didn't like about his performance was little hints of Napoleon Dynamite that seemed to sneak in from time to time.<br/><br/>Creative (very creative and rather original) editing techniques really make this movie stand out from typical comedies but what really makes the whole relatively unrealistic movie believable are the great, high energy performances from the entire cast.<br/><br/>The music is also quite unique. Though not a completely original sound, it is a sub genre (with a long hyphenated name of some sort) that is relatively unheard of and was pulled off excellently.<br/><br/>A lot of the content of this film could easily have been taken as cheesy/lame if it wasn't for how well it was produced."
"siderite","8","1","3","25 November 2013"," They are Canadians
","Michael Cera is a strange beast. As a friend of mine said, he is in a category of his own. If he had been born American, he would have been the eternal geek, rejected by women and beaten up by jocks. Instead, he is Canadian, so he is like a superstar or something. The movie is also like that. It makes sense to geeks, that is true, but also it can only do that with a Canadian cast.<br/><br/>What is it about? Michael Cera's character is a guy playing in a band and having a girlfriend that is way too immature even for him and that he hardly touched. He gets a dream about a girl, then he literally meets her, the girl of his dreams. He has to battle her seven former exes (you will see a lot of X-es in the movie) to keep the girl. Also he will have to explain to his current girlfriend why he suddenly doesn't put up with her puerile crap.<br/><br/>To do so, though, he employs his magical gaming skills and the beauty of the film is in the multiple references to game and movie culture. It is not a parody, though, only a very beautifully geeky film. You can understand why I will rate it high.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it is obvious why the film reached a cult status in the geek community, but the movie works on several levels of comedy and thus can be enjoyed by everybody. It was a fun film that I can recommend."
"lmsoftlight","8","1","3","22 October 2013"," What if life were a video game?
","One of my favorite movies, and one of the better adaptations of a graphic novel I've seen. Although of course they had to condense a lot of stuff, which lead to necessary changes, it felt like the same story. I was worried it would feel limited, because there are things you can do on paper that you can't do in a movie, but they utilized sound and action well, while keeping that comic book feel.<br/><br/>It lost a couple points only because I felt like the ending suffered a bit...I know the comics were still coming out when the movie was being produced, so even the author didn't have the ending perfectly figured out, but I thought Ramona didn't get to be as awesome in this version as she was in the comic. Also, much as I love him, Michael Cera's Scott wasn't the same Scott that was in the book; it worked, and I still liked his interpretation, but it was an odd casting decision."

","Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a slacker hipster in a garage band who's dating high school girl Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). He is self-absorbed and willing to abandon Knives as soon as he meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Before Scott can date Ramona, he must defeat her seven exes.<br/><br/>Scott is a douche. The biggest problem for me is his unlikeability. It runs counter to Cera's usual good guy persona. Everybody is blasé and sarcastic which get some good laughs.<br/><br/>The best thing about this is the 80s video game visual motif. Edgar Wright brings a fresh hip-without-the-irony sensibility. It also uses Toronto not as New York or as anything other than Toronto. It's refreshing and unique in a world where almost everything is a sequel."

"mrees78315","8","1","3","27 September 2013"," Made for 20-somethings, and not all of them!
","Scott Pilgrim came out when I was 25 years old. As a child I had a Nintendo and a Sega. I read comics and I played games like Street Fighter, Zelda and Sonic the Hedgehog. Upon watching this movie, all I could notice was how much of my childhood seemed to be referenced, used, and often exploited! But in a good way, a really good way.<br/><br/>Pilgrim is at its heart a coming of age story. Our main character acts like a child, takes no responsibility in his actions and is 100% self-centred. How this makes him a likable hero is largely because he is so human. I often compare him to the legendary ""Dude"" from The Big Lebowski. Both characters are hugely likable because they remind us so much of ourselves, each of us has moments of selfishness and laziness but like the characters also value our friends and our own morality. Scott, despite cheating on his girlfriend, constantly complaining and letting his band down, remains very appealing because we care about his redemption - and how do the film makers do this? By throwing in literally everything from our childhoods to make his story seem like a supercharged, action packed version of our own experiences of becoming an adult. <br/><br/>There is no logic to this film. Scott despite his mostly normal behaviour is magically blessed with fighting abilities, super strength, endurance and a slew of other super human abilities.. No explanation is given or is needed. No characters in the movie comment on this. Part of this films charm is how it absorbs you into its world of seemingly normal super human feats - all of them very cool, flashy and somehow reminding you of your 10 year old self dreaming of being a ninja!<br/><br/>This is why I can understand people not liking this movie, it was made 100% for people who, as children, grew up with arcade style video games as shown in little gags like Scott's ""pee meter"" or getting an ""extra life"". These gags are not subtle or clever, they are face value jokes that the audience is supposed to laugh at. Scott and his friends seemingly amazing powers are basically the imagination of a child and this is anything but a subtle movie. Its large IN YOUR FACE style is very reminiscent of the early 90's when everything was EXTREME! Its references to what was recently called ""nerd"" culture are very modern. There are little to no references to Star Wars, Star Trek or anything considered classic ""nerd"" appeal, literally everything is from the late 80's/early 90's onwards, IE its audience's childhood.<br/><br/>For a film that seemed tailor made to suit my viewing demography, naturally I loved it. A particular ""nerd"" moment for me was when Scott proudly proclaimed ""Hey I learned the bass line from Final Fantasy II!"" which would mean literally nothing to someone who has never heard of the Final Fantasy video game series. I can only be impressed with this film's decision to appeal to a relatively narrow section of the audience, as so many films go for the catch-all approach and usually end up being terrible.<br/><br/>I can see this film easily becoming a classic, along with the likes of The Big Lebowski and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Those films were received poorly at their release and have become ""cult"" classics, and I feel as we grow older and more nostalgic this film will become even more appreciated by us 20-somethings, and maybe even a new generation will find its ""retro old school-ness"" appealing."

We would also like to see if she was married or had children and if she is still alive. So far Wagon Train was the only show we have seen her on. Any reason why she quit acting again in 1968? Guess we'll look for her if we see any of the other TV shows or movies she might have been in.

There is so much weird stuff going on all throughout the movie, and you just sit there trying to take it all in. From the very beginning, where you had the Universal logo and music coming at you in 8-bit sound, that simply laid the line for what you were in for. A movie in the extremes. A movie that rocked. And a movie that will blow you away.<br/><br/>The story is good and fast paced, a weird, but sweet romantic tale, if you will. And you throw in a lot of, oddly enough, really cool fight scenes, cool CGI effects, quirky characters and lots of comedy, then you have ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" fairly much summarized. Plus there is a bunch of really, really cool cameo appearances. And you also have a good amount of fairly nice music. Not personally the type of music I listen to, but still, it worked very well for the movie.<br/><br/>I was laughing throughout the movie, especially at the scene where Knives came asking for Scott unannounced, and he jumped out the window. It was by far the best scene ever!<br/><br/>The cast in ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" is very good, lots of really awesome performances being put on here. And people portray their characters with passion and a lot of believability. And it is hard to say who stood out here, because everyone was really adding their own unique touch to the movie. And the cameo appearances also spice up the movie quite a lot.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a keeper for the DVD collection. And it is so far out there and bizarre that is most definitely have repeated watch-value. This is not the type of movie you just watch once and put it away, never to see it again.<br/><br/>I stumbled on this movie by sheer luck, and I am very grateful for having found and seen it.

","SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World, Oh a great movie tank on B.O because of its lead cast. That's just terribly sad. Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World is a totally different experience I ever had while watching a movie. It's hilarious and totally blows your mind. I think this movie could have been lot better if Michael Cera wouldn't have been in it that was not his movie role at all. I just can't believe how come Michael Cera can be a heart breaker? Look at his face C'mon. He wasn't even playing geek like all his other movies. It's not that I hate Michael Cera, I actually loved his previous work but watching him in movie like that was just bad, because with some new or other young guy, this movie could have touched skies and made Millions on Box Office. people are just fed of Michael Cera, playing same role and doing the same thing, it's like someone put him from Arrested Development in Super Bad, then transfer into Juno and other crap movies he did in between and then into Youth in Revolt (another good movie victim of Michael Cera's presence) and now Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World. The other miss cast of the movie was Marry Elizabeth Winstead, C'mon, I was against her ever since she got signed on, she is pretty but not drop dead gorgeous like it required in the movie plus she looks like mother to Micahel Cera in the bed room scene. Above all she has Zero chemistry with Michael Cera on screen. Two Wrong choices totally tank the movie. All the supporting cast is just simply Marvelous ""director got his casting 101% right here"". Kieran Culkin was outstanding and scene stealer as gay roommate of Michael Cera, he stole every single scene he was in it. Alsion pill, mark Webber and Johnny Simmons as entourage of Scott pilgrim did a fine job. Ellen Wong as the 17yrs old Scott's girl friend was amazing, how she transforms from innocent teen into jealous teen and then into the fighting teen was Amazing. Anna Kendrick was sharp and sweet. Brie Larson was really good as Envy Adams. Other stars who shine were Erik Kneudson, Ben Lewis, Nelson Franklin and Aubrey plaza. Now let's talk about the SEVEN Evil XXXXXXX and fights with them. 1. Satya Bhabha, the fight was simply incredible and here you realize that the whole movie is just like a game and the moment the other person gets defeated he will transfer into coins for Scott means more points. The whole fight was really intriguing though the Indian dancing and singing was little over the top. 2. Chris Evens, well Chris Evens is always incredible and it's so good to see him in new look and that heavy voice. His fight was really funny and amazing though it was hard to accept how Michael Cera beats his Seven Duplicates. Anyways he was the Hero so it happens! 3. Brandon Routh, Woww that was really Amazing, all Vegan thing, and firing Eyes was just incredible plus Brie Larson was also in this segment. The fight was really cool. I loved it. 4. Mae Withman, she was really spooky and her fight between Marry Elizabeth Winstead was freaking Awesome. (I still wished they had some other actors rather than Michael & Elizabeth). It would have been a Master piece. 5 & 6. Keito and Shota Saito as the Katayanagi Twins, that was simple Outstanding, you have to see the Musical Battle to know how incredible it looked on the Screen. Wow :-O 7. Jason Schwartzman was creepy and his fight was really cool but the thing I hated in the whole movie was that fight. Michael Cera Dies and comes back to life to use his last 1UP like in games, that was just too much, because till then we believed that its imaginative fights are replica of what we are watching means the exaggeration and then there is another Game ""Michael Cera's game replica"" in the end, that was another let down. If it would have been finish off as it was suppose to it could have been more incredible but still it's a movie that is nothing like you have seen before. A worthy of watching Again and Again! P.S Michael Cera did a good job in the movie but it's just we have seen hundred times doing him same acting."

Is there any films about youths today which do not dwell on homosexuality? There has been no serious debate upon this in society - just more or less tired acceptance of it all. Once it was forbidden, then it was suddenly wanted behavior and there was no debate in between. To be sure, at least so do I think, society should not interfere in what goes on between consenting adults. To love somebody of your own sex is always better than no love at all. Nobody should have to feel ashamed or miserable about it. But to have to propagate it like something desirable? I think that needs to be debated and this film does not do that. It just invites to swallow it all like all the other lies you are made to swallow. This is very tiring indeed."

That isn't to say it won't be enjoyed by people who don't fit this category - it's just that the writing aims and hits at that precise demographic.<br/><br/>For a movie that manages to be nerdy, trendy, absurd, hipster and even touching, the pacing and editing are spot on. Even Michael Cera's deadpan, which has been lacking in his last couple of films, will be sure make you laugh this time around (even the milieu of savvy video game/indie jokes should at least entertain the unfamiliar). I've never read the original comic book serial, but the paneling of the comics shines through magnificently in the screenplay with its overblown camera angles and graphics - it's the exact kind of thing that belongs in a comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>The setting is also a perfect world for the plot - the overblown story takes place in modest Toronto, though a Toronto where no one breaks the age 30 barrier and high school seems eons away. It plays the college mentality to perfection: your age group is the only group that matters, and you will live life by your own whims. I'm a bit worried this direct exclusion of age groups is a factor that will deter a large portion of the movie-going crowd. For that certain crowd, though, this movie is the perfect remedy for boredom and is a great cap-off to the summer."

","I can understand why no one saw this. It looked like another annoying teen comedy starring Michael Cera as himself for the umpteenth time. Not to mention, the movie is based on a not-too-well-known comic. I like independent comics, but I had never read Scott Pilgrim. So, yeah. It bombed.<br/><br/>Not to worry, though. Much like ""The Big Lebowski,"" this movie will one day rise up and receive all the love it so awesomely earned. This film may look like it's chock full of annoying pop culture references, but in actuality it will CREATE pop culture references. Look out for movies in the future that give a little wink to this one.<br/><br/>Why? Because it effing awesome, that's why! Never slows down, great cast, cool music, amazingly hilarious, highly original, and utterly badarse. Scott Pilgrim rules. And for the record, once you see it, you'll be quoting it for weeks because there aren't any bad lines of dialogue in the entire thing.<br/><br/>Prepare for Awesomeness!"

","Edgar wright makes a move to the Us with this adaptation of the cult comic book series of the same name, with an acquired taste latched on to it.<br/><br/>i can understand why this hasn't really hit the mark in the US, as it isn't your typical blockbuster, but a psychedelic trip the movie itself is.<br/><br/>Scott is in a band, and to cut a long story short, he falls for a girl and in order to date her, he has to defeat her seven evil exes in order to do so. In the form of some sort of video game/matrix/lightsaber duels.<br/><br/>Now the best thing about this film are the evil exes, each one having some great lines (or in the respect of two certain twins, great acoustics) and the set pieces for these respectful scenes are mind knowingly awesome.<br/><br/>As are a lot of the supporting characters, which seem to come right from the pages of ghost world.<br/><br/>Cera is good as the titular character, as is Winstead as Ramona, but the film would not have worked if it wasn't for the supporting cast.<br/><br/>They have a whale of a time spouting silly lines which are genuinely funny and endearing, and they all love Scott in their own special way. Wright does an amazing job with this movie, and he should, he knows popular trivia, and is a geek when it come to movies and video games (see spaced, Shaun, Hot Fuzz).<br/><br/>To be fair, I was seeing Pegg and Frost in the film as the two house mates for a little while, but then it drifted away just like this film drifted into some geeky drug fuelled video game heaven.<br/><br/>As I've said before, this will not be for all tastes, and i can understand why some people would hate this film.<br/><br/>It will divide people and become something of a cult in years to come, something i feel Wright was planning on.<br/><br/>Candy for the eyes, one up for the soul, bonus for the cinema-goer."
"Jules45","8","2","11","8 September 2010"," 'An epic of epic epicness' is another Edger epic experience.
","The familiar ingredients in this film are eminent. Love triangles, gay roommate, seven evil exes Whoa. Hold the phone, that doesn't sound like clichéd flop? That's because for the first time, in a very, very long time there is a romcom (with plenty of action, don't worry) which points its radar more to the boys than the girls – for once.<br/><br/>Hapless Scott already has a girlfriend: Knives Chau, but then falls for eccentric haired Ramona Flowers (Cheerleading Death Proofer'). This mushy mess gets even uglier when the infamous boyfriends start to appear – but in a cracking arcade style that will easily make geeks heads explode, though that will unlikely add anymore colour to the screen. If that still isn't enough for you, the screen is burdened with oldie-style Batman film jargon's; everything from 'Whip' to 'Plonk' to the 'Dddddddddd' of a guitar note. <br/><br/>Perfectionist Edgar has clearly exerted all his efforts into making a worthy third outing after Shaun of the Dead (his best) and Hot Fuzz (his newly instated third best after Pilgrim). True the script is barmy, but the wit is still pin-prick sharp and the momentous special effects give a gamers zest under the multitude of colour that isn't just Ramona's hair.<br/><br/>Surprisingly not in 3D and surprisingly/disappointingly lacking a bare minimum of a cameo from Frost and Pegg, but there is so many quotable characters and realistic scenarios in an unrealistic world you'll soon get past it."

"gigadragon12","7","2","11","6 September 2010"," Scott Pilgrim is a shiny tinfoil wrapping around a mediocre movie
","Well to be honest, Scott Pilgrim is a movie that completely confuses me. That's not to say I didn't get the movie or the story, I just don't understand what its doing or what effect its trying to have.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim v. The World is about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who is a Canadian punk rocker trying to break out with him band Sex Bob-omb. Shortly after the start of the film, Scott has a dream about Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) who then shows up to him in real life. Crushing big time, Scott maneuvers his way to win Ramona's heart, only to realize that he'll have to battle Ramona's seven evil ex's. Insert tons of video game references and implications and you have Scott Pilgrim.<br/><br/>Now as a huge gamer I'd like to say that Scott Pilgrim presents something wholly new to the spectrum of well entertainment in general. Most of the references to video games are the old school retro style platformers, either through music or the existence of life ups and points, but these really only exist as a backdrop to the whole thing. It could be a symbol of the immaturity in Scotts own mind as he battles to win the heart of the princess whom he dreams about, but the movie never directly points this out, or even embraces it. The lack of pointing it out of course doesn't mean that such implications do not exist, and indeed it is a great way of pointing out the simplified way that Scott's mind works, and may point to something in our own society, but again, the lack of direct influence of this way of thinking leads me to think that its nothing more than a shiny coating to what is really a very mediocre romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Now maybe you understand why I'm confused about this movie. I could get more in-depth about this way of thinking, or the symbolism or what a battle against seven evil ex's could mean in the age of today and how it reflects upon a boy who feels he has to prove himself to win the heart of a girl, but I also feel that by pointing this out Scott Pilgrim would simply give me a +10 points for missing out on what the movie was meant to be, mindless celebration of gaming through romantic storytelling.<br/><br/>So to sort of recap, Scott Pilgrim does things visually that make it seem spectacular and actually ties in tongue in cheek reference and examination to make it a major part of the point and the appeal. However, with what we were given in the film any of this ultimately plays out to the tune of a boy who wants to prove himself to a girl. No matter how epic the proportions, no matter how perfectly executed the marriage of gamer humor and reference is I find myself still looking at what ended up what I've said several times, a mediocre romantic comedy that didn't even provide much of a point.<br/><br/>So shoot me in the kneecap but Scott Pilgrim was only slightly better than most romantic comedies. Its probably worth seeing, movie or rental is your choice."
"goldwriting","10","2","11","25 August 2010"," Truly Hip to Be Square
","Could it really be possible? Could one movie company really release two movies in under two months deserving of my greatest accolade: a perfect score? I don't give them out easily, many times feeling at least one little thing was out of place or lacking in the overall composition of the film, but almost in back-to-back form Universal Studios has made their mark on the summer with the release of one of the most anticipated comic book adaptations of the summer (at least by a small group of fanboys and fangirls).<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World brings to life the tale of an adorably square hipster/bass player named Scott Pilgrim. While trying to mend his broken heart and shake his unwelcomed status of 'dump-ee', he dreams about a punk-chic on roller blades and his world trips down the rabbit hole when he finds that the dream girl is real. Compelled to court her, he discovers that to win her companionship he must defeat in battle her seven evil Ex's, each still equally enchanted and desperate for the love of this oddly endearing young girl.<br/><br/>While so many things came together in perfect harmony here, for the first time in a long while, first credit and top billing for the success needs to go to the man on top of the totem pole, director Edgar Wright. Erupting from the mind that brought us Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz (plus the equally amazing, but woefully less well-known, Spaced), Scott Pilgrim displays the same skill and amazing amounts of research into the genre, which helped transform his earlier efforts into trophy case pieces of what makes a great film. So many tiny moments, pixelated pop-ups and even audio reminders of the original Nintendo generation helped shape the universe of Pilgrim into one we not only believed in, but recognized from our youth. The tone, the atmosphere, even the overly romanticized quest, it all hearkens back to the roots of comic book caricature mixed with action hero devotion. Without diving into too much more detail and turning this into a novella of wonderment about Wright and his talents, I will just say that as the captain of this ship, he steered brilliantly and I would very much like to see him awarded for it, even if that seems unlikely (although with a 10 movie Best Picture category, it's not impossible).<br/><br/>Moving on to those lucky souls who got to inhabit these wonderful characters, it is a pantheon of young Hollywood elite who earn each and every second of their on-screen glory. Michael Cera, once dangerously on the verge of over-exposure and being perennially typecast, has surged back with his touchingly awkward, yet awesomely heroic rendition of the lead, Scott Pilgrim. This time Cera really feels like he is fully in touch with his capabilities and embraces the geek charm which many were beginning to feel was holding him back and turning him into a cultural antique before its time. What was also great is no one would really find a fight scene with Michael Cera truly believable in a normal world, but the world of Scott Pilgrim is legions away from normal. Blending comic book candor, anime stylings and 8-bit video game action gave Cera a universe he could truly become the nerd warrior of our fantasies. As the woman of his quirky and vivid dreams, Mary Elizabeth Winstead delights as Ramona Flowers, creating one of those tragically cute girls all men want to win and make happy for the rest of their days. She also tiptoes down that tightrope between confidence and cowardice, showing humanity in its most simple and pure form. Peppering the outskirts of this incredibly creative world, much can be said about the co-stars and side characters. Amazing on all counts, they helped firm up the reality of the world by embracing their individual quirks and all playing in that same wonderful tone. A special mention needs to go out to Kieran Culkin, who played Pilgrim's sexually voracious gay roommate. His darkly comic timing and constant calling of 'bullsh*t' to the rest of the characters helped keep the story from spiraling off into a cartoonish purgatory.<br/><br/>Anyone who owned the original Nintendo should love this film. This is made specifically for you. As for the rest of the world, there is heart and humor to be had, but it might get lost on you behind the screen of random quick edits and constant cultural in-jokes. It has not gotten its due in the box office, but I guarantee this will become a cult classic on the DVD market. I'm already dusting off a space on my shelf for it."

","An entertaining movie that can be interpreted as a biography of Chuck Norris in his early twenties. Presumably Chuck was taking lots of drugs at that time because if he saw this movie now he'd be thinking to himself ""Did that happen to me or did I dream it?"".<br/><br/>The unbridled machismo glimpsed in star Michael Cera's role in ""Juno"" is brought to fruition here. You really do believe that he is Chuck Norris...the pain...the rage...the dread that he will go berko on you...and maybe teabag you.<br/><br/>Speaking of Juno...if you thought that that could have been a really good movie...if it had kick-boxing, then this movie will be your cup of tea.<br/><br/>Anyway, in this movie Scott Pilgrim/young Chuck Norris is ""between jobs"" and spends his (nothing but) spare time in his band ""Sex Bob-Omb"", where he plays bass guitar. The more savvy reader will have noted the Buddhist chant pun in the band's name. This movie does have a lot of music in it. And it's interesting to listen to...sort of garage-punk. Beck Hansen wrote much of the music and it's fine in its own right.<br/><br/>So anyway, Scott/young Chuck has found himself a schoolgirl girlfriend, but complications ensue when he meets Ramona Flowers/young Edna Everage. Dilemma. If Scott/young Chuck want to be with Ramona/young Edna, he has to fight a series of ex-boyfriends of Ramona/young Edna. The fight scenes are modelled on video games and is where Scott/young Chuck gets to amp up the machismo and kick-boxing to 11.74.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are 'cute'...i.e. you might see one conversation between people played out in different places over different periods of time. It's sort of dream like in that way.<br/><br/>I'm not sure that this movie will have a lot of repeat viewing value in a short space of time, but it was entertaining first up and would be worth revisiting after a spell.<br/><br/>It's funny, cute and comically violent. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona really nails the Edna Everage look...when Edna was in her prime. And who knew young Chuck Norris wrote love songs and sang them to his woman...on acoustic guitar? Fans of Seinfeld might like this too...remember that episode where George plays Frogger for real? This movie is like that. And as in Seinfeld, you get a lot of fun peripheral characters...like Scott/young Chuck's gay room-mate."

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is an amusing adaptation of the graphic novel series written by Bryan Lee O'Malley. <br/><br/>With Michael Cera, the perpetual adolescent who is now 22 years old, the film has a made –to-order protagonist challenged by dream vision Ramona Flowers, a roller queen with a serious number of exes. 7 to be exact, that Scott must vanquish in order to win her. The video-game, comic-book foundation of this ultra-contemporary analysis of modern young love shows up in the graphic motif almost everywhere: in cloud-formation love expressions and starry explosions of knuckle fighting as well as victims turning into coins. <br/><br/>Anna Kendrick as Scott's sister and Kieran Culkin as his gay roommate give Cera the acting support necessary to make the film more than a visual virtuosity because it is really about the combat for true love, a never-ending battle."

"Generic_Gooner","7","2","12","23 September 2010"," Something very uniquely conceived, but still felt lacking
","OK, i may have built this film up too much in my mind having anticipated it since 2009. I wanted to be blown away by something that had all the elements i love in film and find myself lauding this as one of the films of the year.<br/><br/>But for some reason it didn't happen.<br/><br/>But there isn't a lot i can focus on as to why.<br/><br/>The film has a style and theme that although at times may borrow from other mediums feels distinctly original. It was slick, well acted and never tried to explain away things, instead letting us simply enjoy the madness of it all without giving us any answers as to why it was all so fantastical. This element alone made it enjoyable, but coupled with a very well crafted script and visuals that only served to enhance the mayhem, all the elements were seemingly in place. Even the hit and miss nature of Cera worked wonderfully in this lead role and if his niche is to play quirky and geeky then the comedy side of this suits him better.<br/><br/>But what i think was the problem is a sign of modern movie releases now. The hype. By the time a film hits the cinema we know pretty much every plot detail, and even the comical twist in this film (which i will not spoil for others, i will only say 'sexy phase' so when you see it you will know which part of the film i mean) had already been revealed.<br/><br/>OK, fans of the comic series will already know the story, but newcomers to Scott pilgrim would maybe like to feel that twist the same way the readers did when the comic was first released.<br/><br/>And the trailer itself along with lots of interviews and journalistic pieces on the film have only served to remove the shine on what could have been something quite fresh in a year of remakes and re-imaginings. And this also made the best comedy moments in the film feel like i was re-watching the film for a second time, thus the laughter value had been lost.<br/><br/>I know it seems like I'm complaining, but i think the fact i felt the film was an 8 after all these elements had been spoiled had me wondering what it could have been if the promotion of the film had stayed a little more cagey. I didn't expect 'inception' levels of secrecy, but at the same time when some of the best jokes are placed in a montaged trailer you do find that the audience will not react in the same way they should have hearing the jokes in context for the first time.<br/><br/>This is definitely a strong film from 2010, but if you had built up hopes of it being something special like i did, you might find that deflated feeling in the end."
"blacklist-1","9","2","12","2 September 2010"," Scott Pilgrim rocks the world!
","Scott Pilgrim vs the World is similar to Kick-Ass with references to the comic book world and the pacing and tone of the film where it takes you by the balls and goes on one heck of a roller-coaster ride and blows off any expectations you have of it. No doubt with the sequel of Kick-Ass 2: Balls to the Wall (A brilliant title if I might add) will produce the same hopefully. The one difference between Scott Pilgrim and Kick-Ass is that Pilgrim is more tame and not as violent and crude. But it is still excellent.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs the world won't be to everyone's taste as I found out when I took my fifty year old father to see it with me. Director Edgar Wright previously responsible for the hilarious Hot Fuzz with Simon Pegg and Shaun of the Dead (though I've never seen it). I believe he has specifically targeted a younger audience with this movie. It's highly unlikely (though not impossible) that anyone over thirty will enjoy it. And even then there are those who wouldn't enjoy this film as it won't be everyone's cup of tea, which is fair enough. But I did love this.<br/><br/>From the start it's clear to me that Wright goes for a more visual and style movie more than substance, but this isn't a bad thing. Comic strip words fly across the scene at different angles and speeds and makes the experience more vibrant. With that coming with the excellent action sequences makes it even more exhilarating. It's wacky, nuts and over the top, but it's so much fun, it left me on a buzz, Through the comic element of the film comes numerous references to the pop and rock culture and old computer video games. But also it's hilariously funny. Thanks to a good script, which has moments of wit. The comic timing with Micheal Cera as Scott and particularly his gay roommate Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin) is perfect, which brings me onto the acting. Micheal Cera makes a capable enough lead and he has a certain charm for the character. He even looks impressive when fighting Romana's evil ex's, but for some reason I couldn't help thinking he looked more fifteen than twenty two. The other actor who I really liked was Kieran Culkin. He gave for me the most and best laughs and Ellen Wong as Knives Chau who plays Scott's first girlfriend before he meets Romana was entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Initially some of the problems I had with this film and stopped short of giving it a ten for a start is Mary Elizabeth Winstead who played Romana, she was okay, but I just didn't like her performance much and she looked bored for most of this. Another problem is the lack of character development. I could never really believe that Scott really loved Romana. There isn't really much chemistry between them and the film fails to have an heart or charm when it comes to their relationship. I could see in a couple of moments between them that the movie tries to be touching, but it fails and just comes across as shallow. However they do look cute together so at least that is something. The story also is quite predictable where Scott has to defeat Romana's seven evil ex's in order to win her heart.<br/><br/>However I'm not going to put this down to much as I generally loved it overall. So much so I had the biggest grin on my face afterwards and it stayed on my face for so long I began to wonder if I would ever be able to change my facial expression. In the end Scott Pilgrim rocked my world and if your under thirty and want to see something wacky or have a fondness for the comic strip genre. You will love this. Scott Pilgrim vs the World is one of the most refreshing and original films to come out this year. An exhilarating blast."
"deastman_uk","6","2","12","30 August 2010"," Battle Royale
","To say the last ten years have brought forth many comic adaptations would be a daft understatement. With CGI coming of age, as well as the attention deficit generation, it made sense as a source.<br/><br/>But until recently, most adaptations were actually films. That is - you were watching a film of a comic. With Scott Pilgrim, you are watching something that is part film, part comic, part video game. The logic of the film is not entirely cinematic. If you don't read comics or play video games - you simply won't be able to progress to the next level. Even when the logic runs as a film, the genre keeps altering through rom-com to bollywood. The constant battleground is a post student McJob Toronto, with a sort of 90s view of geek rock.<br/><br/>While the plot is simply guy meets girl, guy loses girl, guy battles with mystic evil ex-boyfriends to the death, the film isn't too bothered whether the audience is involved or not. Cool and funny things happen, but it seems all a bit esoteric.<br/><br/>While much of the sensibility is Kevin Smith vs Douglas Coupland, and therefore pretty funny, I would expect that it will take a few more tries in this direction before a true classic emerges. But the attempts will be entertaining."

There was an introduction at the beginning of the movie that, if you heard closely, you could hear video game music playing on the background while the name cards for all the characters appeared next to them, it was a perfect way to make the ambient just like in a game. The video-game-like fighting style also added a lot more fun to those sequences, and the way it was choreographed blew me away.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. is a fun and silly movie that has a lot of heart put into it. I would recommend it to anyone that appreciates good editing and dialogs in movies as well as morally grey characters that get redeemed properly by the end. And, of course, an awesome soundtrack."

","I was very much looking forward to ""Scott Pilgrim"". It's set in my hometown, it stars Canadian actor Michael Cera, it was directed by the brilliant Edgar Wright who has made films that I absolutely adore like ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", and my college friends loved the comic book series.<br/><br/>But thirty minutes into it, it dawned on me that I just wasn't the demographic this movie was targeting. I'm in my late 20s, and this movie seems definitely geared toward people in their late teens to early 20s, as well as people of all ages who can't focus.<br/><br/>The storyline is not so much a storyline but a setup for the awesome special effects that pay homage to retro video games, Japanese animation and comic books. Scott Pilgrim, a bassist in his early 20s, meets a girl with wacky-colored hair who he falls head over heels for, but has to fight off her seven exes one after another before he can be with her. Let it be known that the special effects are VERY good and you'll see amusing sound and visual effects peppered throughout the entire movie that you'll be able to relate to if you've been even slightly interested in the things the film pays homage to. The film may not be much for your brain, but it definitely is a treat for your eyes.<br/><br/>But that might be the only thing that holds it up. I felt myself coming out of the movie several times due to the sloppy screenplay. Similarly, the characters were all cardboard cutouts that I didn't care about. Even if characters are one-dimensional, they can still be endearing. Here, not so much. Most of them randomly appear to throw out some quip for its own sake without adding anything to the film, and then vanish just as inexplicably as when they appeared. This in itself isn't a problem, but this device just keeps happening way after it's stopped being interesting.<br/><br/>I've never read the original comic, so something tells me my gripes with the film have everything to do with the fact that the source material just isn't that good. After seeing the film, I really can't imagine it being worth reading, since my main problem with the film was a lack of a story I could really grab onto. And really, unless you're a film student, isn't that what movies are for?<br/><br/>If you're under 25, chances are good that you'll enjoy this film, because I can definitely see why it'd be fun to watch some random battles with lots of sfx that hark back to Super Mario and Street Fighter days. But if that's all there is to it, then I'll just play the video games! It just felt so long for lacking so much substance. Lots of style, though, so kudos to that. An extra point for being set in Canada, too, but a glossy dud is still a dud."

","I absolutely adore this movie but it is to an acquired taste. I guess Micheal Cera, slacker culture and pop/geek culture references can be too much for people. I find Cera an excellent actor but a lot of people don't like the geek hipster character he always plays but GET OVER IT! for this gem of a film. It also is ridiculous in some scenes when crazy fantasy duels occur but it fits in perfectly if you appreciate the comic-book setting. The inbetweener going for the hot girl is most definitely overused in movies but this film makes a overused cliché enjoyable, especially when you stick in 7 evil exes. This film is really unique and will live in my blu-ray collection forever. For this film you either need to be a geek, a college student, a loner or able to take the jokes. This is immortalized in my top 5 for being a film you can watch over and over again. No seriously, three times in a week."

","As someone who has never played a video game ever I did not appreciate the use of video game sounds throughout this movie. I found it offensive to the vast majority of the public who have no idea what a Sega is and I would hope that those in charge will not make such a foolish decision ever again. This being said the music within the film was in my humble opinion +++, however I was concerned by the simple fact that the music was live, which creates a ridiculous risk, which for someone with my social anxiety resulted in a severe panic attack. Scott Pilgrim is renowned for being a stylish movie, but I felt the use of OST (On Screen Text) was gratuitous to the point of nausea (ad nauseum). When I watch a movie I do not want to read during it, if I wanted to read I would have stayed at home and read a comic book. However I suppose this is to be expected from a foreign film. My main concern for this film is the simple but downright disgusting use of strong violence throughout, with a strong basis in using cumbersome and unimaginative weaponry. Do you really need to dedicate an entire scene to a fight? What message is this sending out to the younger generations? I will tell you because that wasn't a rhetorical question. A BAD MESSAGE. Finally, I was pleased that the film came to a happy conclusion for all parties, but was surprised and a little shocked to find there was no intimate sex scene between the 2 protagonists (the girls), neither were even topless. I feel that I wasted £2.99 in purchasing this film from the Morrisons bargain bin and am disappointed in all who took part, apart from Toby Maguire who really rocked that last scene. <br/><br/>To conclude, not all that great but a little bit better than Debbie Does Dallas.

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is the old school video game and manga style live action story of an awkward twenty two year old Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who lives with his gay friend, Wallace (Kieran Culkin). He finds love in Not Kate Winslet from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But in order to win her heart he has to get through her eight ex's. Now I am not a Michael Cera fan so it was difficult going into this knowing he was the star. The only reason I wanted to see this movie was the high recommendations. My first impressions of this movie were that it's stylistically beautiful and imaginative. The humor meshes well with the characters and situations, and the plot was very old school video game inspired and worked in the live action setting. But on the other hand, Scott Pilgrim is a terrible person. He's a socially awkward fourteen year old stalker who throws away girlfriends like cheeseburger rappers. He hurts a girl who loves him, even though she's slightly crazy, for a more ""interesting"" looking girl. My hatred for this character made watching this movie very difficult because when Scott got beaten up I was cheering because he's way out of this girl's league. She is a vulnerable girl who is dating a spineless wimp. But what changed my mind was the ending where he defeats the final ex through the power of self confidence. And after he's won her heart, he realizes how much of a horrible human being he was. He matures and comes to terms with the fact that he has hurt his old girlfriends. And you realize that the reason Ramona dated him was because she ran away from her past, which was filled with ex's who treated her wrongly. She wanted somebody who was harmless. No matter who. But by the end she realizes that he really loves her and is willing to go the distance to protect her. He also mends his old girlfriend's wounds, and she forgives him. The movie as a whole is a feast for the eyes, but doesn't choose style over substance. It balances the two well."

Both the script and editing are very dynamic, because something happens all the time and we have some speed along the history.<br/><br/>It is a fun and entertaining movie, with characters that generate empathy with the viewer, as the search for love and fight for it is something that everyone passes.

","I think the people who reviewed this film negatively need to lighten up a bit. While this movie will probably not be remembered for decades to come as a pinnacle of film making (although with the internet's current obsession with it, I suppose anything is possible), it will leave you thoroughly entertained, and really what more can you ask from a movie? Michael Cera does a good job playing pretty much the same person Michael Cera plays in every movie he's in, except it feels way more at home in natural in a movie as amazingly weird as this. Kieran Culkin is incredible as Scott's gay roommate Wallace, and Jason Schwartzman is appropriately annoying as the main villain. Imagine the most insufferably arrogant hipster, and then multiply that by 10. You will laugh, you will gaze in amazement at the awesome fight scenes, and you will quote the movie for weeks on end, because this may be the most quotable movie of all time. So do yourself a favor and watch it. While history may not remember it, you certainly will."

","Scott Pilgrim is a geeky, slacker rocker. He has just broken up with his high school girlfriend Knives for a stunning beauty Ramona Flowers.

This movie is a wet dream come true for the fans of video games. The fights are beautifully choreographed and the viewer would find himself immersed in a game like experience with points being awarded for hits, the fighters getting extra lives for their acts and earning sword like weapons for love and self respect. Michael Cera mouths his one liners perfectly. Winstead as the object of his affection is stunningly beautiful. Kieran Culkin as Pilgrim's gay room partner is hilarious in some scenes. However, as I am not that big a gaming fan, I found myself disconnected from the movie in many instances. The exes are played by actors like Chris Evans, Brandon Routh etc who are big names and play absurd characters to perfection. If you are a gamer, then this becomes a must watch for you. If you are not much into the games, give this a miss. 3 out of 5."
"DanLives1980","9","1","4","20 January 2012"," To be with the girl of his dreams, shy and insecure bass guitarist Scott Pilgrim must defeat her seven evil ex boyfriends!
","The writer and director of classic television series 'Spaced' and comedy features 'Shaun of the Dead', 'Hot Fuzz' and 'Paul', Edgar Wright, has come a long way before making what is undeniably his first 100% original feature film.<br/><br/>I'm a fickle creature these days when it comes to mainstream film. It worries me when a film gets so much hype in America because so many average films get made out to be the biggest, bestest thing ever and then I regret parting with the remains of my own hard earned minimum-wage funding because I found it contrived, unsurprising and bland. So I usually wait a year or two, waiting for the noise to die down and then I watch it without preconceptions of what it's supposed to be.<br/><br/>'Scott Pilgrim...' is a curious creation. It's more original than anything I've seen come from across the Atlantic in a long time, yet as is typical of Wright, he immerses his vision in modern pop culture and the clichés that come with it, only more so than he's ever done before. The film is chock full of classic references though so it will keep mum and dad happy.<br/><br/>For those that don't know by now, Edgar Wright is English, yet this film is so American, I now understand why so many Edgar Wright fans were dismayed. But then so many more raved about it and I'm more inclined towards the latter since I do love American film when it's original.<br/><br/>'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is a confident and clever comedy boasting both conventional comedy perfected to a tee and unconventional and original comedy and storytelling. It's a clash of reality and fantasy based in the life of a shy, inexperienced and somewhat insecure bass guitarist only the rules of reality outside of the rules of conventional human drama are changed to that of side-scrolling and beat-em-up video games.<br/><br/>Suburban Toronto, Canada based Scott Pilgrim is a 22 year old seeing a potential psychotic stalker Chinese schoolgirl by the name of Knives Chau, without knowing exactly why, when he happens upon the girl of his dreams. Literally; he meets a girl in real life that he recognises from a dream he had the night before. Infatuated with her to the point of stalking her, the somehow legendary Ramona Flowers agrees to date Scott and they quickly warm to each other but then he finds out why so many of his friends know her name.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is soon forced to fight for Ramona Flowers' honour when one by one, her seven super-powered evil exes challenge him to a duel and only if he defeats them all will he get to keep dating the literal girl of his dreams. The story gradually takes on a concept all too familiar with fans of classic games such as Tekken, Street Fighter, Rock Band and even Super Mario as Pilgrim nears closer to his destiny but the strain of such new-found popularity and infamy by the side of his new girlfriend - especially since he hasn't officially dumped Knives for her - begins to put distance between the couple.<br/><br/>My greatest joy upon watching this film for the first time was its spontaneity and unpredictability. Just as soon as you think you're in the familiar territory of the situational American (I know the film's Canadian-based, just shut up) teen rom-com, you're proved wrong by some absurdly funny moments that get out of control, much to the viewer's by then deliriously tickled delight.<br/><br/>The seven evil exes are a fantastic group of characters, especially the cocky but dim action movie star played by Chris Evans and the spiritually superpowered egotistical vegan bass player played by ex-Superman Brandon Routh.<br/><br/>Not only that but there are some awesome cameo scenes provided by the likes of Thomas Jane and Clifton Gonzales. But the best support character has to be Scott's best/worst friend played by Kieran Culkin (yes, brother of Macauley), whose comedic delivery is just unexpectedly amazing.<br/><br/>Michael Cera is on top form as a lead actor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead just oozes character like so few young actresses, let alone the has-beens that refuse to leave Hollywood. And she still manages to be hot with the most bizarre hairstyle I've ever seen on a woman. How she does it is anyone's guess.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure that Edgar Wright will remain a comedy-drama writer and director in future but I'll regardless state in confidence that he'll be up there with the likes of Zack Snyder in a few years time if he continues to show the world just how lazy the majority of A-List producers and directors have truly become."
"kitchenaut-1","Null","1","4","28 October 2011"," A nice little comedy if it wasn't so insufferably postmodern
","Scott Pilgrim vs The World, which I hadn't seen until now, despite ravings from my fellow dweebs.<br/><br/>Firstly, i'm not a gamer, but I could appreciate the references from having played games on the SNES and Playstation As a film, I found the acting to be good, and Chris Evans, Thomas Jane (the 'vegan policeman') and Brandon Routh were all particularly funny, but overall the film was too dependent on self-conscious geek service and postmodern gimmickry to make it a truly decent film. If anything, many adults would've been distracted from the story by the constant smugness of the self-reflexivity- A girl's face becomes an emoticon, and a swearing character has a black 'censor' box over her mouth, only to be asked about it by the eponymous hero.<br/><br/>It sailed close to the wind with regards to acknowledging its roots in a comic and nearly fell to the same indulgent trap of pretentiousness as Sin City - over-stylised and overly reverential to the original format, thus appearing static and quite dull. As it is, it gets away with just being silly and playful, although the dialogue is of the egregious Whedon School of screen writing - flippant and far too studied to be believed; as if a single voice were engaged in a witty repartee with itself, as is usually the case with Tarantino, Whedon and the slew of imitators such as Orci and Kurtzman. I winced when the female drummer said 'Your bad was saying 'my Bad'', when that's the kind of dialogue the film uses throughout.<br/><br/>Overall, quite a mixed bag. 2.5/5"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","4","2 September 2011"," A flashy, fun and innovative cross-media film experience that will split opinion
","As I left ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"" a woman probably in her 40s or 50s exclaimed into her cell phone how it was the worst movie she's ever seen. I rather liked it, though I'm definitely 20-30 years younger than she. That kind of split is evident of only a few films in cinema history: those that are radical and progressive. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is both.<br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim,"" based on the comics by Bryan Lee O'Malley, marks the third major feature for director and co-writer Edgar Wright, whose ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" practically turned the definition of the word ""genre"" on its head. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is five times as ambitious, a psychedelic montage of hyper-pop culture, fusing together romance, three decades of video games, fantasy and alternative rock. Are Wright and Universal crazy or dead-on?<br/><br/>Our titular character, played by this generation's arguable embodiment in an actor, Michael Cera, is 22, lives in Toronto and plays bass in a band called Sex Bob-omb. He lives in his gay friend Wallace's (Kieran Culkin) apartment and doesn't pay rent and is easily smitten by ladyfolk. After dating a high schooler named Knives Chau for a little while, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) comes into his life. His desperate attempts to win her affections work, but she comes with baggage: seven evil ex-boyfriends (and yes, one girlfriend) who possess various powers and have formed a legion bent on killing him. He must defeat them all.<br/><br/>Welcome to the cutting-edge of contemporary entertainment. You can call the current youth the ""A.D.D. generation"" and it might well be justified, but ""Scott Pilgrim's"" flashy style-heavy approach isn't to compensate for young people's warped attention spans, but to embrace new forms of entertainment made possible by today's multitude of stimulation.<br/><br/>The film is foremost an homage to video game culture. If you love video games, ""Scott Pilgrim"" piles on the references from fighting games such as Tekken to bits from the Zelda games soundtrack. Scott's pick-up line to Ramona is about the origin of the name Pac-man. Wright's style draws on classic gaming imagery like low-bit CGI, comic book illustration, anime and more. Someone younger will gel with that, but someone older might find it total overload. If our normal, hum-drum lives took place in a world with video game or comic book rules, it would look like this for sure.<br/><br/>Fueling it all is a wild imagination: at one point Ramona pulls a giant Donkey Kong-sized sledgehammer out of her purse, echoing countless fantasy games where characters carry around weapons but you never see it on their person during gameplay until it's being used. One scene even spoofs Seinfeld and other notable sitcoms, when Scott comes back to his apartment and a laugh track accompanies his interplay with Wallace. The scene ends and no more sitcom references. That's how quickly scenes come and go. The transitions are abrupt, with scenes going from one place to another sometimes in seconds. There are no drawn-out dramatic conversations, just bursts and vital snippets with occasional graphics and unique style shots.<br/><br/>The style over substance argument reaches an interesting crossroads with ""Scott Pilgrim."" Although immensely fun and filled with wry humor and defied expectations, those who look for purpose in all the pop-up graphics and visual shenanigans will have trouble seeing the point in all this. There are times when the love triangle story between Scott, Ramona and Knives becomes lost in the video-game narrative of defeating the evil exes. ""Scott Pilgrim"" is a very good film not because it beautifully ties substance with schmaltz, but because it entertains in a fun, impressive and completely unique fashion.<br/><br/>This is easily the first film to recognize the effect of cross-media: how images, special effects and music all converge for our entertainment. For younger audiences, these multiple media are part of daily life. Sound and imagery are synonymous, whereas the film and music industries were miles apart decades ago. This has nothing to do with age, but young people can process so much more at once, which makes ""Scott Pilgrim's"" appeal fresh and new.<br/><br/>Those who prefer the cake over the icing will only be able to enjoy ""Scott Pilgrim"" to a point. But we're talking ground-breaking rainbow-colored frosting with sprinkles. No words can describe the kind of entertainment the film offers because it's just that new and fresh. All the way down to the film's openness with homo (and bi) sexuality as embodied by Culkin's excellent portrayal as Wallace, the movie is progressive and unconventional. There's certainly room to go up from here in terms of quality, but for now, the novelty of ""Scott Pilgrim"" and how in-tune it is with contemporary society warrants it much praise, even if it's not for everyone.<br/><br/>~Steven C"
"trentreid-1","8","3","23","16 August 2010"," Not Just Another ""Comic Book Movie""
","Does an unusually good job of not just retaining but enhancing period and place-specific pop culture references in adaptation to film. Wright's work has always shown such sensibilities, from TimeSplitters in SOTD to an entire episode of Spaced that references Resident Evil. But here it is enhanced visually by the pixel-jamming cinematography of Bill Pope and Brad Allan's martial choreography into something unique.<br/><br/>It is easily the most accurate ""comic book movie"" to date, but not in the sense of being slavishly faithful to its source. It does so in expressing stylistically the ability of sequential art to collapse time and space, forcing the viewer to make inferences beyond those implied by jump cuts. At the same time, the film captures the sense of immediacy and complete immersion into the dream logic of video games.<br/><br/>The references are extremely well integrated into the plot, with many foreshadowed by games characters play before they themselves act them out. From a ninja arcade cabinet game to Nintendo, Sega and Dreamcast home console titles. There are dance moves from Space Channel 5 in the Matthew Patel faceoff, opponents exploding into coins from countless brawlers, Ramona travelling through a Sub-space shortcut like in Mario, references to Zelda, Street Fighter, Double Dragon and Mortal Kombat franchises.<br/><br/>It also draws upon anime, with the art style from the comic appearing directly on screen at key moments, and an emphasis on establishing shots familiar to manga fans. At a key moment, the ability to manifest and draw a katana from one's chest appears, just like in Revolutionary Girl Utena.<br/><br/>Brad Allan from Jackie Chan's Sing Ga Ban brings a strong sense of video game rhythm to the fight scenes. They are tightly choreographed to often diegetic music by on stage band battles. Allan has Matthew Patel do a quick flash of Ken Lo's footwork snap from Drunken Master II, in a fun nod. And Wright casts the Miyoshi Brothers from Battle League Horumo as twins who synth-duel with Sex Bob-Omb.<br/><br/>****************SPOILER****ALERT********************* The films changes the ending and sequence of events from the comic, but in a manner I found more dramatic and fitting to the medium. Knives fights Flowers in Schwartzman's Chaos Club instead of the library, and the appearance of Nega Scott is resolved almost as soon as it happens. But it is all of the fine touches that Wright puts in that most accurately reflect those in the comic, while being done in a cinematic way more reminiscent of European art house film than Hollywood product.<br/><br/>Numerical, heart and ""x"" motifs run through the film, and Evans' Lucas Lee is used to more directly mock Hollywood action film conventions. Brad Allan, no stranger to stunt doubling, has the movie star Lee character's doppelgangers take on Pilgrim for him. This scene simultaneously mocks the substitution of Toronto for NYC in American productions, having them tear through a matte painting on a scrim.<br/><br/>By mocking the clichés of multiple forms of media and maintaining a specificity in terms of time, place and tone, this movie distinguishes itself clearly from not just other comic book adaptations - but the majority of literary ones as well. Of course, these same merits are likely to have it be dismissed from critical consideration. At least until those elements become nostalgic enough to be taken seriously, at which time younger audiences will have moved on."

Go watch it with an open mind and fall in love with it. i did, and can't wait for the blu-ray. I know many people hat Michael Cera and think he's a one trick pony. But I think he has a certain charm that could expand into a great actor. Not just him either, the rest of the cast is exceptional. I couldn't get enough of Kieran Culkin. If the Oscars were more open minded, this film would definitely be up for selection. Simply because of what i said before, its one of the better films of 2010."
"adrongardner","8","3","23","14 August 2010"," Short review
","I jumped to see this as a fan of Edgar Wright's other films. It's a sort of hit and miss, but worth the money overall. If you don't like the title, you'll probably hate the movie<br/><br/>The film is funny, good looking and pretty entertaining. Michael Cera is getting tiresome in the same old deadpan-single guy-lonely nerd role. I can't decide if Mary Elizabeth Winstead is good in the movie or, like Scott, we all just love her hipster, goth, punk hair. Kieran Culkin is the best actor in the movie as the gay-stalker roomie.<br/><br/>Despite being inundated by the special effects sequences - it's about 15 minutes too long - a pittance of character development, and the lack of some real heart, this is a good one. For the older crowd, Scott's battles are a reminder of a life you probably didn't want to remember and the best piece of ridiculous nonsense you'll see.<br/><br/>I'd pay to see it for the Vegan Police alone."
"keuhkokala","8","4","36","9 August 2010"," Young Hearts will Clash (at Demonhead)
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a quite good movie, despite it having to balance kick-ass over-the-top action, dry observational character-based comedy and a sweet, life-like romance. But director Edgar Wright has proved himself to be able to direct with a fast, music video -like style, of pretty normal and mundane things. He is also able to make symphatetic comedy characters that are properly fleshed out.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is based on a comic-book by Bryan Lee O'Malley. The titular character is a slacker in his early twenties. He's just met a new girlfriend, the 17-year-old Knives (Ellen Wong). He introduces her to punk music with his band, Sex Bob-Omb. But as their relationship progresses Scott grows anxious as he's dreaming about a mysterious woman on roller skates, Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). When he finally meets her, he decides that she is the woman of his dreams and gives everything to be with her. But besides having to break up with his prior girlfriend, this means he has to battle seven bitter old flames of Ramona.<br/><br/>The colorful imagery of the film is very comic book-like. Sound effects are displayed by text, split-screens resemble comic panels, the color scheme is bright and colorful etc. It owes also much to various video games (such as Street Fighter, Devil May Cry and Mortal Kombat) and to anime movies. It's worth noting that rather than copying O'Malley's style, Wright creates his own visual better suited for the film medium.<br/><br/>The OTT style represents on how the characters feel their (love) own lives are earth-shatteringly important. Characters can do basically anything: fly, make sonic blasts with guitars or turn people into quarters.<br/><br/>The editing is fast and furious. It is fitting that the soundtrack consists of fast and furious punk rock music as well. And it is very, very good, especially the songs by Beck.<br/><br/>The biggest strength of the film is the large cast of characters, all of which are well-written and believable in that universe. Wright has chosen his supporting cast well, as even with few lines, they bring out the fun and steal scenes. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are both good, but overshadowed by the supporting cast. However, their relationship works in the film too, and one can reflect one's own heartbreaks and loves on the screen. This is a feat only films that have characters one can truly identify with, can have.<br/><br/>The film is aimed for an audience from teens to mid-twenties (more if they are really childish). Many people older from that probably won't understand anything from the kinetic style, or have forgotten what it feels like to have heartache at this age. For us that do, and geek out over the stuff this references, this is warmly recommended.<br/><br/>Full review at http://fastmovieblog.blogspot.com/"

I got the impression the wave effect was as sort of 3-D mirage effect that was supposed to be like 3D concentric circles that obscure your line of vision. Kind of like the singularity of a black hole kind of thingy. The background was fading to black so this all comes across as intentional to me to show off the cool perceptual effects of Vegan Power. The girl in the background reappears as soon as Evil X number 3 throws Scott through the wall. I realize nitpickers are going to pick, but this movie likes the play with reality a LOT and I think the director and the effects guy deserves the benefit of the doubt on this one."
"joe_beck","8","1","5","3 September 2011"," A full-throttle, coming of age, arcade style beat em up...with more than a couple of laughs to boot!
","The film is a highly entertaining teen/early twenties kung-fu romance, which sees Brit comedy director Edgar Wright teaming up with American indie sensation Michael Cera in this action packed comedy.<br/><br/>The narrative progresses quickly after introducing Scott (Cera) and his pals, following the story of the young man's (surprisingly eventful) love life. He is soon infatuated with a cool chick, Kim Pine (Allison Phil) and sets out to gain her attention despite already having a high school girlfriend, and granting his up-and-coming band second fiddle to his new love interest. <br/><br/>There is much to be said of Scott Pilgrim's unique visual style and its quirky comic book and computer game references that build into the narrative, and add innovative layers onto the film's Toronto-set, music scene world. These touches certainly grant the film a unique, uber-modern quality. Combined with punchy, plot-progressive editing and a fun, quick-fire script that will remind Edgar Wright fans of his earlier hits (Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz), Scott Pilgrim skilfully uses both gaming and comic book culture to create a highly watchable, and at times very funny character driven filmic experience.<br/><br/>Cera puts in a fine, Cera-typical performance, doing what he seems to do best, (he will have both the unemployed and geeky kids aspiring to be him globally.) Yet Superbad and Juno fans may be shocked as he launches into action, dealing out spinning kicks and ass-whoopings like he's put in some serious hours preparing for this stumble-upon martial arts skills, fist-swinging-action role. There are other nicely drawn and well scripted characters such as Scott's groupie high-school girlfriend, lovable but none-the-less frightening knives Chau (Ellen Wong), and some particularly memorable ""evil ex"" boyfriends that Scott finds himself facing off against.<br/><br/>Praise aside, the film does seem overlong. Timing in at just under two hours, any longer and the rolling credits may have warranted a deep sigh of relief. However, for a film that was only ever going to end one way, and which almost exhausts its comic book-like onomatopoeic labellings, the movie is surprising, engaging and ten times more fun than two hours down an arcade bashing the buttons of a beat-em-up video game."

","A retelling of the Scott Pilgrim graphic novel, hits the big screen. At first, I thought the movie was going to be some random movie with weird elements. The strangest thing, I never even read the graphic novel. But when I started to know more about the story and its elements, that made me want to see it, and made me change my mind! The film tells the story of Scott Pilgrim, who falls in love with a mysterious girl, but he must fight for her love, by defeating all of her seven ex-boyfriends, ""The Evil X's"", to be exact! The film was an excellent piece about fighting for love, and the film was like playing a video game. The whole film had the neatest cast that includes Michael Cera, Anna Kendrick, Kieran Culkin, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, & Jason Schwartzman. Michael Cera made a funny performance in the title role, that made me laugh at times, and it was easy to cheer him on! Although sharing a pretty good chemistry with his co-star, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, this movie is more of a stylish action-comedy, than it is a romance. Also, the film had both awesome visual effects and amazing graphics that made the movie into a hand-held video game. Filled with stylish cinematography, and gorgeous editing, it's nearly impossible not to smile! Every scene is filled with such memorabilia to pay tribute to the many classic video games out there. You want find a movie like this anywhere else, I promise you that! Many elements of the storyline has it's own visual style, and it's really impressive! This film is one of the most awesome movies I had ever seen, and made me want to play more video games, or maybe not! This is a ridiculously enjoyable film that I hope I'll see again soon, and it's also one of the best movies of 2010. You don't have to be a video game fan to like this movie, this is also a tribute to those who are a fan of film. Go check it out, if you haven't seen it!

","Alternative, witty and hip, ""Scott Pilgrim vs the world"" is HUGELY entertaining. I snapped it up after reading the blurb on the front, 'From the makers of Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead'. While not quite in the league of the two British comedy classics, Scott Pilgrim has a charm all of it's own. While the too-cool-for school comic effects grate after a while and the Tarantino references become a bit wilted the charm lies in the cast and the acting. Indie darling Michael Cera is a hit in the title role with a fantastic supporting cast including the more talented Culkin sibling Kieran as the gay best-friend. He has some of the best lines in the movie and is absolutely hilarious. The female roles are well fleshed out for this type of movie and the girls kick butt in some of the funniest fight scenes ever. Some well-known faces makes an appearance too, such as Chris Evans (Fantastic Four, Cellular) in a hilarious role as a skate-boarding movie star and Brandon Routh (Superman, Chuck) as a Vegan with super-powers and Clifton Collins jnr (Crank) and Thomas Jane (The Punisher) in one of the films funniest scenes. <br/><br/>""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" is one of my favourite rom-coms ever, right up there with ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind""oddly the leading lady in both of these films have an unusual hair-dye. ;)"

","I've only seen the trailers but the movie didn't come out here, so I had to watch it on a flight to Tokyo. I honestly didn't expect anything, I just wanted to watch it because it seems funny. And it was. It was funnier than I thought it would be. The exaggerated, comical aspects of the movie were great, bringing a fresh outlook for Hollywood movies. I loved how the whole movie was so exaggerated, in an almost anime kind of way. The characters were different and not the usual characters you would see from any other movie, the graphics were great, the storyline was able to keep you sitting there, just waiting to guess what's going to happen next. I was sitting there on the airplane, watching this movie in the middle of the night, having to cover my mouth with my hands because I couldn't stop myself from laughing. Definitely a must-watch. No need to think hard, just enjoy the movie."

","Scott Pilgrim vs the World is by far one of the most enjoyable films of the year, if not ever. A truly unique experience with both gaming and comic book reference to treat the audience in all of their favorite games growing up.<br/><br/>It takes a little bit to pick up, but with each progressive evil ex, the movie really shines with each baddie bursting into coins, KOs on the screen, and point values appearing, it is a fun ride of 8-bit proportions. We've been waiting a long to time for them to get a video game movie right and Edgar Wright was the perfect director to deliver the goods.<br/><br/>Michael Cera, though in his usual character, fits perfectly in this role as Scott Pilgrim as we've never seen him take on the martial arts in such a fun fashion.<br/><br/>From Street Fighter to Zelda, this movie contains all of our favorite video game references growing up as children and will please all of those familiar with them.<br/><br/>Each ex adds a level of difficulty and never bores as each fight is different, from weapons to music to multiple battles, this movie has it all. Be sure to give this move a look if you love such a genre as this. You will not be disappointed. You'll want to bring your own control."

","After seeing this movie I just had to read all 6 volumes of the comic this movie is based on. I must say I liked the comic a bit more since the movie didn't have some of the good parts in the comic. But that is understandable and this movie really is a very good adaptation. This movie is very unique and really got the essence of the comic and the vibe as well. I heard Edgar Wright made a lot of effort and time in making this film and Bryan Lee O'Malley even pitched in and helped with certain scenes and it was worth the effort and time. I personally think to get the most out of this movie, watch this movie first before reading the comic. Although, like I said the comic seemed to be a bit better but the movie does things in a way where some of the witty dialogue and direction that isn't in the comic gives a lot of flare to this movie. Maybe it's just the slightly different approach in certain angles and parts of the film, the humor in this is done better than the comic itself. This is probably one of the best video game style movie I have ever seen and it's not even based on a real video game although that game after the movie. Edgar Wright did a fantastic job with this movie and hit the mark almost entirely. Fans of the comic this movie is based on won't be disappointed, it might even surpass most people's expectations. Sometimes pop culture references doesn't work in movies sometimes but it worked just fine in this one, especially about the way certain group of people dress, mainly hipsters. The constant things happening in the background was interesting as well, even if it was random or didn't make much sense. My favorite Ex's out of the seven Scott has to fight is the two superheroes, Superman and Captain America...Yeah it's a lame joke but those two actors was very entertaining to watch and seemed to be enjoying themselves. What is really shocking is how this movie has like seven villains in one movie but it still works really well and doesn't fall short of almost anything. I think this 2 movies might have worked better in order to get more of the stuff in the comics in movie form. Like the first movie would be called ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" and the second movie to end it all be called ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the Universe"". Anyways overall this is one of the best movies of 2010 and is highly worth checking out.<br/><br/>8.6/10"

There is this line with the ""L"" word, and a subsequent reference to it, that make me laugh so hard!

","¨Every Pilgrim reaches the end of its journeysome sooner than others.¨ I can guarantee you one thing about Scott Pilgrim vs. the World: It is like no other film you have seen in 2010. You might love it or hate it, but it definitely won't be for its lack of originality. What some viewers may find off-putting are the eye-candy arcade style visuals, which I really enjoyed and found original. I completely loved this movie and was rooting for Scott Pilgrim all the way. This film is as close as anyone will get at adapting a graphic novel. Some scenes felt as if I were passing the pages of the comic book itself since it was full of texts throughout the action sequences (Zombieland tried this successfully last year as well). British director, Edgar Wright (of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz fame), successfully adapted the screenplay along with Michael Bacall, in order to bring Brian Lee O'Malley's graphic novel to the big screen. The visuals, the action sequences, and the soundtrack are all highly entertaining, but what I really enjoyed the most in this film were the characters. The film moves at a really fast pace and it is surprising how much stuff they get into this movie in only two hours. It brought me so many different sensations at the same time: I felt like I was playing an arcade game, watching a live concert, and reading a graphic novel all at once. There are so many talented actors as well, but I will get into that in the next paragraph. All I can say is that director Edgar Wright keeps on demonstrating that he can make highly entertaining and fun films one after another, and isn't afraid of taking risks. He always goes all in and pushes the boundaries of filmmaking.<br/><br/>For those of you who aren't familiar with the graphic novel I will introduce you briefly to the plot and characters. Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a twenty-two year old who is in between jobs at the moment, living with his gay roommate, Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and currently dating a seventeen year old named Knives (Ellen Wong). She is slowly becoming obsessed with him, but he seems to be enjoying her company as they hang out mostly in the arcades. Scott is also the bass player for a small band called Sex Bob-Omb along with Kim (Alison Pill), Stephen (Mark Webber), and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons). Scott is still trying to get over the girl that broke his heart, Envy Adams (Brie Larson), who has now become a famous pop star. It has been a year since he was dumped, but now things begin to be looking all right for Scott and his relationship with Knives. That is until Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) shows up and Scott falls head over heels for her. Ramona is the girl of his dreams and it is love at first sight for Scott Pilgrim. She doesn't seem to be interested in him at first, but Scott manages to get a date with her and she gives him a chance. The only problem is that Ramona comes with some heavy baggage and in order to date her he will have to defeat her seven evil ex lovers: Matthew (Satya Bhabha), Lucas (Chris Evans), Roxy (Mae Whitman), Todd (Brandon Routh), the Katayanagi twins (Shota Saito and Keita Saitou), and Gideon (Jason Schwartzman). To make matters worse he also has to face Knives and let her know that he is in love with someone else.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely amazing. Michael Cera is great in the lead role and he plays his usual self although this time around he can fight really well. He has to face two ex superheroes: Superman (Brandon Routh) and the Human Torch (Chris Evans), who actually have pretty funny and entertaining scenes. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is gorgeous in this movie and it's also love at first sight with her. Jason Schwartzman is always entertaining too watch as well. However the person who really steals every scene he's in actually is Kieran Culkin who gives a terrific and funny performance as Wallace. I really fell in love with these characters and with the movie as well. The dialogue is very witty and funny, the visuals are stunning and really fast paced, the soundtrack is incredible, and I really loved the video game effects introduced in the movie. The story also served as a metaphor for love. Just like Scott we too have to face the evil exes of the person we love if we want to win their heart. If we can't manage to make them forget about their past they will never want to move on with you. I thought it was an interesting metaphor anyways. It's not a film you can take seriously, but it is one of the reasons why we love to go to the movies: Its pure fun and entertaining.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World got a lot of hype, luckily enough, it lived up to my expectations, and than some. Other then the fact that this movie is just plain cool, it is in fact genius, or should I say, the director Edgar Wright is a genius. He is also, the king of spoof. Wright is the only director out there today who seems to actually understand what a spoof movie is. In today's world of Scary Movie 4 and Meet the Spartans, it's nice to know that I'll have something to get out of bed for. It's a fun, funny, unique and an interesting look at love and how the past affects the future. Wright was able to capture the essence of all 6 books and turn it into the best cinematic adventure of the summer. Using the style of the modern musical, using the moment when the characters would usually break into song and dance and instead having them break into a fight. Edgar Wright's dizzying cinematic style, never misses a beat, dripping with deadpan humor and break out stars. Michael Cera, being surprisingly un-Michael Cera-y, Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the perfect dream girl, with Ellen Wong, Anna Kendrick, Brie Larson, and the list goes on and on. The person that I found particularly surprising however, Kieran Culkin. Kieran Culkin, as the cool gay roommate, a scene-stealer? Who knew? For those of you who didn't like this movie, you either A) didn't understand it or B) never actually saw it. So here it is, even if you didn't understand this movie, maybe you could at least appreciate its unique charm. You don't have to see Scott Pilgrim the way that I do, but I do, however, insist that you all give him a chance. I mean, he's Scott Pilgrim."

","Based on Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novel series 'Scott Pilgrim', Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a surprisingly great teen-angst fantasy as you get to watch an almost live action computer game take place before your eyes. Geek, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) must defeat his new girlfriend's (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of Die Hard 4.0) seven evil exes in order to win her heart.<br/><br/>Packed with famous faces, game references, kung-fu action, Street Fighter-like stand offs and a pumping soundtrack, Brit' director Edgar Wright pushes the visual envelope while keeping it mostly reality based with everyday locations. <br/><br/>It's heroic enjoyment that is difficult to categorise, a hybrid of mix of Super Mario Bros.(1993), DOA: Dead or Alive coupled (2006), Mortal Kombat (1995) with The Matrix's (1999) fight scene excitement and American Pie's (1999), Road Trip (2000) humour. This with the teenage coming of age theme, first love etc running through it. It's also reminiscent of Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) and Disturbia (2007).<br/><br/>Pilgrim is developed popcorn fun that gamers and teenagers will eat up, but it's also witty and slick enough to be enjoyed by all.<br/><br/>Michael Bacall's screenplay & director/ writer Wright's latest offering will become a re-watchable, quoted guilty pleasure for many."
"RCWjr","7","1","6","1 January 2011"," Appreciation depended on Cerra
","This was the year that we saw several little known comics made into films. Kick-Ass was the first out of the gate and in my opinion, the best. We were then given this film, Scott Pilgrim, directed by Edgar Wright. The biggest difference between the two films is your enjoyment of Scott Pilgrim is far more dependent on your tolerance/enjoyment of several elements.<br/><br/>Firstly, you must be a fan of Michael Cerra. With Scott Pilgrim he continues the same shtick that he has presented in pretty much all of his roles to date. I personally have grown tired of that shtick. He doesn't ruin the film for me, but my weariness of his seemingly limited range kept me from fully appreciating the film.<br/><br/>Second, you need to have a frame of reference when it comes to video games. The film, as is the comic, resides in the world of video game reference. I personally enjoyed the continual video game style of story presentation, however this is not going to be something the general movie audience will appreciate.<br/><br/>Third, you need to be a fan of Edgar Wright's direction and story telling skills. Personally, I love Wright's direction and story telling skills. Were this film directed by anyone else, I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. Wright's quick cuts that he is known for do overstay their welcome as the film is done almost entirely through quick cuts and that can be jarring.<br/><br/>My biggest issue with the film is Cerra. He is still playing the same character that he has played in previous films. Why that is a problem here is that compared to Ramona's previous ex-boyfriends, you have to scratch your head as to what there is about Cerra's Pilgrim that would attract her to him. This believability is a very high hurdle to get past, especially if you are not a Cerra fan. I don't hate the guy, I just think this film would have been better served with a lead who actually looked the part. What hurts the casting of Cerra in the lead role is he pales in comparison to Ramona's, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, ex-boyfriends. The boyfriends, played by Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, etc, look like they would be someone Ramona would go after. Cerra's Pilgrim has nothing in comparison to offer. Ultimately, I found myself not pulling for Cerra and Winstead to get together, rather, for Cerra and his dumped girlfriend, Knives Chau played by Ellen Wong, to stay together. This is a major issue with the story as we are supposed to be pulling for Scott and Ramona to be together.<br/><br/>All of the supporting characters are wonderfully brought to life. It is the supporting characters, action and Edgar Wrights direction that ultimately pull this up to a 7 for me. It is Cerra's casting that reduces this film's rating. Again, I don't want to come off as a Cerra hater, I just think his continued reliance on the same mannerisms, voice inflection and his overall physical inadequacies, make his Scott Pilgrim not reflective of the Pilgrim from the comic. Or for that matter, a hero lead that is believable."
"NJMoon","7","1","6","11 December 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs My Patience
","I loved the first 1/3 of this film. Meeting Scott and his off-beat pals thru a skewered lens set to comic book crazy. This unique visual take on the rom com is courtesy of game boy but didn't lose its sense of fun and reality: These characters are not so far off as to be unreal. Cera and company are (at core) really likable and I would have liked the whole film to stay firmly rooted in Scott's romantic ambitions. And there's enough inside humor to keep the non-game playing public amused as well. But the film's lengthy plot about conquering seven evil exes just got tiresome and frenetic. I could have done with several fewer exes and more about the core cast. Maybe a ""Scott Pilgrim"" TV series would solve that problem? Maybe."
"pablobg","8","1","6","23 November 2010"," A treat for the Nintendo-generation
","It wouldn't be fair to judge a movie like this by conventional cinematic standards. Or maybe not- it would still fair okay. The thing is that this movie is tailored to the ones that grew on Nintendo, internet and probably don't care about anything else. So it isn't hard to realize why some other people didn't like this movie. Some reviewer said that this was a prime example of ""attention-deficit filmmaking""- and it sure is, and it's great. The editing reflects clearly this trait- in less than a minute it goes to three or four different locations. It's fast, and it's fun.<br/><br/>The movie has a very original presentation, filled with comic-inspired graphics and eye-candy. It has very bright colors and it is just nice to see. The video game-inspired humor and general nonsense are backed up by lots of computer-generated effects and comic-like text that is hilarious from time to time. Again, for the ones that we played all this games, it's really fun to see how the movie makes fun of the games (and gamers) clichés. I mean, even the movie's premise falls into this grounds.<br/><br/>So, the movie itself may have a nonsense story and doesn't take itself serious at all. But it really works. Not for everyone, but it does. It's fun, but it won't change your life (if it does, then you really need to stop playing games and watch more good movies). Then again, is a must-see for the viewers that the movie appeals to."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","6","23 November 2010"," Scott Pilgrim vs. Seven Exes
","Edgar Wright comes back with a bang with his first American movie which is none other than 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'. Wright has proved his love for comic books and movies in his earlier excellent works like 'Spaced', 'Shaun of the Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'. I haven't read the original Scoot Pilgrim comic series (I've been meaning to) but as a stand alone it works fantastically.<br/><br/>Stylish, colourful, energetic, classy and loaded with fun and action, there's hardly anything like 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World'. The story is quite silly and even absurd at times but there is plenty to like and it's funny as hell. It has a very comic book/ manga feel to it and even though similar style has been witnessed in other films, Wright gives his own unique touch.<br/><br/>I was also surprised to see how he managed to assemble so many popular young actors like Michael Cera, Jason Schwartmann, Allison Pill, Johnny Simmons, Brie Larson, Anna Kendrick, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans, Brandon Routh... and the list continues. The acting overall is very good. Michael Cera's Pilgrim has shades of characters he's played earlier but I can't picture anyone else do more right by the part. Ellen Wong and Mary Elizabeth Winstead fit their parts brilliantly.<br/><br/>Fans of Edgar Wright shouldn't expect this to be anything like his previous films because it's not. 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' is one of the most refreshing films to come out this year and it can be enjoyed by anyone with an open mind."

"bennet-battle","10","1","7","24 July 2011"," Why I loved it and others might hate it
","Mostly it's style is different because of the comic series it was based on. I usually get irritated with most new movies, and I really didn't think I'd like this movie at all. I caught a piece of it, and loved it. As I watch more, it seems to be growing on me. <br/><br/>I think this movie is for anyone tired of repetitive movie love-stories, or any of the movies that basically tell this same story but in a very different way. <br/><br/>Best way to broadly describe this movie is that it is your traditional boy meets girl but instead of showing a couple arguing about each other's baggage the movie shows these emotional conflicts and thoughts in a visceral way. The fighting is symbolic of the emotional struggles to conquer the confidence people use to feel strong about themselves to knock you down and dispose of you. It is about battling your own ego, and everyone else's. Instead of battling Ramona's baggage in her mind, Scott is literally fighting her baggage to stay alive as the nice guy he wants to be for himself, and for her. His own ego, and the expectations of the man he wants to be for her, and for himself is his biggest conflict. Very original style on the traditional love-story. <br/><br/>Some people are not going to get this movie because it really demands that a person step out of the traditional narrative formulas we've all become so accustomed to, and to use your imagination. The pacing is very fast, and you really have to pay attention to even some of the smallest of subtleties. Some parts of the movie parodies itself as a hero story. Most people bored with traditional story narrative formulas will most likely love this film. Others that don't think much about story structuring might hate it. The film demands that you use your imagination to understand the context of what it is really trying to say about people's egos, and what people use to feel socially confident about themselves."

","I hate Michael Cera. Didn't like him when I first saw him in Arrested Development don't like him years later as the same character. I do like the concept of this film where romance is fought for while therein lies the guise of visual video game references.<br/><br/>However, the chick he's fighting for is distant and a bit of a bitch/slut. Who the hell dates twins? And Michael's character is a bit douch-ey, juggling between girls and being all emo all the while.<br/><br/>If it were n0t for the main characters, I think I would have gotten a kick out of this movie. The side characters were awesome and very likable, but they didn't have as much screen time as I would have liked. Therefore, it sucked because while I was watching Michael Cera pine over another indie chick who dies her hair at whim, I was hoping and wishing for his roommate and his band mates to show up.<br/><br/>I do however, recommend it for kids. The beginning is boring for them, but if you get them past that, they will sit down and watch.<br/><br/>Lastly, I DO NOT understand why all the critics are googoo gaga over this film. It's nothing innovative and a lot of things are unexplained Like Ramona's appeal and Michael's ability to kick ass. And it's entertainment value is only redeemed by the minor characters who deserve more time on screen and the funny way of filming things.<br/><br/>Fart, poop, that's all I have to say.<br/><br/>(side note: Soundtrack is pretty fun)<br/><br/>Watched it 2nd time: However, even with all that said, this movie is based on a graphic novel/comic book or whatever the correct term is for it. So with that in mind, I may have exaggerated the severity of the lack of entertainment. I think my bias against Michael Cera didn't help my review of this movie whatsoever. Upon second watching, it's actually quite entertaining and smart. BLAH."
"flumswack","Null","1","8","10 March 2018"," PLEASE PULL YOUR HEAD OUT YOUR ASS.
","I hate this film. I love the books, I love the director, but I hate the film.<br/><br/>The style of the books was used to express Scott Pilgrim's quote unquote ""Precious Little Life."" All the video game references, surreal yet intimate imagery and sometimes fluctuating pace were all extensions of the character Scott. He was kinda awkward, kinda funny, kinda nerdy, kinda sweet, and kinda asocial yet kinda social. (The books are inspired by the song Scott Pilgrim by Plumtree, which is a pretty nice and sweet song).<br/><br/>The book's style is as ""precious"" as Scott Pilgrim himself. So it pisses me off to see the film butcher it entirely.<br/><br/>The film's style is SELF-INDULGENT. It does things that aren't even neccessary and tell us nothing about the characters, like having comic book style onomatopoeia spring on the screen when a sound effect plays. WHY? It's like a hipster grabbing you by the ears and screaming in your face ""I'm really clever and funny!""<br/><br/>The characters in this film are DEAD. I do not like Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim. Such a rich character is reduced to a basic pale-faced pathetic little weeb as one-dimensional as the line ""hey Wallace."" Scott was pathetic in the books, but he had potential. This was what the whole series was rooted around: potential. <br/><br/>All characters in this film are dull. Not one stands out as entertaining. Well, I guess the actress playing Stills' bitchy girlfriend is convincingly bitchy.<br/><br/>The depression Scott goes through towards the end of the saga - from it's heart-wrenching introduction at the end of the fivth book, to it's equally emotional conclusion halfway through the second - is reduced to another forced ""problem"" for a processed third act that needs to be ""resolved"".<br/><br/>The books were, above all, real. The crazy style was spun from its REAL heart. The film just wants to show off."
"tributarystu","9","1","9","3 November 2010"," A Matter of Experience
","I reckon this has to be a polarizing film, seeing how Wright chooses to make sure there is very little middle ground to tread on. But, hey, I love polarizing films as long as I'm on the right side of polarization.<br/><br/>Rarely have I enjoyed a film experience so much as I enjoyed this one, thanks mainly to the excellent blend of fantasy, adventure and...realism. It covers the essential basis of tangency and then takes you through a fantastic journey of self-discovery and bemused romance. Particularly if you're transitioning from teenage-hood to adulthood, when the ""real world"" starts catching up with you really fast, this is something that allows you to take your mind off things, to find refuge in a faithfully familiar place.<br/><br/>The story of Scott Pilgrim, our oh-so-subtly named protagonist (like so many other characters, actually), describes a fairly restless and isolated guy, who happens to fall in love with the girl of his dreams. Literally, as she turns out to be very much alive and kicking. Yet, everything about her is dreamlike, from the snow melting under her roller blades to her eccentric way of being and becoming. As with every fantasy world, there are a few obstacles involved in conquering the fair lady, in this case manifested through the presence of seven evil exes that need to be defeated. So Scott has to get through this series of challenges in arcade style match-ups, as if it were that simple to get what you've always dreamed of. Can't say though that the thought never crossed my mind.<br/><br/>The film's comic sense is sometimes ridiculous, but it always seemed fulfilling. Regarding the actors, Michael Cera is enjoyable, even though I'd say Kieran Culkin was the more delightful actor to watch - or Ellen Wong, who portrayed her character in a virtuous Japanese anime style. Clearly however, a dreamlike central figure like Mary Elizabeth Winstead was essential to the well-being of Scott Pilgrim and I reckon she was an excellent choice, even without needing to do too much to affirm herself.<br/><br/>Ultimately the film captures the spirit it is trying to convey so very well, that spirit of a naive and noisy youth, filled with cultural and pseudo-cultural pillars of reference. If you can resonate with this (as I assume anyone who still has some vague memory of teenage years can), with all that is implied by the bizarre and childish world it creates, then this has to be an experience worth trying out."

","I have had the pleasure of watching the best movie ever made. I can now die happy. ""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" is by far the best movie ever to rear its head in modern society. It has everything; The action tensed my very soul, the comedy is classic Michael Cera, and the love is typically youngster. I loved every single minute of it and when I watch it again, I will not take my eyes off the screen for a split second.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim has to fight the 7 Xs of the love of his life... or is she?... Michael Cera almost had it with Superbad, but this takes the cake. ""Scott Pilgrim versus the World"" will probably always be my favourite move of all time; NO CONTEST!<br/><br/>I have had the pleasure of watching the best movie ever made!!! FOR REAL!!!!!! To every movie to ever come out in the future: GAME OVER!!!! ;-)"

","This film is entirely ingenious, brilliant, and captivating. It is enticing and enjoyable, completely out of the ordinary and a refreshing change to the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>Every actor in this film excels, they immerse you in the realism of such a surreal film, alongside the amazing direction and special effects. The added annotations/captions are creative and the storyline is completely out of this world.<br/><br/>Although the storyline might seem straightforward, the way the film plays out and the change of scenes are so captivating, you'll be amazed, astonished, and yearning for more.<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy this film, I don't know what you would enjoy. This film is on-par with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang for me, both of which were refreshing and creative, with comedy both small and large. This film is more of a video game, which in itself might seem lame, but the blending of a film-like video game is astonishing.<br/><br/>Enjoy this film, it's definitely worth watching for years to come, just try and find ways to enjoy it, such as Friday night with friends and popcorn."
"doctorsmoothlove","7","1","9","19 September 2010"," The People vs. Michael Cera
","During the period of time between the release of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, I called the former the best film adapted from a video game. I will stand by that claim. But now, it's ironic to think that the current best video game film isn't an adaptation of any individual one. Scott Pilgrim is actually a comic book movie with numerous stylistic references to video games.<br/><br/>The movie works because the comic is also heavily influenced by game culture, and this was invaluable in helping bridge the severe medium gap between game and film. Despite their shared visual aesthetic, games have more in common with novels than films. Think, for a moment, about the fantasy films you enjoy. Excluding some animated productions, live-action films are set within the laws of physics and follow established cinematic storytelling methods. Characters simply do not appear out of thin air and they usually do not have another chance to experience a plot point again. Games have the option of being liberated of such burdensome reality. Both of these happen within this film, and I would probably not have enjoyed it (at all) had it not been an experiment in creating a proper video game setup within a feature film.<br/><br/>The title character (played perfectly by Michael Cera) is an early 20's something self-proclaimed loser living in Toronto with his comic-relief hypersexual gay best friend. Scott doesn't have his luck and has resorted to dating a high school student. Their ""dates"" mostly involve her coming over and watching him practice with his garage band, Sex Bob-omb.<br/><br/>Scott soon meets the girl of his dreams (literally). At a party he sees her and sets up a date. The girl is named Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and was using his dreams as a shortcut to get from place to place. They go back to her house and don't have sex, much to Scott's disappointment. The next day he asks her if they are dating, and she agrees that they are. Scott receives an email from somebody saying that he will soon show up to ""challenge"" him. At a band concert, Scott is interrupted by the man in the email, Matthew Patel, whom he beats up.<br/><br/>Ramona reveals that her prospective boyfriends or girlfriends will have to defeat the league of Seven Evil Exs of which Patel is a member. As long as Scott wants to date her, he will have to defeat each of them in combat. He does just that throughout the course of the film, taking care of each in a unique way. These battles are highly stylized, like what you would see in a Stephen Chow film. The film pits Scott against a diverse group of antagonists that are afflicted by strange vulnerabilities. One of them is a vegan who is undone by a helping of milk.<br/><br/>The movie runs out of gas by the ending, even for those open-minded enough to enjoy it. It's another example of the hipster dialog exhaustion problem; first pioneered by Cera's other great film Juno. Even I was tired by the final boss. Yet, I'm happy to say this is the first time I've seen a video game movie that was created by people who really understand the way people enjoy experiencing games.<br/><br/>Recommended 39th of 2010"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","10","5 February 2011"," Two Great Leads Make the Film
","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Trying to get over a girl dumping him, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) dumps his teenage girlfriend in order to go out with the beautiful Ramona Flowers (Mary Winstead). Scott quickly falls in love with her but learns that he must destroy her seven evil ex-boyfriends before he can fully have her. I'm going to be incredibly honest upfront and admit that this movie simply wasn't for me. I'm not a gamer. I'm not into comics. There's really nothing in this film that I'm into so it's easy to see why my biggest problem was connecting with the film. There's no question that it features some very good performance, the direction is very good and the visual style is wonderful but at the end of the day you must connect with a film and I simply didn't do that here. As I said, there are a lot of very good things in this movie and I especially liked the cast. Cera is the most unlikely superhero in the history of superheroes but he perfectly sells the character and makes you like and care for him. I thought that shyness he uses early on with the girls was quite charming and I thought he made himself believable once the action started. Winstead clearly steals the film as Ramona since she's certainly easy on the eyes and she comes across so lovable that you can't help but think anyone would be willing to fight seven ex-boyfriends to get with her. The supporting players include a nice performance by Kieran Culkin as Cera's gay roommate and I really enjoyed Ellen Wong as the teenage girlfriend. There were a couple classic moments and one comes when both girlfriends show up at a concert to see Scott and the way the connection is shown between the three characters was simply priceless. Another terrific spoof is when Scott must fight one of th ex's who just happens to be a famous action star now. Throughout the movie there are graphics shown on screen just like you'd see in a comic book and many of them were rather smart and funny. After saying all these positive things you'd expect to see a higher rating but this film simply wasn't made for me. If you're a fan of anything that happens in this film (games, comics) or you're familiar with the graphic novels then I'm sure you'd see this as a masterpiece. As for me, it was just way too long for my liking, although I can at least admire what they were going for."
"oporachel","8","1","10","29 August 2010"," Awesome!
","Wow! This movie was amazing! With the decades current trend of turning comic books into feature films, there are many different interpretations and ways to present an already visualized story. Even though I haven't read most of the comics, I must say this adaptation has been one of my favorites! I loved the choice to make very stylized visuals. I love how fight and song sequences would merge int It was fun to go from understand the normalcy of the characters and then feel as if you are in the middle of reading a comic or playing Street Fighter. It was both a comic and artful way of moving the plot or giving characterization. The script was great too, with many fun quips and dialogs, as well as great timing and delivery by the actors.<br/><br/>Although I loved the mixture of realistic and animated qualities, it also made the movie a little confusing at times. I kept waiting for there to be an explanation of why Scott suddenly had powers near the beginning, as well as to how the exes got them. As the movie progressed, however, it got easier to simply except that it was part of the surreal and fun aspect of having both worlds. I also had a hard time sympathizing with Scott's character (the jerk!) but the end also helps make up for that.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me somewhat of Kick-Ass, but it was a very different approach. There was much less violence, the characters in Scott merely evaporating into piles of money. In Kick-Ass, the focus seemed to be more on the reality of where a super hero comes from and the problems that come from living in ""real life"". Scott Pilgrim did almost the reverse, moving from normality into parts of imaginary worlds, but with an acceptance that it's simply a fun and colorful story.<br/><br/>Very good! Go see it!"
"Fields201","8","1","10","28 August 2010"," A Flop To Remember
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World flopped at the theaters and some people don't know why. It took me a while, but I managed to see this movie late in its lifespan at the theaters. I, for one, didn't really want to see this movie but the word of mouth guided me there.<br/><br/>The big question on my mind was: How can a film flop at the box office with such glowing reviews? I can tell you that it's not Michael Cera, who did a wonderful job in this movie, or the story itself which revolves around Scott Pilgrim fighting the league of evil exes to win the heart of Ramona Flowers. The cast did an extraordinary job with this film and the director put a lot of his heart and soul into this film, even using old school video game references to accompany the film. That I liked.<br/><br/>The reason why this film flopped was because it's not for everybody. My parents would not like this movie. My siblings would not like this movie. It only reaches out to a specific audience. It caters more to the hard rock groups (which I'm not a part of), new and old video game junkies like myself, and the comic book crowd. The whole film is like comic books, movies and video games all thrown into a blender and somehow brought to the general public hoping it will work. It succeeds on a certain level but to fully enjoy this movie, you have to ask yourself: ""How far am I willing to suspend disbelief?""<br/><br/>And that's where Scott Pilgrim falters. It has to be accepted by a wide general audience for it to succeed. It's one of those movies you might turn to on the TV and you might be like, ""This looks stupid!"" And then change the channel. That could be Scott Pilgrim vs. The World to the public.<br/><br/>But if you're willing to suspend disbelief, then you are for one heck of a ride. The core of the film is Scott defeating the exes and a lot of imagination went into the fight scenes. To me, the best part is watching the actors, because they look like they are having fun. The fight scenes, as over the top as they are, are fun to look at. I did have to ask myself, ""How did Scott Pilgrim learn how to fight like that?"" There was no indication of him knowing how to fight. It just happens. Maybe I was supposed to turn my brain off at that point.<br/><br/>All and all, this isn't my favorite movie of the year or anything but I did enjoy it and that's what I was asking for. One last question I asked myself after leaving the theater, ""Why was it called Scott Pilgrim vs. The World?"" He never left Canada! I'll shut my brain off on that one too."
"colinrgeorge","8","1","10","20 August 2010"," Geek Chic
","The levels of unreality are stacked so high in ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" that it takes a certain head-in-the-clouds mentality to see over them. Fueled by graphic novel gasoline in a vehicle straight out of ""Super Mario Kart,"" director Edgar Wright's third film (following genre parodies ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"") is a roaringly imaginative, high-octane action flick that may send unrepentant adults running—While treating the rest of the audience to a Neo Tokyo monster truck rally they won't soon forget.<br/><br/>The premise is simple; it's the lightning-paced editing that's complex. Canadian slacker Scott Pilgrim (played by an uncommonly curt Michael Cera) meets the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). However, the scaffolding to her heart is fraught with as many ladders as a game of ""Donkey Kong;"" he must defeat her seven evil ex-lovers in fight sequences that run a gamut of 16-bit references, from ""Street Fighter"" to ""Mortal Kombat,"" or it's game over for their relationship.<br/><br/>Yet ""Scott Pilgrim"" isn't a violent movie. The titular, twitter generation twenty-something bounces back with the resiliency of a Looney Toon after each subsequent pounding. And there isn't a drop of blood in the picture—Enemies appropriately explode into a shower of coins when slain. It's a creative decision pulled straight from the pages of the comic book series by Bryan Lee O'Malley (on which the film is based), but it communicates a poisonous message for advertisers and mainstream audiences with all the subtlety of a flashing neon sign: this is a niche movie if ever there was one.<br/><br/>The box office returns said as much; ""Scott Pilgrim"" will be best appreciated by those who have played ""The Legend of Zelda"" and can pick out a stray sound effect from ""Sonic the Hedgehog,"" but acknowledgement of such esoteric points of reference is entirely nonessential. My instinct is that almost anyone with an open mind will be equally swept up in the white-water current of a very fun film.<br/><br/>The action sequences are a blast. Compared more than once to Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" (in which Uma Thurman stylishly exacts vengeance on five choice acquaintances), Wright's film is just as successful at innovating action. Each of Scott's bouts is accentuated by a unique gimmick—Chris Evans plays action star and evil ex Lucas Lee, who beats up on Pilgrim with his entire stunt team in tow; the ruthless Katayanagi Twins are dispatched via sound- wave avatars during a battle of the bands; Todd Ingram (Brandon Routh) is a vegan with telekinetic powers—The diversity of these sequences, beautifully, epileptically shot by cinematographer Bill Pope, keeps the premise from ever becoming stale.<br/><br/>Where the film does falter, at least in comparison to books, is in its inability to genuinely evoke audience empathy. Partly, this is because six graphic novels are being sandwiched into a 112-minute film. Trimming the fat, inescapably, means nipping at the arteries of the books' heart. Wright was right to emphasize the kung fu over the lovey-dovey minutia, and in less altruistic hands, ""Scott Pilgrim"" might have been pitched as a six-part franchise (God help us).<br/><br/>Ultimately, your ability to connect with ""Scott Pilgrim"" lies in your ability to detach yourself from emotional expectation. ""Cute"" might be the best way to describe his relationship with Ramona, and the layers of nuance developed over however many hundreds of pages in the comics is largely absent in this adaptation. Still, it's not a problem so much as it is a trade- off, and though the balance could be better, Wright improves upon O'Malley's work just as often.<br/><br/>Know going in that it's a movie about love, not romance. Know that the experience is more sensory, less sensitive, and you'll find plenty to marvel at. A kaleidoscope of brilliant brawling with visuals like a laser light show, ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" is resplendent with newness in an age where comic books films are a dime a dozen and all either look like ""Spider-Man"" or ""300.""<br/><br/>Its wily, unfettered charm will be lost on literalists. Wright's movie is a gee-whiz-wow-bang fantasy cartoon wrapped tight in hyperbole—And as the unrepentant adults disperse, the kids will rejoice."

","I'd always heard of this film, I assumed it was something to do with music, I was partially right, but I had no idea what else to expect, I was hoping it would be entertaining, the Hollywood debut of British director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Baby Driver). Basically, in a surreal world of Toronto, Canada, where everything in society is like a video game, lives twenty-three-year-old unemployed Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera). He is the bassist in an up-and-coming garage rock band called Sex Bob-Omb, with drummer Kim Pine (Alison Pill), who he used to go out with, Stephen Stills (Mark Webber) is The Talent, and Young Neil (Johnny Simmons) lives there and hangs out with the band. Scott is dating seventeen-year-old high-school student Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), to this disapproval of his bandmates, his gay roommate Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), and his younger sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick). One night, during a party hosted by Julie Powers (Aubrey Plaza), Scott sees girl he has been seeing in his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an Amazon delivery girl. He loses interest in current girlfriend Knives but does not break up with her whilst pursuing Ramona, he finds it too hard to do so. Sex Bob-Omb get a big opportunity when they play in a battle of the bands concert, sponsored by record executive Gideon ""G-Man"" Graves (Jason Schwartzman). Scott invites Ramona, she attends along with Wallace, Stacey, and her friend Jimmy (Kjartan Hewitt), who Wallace constantly tries to hit on. Sex Bob-Omb's biggest rival is Crash and the Boys, who play a great set. Knives screams and faints like an overexcited fan when Scott and the others play. But their performance is interrupted by Ramona's ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha) who attacks Scott. They get into a big fight; it ends with Scott defeating Patel. Afterwards, Scott learns that, in order to date Ramona, he must defeat her remaining six evil exes. Knives tells Scott she is in love with him, but finally he breaks it off, she blames Ramona and swears to win him back. Scott goes on to fight with and defeat the next three Ramona's exes: Hollywood actor and skateboarder Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), super-powered vegan Todd Ingram (Superman Returns' Brandon Routh), and lesbian ninja Roxy Richter (Independence Day's Mae Whitman). Meanwhile, Scott is also having to confront his own ex, pop star Envy Adams (Brie Larson), she broke up with him after getting a record deal with her band Clash at Demonhead. Scott grows frustrated having to fight with these various exes, and has an outburst regarding Ramona's dating history, the argument causes her to break up with him. At the next battle of the bands, Sex Bob-Omb defeats Ramona's fifth and sixth evil exes, twins Kyle and Ken Katayanagi (Shota and Keita Saitou), earning Scott an extra life. Despite this, it looks like Ramona has returned to dating her seventh evil ex, Gideon. Sex Bob-Omb accepts Gideon's record deal, except for Scott, who quits the band in protest. Gideon invites Scott to his venue, the Chaos Theatre, where Sex Bob-Omb is playing. Wanting to win Ramona back, Scott challenges Gideon to a fight for her affection, earning the ""Power of Love"" sword. Knives interrupts the battle, attacking Ramona, and Scott is forced to reveal that he cheated on them both. Gideon kills Scott and Ramona visits him in limbo, a desert land, and reveals Gideon has implanted her with a mind control device. Scott uses his 1-up and re-enters the Chaos Theatre. After making peace with his friends, he challenges Gideon again, this time for himself, gaining the ""Power of Self-Respect"" sword. After apologising to Ramona and Knives for cheating on them, and disappears into 10,000 coins, and Ramona is released from mind control. She prepares to leave, but Knives accepts that her relationship with Scott is over, she encourages him to return to Ramona, and Scott asks if they can ""try again"". Also starring Johnny Simmons as Young Neil, Clifton Collins Jr. as Vegan Policeman and Thomas Jane as Vegan Policeman, with the voice of Bill Hader as The Voice. Cera does his dorky hero routine well, Winstead is charming as the colourful (hair) love interest, and there is good support from the likes of Kendrick, Evans, Larson and Schwartzman. It is based on a graphic novel series, hence the video game style, the visuals and editing are fast-paced and cool, it gets a little repetitive, and a bit much in moments, but it is amusing, with likeable characters, and it will it has garnered a cult following, which is fair enough, a fun romantic action comedy. Worth watching!"

"gantchris","10","0","1","21 March 2019"," The Magical Mysteries of Scott Pilgrim Revealed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I must admit that when I first watched the Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, directed by Edgar Wright; I thought the movie was rather straight forward. Young man meets young woman, they fall in love, young man has to battle seven deadly ex's in fights to the death (well, maybe not that straight forward in terms of a love story)... maybe if I break the story down to love at first sight, conflict, victory, win the damsel in distress, and happily ever after... that's rather straight forward. But, not until recently, upon revisiting the movie nearly ten years later did I see that there is a key to understanding this film which is a mystery wrapped as a mummy within an enigma. They key is the music, the words... that is quite self evident isn't that? Of course, the words and music are a key of understanding... of course! Oder, mais oui! However, perhaps I am now much more introspective, pensive, and knowledgeable than I was nine years ago.
Over the past year; I, Myself, have taken up the boldface keyboard in order to write scripts of ancient mysteries and spiritual order, of musical and operatic themes, of film and liturgical references and citations; and of Historical conflicts and treaties of resolution. Coincidentally, or by Divine and Cosmic Forces of Our Universe; after writing a Fantastic Four script, I went in search of actors to play the part of Johnny Storm. By happen stance, I came across an article about an actor named Matt Lauria as an up and coming actor in a series known as Kingdom written by Bryan Balasco. I thought; My, My, My, this actor reminds Me of a High School heart throb, somebody that I used to know a long time ago.
I began to research Kingdom and got the basic gist of this TV show; Mixed Martial Arts fighters and their lives. Ok. Seems rather direct... So, I endeavoured to rent the Kingdom from the local library to see how this actor, Matt Lauria, acts. To get the rhythm of his line delivery, the cadence of his voice; his motor movements and facial expressions on screen; as I had done with actors for different roles in the film scripts I wrote when making actor recommendations for the parts Long story short, I fell in love with Matt Lauria's acting; and thought, Matt Lauria is My Johnny Storm.
I don't remember exactly how I returned to the Scott Pilgrim movie. I vaguely remember thinking about Matt Lauria in terms of the character Todd Ingram as I happened upon Brandon Routh as the Atom in the Legends of Tomorrow series. No, that wasn't what the catalyst was, the prompt was Mae Whitman, because I started to watch the Parenthood series. I looked at her rÃ©sumÃ©; and saw... Scott Pilgrim vs the World. I didn't remember her in Scott Pilgrim, but that was because I probably didn't know her from any other film or TV show at the time. Hmm... Scott Pilgrim, I didn't really remember that movie. I began to watch clips of the movie on Youtube; and then I remembered how much I enjoyed the film upon Initial Viewing.
I then watched the movie again, and suddenly... I began to notice things I didn't notice before; but these weren't just objects in the background or understanding a line of foreshadowing; these were much bigger references; as though this movie is a Master Skeleton Key to unlocking the doors of perception in order to comprehend the Universe. Hmm, so many. Shall We begin?<br/><br/>8 bit opening, just like the old Nintendo games. Strange video game effects and music? Very strange. Toronto. What kind of movie IS this? An amorous comedy? Comical in more ways than one. Opening, Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is dating an underage girl, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), who is still in High School while he is a young twenty something. Scott's dating history is rather hazy, but We get the feeling that Scott is... flaky with his exes as his friend's name time after time that Scott had been dumped, or broken the hearts of the females he was dating; including the band's drummer, Kim (Alison Pill).
Did I mention that Scott is in a band? Yes, Scott is in a band called Sex Bob-omb with his friends Stephen Stills (Mark Webber), Kim Pine, and ""Young"" Neil Nordegraf (Johnny Simmons). Yes, these are obvious musical references to greats from musical History, such as Stephen Stills and Neil Young from Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young; Buffalo Springfield, and Neil Young and the Crazy Horse Band. Some of the band's music was written by another musical prodigy from this generation, My Generation being Generation Y, known for his fusion of musical genres, hip beats, sound effects; and soulful, thoughtful, and hooky melodies; that man being Beck; and Beck's music being a key to understanding this film; especially ""Hell Yes"" and ""Where It's At.""
Scott lives with a Gay roommate, Wallace Wells (Kieran Culkin), who ""sees"" a number of people throughout the film, as his bed seems like as a revolving door, Scott Pilgrim included. He acts as Scott's voice of reason, a mentor in some ways, and has a very paternal figure on the young Scott. We get the feeling that Scott lives on the poorer side of life at this time, because basically everything in Scott and Wallace's room, with the exception of Scott's coat, is Wallace's.
One day, as Scott is visiting the library in a scene reminiscent of the Song of Roland, Orzabal, in the Tears for Fears ""Head Over Heels"" music video; while with Knives, he falls in love with Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) at first sight. He asks his friends about her, he stalks her, he dreams about her, and then has him visit her while she's at work. You'll have to see the movie to understand this, or just think about pizza; as I used to be a pizza delivery man like Chris Jager in New Orleans. And on dating they go, ""hooking up"" with each other on the first night of a cold blizzard, walking through a black starred doorway; Scott getting to proverbial 1st base; as Scott is still dating Knives Chau at the same time. A dating Nightmare, and a poor reflection on the calibre of Scott's soul. Scott, as Johnny Cash, has to walk a fine line between these two women.
They fall in love with each other, and... then... Scott gets an email. A duel to the death? Over Ramona? League of evil Ex's? Deleeete. Scott asks Ramona to see him and Sex Bob-omb perform at a local low level battle of the bands. But his bandmate, Stephen Stills thinks there might be rec execs there, so he's stoked about the performance. Crash and the Boys (despite their drummer Trasha Ha (Abigail Chu) being a young woman), a Nintendo video game reference, is the band they play against. A foreshadowing. The band is led by a neogothic emo frontman, Lucas Wilson (Erik Knudson) and he and ""the Boys"" deliver a 2 song blistering set while Wallace heckles the band and gets uncomfortably cozy with Scott Pilgrim's sister, Stacey Pilgrim's (Anna Kendrick), date Jimmy (Kjartan Hewitt).
I'll admit, Crash and the Boys did deliver on their performance; and if I were in Stephen Still's position of following Crash and the Boys on stage, I would be freaking out too. But, it wasn't Scott trying to get Stephen to come to his senses that prompted him to prompt Steve. It was that Ramona and Scott's other girlfriend were starting to talk to each other. Sensing that the conversation might turn to Scott, Sex Bob-omb takes to the stage; a and opens with the song, ""Garbage Truck,"" a catchy fuzz tune. Enjoying the music, not really paying attention to the lyrics, but more attention to the interplay between Jimmy and Wallace, wait a minute. Wallace staring at Jimmy; initials, W.W.; Scottish History? William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, Robert Plant? Jimmy Page? Stairway to Heaven! And I see, if Heaven is Love, then at the end of the scene, Wallace and Jimmy are making interface love with each other.
Then, crash! From the rafters, an angry Indian named Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha) enters the scene and the E-""Mailman"" challenges Scott Pilgrim to the duel alluded to in his email. Scott sees Patel coming and repels his attack with a reversal and a 64 combo counter-attack, kicking Matthew off stage, and onto a chess or checker board floor. At this point, Ramona is forced to uncomfortably recounts her liaisons with Matthew, and their fight against the jocks in her Middle School, portrayed as American football players, and Flowers speaks of Matthew's Mystical Powers. Mystical Powers?
Matthew begins singing as though the film were now a Bollywood movie as he sings the song entitled ""S-L-ick"", as identical demonic hipster chicks (Christine Watson), who looked suspiciously like the actress from Queens of the Stones Age ""Burn the Witch"" music video flock to Patel's flanks adorned in what appears to be black starred Rage Against the Machine shirts, and pink leather Roman Catholic School girl skirts. Matthew lights himself on fire with his magical powers, and delivers an off key lyrical, and fireball, assault on Scott Pilgrim. An angry Scott critiques Patel's poor performance and muses that the line he sang doesn't even rhyme and ends the fiery rain of Matthew Patel with a cymbal. Jungle Book, Mario Bros, the ""Red Flower"" of fire power.
Wait... didn't that rhyme. Did Matt say ""out,"" or something else? Hmmm. Out rhymes with about. The printed lyrics say ""Down,"" is that accurate? Ok, wait, I hear ""down"" or is that ""Doubt"" as in the John Patrick Shanley film now... or is that just because I'm listening for ""down"" and I heard ""out"" before? Ah, the joy of discovering what the lyrics really are, and you know... sometimes the lyrics presented to you aren't what the lyrics really are. You should take a listen to ""S-L-ick"" and decide for yourself. And the whole motif of a fight between the Indian and the Pilgrim seems to be completely confirmed by the Queens of the Stone Age ""Burn the Witch"" video since the actress playing Matthew Patel's ""demon hipster chicks"" (Christine Watson), appearing as the models round about Robert Palmer in ""Addicted to Love"

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is Edgar Wright and Bryan Lee O'Malley's American- Canadian-Japanese-English thrill ride of a movie with a fitting soundtrack, striking visuals, intriguing characters, and a simple yet complex plot.<br/><br/>The movie follows Scott Pilgrim, a 23-year-old lovable loser and bassist for his and his friend's rock band, ""Sex Bob-omb"" in the mysterious land of Toronto, Canada. He starts dating a 17-year-old Chinese girl, but when the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers, starts to skate into his life, he goes after her instead, but love always hurts - and this time I mean it. Scott must fight Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends in order to win her heart. Rock music, video game-like battles, and vegans ensue.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't for everyone - especially an older audience. It's intended for the younger generation, especially those that grew up on classic video games, the movie's littered with references to Nintendo's cult game series ""The Legend of Zelda"", which is also my favorite game. Most older viewers won't find the movie appealing but to the marketed audience it's definitely a great film.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that in the first 15-25 minutes the movie kind of jumped in on the story. Events were happening so fast it was sort of hard to understand, but about 30 minutes in you realize it's because Scott is in a dream-like trance because of Ramona, and the movie slows down.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're a major comic book, movie, or video game geek, and if you're young enough to appreciate it, you will love this movie a lot. I'm kind of surprised it hasn't gained a cult following, as this is only one of four mediums of the Scott Pilgrim franchise. Definitely check them all out when you get a chance."
"ThelWhirh","8","0","2","31 March 2016"," One of my favorites
","So I'm a fan of the Scott Pilgrim comic book by Bryan Lee O'Malley and to me the film manage to capture the feel of the comic book. Of course there are some big differences from the movie and the comic book but in my opinion it still feels the same. I think I was about 13 when I saw the movie in the theater, I was blown away and all I could think was how amazing I thought it was and how it inspired me to want to learn about film an in particular visual effects (VFX). This is one of my all time favorite films, it may not be the ""best"" film compared to what you'd typically would think of when somebody talks about great films, but to me it is pretty much the best film I know of.<br/><br/>(Sorry if I messed up any of the writing, I kinda suck at this stuff)."
"robsta23","7","0","2","26 February 2016"," Style Over Substance
","Scott Pilgrim is good fun from director Edgar Wright. The cinematography and visual effects really capture the video game feel of the movie perfectly. That being said, the intended audience for this film seems a little more limited than Wright's ""Cornetto"" trilogy - this movie has created a cult following by the younger generation or anybody who loves classic video games, but the focus on Canadian teenagers and the many homages to video games makes this story less relatable than any of the films in the Cornetto trilogy.<br/><br/>Towards the beginning of the story we sympathize with Scott's young girlfriend, Knives, who seems like such a good kid and makes us wonder how Scott can break this girl's hot. Well there's the answer - a mysterious girl Scott's own age with pink hair who he is simply more attracted to and starts stalking (not to an extreme level though). Many references to past girlfriends, however, makes us wonder how Scott is such a stud since he is played by Michael Cera.<br/><br/>The premise is interesting and is obviously video-game-inspired: defeat Ramona's seven evil exes to continue dating her. The way this plot is revealed does not seem forced either, as Scott is unexpectedly attacked by the first ex while he is still juggling Knives and Ramona and has no idea what is going on.<br/><br/>Aside from the great action sequences littered with jokes and references to video games, the overall humor of the film is its greatest highlight. Michael Cera may be quirky and a bit of a geek, but it is in a lovable manner. Scott's roommate is gay, but not just for the sake of being gay - he is able to turn straight guys gay with little explanation, and it is also funny to see Scott and him to share the same bed (mattress) making us question Scott's sexuality.<br/><br/>Even the supporting cast is well cast with big names like Mae Whitman and Chris Evans, who each prove to be great caricatures for Scott/Ramona to fight. Chris Evans' scene may be the best scene of the whole film - he plays his part perfectly and draws big laughs as an overly macho actor.<br/><br/>What this film lacks is great substance. It may be a great romantic comedy for its comedy, but the romance is not well-executed. Not only that, but the film constantly makes the audience question which girl Scott should pursue, Knives or Ramona, and it seems odd that Scott would go to such great lengths to ""save"" Ramona when Knives seems to be the better person by default. The only gratification that comes from Scott wanting to break up with Knives is the fact that he no longer has a creepy relationship (she is only 17). But in early scenes within the film, no matter how creepy this relationship, it is clear the two were made for each other. Oh well.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs The World immerses the audience in its great style, but the story is hindered by its lack of substance.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"lukedeboinville","10","0","2","9 January 2016"," Edgar Wright hits hit out of the park, with a true-to-form adaptation
","Man, what can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? The casting, acting, set-pieces, writing, and humor are all fantastic.<br/><br/>First off, the casting. Picking a Scott and Ramona, as well as Sex Bob-omb and all of the evil exes was bound to be tricky. But all of them pulled it off fantastically. Usually I can take or leave Michael Cera, as I never really found him to be a standout actor.<br/><br/>However, as Scott, he seems right at home (though I have to say, in the books, he seems a great deal more cocky).<br/><br/>The acting felt very natural and well paced. There was always a great deal of chemistry, and you could tell they enjoyed working with each other, both on and off set.<br/><br/>The set-pieces, from the Battle of the Bands, to the Castle, to the Katianagi twins, and everything in-between, were action packed and well represented. Edgar Wright did an excellent job making those moments feel like they leaped right from the pages of the series.<br/><br/>The writing was very smart and quick witted, with a lot of references and blink-and- you'll-miss-it type humor. However, I feel that it worked both for fans, and those who weren't as familiar with the source material. So kudos!<br/><br/>And lastly, the humor. While mostly subtle, there are some laugh-out-loud, highly memorable moments, that will make you come back for repeat viewings for sure.<br/><br/>Quite a few things ended up being left out on the way to the Silver screen (as is to be expected), so I highly recommend reading the fantastic graphic novel series by Brian Lee O'Mally that this film is based on.<br/><br/>That's about it guys. Enjoy the film!"
"lyvisal_heng","8","0","2","17 November 2015"," This is an epic movie
","This is one of the most rarest things ever happens to me, is that too find this movies that has everything I want.<br/><br/>This film has so much that one watch is just not enough. It is well filmed, the fighting scenes are not too complicated you can tell who's hitting who. It is well designed as well, it looks like a video game or even a comic book/anime that has come to LIFE. The visual effects and sound when you see an attack moves being delivered are awesome. After seeing this makes me feel why didn't the movie""street fighter"" didn't pulled this off.<br/><br/>The best things about this movie are the dialog and the humor.They are just hilarious. This film is one of those movies where sometime by re watching it makes you uncover new things like a good joke perhaps.There all reference jokes like in ""Futurama"".<br/><br/>Characters even the minor ones are all great and I felt cast just right. Even though for the record I'm not a fan of the actor, Michael Cera I thought did very well as the character, I really felt like he was Scott Pilgrum. What I love about Scott is just how he relates to me, Scott is a bit like myself in real life; he's shy, insecure, but not short of courage, loves video games, and trying to find himself. I also love the fact that Scott looks like any other everyday person, he's not some stereotypical pretty boy.<br/><br/>Mary Elesebeth Winstead is perfect in the role of Ramona Flowers,Ramona is feisty, fiery, spontaneous, rebellious, bitchy (I mean that in a good way) despite these things she's capable of warmth and mature, and like Scott is also trying to find herself (heck her changing hair color reflects that).<br/><br/>Like the minor character Knives Chaou played by Ellen Wong whom is a capable actress hoping she gets more in the future. Knives is 17 (though in reality the actress is 25) she's young, full of energy, sweet, has some fire in her which we see in the final fight, a bit immature though I don't mind. The way the film handled her I could of gone either way but we know who the right one is so it makes sense who Scott chooses in the end.<br/><br/>The villains are all colorful, just like in a ""Street Fighter"" video game each have different abilities to do serious damage. However all of them are unlikeable, their just all dirt bags , their the kind of people that have pushed me around in the middle school; all the more reason we want Scott to win.<br/><br/>Well that's all I have to say, Scott Pilgrim is an epic, well sort of. Give it a chance and watch it."

","Scott Pilgrim VS The World is an incredibly quirky film that you either love or don't really understand. I for one thought it was awesome. It was funny, had a great cast, kicking soundtrack, was about a bass player for once, ( low end represent!) and was set in my home town, Toronto, which has so many great places to film, it was nice to see it get some movie love. Scott Pilgrim is original, directed perfectly from Edgar Wright and Michael Cera's best movie. All in all this is really cool film, and the comic and video game aspect made it even cooler, plus they have Thomas Jane as a member of the Vegan Police, which made me laugh and that alone makes it worth seeing.

"troyputland","10","0","1","28 April 2015"," It's a geekgasm.
","Need a director to characterise a video game, comic book and action movie in one medium? Edgar Wright's your man. You don't need to be a nerd in order to enjoy Scott Pilgrim's adventure. Just a childhood fashioned with intricacy and a longing for 'that girl'. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World's starts how it intends to go on, its opening credits are loud and bright, and there's more to extract from it too. It plays on our geeky side whilst gaining new audiences. Sounds from Zelda: A Link to the Past are sly but obvious to some, 'SMACKS!' and 'THWONKS!' make a show like we're watching the original Batman, as do homages to Japanese Manga, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and all sorts of fictional clientèle. But is it all real for Scott? Michael Cera's lovable rogue blossoms when he meets Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and immediately falls for her. Is she real or fantasy? Either way, Scott must defeat her 7 evil exes in order to gain her love. Each new ex brings a new style of play. It's consistently stunning and breathtaking, and non of it makes any sense. The best thing to do with SPvsTW is to go along with it. Cera is a relatable frontman, worrying about how his hair looks and seeing his ex-girlfriend. Strong support comes from Scott's nosy sister Kendrick, his gay best-friend Aces (Culkin), his band mates, and all the exes, especially Chris Evans' movie star (who cracks his neck in time with Universal's theme tune) and Jason Schwartman. Go with the flow. It doesn't make a lot of sense, and it doesn't need to."

","Edgar Wright, damn this guy is one talented SOB. He has a unique knack for delivering the goods on multiple levels: jaw-dropping action merged with razor-sharp comedy, straightforward narratives combined with complex and thought-provoking subtexts. Not to mention the efficiency in his editing, his always great use of music, and his ability to draw excellent performances from his actors.<br/><br/>He is most known for his Cornetto Trilogy (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, The World's End). Three magnificent films that I hold near and dear to my heart. But his true masterpiece is Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.<br/><br/>You wanna know how to adapt a comic book? This is how you do it folks. Completely capturing the playful tone of Brian Lee O'Malley's source material, and really staying faithful to the awesome characters and story lines.<br/><br/>Some have said Wright stays a bit too faithful, going overboard by staging every single ""evil ex"" battle from the comic. And had he styled each battle the same way, it could have gotten a bit tiring. But the fight scenes in the film are all totally inventive and quite different from each other. Satisfying on so many levels. C'mon, Vegan Police? Completely brilliant. And goddamn, it's Michael Cera vs Captain America. Then vs Superman. Then vs Max Fischer from Rushmore?? All incredible and hilarious fights. Wow!<br/><br/>Maybe best of all, Wright really flexes his filmmaking muscles and shows us great range here. Can he make great films outside the UK? Can he make great films without Simon Pegg? Can he handle a big budget? Yes, yes, and yes. Nothing this guy can't do. Scott Pilgrim is the masterpiece that proves it."

","If you're a fan of old school video games (Zelda, the first four Final Fantasy games, etc) you're going to definitely notice a couple of references. In fact, the movie itself is like one long reference – though mostly to comics.<br/><br/>It's designed like a comic, which shouldn't come as a shocker since it's based off a series of graphic novels. However, Spiderman was also based off of comics and that was one continuous story. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World almost seems to be cut up and filmed in panels. I can understand why the critics flamed it, but I also think they were resistant to difference and, quite frankly, closed minded jack-offs. As you may be able to tell already, I can also tell why there's a cult following for the movie.<br/><br/>It's different, it's fun and entertaining. Tell me, what more do you want from a movie?<br/><br/>The best part is that not only does the movie do it without throwing an underlying lesson in your face, but if you search deep enough you still find that meaning there. I mean, what would you rather do when meeting your significant others ex? Have that awkward meeting/conversation where you're trying not to say too much and sizing each other up or bust out some wicked magical powers and start zapping each other in the ass until one of you bursts into coins and gives the other some massive life- points? The latter is just so much more fun."

I was browsing the new releases back in 2010, searching for comedy/romance movies and at the bottom of the list , there it was, this perfect match. At first, I didn't know what to expect, and that was normal, because I didn't even read the review for the movie, but once I got to watch it I was mind blown. Every little disappointment I thought I'd feel, disappeared. The love story, the gaming references, the awkwardness and the soundtrack of course. Every little detail, I loved. This movie for me was everything I've ever looked for in movies - action, cool love story and good music as well good atmosphere which brings the good feeling overall. The music is so fitting, it's unreal, every fighting scene, love scene or whatever scene it is - the music fits perfectly. But the music is not the only exceptionally good thing about this movie, the effects are great as well. The movie being of fantastic nature requires good effects and presentation, and this movie has it all. I want to mention that as well as many others, the movie made me get the books, and there it is - another great decision led by this accidental discovery of mine. I love this movie, and I mean it.

","Most actors are bombastic, pushing full-force at us with the strength of their personalities. There are a very few, however, who bring it back down to earth and act, not as a performer, but as someone who seems to be visiting the movie frame from the real world. Michael Cera is like that. He is a skinny, curly-haired, unassuming kid with a goofy smile and a look that - even at 23 - still allows him to play teenagers. There is a look in his eyes that is less confident than most of the young actors around him. In his best performances, in Juno and the underrated Paper Heart, he seems to play teenagers who aren't trying to change the world but simply to understand it.<br/><br/>That quality makes him all wrong to occupy the title role of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, a loud, overwrought special effects exercise that lies somewhere between an Anime epic and a hyper-kinetic video game. Hyper is just about the only way to describe it. The movie uses effects wall to wall (this is really an editor's movie), spelling out sounds behind the actors as if we are looking at the panels of a comic book. The colours blast and burst behind the actors to express extreme emotion. That would be fine if I cared about what was happening. As it stands, this is a movie with all frosting and no cake.<br/><br/>The story is more concept than plot. Scott's girlfriend dumped him and, in a fit of broken-hearted delirium, he starts dating a pretty girl who is five years younger and still in high school. She carries the inexplicable name of Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). That relationship lasts until Scott meets Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a daffy introvert who changes her hair color every week. He thinks she is the girl of his dreams, but that little illusion is tainted when he discovers that seven of her former exes - six guys and a girl - are so brokenhearted that they have formed an evil alliance to destroy Scott. Oh, and did I mention that the exes have superpowers? Yeah . . . I know.<br/><br/>One by one, these colourful characters come out of the woodwork, introduce themselves and try to destroy our hero. The fight scenes - and in fact most of the movie - is given over to a lot of special effects to make the movie look like a video game. The problem is that the entire production is so busy that it never stops long enough to allow the actors to build any kind of momentum. The characters are defined by personality traits but they aren't much more than that.<br/><br/>At the center of this chaos rests Michael Cera, whose personality is not suited for this kind of nonsense. He is a very good actor whose best moments take place when the camera just leaves him alone. His best performance came in Jason Reitman's Juno in which he played Paulie Bleeker, a gawky high school kid with an addiction to tic tacs who impregnates his best friend. That movie had moments of truth and it shows what he can do as an actor. I still believe that his best performance still awaits him. I think there is more to him than the snore-inducing sight of flying through the air and kicking someone."

Of course, it's not boring, and the visuals are very interesting. You can see some inspirations of the film 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless mind' in it, such as the ice ground location and the fact that Mary Elizabeth Winstead's character is impulsive and always change his hair, much alike Kate Winslet's character in the aforementioned film. <br/><br/>But unfortunately, the story is way too dull for my taste. Almost dull just for the sake of being dull.Is just...dull. Some funny moments, or at least supposed to be funny, don't works in it. The acting was also terrible and dull.

Sounds kind of unreal doesn't it? But that's just the surface of the movie. If you re-watch a movie a couple of times it becomes not just an adventure comedy about a made up life, but the slightly exaggerating mirror of everyday life.<br/><br/>The story tells about the Canadian guy called Scott Pilgrim who:<br/><br/>-Has a girlfriend -Plays in a band -Has his own place (well yes, OK, it's more Wallace's (his gay roommate) place, but still) <br/><br/>Everything seems normal. One small problem – he gets interested in Ramona Flowers, the new girl in town. He doesn't know where he will get into, but hey, love is blind. Soon he finds out about the seven evil exes he has to defeat in order to be with her.<br/><br/>Sounds unreal? Or does this movie tell us about real life?<br/><br/>Well first of all, this movie's main theme is that you have to fight for what you love. It can be your hobby, your dream job, your dream position, and yes, your dream girl/boy. It may not be just one battle, but after each one you get more experience (or more coins if you're Scott) and that helps when you need to defeat the boss. It may require some sacrifices – you might have to drop your favorite hobby, but hey, it's worth it. Of course, if you fail miserable you can always try again – if you earned an extra life.<br/><br/>Second of all, the movie tells about the nature of human relationship. It tells about supporting friends, who would give us helpful critique or give us a push when we don't know what to do. It talks about how you can get to know a person, how little by little people open up to each other and start trusting. Another topic is baggage. When you think about it, we all have baggage like Ramona says. And she's completely right. Why? We never know how to handle a relationship – nobody teaches it, you have to learn it yourself and along the way you make mistakes and people get hurt. And all you were trying to do was to be happy.<br/><br/>This movie shows that in order to be happy, you have to earn the power of love and more importantly self respect. And maybe even your evil side is not so bad, when you are ready to accept it. After all, you are the person you will be living the rest of your life with."
"matbutcher","7","0","1","12 August 2013"," Nearly all style and no substance...
","There is a lot to be admired in Edgar Wright's Scott Pilgrim. The quirky visuals, the pop culture references and his inventiveness with the conventions of mainstream cinema -which have all become a visual trademark of Wright's directorial style - are all here in abundance. In this respect the film is a visual treat; the special effects are impressive and used effectively; the stunts and set pieces are well handled and the mixing up of various genres lends the film a pleasant eccentricity. <br/><br/>So far so good<br/><br/>What the film lacks however, is heart. As impressive as the visuals are, there's just something missing which meant I found myself unable to connect with the film in any meaningful way. What made Wright's previous outings Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz so good -apart from the visual inventiveness, was the sharp script and the great comic performances from Pegg and Frost. Whilst there's no one better at playing the sensitive loser in love character than Michael Cera, I'm not sure how long he can keep this up, we've seen it all before and it's wearing a bit thin now, and as a result it's hard to really care about the central character.<br/><br/>The film has good intentions with regards to human relationships but it is ultimately let down by a script which falls short of any genuine sincerity. In the end the film is carried by the strength of its visuals, and its overall genre mixing quirkiness, which is not a bad thing but it could have been so much better."

","Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is a terrific movie with a clever, different plot and a very talented cast. I did not think I would end up understanding it because I have never read any of the comic books, but it turns out you don't need to. The humour is weird and out there, same with the effects, in a very refreshing way. There are some missteps, but it's mostly really funny, and a lot of laugh out loud scenes. I really enjoyed Michael Cera in this movie, the part of Scott suited him perfectly, he seemed to be having a lot of fun, as did the rest of the cast. There really is nothing like it, I would recommend Scott Pilgrim vs. the World to anyone looking for a good fantasy comedy. <br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim falls in love with Ramona Flowers, but to win her heart, he must defeat her Seven Evil Exes.<br/><br/>

","This film is amazing in the way its put together, I love the whole video game/comic book vibe that this film gives off, and thats what really makes this film special, how much of this video game aspect is incorporated into the film, with coins exploding out of people when they died as well as classic comic book words coming out as well as sounds, it really is a treat for your eyes in terms of visuals, and a definite healthy break form what is usually out there.<br/><br/>Something I also really liked were the seamless transitions between different scenes that seemed to run on and so you never had heavy block transitions, instead the camera always moved with people to achieve maximum fluency which is something I greatly admired.<br/><br/>The one main thing I didn't like about this film was the acting, they kept it just interesting enough to be quirky but many of the actors in this film could be described as 'card board', which was kind of disappointing in a film that was put together so well. I've never really seen a film that I thought had been edited as well as this one, it was perfect in that term but really the acting let it down.<br/><br/>Im not a huge Michael Cera fan, and he definitely didn't pull through in this film either, all I ever think about him when I see him in this film, is that someone else could be doing this job better and it would have made the film a lot better.<br/><br/>I feel therefore that this film was excellently put together with amazing visuals in video game format but what let it down was some terrible acting which brought the tone of the film way down, and that was the disappointing thing about this film. However for something different in terms of editing this film is definitely an essential film for all film lovers."

","I watched this movie yesterday afternoon and it just blew me away! That was probably one of the most well-made movies I have seen in a while. And I'm not just talking about the action and the effects (which are amazing) but also the general feeling of the movie. I was afraid to see something pretty good when it comes to action but with little scenario and poor acting when it comes to comedy. Of course like many people I love Michael Cera in all his roles and this film was no exception.<br/><br/>He manages to play this geeky guy without making him sounding annoying because of his special personality, it's the type of character that I think a lot of actors would've ruined, but not Michael. The others are good too, I'm not arguing on that, and I was extremely pleased to see Edgar Wright's name in the opening credits (along with that awesome scene & music). He's one of the most promising directors because he really has his own style in filmaking, just like Tarantino you can recognize an Edgar Wright film now. <br/><br/>All things considered, this was one of the best movies I have seen in a while, and I really commend it to anyone enjoying action, comedy, geek stuff and love stories."
"Mr-Fusion","8","0","2","15 August 2012"," Unusual, refreshing and (yes) epic
","I've never read the ""Scott Pilgrim"" comic books, so I couldn't tell you how closely this movie hews to the source material . . . but on its own terms, it's pretty sweet. I love that the hero is a bass player (unsung as movie instruments goo) and Michael Cera's a terrific choice for this character. He's a whiny douche, but manages to have a decent character arc. and hell, it's not just him - look at everybody else; I can't find one weak link in this cast (although, Chris Evans and Brandon Rout stand out in the League of Evil Exes, not to mention Mary Elizabeth Winstead's disinterested hotness).<br/><br/>Really, this whole thing is about relationship baggage, and it's such a quirky setup; a romantic comedy steeped in gamer culture . . . with fight scenes. And as it rolls on, it's just infectious. Movies like ""Scott Pilgrim"" don't just come along everyd- ... ever. <br/><br/>8/10"
"axlrhodes","8","0","3","23 June 2012"," Edgar Wright levels up with a real treat. Mega.
","Well that was an absolute blast!! From what i can gather, and this is without going and looking at box office figure, Scott Pilgrim was something of a flop. After having just sat through what was one of the most entertaining films i have seen in a good while, it's hard to see exactly why. Was the marketing strategy all wrong? Were people confused about what the film was. Whatever happened, i can for the life of me see how this isn't going to be one of those long term success stories. This film is so clever on so many levels. Levels is actually a key word here too. This film is all about getting to the next level, and the way in which Edgar Wright manages to squeeze every mega byte of gaming culture from the early days of the Atari, to the loading screens of Spectrums is just inspired. Even the Universal studios ident is given a Super Mario style sonic makeover at the beginning. This film is a real mash-up of cultures and styles (i was reminded of Quentin Tarantino) that really comes together in a very enjoyable way. As much fun as the direction from Wright is, the performances from the actors are all equally right on beat. A series of small but effective roles for the likes of Brandon Routh and Chris Evans really stand tall while all the central players, Cera, Winstead, Culkin come away with what should have been career enhancing credit. I don't really know how Scott Pilgrim is doing with it's life on DVD. I picked the film up for £4 in a supermarket, i didn't really have much in the way of expectation but boy, oh boy it blew my socks off. Congratulations to all, i hope the film earns the respect it so richly deserves over the course of time."

","So I'll start with a disclaimer: I loved ""Shaun Of The Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""...both directed and written by Edgar Wright.<br/><br/>So when I saw the trailer for Scott Pilgrim in the theaters I figured I'd want to check it out.<br/><br/>It seemed like it came and went pretty fast at the movie houses...but I kept it in the back of my mind. Recently I saw the DVD cheap and knew it was time to check it out.<br/><br/>This film is very quirky and in some ways reminded me of Napoleon Dynamite crossed with Kung Fu Hustle...but on steroids...taking you on a fun-house, thrill ride.<br/><br/>It makes huge references to comics/graphic novels and video games...and often the plot and characters veer WAY over the top.<br/><br/>But once you realize you're not going to get a typical story line and Hollywood drivel...all you can do is sit back and hold on.<br/><br/>For the most part it is a very young cast..but their performances are really strong. Jason Schwartzman, who is 31, may well be the oldest cast-member.<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic (to see wimpy Michael Cera look like a bad-ass in a several scenes is a credit to them).<br/><br/>There are moments where the movie drags a bit...but not many...and there are several good laffs.<br/><br/>Overall...I thought it was pretty good...and recommend it to anyone who likes this style of movie.<br/><br/>BTW...I haven't been a teenager in (*coughs) a long while"
"theinaniloquent","9","0","3","2 May 2012"," ""A epic of epic epicness""
","Scott Pilgrim must defeat his new girlfriend's seven evil exes in order to win her heart.<br/><br/>Read that description. Now read it again. Sounds crazy right? Sure, I can agree on that but is it contrived? No, not at all. Instead of going the path it could've gone in, it separates from what it could've been. This is the reason why I liked the film so much. It was never borderline cliché, never cheesy, never too much. They blended all the right stuff in will knowing what to put in and what to put out.. So instead of creating on big, long paragraph on why I liked the movie so much, I'm going to just tell you why Scott Pilgrim does it, and why it separates from most movies today...<br/><br/>The editing. Okay, that sounds a little silly. Most people never pay attention to stuff like this. They just sit down and enjoy whatever they watch. But with this film, it's quite obvious what they did. When someones phone rings, the words 'rinnng' show up on the screen, describing what happens. Even in an hilarious scene, when Scott goes to the bathroom, there appears a pee bar, that plays out like a video game. That reminds me, this whole movie is like a video game. Everything about it, it's not just a movie. It's like an experience. Which leads me to...<br/><br/>The references. If your a video-game buff (like me) this movie will be the ultimate treat. Each line contains a reference to video games or even our society. The whole movie is constructing as if it were a video game, and that's pretty awesome. The film, again, makes fun of our society and our fads. In one classic scene, they show a vegetarian losing his power, when the vegan police show him and strip him of it. The movie is just all cleverly done. Which leads me to...<br/><br/>The music. Yeah, the music. Some people didn't even like it, but you like alternative rock music, this is your movie. The best thing is that this band doesn't even theoretically exist, so the music they made was just made for the movie. And for that reason alone, I give major kudos for whoever did it. It was funny but also awesomely epic as well. And the people in the band, which I purposely said that so I can say this leads me to...<br/><br/>The cast. You know who completes this film? Michael Cera. He plays the same exact role in most of all his films, but that's okay, because he completes this one. His fast-speaking, his awkwardness, and his hilarity just make this 100x better than it could've been. Okay, not JUST him, the rest of the cast just teams up and marks this film as their own. Each character contains their own attributes, and they all combine like the perfect smoothie. Which totally irreverently leads me to... <br/><br/>The heart + soul. Yup, even through all that craziness, the movie still contains this. The movie is a romantic story but with all this epic stuff going on, your not going to realize it. By the end, your going to know how it contains it. I rate films low with no heart and soul, because I think that this completes a movie. It surely does. And with Scott Pilgrim, the heart + soul is right there in front of your eyes. Maybe YOU don't see it, but I see it. It has it. Which again, irreverently leads me to...<br/><br/>The epicness. Read the tagline, read it again. Watch the movie. Nod your head in agreement. The movie is just totally EPIC. The cleverness, the hilarity, the epicness all combine to make one hell of an inventive movie. It's neither cliché nor overdone, it's just epic. Right? But it's for a certain crowd. I see lots of people who disliked it just because they found it to be a mainstream, hipster movie. But if they looked deeper in it's cleverness, I'm sure of you they would find it something special. But most people cannot look deeper, so I recommend it for people who can. Scott Pilgrim is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen..<br/><br/>9/10."

I'm probably considerably older than the target demographic of this film, but it has to be one the cinema highlights of the last few years, for me at least.<br/><br/>An exceptionally difficult film to classify, it just works. The crew (actors, production, tech etc.) deserve huge credit for creating something that is funny, quirky, totally left-field and, er, odd (in a good way!)<br/><br/>Don't expect intricate plots or cerebral twists, it's just a crazy, funny and definitely off-beat movie that has excellent characters, well crafted dialogue, great music and wacky photography (and then some).<br/><br/>A genuinely great little movie that had me thoroughly entertained throughout. <br/><br/>Highly recommended."

A big thing was how wonderfully fresh the gay characters were. While some people may have an issue with some of the stereotypes here, I myself was laughing uproariously at the lines being brought down. All the action sequences were downright cool too, oh, and the soundtrack, oh, and the video game geekness about it. Arrrgh, so so so much goodness here.

","The world that Scott Pilgrim dwells in seems like a paradise for all who cherish the activities and cultures of the teenage life. Here is a world centered on teenage relationships, video games, comic books, and rock n' roll. It allows a freedom that the youth could celebrate on a daily basis. The influence and sightings of adults in this movie are almost, if not entirely, absent.<br/><br/>Not only are the young characters here privileged with such an exciting reality, but they are also presented with powers of many possibilities. I am thinking of a scene that could be used as an example. Oh, yeah. After an evil ex-boyfriend has been stripped of his supremacy by the vegan police, our hero head butts him, and the weakened villain explodes, leaving a pile of coins just waiting to be the fed to greedy slot machines. In a world where sudden death turns into instant riches, one would suspect that murders would be much more rampant, but not here.

","In this day and age of over used story lines, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, is honestly original. Absolutely awesome movie. Now, let me explain my style of reviewing things. I have 3 ways of reviewing, I always add a basic story guide, a spoiler alert where I explain a few things that go on if needed (where bad publicity is coming from, a few parts that are graphic and may not wish to see) but since there is nothing to spoil I will avoid that, and then my verdict. So lets get started: <br/><br/>Basic Story Guide: <br/><br/>Scott Pilgram is a mild mannered young man, in aband, and has a high school girlfriend named Knives Chau. Then Scott Pilgrim begins having dreams of a young woman with purple hair and Rollerblades. And while on a ""date"" with Knives. He meets Ramona, an aloof beauty with purple hair and he realizes this is the ""girl of his dreams. And it is not long before Scott and Ramona begin a relationship. But Scott realizes he maybe in over his head, because if he wishes to continue dating Ramona, he must defeat her Seven Evil Exes, an organization bent on controlling Ramona's love life. Can Scott defeat her evil ex's and win young Romana's heart? Oh, the things we do for love...<br/><br/>Spoilers: There really is nothing to spoil here. <br/><br/>Verdict: This movie is a romance movie, but it's not a cheesy romance movie like Twilight (not trolling, just stating my opinion), or Titanic where either one wants to be with the other but the other pulls away because of dark events in ones past, or they sit around explaining to one another how much they ""love and can't live without one another"". Even the most serious and intimate of conversations is laced with wit, and humor.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are simply awesome. Graphic wise, they are like watching a video game in live action. Some of the fights are just hilarious to watch. During some of the fights I was laughing so hard, I thought I was going to suffocate.<br/><br/>But like all good things, there is one flaw in this movie that prevents it from being an excellent movie. The trade off is: the acting. The acting is not by any means Oscar worthy. Some of the acting at times is just flat out lame. But overall it's a fun, original, and an awesome movie. I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>8/10"

","9 out of 10 is a number I don't use too much, but the way this film ended out to be was just phenomenal.<br/><br/>The majority of you will probably know the synopsis of the film as you're on this website of course, but to break it down quickly, a jobless Scott Pilgrim in a small garage band falls for bad girl Ramona Flowers, who says they can be together as long as he defeats her seven evil ex's. One by one Scott tries to take down the evil ex's with comic book like special effects (obviously with it coming from a comic book).<br/><br/>Now, what I love about this film is that the plot to the film is so simple yet so witty and how Edgar Wright is able to create a both hilarious and beautiful film. It's like nothing you've ever seen before as Wright has created a new style of cinema.<br/><br/>The only sort of downside is Michael Cera who portrays the title role. He plays the role very well but with the films and shows he has been in like Superbad, Juno and Areested Development, he plays the same geeky and timid character in all of these and Scott Pilgrim, but it's because of this that makes Cera the perfect choice to play the lead role, which in a way isn't a down side<br/><br/>Although it was not commercially a success, I would definitely get your hands on a copy of this just to be visually entertained by the way it has almost revolutionised the wonderful world of cinema.<br/><br/><ul><li>Anderson</li></ul>"

","Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World the movie is a smash hit action movie that steps away from the norm when it comes to presentation, sound, and delivery. This movie has it all and then some when it comes to the zaniness of the story, over-the-top action scenes, and laugh-out-loud craziness that is hard not to love. This is not a movie to sleep on. Not only does it provide a good sense of itself, it will keep you glued to the screen, cheering until the end.<br/><br/>PRESENTATION: This movie is art. It is presented like a live action comic book, this really helps bring the scenes of the movie alive and it's a lot of fun to watch. Unlike other action movies Scott Pilgrim doesn't force explosions in your face or focus on sexy female actors to draw in attention. Scott Pilgrim has its own style of delivery, making it seem like a video game come to life by presenting to us things we know and love about video games. The soundtrack is also top-notch and it really adds to the flare that makes Scott Pilgrim so good.<br/><br/>PLOT: This isn't your grandfather's story. Scott Pilgrim doesn't take itself seriously and a lot of it's content is meant for fun, not a deeply engaging story that we'd tell our kids. Plot fiends should stay away, while those who are in for the action will have a blast. The characters have enough personality to bring you back for more.<br/><br/>EXECUTION: This is best part of the package. This movie will make you want to pick up your favorite video game and have a ball. This movie has no boring way to transition the story, so it feels fresh and new.<br/><br/>LASTING REMARKS: This movie is an action movie giant. There's also plenty of fan service for those who read the comics and if you haven't you'll have fun anyway. This is art, an absolute must see."

","Though this film is clearly meant for viewers of the generation of video games and crazy, whacked out anime, I felt that of the dozens (if not hundreds) of comedy movies I have seen it has a sensibility of storytelling not found in the general comedy genre. This laudable usage of strong thematic connections, when added to the eye-popping visual effects and clever camera work (including some inventive cuts that fluidly transition the action of the film throughout its many locations), makes for an exciting and surprisingly fulfilling movie that manages to perfectly blend video game classics and clichés, music allusions, and almost non-stop comedy together in such a way that it still manages to tell a good story that is not as dumb and flighty as the vast majority of comedies. Overall, I have to give it the level of respect I would normally never grant to comedies."
"lmaocarrots","9","0","3","7 January 2012"," Coming From a Huge Fan of the Comic Series.
","When compared to the comic, I'd argue they could have made it longer or split it up into a trilogy to include all that they left out. When viewed as a stand alone film, this is an utterly fantastic film with truly unique Special Effects and Editing.<br/><br/>Story: 8.5/10 I adored the story in the comics, even though it was the character development and dialogue that made the series. As far as the main plot goes, they did it excellently and even the changed ending was equally as good as the book's. My major complaint was that they basically did Scott Pilgrim: Precious Little Life (the first comic) perfectly and it was nearing 1/2 of the movie. But then for the other 5 they chopped out every bit of side plot possible (such as Scott getting a job, the high school flashbacks, and Knive's father trying to kill Scott) and left the bare minimum. All these side stories were equally enjoyable as the main one and were what really developed the characters well.<br/><br/>Acting: 8.5/10 As far as casting went they portrayed all the characters accurately as far as looks go, but there were 3 stand outs for me. I thought Stephen Stills, Scott, and Ramona were played sort of badly. In the comics I saw Stephen as the kind of emotionless guy who didn't care much, but he was played as if he's really nervous. In the books I saw Scott as the obnoxious, annoying, nerdy guy, but Micheal Cera plays him like the quiet and awkward guy. And Ramona was played as if she was a Gothic, emotionless person who didn't ever smile, but in the book she seemed more girly and she was smiling quite frequently. Ramona particularly annoyed me because there weren't any of those happy, funny moments between her and Scott which made more of a reason for Scott to like her.<br/><br/>Special Effects: 10/10 The special effects were the stand out part of this movie. They were probably the greatest comic book effects to date. The editing was flawless with split screens, tracking text, and great fights galore. I was absolutely awestruck by the actions going on on screen. And as far as the first book goes, they basically did it panel for panel and that was truly impressive. <br/><br/>Directing: 9/10 I feel that Edgar Wright truly loves this series, and based on the first 40 minutes, was planning on doing it much more accurately and much more like the books. I think it could have easily been made into a 2 part series (book 1-3 in the 1st, book 4-6 in the 2nd), but they probably ran into time or budget restraints. But from what was made, Edgar did a brilliant job at recreating what he did.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the series, I think you'l love this movie to no end, and if you have read the series you'll love the movie, but will be angry with what they left out. Truly a great movie adaptation that's worth the watch."

So guys just don't go by the start as its quite mocking. One thing you'll learn in the beginning itself that it has got a feel of video game, but that's just the start. Half hour in the movie, you'll gonna love it if you are pretty much into games. It may remind you of back years when you used to play them if you're old enough. The style of direction is the wow thing about this movie. The storyline is easily predictable. The acts are fine. All the visual effects are just adequate to manage the feel of a video game. The music is good. Few liners are good including the pac-man one and will make you smile. The co-relation of the movie can be felt if seen deeply as it follows the current code of conduct of the teenagers regarding their life.  Though I strongly feel that its not quite conveyed. All the way the movie is entertaining after the first half an hour with all the action sequences. Its a must for all video game lovers."
"policy134","Null","0","5","15 August 2011"," Annoying, loud and overblown. It's great
","There is a lot of noise in this one and it works great. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is one of these teen fantasy movies that the director, Edgar Wright specialises in at the moment.<br/><br/>In 2007, the delightful Hot Fuzz was released, a movie that I enjoyed enormously, but this is the net, so let me totally nerd out and find all the faults with both films. These are fantasies, folks. Nothing more, and Wright makes wet dreams put on film and not those insightful character studies, like one of last years greatest, The Social Network. Stay connected for that commentary.<br/><br/>The characters in here are purely one-dimensional. You don't feel like they evolved at all and yet, I enjoyed them. Ramona Flowers is the key character and she is not that much different than Robot from Lost in Space. She is almost completely devoid of any kind of personality and because of that, the ending puzzles me immensely. Still, she looks nice.<br/><br/>The character of Knives is brilliantly played by Ellen Wong. I like the fact that her race is not an issue as in many, many, many Hollywood films. It seems that that's the only race that it's okay to make fun of somehow. She is a weirdo, though, but not because of her race.<br/><br/>The plot about the evil exes is of course ridiculous like most comic book to movie adaptations, and the fight sequences does drag on a little bit, but overall, this is entertainment at high value and not much more."

","I bought ""Scott Pilgrim vs The World"" for my wife's birthday months ago, following a great review of the film by Mark Kermode (who we generally find has taste that matches ours). We didn't watch the film until last night (seven months after it was bought), and I'm quite disappointed that we didn't find time for it earlier. This is a very good movie! The main characters are quite sympathetically drawn (with the possible exception of Knives, who is sidelined too much until she has such an important role in the story), but with flaws which make them three-dimensional (quite impressive for a film derived from a comic-book!) I am very impressed with Kieran Culkin's acting - I don't think I've seen him in anything else. As a character, Ramona Flowers is seriously hot - very sexy, strong and vulnerable all at once.<br/><br/>I missed many of the video-game references, never having the patience to play them, but it didn't affect the film from my point of view. However, I am a bit concerned about the casual acceptance of having to kill previous partners in order to become the next partner. My wife thinks that is an allegory for what actually happens in a relationship, but I just don't get it. It seems needlessly brutal, since there is no indication that the deaths are metaphorical (once the basic premises of the film are accepted, so that these people really can fight like video-game characters). Let's face it, Scott does not know any of the exes, yet he he puts a great deal of effort into killing them for his own benefit. He could have walked away at any time, as I understood the plot, and the remaining evil exes would have left him alone.<br/><br/>Overall, an 8 out of 10n, because it was well-made movie with some great acting, but the basic premise leaves me a bit uncomfortable."
"compi24","7","0","4","28 July 2011"," Review of ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World""
","Director Edgar Wright brings Bryan Lee O'Malley's famed comic book character to life with ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"". The movie, of course, tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Cera), a young musician who must battle all the evil exes of the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Winstead). First off, try not to take this movie too seriously - because it's not. If you walked into this movie expecting a tour-de-force tale of love, passion, and perseverance you'd be sorely mistaken. This movie is not meant to be thought-provokingly philosophical. It's meant to be fun - and boy is it fun. I had a pretty darn good time watching ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"". The most entertaining quality of this movie is it's special effects. Granted most of it's CGI, it doesn't hinder the entertainment value. I only wish I would've seen this movie on the big screen - it would've been exponentially more fun to watch. Another great quality of the film is that it features a wealth of tongue-in-cheek throwbacks to some of the classic video games of the late 80s and early 90s. A lot of video game clichés make their appearance in this movie and I (being a nerd) found them highly entertaining to spot. The acting is what it is. It's not really anything worthy of note, but it fits the bill for the overall tone of the movie. The same goes for the script, which, for most of the movie, should not be taken seriously. Wright also employed a lot of CGI to really make the film feel like a comic book. I feel that a lot of these techniques were really fresh, innovative, and even, at times, funny. In the end, Edgar Wright's ""Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World"" remains an impressively entertaining adaption of the popular comic book series."

","I loved this weird and wonderful movie, directed by Shaun Of The Dead's Edgar Wright, and starring Michael Cera (playing Scott as his stock character, albeit less of a loser than usual) and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Ramona (and a couple of honorary mentions for Ellen Wong as Knives and Kieran Culkin as flatmate Wallace - both very funny). It doesn't conveniently fit any category. It's not a comedy, although it's very funny. It's not a teen romance, although there's a strong element of that. It's not a superhero movie or a computer game movie, although both of those aspects are well represented (without any explanation, which was another thing I loved about it). And it's not a comics movie, although it is sourced from a comic (sorry, graphic novel) and, again this is clearly a major influence on how it is delivered.<br/><br/>In short, it is that rarity - entirely its own thing, and an absolute delight.<br/><br/>PS I'm 58, so you don't have to be that young to appreciate it, thank you very much all you young ageist whippersnappers."
"mhlong","7","0","2","5 July 2011"," A mildly enjoyable waste of an afternoon
","I usually don't write reviews of fairly current, reasonably popular movies (I tend to like the odd older theatrical and TV fare), but after reading some of the message board posts, I felt the desire to toss in my 2¢ worth. I'm an 'older' movie lover having played my first arcade game around 1962 (baseball, with a real ball and a levered bat, I won 2 free games but my mother pulled me away). <br/><br/>Anyway, the first time I saw Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, I came in about evil-ex #2, so I didn't catch the set-up. But it didn't take me long to figure out that this movie was a fantasy, not reality, and the world it portrayed was based on arcade/video games. I appreciate plots and locations that shift reality around so long as they stay true to the newly invented world. To me, SPvsTW stayed that way.<br/><br/>Basically, the story follows that very old tried and true plot device, boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. (btw, this could work for both girls Scott is currently interested in, Ramona AND Knives, depending on how you like your ending!) That can be okay, but only if there is something interesting going on. And with Scott Pilgrim now having to defeat the seven evil exes of his current girlfriend one (or two) at a time, in order to win her over, there is. <br/><br/>On a secondary level, it follows pretty much the outline for what used to be called a screwball comedy – unconventional, goes in different directions, behaves in unexpected ways (wikipedia). And more importantly it features not just one female character 'rarely seen in movies' but a number of very strong female characters each of whom is fairly capable of 'holding her own'. And it is close to being a sex comedy without the sex with the couple being obviously mismatched with the male further down the (economic or 'cool') scale than the woman (again it works for both Ramona and Knives). Oh, and witty repartee. An almost perfect fit - a screwball comedy for the 21st century.<br/><br/>One aspect that keeps the interest, is that in this 'arcade' game, Scott Pilgrim like in any good Adventure (yes, I played Colossal Cave a lot), has to use both his strength and his wits in totally different ways in order to defeat his opponents at each level. And the fights were very good, from a great graphic Battle of the Bands to figuring out how to hit a female without looking uncool, to tricking an opponent into making foolish mistakes (and being punished for them!), to Scott finally understanding how he should have been all along.<br/><br/>I found the ending somewhat of a surprise in that the viewer is almost led to believe one result will take place and then it's changed at the last second which goes with the basic screwball comedy concept.<br/><br/>Besides having a wealth of strong female roles, I also think this will be a great movie to come back to in later years to see a lot of future stars in early roles, as well as wondering where are they now for others, much like 'Magnificent Seven, American Graffiti, St. Elmo's Fire, have done for successive past generations of movie goers. I want to see Allison Pill, Ellen Wong, Kieran Culkin, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Aubrey Plaza, Brandon Routh, Chris Evans, Brie Larson in later films (like I already have Anna Kendrick).<br/><br/>My favorite line which cracks me up every time is Gideon (the token villain) saying, 'Do you know how long it took me to get all the evil exes' contact information? Two hours! TWO HOURS!' (has Jason Schwartzman used something similar in 'Bored to Death'? That line could easily have come from his character there.) That and every utterance (and facial gesture or lack thereof!) by Allison Pill were very funny.<br/><br/>Some drawbacks because it's not a perfect movie (few are), Michael Cera (Scott Pilgrim) needs to work the camera better enlarging his range of emotions, most of the females and some of the males easily upstaged him. Some of the fights went on a little too long. Since I came in late for my first viewing (I've seen it 2 or 3 times since), I assumed Ellen Wong (Knives) was playing her real age, because she looked like a 20 something (except for very early in the movie with her longer hair in that ponytail sort of 'do'), so I had some problems accepting that set up when I finally caught the opening sequences.<br/><br/>For someone who has enjoyed the arcade/video gaming scene for a long time, I found it a very amusing pleasant brain-candy type of movie, (like The Fifth Element for instance), strictly an entertaining waste of 2 hours. A solid 7."

","There's two aspects you'll want to consider when seeing this movie: Number 1, did you play video games in the '80s and/or '90s? And number 2, are you a nerd? <br/><br/>If you answered no to either of those questions you'll still enjoy the movie, and you'll likely laugh throughout the film, but just know, you aren't the target audience. This movie is layered from top to bottom with wonderful references and gags that just fills a shameless nerd, like myself, with pure, unadulterated glee. Literally from the opening titles of this film I was laughing, and when I wasn't laughing I was grinning like an idiot. There were several times when I was laughing so hard that I could no longer see or hear the movie. <br/><br/>The only flaw with this film is that it was perhaps too funny, and that you were laughing too much that the emotion behind the love story never really sank all the way in. However, the sheer amount of humor in this movie makes it a very minor issue. <br/><br/>This is likely the last, best movie that's coming out until November of this year so go see it, please? This movie really deserves to be much higher up in box office scores than it currently is, so go help it out. I think you'll have a good time, besides, what else are you going to do?

","I had been dying to watch this movie for ages and yesterday I could finally be bothered to see it. It had a great plot (very unique!) and some great actors. I thought in particular Cera and Windstead's performances were very credible. I liked the fact that it was laid back and funny, it was also appropriate for my age group too. It is a good family film to watch as my Mum saw the trailer and thought it looked awful but she actually really liked the film in the end. There were some references which made me surprised that it wasn't a 15 but overall I would say that Scott Pilgrim V. the World is a great film if you like to just chill and watch a movie.

"dfranzen70","8","0","2","2 May 2011"," A non-superhero-comic-book movie that is really good
","Scott Pilgrim has a fun storyline buttressed by great characterizations and invigorating special effects that don't seem at all gimmicky or tacked on. Styled almost exactly like the graphic novel on which it's based, it permits the viewer to suspend disbelief with some degree of plausible deniability; that is, we're not asked to believe the impossible or even highly improbable, like using two sports cars to rip the door off a safe.<br/><br/>Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a bass player in a garage band. Scott's 22 and is now dating a 17-year-old high school student named Knives Chau (Ellen Wong). That may seem unorthodox at first, but bear in mind that Michael Cera looks like he's 16 anyway, so it's not as stark a contrast as it may seem. Anyway, Knives thinks Scott's awesome, and he just sort of tolerates her. They haven't even kissed.<br/><br/>But then one night at a party, Scott sees Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a purple-coiffed drifter with a blasé attitude that belies something... well, something dark and mysterious, if nothing else. And Scott does everything he can to find out more about Ramona, much to the chagrin of his bandmates, his gay roommate (Kieran Culkin), and his sister (Anna Kendrick).<br/><br/>Okay, cutting to the chase. Turns out that although the worldly Ramona does sorta-kinda like Scott, she has issues. Like evil exes. And so the crux of the story comes about - Scott must defeat her seven evil exes. How? Well, with kung fu, karate, judo, other fighting styles, and various weapons. Why? Well, to win her heart, of course! Oh, did you want more details than that? Let's just say that Scott Pilgrim is essentially a video game based on a graphic novel. There are levels (each ex representing one level); beat the level/ex, you move on to the next one, and so on. Each ex has special powers; so do you, just like in a video game. And when you beat them, they don't lay there all bloody and whatnot; they turn into gold coins. Just like in real life! One of the truly entertaining aspects of the movie is how director Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead) integrates this video-game mentality into the plot line seamlessly. Characters don't act astounded that someone can shoot fire from their hands or fly through the air or cause demons to emerge from a DJ board. It's expected. And Scott Pilgrim himself isn't amazed that he can kick butt with his... well, with his feet. Which is how you kick things. So add in the video-game effects and then a splash of Batman (1966) sound effects, complete with the onomatopoeic words appearing above the action. Lovely visual touch.<br/><br/>The movie is witty, too. It's not just a series of wacky adventures peppered with impossible effects. Pilgrim is no hero - he's cheating on two women! - but is just likable enough to be a real protagonist. He's more a victim of his own desires. He tries his best to be everything to everyone, which isn't a role that Michael Cera is unfamiliar with. I mean, he looks wimpy but engaging, sort of like a beagle. He gets to fight some excellent exes, too, like Chris Evans as a hubristic actor (complete with stunt doubles!) and Jason Schwartzman as the Machiavellian proto-jerk villain.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim is a solidly different film. It's part action, part comedy, big part whimsy. It's daring and unconventional, and from a purely visual standpoint is really remarkably made. It's exciting and entertaining."
"geometroid","9","0","5","23 March 2011"," A simple story.. boy meets girl.. boy must defeat 7 evil exes
","""Not so long ago...in the mysterious land...Of Toronto Canada...Scott Pilgrim was dating a high schooler..."" This is a fairly innocuous opening for a movie that, if you like it, has the capacity to leave you very emotionally wrung out.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is not exactly simple, but not incomprehensible either. Scott Pilgrim is dating Knives Chou, a Chinese high-school girl in an attempt to escape his loneliness following a brutal breakup. Scott is a slacker who lives with his ""cool gay roommate"" just across the street from his childhood home and is in a band called Sex Bob-omb which is involved in The Toronto Battle of the Bands. Things are going fairly well until Life gets more complicated when Scott meets his (literal) dream girl Ramona and gets more and more entangled in a web of her baggage and his own.<br/><br/>About a half-hour into this movie Scott discovers he must defeat Ramona's seven evil exes and thus begins a strange odyssey across a video game landscape while also juggling his band, Knives, Ramona and the complexities of his own big ex showing up in the middle of it all.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie several times and seeing such bitterness on the message boards I can see how it might be hard for the average movie hunter to figure out whether they should spend their time here. The best way I can think of to guide the average moviegoer is through a series of negations. Number one: If you think the Legend of Zelda is an autobiography of the author of The Great Gatsby, then you may want to skip this one. Two, If you think that I am about to spell Mortal Kombat wrong then you may want to stay clear. Three, if you have trouble with movies that think realism is something that happens to other movies then you will want to stay FAAAAR away from this one. Four, if you don't like comic book type movies then you might want to steer clear because this film is very conscious of its graphic novel roots.<br/><br/>Lastly, and on a more serious note, if you think that post-modernism is a movie ""Being weird for the sake of being weird"" then you won't understand this movie and probably shouldn't even attempt it. This movie has more meta-jokes, gimmicks and effects then a movie with its premise has a real right to. That being said however, under all that there is a genuine story being told. The relationships become more and more complicated as the film goes on and in the end it is the characters that won me over and not the tricks.<br/><br/>If you have survived the above cuts and are still interested in seeing this movie then it is you all seven of you evil-ex lovin' B@#$tards that this movie is for. Everyone else can go watch something else.<br/><br/>Two small things are worth mentioning as standing out for me. One, having had a nasty breakup in my own past (and it WAS brutal) I have never seen a movie that depicts the way guys feel when they are broken hearted. You sort of float along, people yell things at you, you sometimes forget where you are I almost walked in front of a bus once. This film's first half hour or so hits this right on the nose. Another thing that relates to this is that it helps if you have been through a nasty breakup (not compulsory, but it helps) so the people on the forums who are watching this movie with their nine year old children should realize that, what with video game references that are from the 80's and early 90's and a rather adult (maybe not mature but adult) storyline, this probably means that prepubescent kids are NOT the target audience here.<br/><br/>Secondly, I hate Culkins, I have loathed them since Home Alone, so when I say that Kieran Culkin was the one I enjoyed the most (and I'm a big fan of Jason Schwartzman too) you can appreciate just how good he was in here. I hate that.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see a movie that's fun, has a story, is funny and filled with geek culture references (this movie should be required watching for ANY fan of The Big Bang Theory) and can stand a little blatant reality twisting, give this a try. Keep in mind though that it is not for everyone. It just was for me.<br/><br/>Note: This rating would be 9/10 but when I rented it from a company that shall remain nameless, the special features were listed but not accessible, movies that do this should be punished. If I had liked the movie less I would have removed two or possibly three stars but one will do here.<br/><br/>8/10"
"tas22","8","0","5","22 March 2011"," Surprisingly good
","I know this movie flopped, and frankly I don't see how the studio thought that this was ever going to be a mass market hit: the target audience is really quite narrow. However, I thought it was warm, heartfelt, and funny, with a nice dose of kick-ass. It helps to know something about the source material and about the video-game references, mostly from the 80s to early 90s. A common criticism leveled at the movie was that the characters were underdeveloped; I think that this was intentional, given the scope of the movie. The characters mostly functioned as archetypes, avatars in a video game. No one expects emotional depth from a video game.<br/><br/>Michael Cera - yes, yes his range is nonexistent - does a nice job with Scott Pilgrim, and displays some more pronounced emotions than he did in the past. His costars outshone him on most occasions, especially Kieran Culkin as Wallace, Scott's roommate. Snarky wit with more heartfelt undertones - Wallace is undoubtedly my favorite character in the film. Ellen Wong (Knives Chau) invested a very limited character with some depth and real emotion, especially at the close of the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Ramona Flowers) functions as the epitome of an object of hipster male desire and adequately fulfills that role, but she wasn't tremendously appealing to me.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were perhaps a little too long, but always very interesting visually. The effects were very well done. The soundtrack was amazing, both the songs and the score and enhanced the action greatly. All in all, the movie was tremendously fun and held my interest throughout. I was very pleased."

","I have a theory - there are two kinds of movie; the kind where you engage your brain and soak the movie up like a good book, and the other where you disengage your mind and let it wash over you as an experience. Scott Pilgrim is mostly about the experience, with our hero being a geeky, dorky heart-breaker forced to defeat his new girlfriend's exes in fight scenes more reminiscent of Manga than Hollywood action movies.<br/><br/>I personally really enjoyed this film, and watched it without having seen any trailers, reviews and what-not. If you decide to check the other reviews posted here, please skip over the wordy, self-indulgent, overly serious ones - these reviewers should check out a nice fun film like Taxi Driver for their style of reviewing instead!<br/><br/>After having seen a stupid number of films both English language and foreign, never discounting any type of movie, except maybe a certain flavour of US comedy (romantic comedies and the mainstream slapstick that's made for dumb-dums), I have to say that I found this quite refreshing, not taking itself too seriously on any level unlike many, many films crammed with excessive posing and ""cool"" one-liners.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs The World makes for a very different experience to most movies, and has more in common with manga, martial arts and 80's pop-culture movies, with video-game references splattered throughout, and probably won't be ""got"" by everyone.<br/><br/>Initially I found the lead, Michael Cera to be quite dorky and a little bit wet behind the ears, and the dialogue a bit vague. But then the craziness kicked in, I grasped the intent of the film, disengaged my brain, laughed out loud frequently, and forgot about everything else.<br/><br/>Visually and sonically, this does great justice to it's manga/video game references, and having come away from reading Manga moments before, I was massively pleased by the style imbued throughout. I thought the cast were well chosen for their parts, with moments of almost inconsequential non-dialogue between characters, and utterly dry, deadpan delivery at others, with no actor taking themselves too seriously. The self-awareness that pervades US comedy acting was thankfully muted in this movie - I can't stand it when comedy thinks that it's funny before it's delivered the 60th punchline in as many seconds (to the makers of Family Guy - you're just too desperate to make me laugh, and end up failing miserably with your back to back lines!).<br/><br/>I truly believe that this is a love it or hate it film, crammed with references and visual touches lifted straight from Manga, Video game and Pop-culture (with love), made to bring much dryness, fun and colour to movie-goers. To the makers of this movie -<br/><br/>Please can I have some more like this?....<br/><br/>-it goes REALLY well between the serious stuff that I also enjoy watching!"
"rparham","8","0","3","12 March 2011"," Visually striking and fun to boot
","Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a stylistic smorgasbord that draws inspiration from a few key genres and pop culture elements, most specifically video games and music. I have heard it described in one corner as parody, but that I would say is incorrect. It is more a love letter to its influences, albeit with a comic bent, for certain. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is an entertaining film that will play well to a certain segment of the population, and, unfortunately, at the box office it seemed that segment was smaller than many wished.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is based off a series of comics written by Brian Lee O'Malley. I am unfamiliar with the source material, so I can't comment on the faithfulness to them. The centerpiece is young Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera), who is playing in a band named Sex Bob-Omb and has recently started dating a younger girl named Knives Chou (Ellen Wong). Into Scott's life falls Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a girl with constantly shifting hair color (she claims it changes every week and half) who Scott encounters in dreams before she turns out to be very corporeal and not just a figment of Scott's imagining. Scott, smitten, begins a relationship with her, but quickly finds that Ramona has some significant baggage: a group of 7 evil exes (don't just say ex- boyfriends, by the way) who have joined forces to fight against Scott in an attempt to reclaim Ramona for themselves. Scott, while not enamored of the concept, does his best to step up to plate as he wants to keep Ramona to himself.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World lives in a very fantasy reality that closely resembles our own. At first, it just looks like an everyday city with drama that most of us can relate to. It doesn't take long before we realize that things are not exactly as they are in our world. Dreams turn into reality, and then evil exes swoop out of the sky and challenge Scott to a duel, involving lots of martial arts fighting, flying, and comic book style expressions of action (the words POW and BANG float into view when someone fights or something crashes, for instance) and as Scott faces off with his opponents, a visual score tally appears, complete with video game sounds. So, if realism is what you seek, then it would be best to pass on Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. If, however, you enjoy video games and comic books, then Scott Pilgrim might be your speed.<br/><br/>Director and co-writer Edgar Wright, who previously brought us Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, keeps his tongue firmly in his cheek with Scott Pilgrim. It is obviously not designed to take seriously, but it also wouldn't be fair to classify it an out and out comedy. It has its share of laughs, to be sure, but also is awash in visually striking, well choreographed fight sequences that rival such films as The Matrix in their energy and style. Its look is also heavily stylized, filled with obvious references to comic books without going to same degree as Ang Lee did with his take on the Hulk, which featured panels around the scenes in many cases.<br/><br/>What makes Scott Pilgrim even more rewarding is that, for the most part, we identify and are taken in with its lead characters. Scott is a basically nice guy who seems a bit on the nerdy side, yet isn't without his flaws. Ramona seems a bit more jaded by life, and meeting Scott thaws her a bit from her rather troubled life up to this point. The dialogue between the two is lively and Cera and Winstead have an easy chemistry that works well.<br/><br/>Wright has managed to fill many of the supporting roles, especially some of the evil exes, with names that are not superstars, but recognizable players that all offer up amusing turns in their various roles. Chris Evans, Brandon Routh and Jason Schwartzman all are having fun with their roles, and there is also a degree of satire in each character in regards to their chosen career and lifestyle (actor, vegan musician, and indie rock promoter).<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is an entertaining film that didn't find its audience in the theater, but on video, it would not surprise me, especially considering who the film is targeted at, that it would eventually develop a cult following. Again, while I don't think Scott Pilgrim is everyone's cup of tea, if you have an affinity for what Scott Pilgrim draws from, and an ability to suspend disbelief, then I would say it is more than worth a look."

","From Edgar Wright (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz), a fresh director with his finger on the comedic pulse, comes Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, an original, unconventional and interesting meld of several genres you wouldn't expect to work well in conjunction with one another, but actually complement each other nicely to produce a very entertaining two hours.<br/><br/>Socially-awkward-but-somehow-a-woman-magnet Scott Pilgrim is the bassist for aspiring band Sex Bo-bomb, who meets the mysterious Ramona Flowers once in his dream, then again during a live show. They hit it off, but before the relationship can get serious he must defeat her seven evil ex's (not just limited to ex-boyfriends, either). Intertwined within all this is his current girlfriend Knives, who takes action into her own hands in this unlikely game of cat-and-mouse.<br/><br/>If you wanted to make things really simple, and tried hard enough, you could look at any single film and justify which two films that came before it are, in fact, its illegitimate parents. This much is true for Scott Pilgrim. It combines the offbeat, new age & contemporary humour of Mean Girls with the bizarre, risk-taking cinematic style seen in Natural Born Killers. Many of its similarities to the former can be attributed to what is at least a half-decent screenplay, and definitely the most ambitious script of any film currently out. Writers Bacall and Wright employ quick wit and, although many of the jokes do possess a hit-or-miss factor, much of the humour is well constructed whether it be a case of art imitating life, or some insane set piece involving superpowers and epic battles.<br/><br/>As for the latter, there is no doubt in my mind that this film took as much inspiration from Oliver Stone's twisted fairytale as it did from the Scott Pilgrim comic itself. The entire film is essentially a video game come to life, with a heap of fourth-wall-breaking, self-reflexive techniques that, for all their simplicity, have never been seen before on such a mainstream level. Honourable mentions must go to Scott's 'battle' with second evil ex Lucas Lee, as well as an excellent scene referencing Seinfeld, displaying the theme music, conversational tone and plot of the show briefly for no other reason than to entertain.<br/><br/>The film did have its negatives, and I'll start with the most pressing issue: Michael Cera. Here we have an actor who, in his few years in the industry, has become typecast like no other actor before him. Once again, he plays the nervous, wimpy teenager; the only difference being his character is actually 22. He is not necessarily terrible in Scott Pilgrim, but his performance suffers tremendously from its stale aftertaste, mainly because we've seen it all before.<br/><br/>Also, some people may take offence with the implied moral of this film. A friend who didn't enjoy the film for this reason (among others) actually summed it up quite well: 'cheating on your girlfriend is OK if the new one is hot enough.' Personally, I'm all about suspending disbelief while watching a movie and judging it on its on-screen efforts, rather than criticizing the way in which some people may interpret it wrongly. But, as mentioned, this can be an issue, and so had to be raised accordingly. However, if you appreciate innovation and directors who think outside the box, actually making the effort to make a film stand out as one of their own, I recommend Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"
"tubby1","7","0","3","21 January 2011"," The Scott Pilgrim Experience
","Scott Pilgrim is a heavily stylised mesh of arcade and comic exuberance. It's bold and eye-catching graphics certainly give this film memorability, and helps transport the film into a playful and wistful world. However, for all its enjoyment it is the foreknowing of events which hamper the Scott Pilgrim experience.<br/><br/>In terms of enjoyment, Scott Pilgrim excels early on with its charming flare and originality. It is very youthful, refreshing and dynamic in the way it strings scenes together. As well as providing this visual experience there is a constant stream of witty interplay. This is most visibly conveyed by the wonderful Michael Cera who excels as Scott Pilgrim with his goofy and radiant charm offensive.<br/><br/>Where Scott Pilgrim fails is when we understand that he must fight 'Seven Evil Xs'. Once the first two contests have passed, it becomes a film of re-treading, and although it conjures different effects to each contest it becomes less of a thrill and its adolescent vibrancy becomes regrettably diluted.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim certainly entertains, and if it had managed to cut half-an-hour from the film or reduce the number of 'Evil Xs' it could have been a really enjoyable roller-coaster of a ride. It is a film which I recommend seeing as it is so originally brought to life and a rather refreshing movie experience. The film does have heart, and although Scott Pilgrim might not of won over the world, and it does lose its initial momentum, it did win me over."
"eatfirst","9","0","3","18 January 2011"," Cool, funny, geeky, madcap, wacky comic book adaptation that gets it nearly all Wright.
","While Kick-Ass was busy gobbling up the lion's share of the attention and Daily Mail outrage, there was another genre-bending alt-superhero comedy mash-up last summer that rather slid under the radar, which is a great shame as, while it may not be as in-your-face outrageous, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a more engaging, funny and sprightly movie that mysteriously failed to storm the summer box office in the face of bigger, badder, swearier competition.<br/><br/>A geek's paradise, Scott Pilgrim is chock full of gamer references, 8- bit sound-bites, and teen-rocking wannabee heroics, however what makes it more than the sum if its slacker culture nods and winks is a genuine warmth and affection for its inhabitants and their world. Brit helmer Edgar Wright, who showed he knows a thing or two about game-obsessed overgrown boys in Sean Of The Dead, tackles his first transatlantic mega-budget project with a breezy lightness; blending together bitter- sweet moments of awkward teen romance, and heart embiggening scenes of rock & roll camaraderie along with the madcap fights, and surreal flights of fancy.<br/><br/>The young cast, headed by eternal dweeb plus ultra Michael Cera, are largely excellent, with quirky but likable supporting roles given the same care and attention as our eponymous hero. As a teen ensemble comedy it recalls the films of John Hughes, such is the ease with which it takes its outlandishly fantastical premise and grounds it with deft, easygoing character work.<br/><br/>On the minor negative side, the film is rather undisciplined, being about twenty minutes longer than needed, with an occasional repetitious tendency brought on by its own multi-life, game-level structure, and somewhat lacks a solid dramatic shape as a result. But with so many charming, engaging characters and a sharp, witty script overflowing with quotable banter and inventive non-sequitur moments, the movie carries its excess baggage with a light touch and a giddy energy that is hard to resist."
"Thomasamills","9","0","3","12 January 2011"," And The Winner Is........ Edgar Write
","When I first saw the trailer for Scoitt Pilgrim vs The World, I was disappointed. The cast looked great and I am a fan of Edgar Write, but there was just something that was not grabbing me and making me want to see it. The film came and went at the cinema, and although many positives reviews from critics and friends of mine who had seen the film were praising it, for some reason I never got round to seeing it. When the DVD was released I bought it hoping for the best, but not expecting much. Well Scott Pilgrim showed me how wrong I was to ignore it at the cinema. It was the most fun I have had watching a film in a long time.<br/><br/>The film follows Scott (wonderfully played by Michael Cera)as he finds himself falling in love with Romana (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). This is a problem for a number reasons. It distracts him from his band who are trying to make it big, He is already in a relationship with a girl who is still in high school and the main problem is Romona's seven evil ex's. The film follows Scott as he tries to overcome these problems whilst trying to make Romona stay in love with him.<br/><br/>The film is full of great performances from the whole cast, including Chris Evens and Brandon Routh. Each actor creates a memorable character, which makes the film a real joy to watch. The quirky one liners are funny and the films constant references to arcade games keeps the light hearted fun of the film alive. The person who should be getting the credit is Edgar Wright. This film shows that he is a very versatile director who can do more then British comedies. This film will hopefully open new doors or him as he is a true talent with a lot to offer.<br/><br/>Even though the trailers put me off, I really enjoyed Scott Pilgrim vs The World. It deserves to be known as a cult classic in years to come, and hopefully it will be. Scott Pilgrim vs the world, and the winner is Edgar Wright."
"Jonny_Numb","8","0","4","10 January 2011"," Many Levels Above
","""Scott Pilgrim vs the World"" is the most visually stunning and elaborate film taken from the pages of a graphic novel since ""Watchmen."" Actually, it's probably the most visually stunning film, period, since ""Watchmen."" And even more so, it is a prime example of cinema's ability to reconfigure familiar tropes (in this case, the Romantic Comedy run through the John Hughes/Diablo Cody hipster-slang script machine) into a finished whole that transcends nearly all crippling convention. Like Hughes and Cody, the language of ""Scott Pilgrim"" is distinctive, pop-culture savvy, and with a unique heart under its glossy, showy surface. Who knew that Edgar Wright, the promising director of such quaint-by-comparison genre homages as ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" had the capability to wield extravagant digital effects (with more dexterity than most high-budget filmmakers) in a film that sets a new precedent for hip romantic comedies? Scott Pilgrim (perpetual adolescent Michael Cera, typecast to his advantage here), the bass player in a struggling indie band, is getting over his last girlfriend by dating an Asian high-schooler; when he notices the neon bob of a steampunk rollerblader (the wonderfully deadpan Mary Elizabeth Winstead) one day, he becomes fixated on winning her over. Little does Scott suspect that this enticing babe has 7 ex-boyfriends he must lay to waste in order to claim her hand (and thus proving that chivalry is not dead). The film's setup takes some adjustment (with an emphasis on superimposed factoids about characters, comic-book sound effects, and storyboard panels laying out certain plot details), but by the time Scott is thrust into his first battle (not ironically at his band's first gig), Wright's approach establishes itself as something to be reckoned with -- these guys don't fight with traditional fisticuffs; they fight with the impossibly slick maneuvers of joystick-controlled video game Spartans. While it may sound eye-rolling in print, the choreography is smoothly rendered and edited with a precision that keeps us firmly rooted in the action; and better yet, Wright finds new ways to tweak and spin this fresh, candy-colored technique over the remainder of the film, so that it never gets tedious. By its close, ""Scott Pilgrim"" has given us an incendiary tale of romance and intrigue, never sacrificing character or story for the sake of mere visual dazzle. It surprises me to say, but I think it's the best movie of 2010."

","A deaf person would get as much from this film as anyone else, from first frame to the credits the screen is chock filled with colour and most sounds are spelled on the screen.<br/><br/>We get right into the film from the first sequence, it is band rehearsal for the Sex Bob-Ombs, as each band member appears on screen his/her vitals are listed for the audience, this happens at various times through the film, other touches include brief cutaways and written narration and segues, the intent is to always keep things moving swiftly at all times.<br/><br/>Scott is 22 and in that phase of not having a steady anything, no job, prospects, direction or relationship. But today he has informed the clan of his new girlfriend, a schoolgirl no-less. A Chinese schoolgirl in fact named Knives Chow. The band view this as a short lived act of desperation by Scott that can't and won't last.<br/><br/>Knives in doe-eyed and energetic, desperately wanting to be adult and part of the ""scene"", she instantly becomes the band's #1 fan. Scott and Knives don't as much date as play-date, video arcades and music stores are their haunts, and hand holding is as far as the romance goes.<br/><br/>All this changes when Scott glimpses a purple haired girl one day and is instantly besotted despite knowing nothing about her. A little homework later and he and Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) meet. Despite his sorta-girlfriend Scott asks Ramona out and after some awkward moments and a near first date home run they are officially on...<br/><br/>Complicating matters though is the continued presence of Knives, both the band and Scott's gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin) tell Scott to break it off with Knives immediately if he is serious about this new coloured hair alterna-vixen.<br/><br/>And he was gonna, but the battle of the bands is coming to decide which band is rockin' enough to get a record contract from the mythical producer G Man. Now it was a crazy film to this point, but halfway through the first battle of the bands it gets crazier and never lets up from there. The walls explode mid-song and a young man flies in, informs Scott that he is Matthew Patel and immediately gets Street Fighter on Scott's ass.<br/><br/>A mid-fight speech informs Scott that to be with Ramona he must first deal with the League of Evil Ex's, of which Patel is the first, all of whom have had dealings with Ramona in the past...<br/><br/>The remainder of the film deals with Scott attempting to do just that.<br/><br/>The evil Ex's are all quite cartoony and over the top, in fact only Ramona appears semi-normal in this film despite all the insane goings around - and largely because - of her. Winstead plays her with the impassive resignation that apparently encapsulates Gen Y and is both spunky and annoying at various times.<br/><br/>Each level-boss equivalent necessitates a fierce one on one battle, some of which are waged with fists and feet, others instruments and still others with dual dragons taking on a huge monkey. Upon completion of each ""level"" Scott gains points and coins that appear from the exploded victims... yes it is exactly that kind of film.<br/><br/>Every frame is packed with colour and action, there are dozens of musical cues from classic games like Super Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog throughout, and many more that I obviously didn't get, and in true video game fashion the defeated foes are never on screen for long as they vanish, or again explode into coins.<br/><br/>Michael Cera's ""I'm clumsy and sorta whisper my lines almost apologetically but darn it I'm a nice guy"" routine will get old fast - but it works yet again here. Ellen Wong is spunky (and jail-bait-ey) as Knives, spawning a chat-room handle for thousands of young Asian girls, Chris Evans and Satya Bhabha steal scenes as evil Ex's, but the surprise for me was Kieren Culkin as Wallace. Wry and sarcastic, he is nonetheless very loyal to Scott and always there for him, he's just not that into or involved when he doesn't really have to be. Wallace gets a lot of laughs in the film, and almost all of the sex, something the pre-teens in the screening I went to weren't capable of dealing with (none is on screen, don't panic).<br/><br/>I wanted to love Scott Pilgrim and at times I really did, it is breathlessly inventive and unbelievably creative, everything is filmed and edited in a way like no film I have seen before. In fact the only stylistic comparison I could come up with was Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure crossed with Crank and produced by Speed Racer, and that's still a ways off the mark. I found myself grinning throughout, the sheer audacity and creativity often makes it impossible not to be impressed... even in bits where I got a little lost or there was simply too much going on.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim Vs the World is most definitely one of a kind, just the kind that will appeal more to gamers than anyone else, but even more than that gamers of the 80s and 90s who will get most of the references continued within. It works well if viewed as just a film, but needs a basic understanding of the subject matter to be more than that.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 8 / 10. The beauty of Edgar Wright is that he is only in his mid 30s and has already made three excellent flicks, we hopefully have 20 years more to enjoy his output."
"moviemaniac008","9","0","3","22 December 2010"," Visual video game experience is great!
","Movies turned video games have a tendency to suck a lot more than they should, though many of them do have great potential to be turned in video games. Video games turned into movies have a tendency to suck as well, but in a good way. I have no idea why, but more often than not, a movie adaptation of a video game manages to entertain me. As a result, I enjoyed Prince of Persia : The Sands of Time (though not being a great film) and Doom (I rated Doom a 9.0 back when I was a snotty little 12 year-old brat, but even today Doom can still manage to entertain me). When I first saw a trailer for this before the excellent Toy Story 3 this summer, the first thing I said to myself was ''Damn this is gonna suck'', and even when the first reviews, who were mainly over positive, came out, I still wasn't interested in viewing this film. But having rented this film just a few hours ago, and in fact just a few minutes after the viewing, I thought I might just write a review for it.<br/><br/>I've never read a Scott Pilgrim comic before, so I can't exactly say how faithful the film is to the comic books. But from what I saw in the movie, the story was great. We've all seen this story before, of an ordinary guy who is in love with a girl, but who must stand up to her boyfriend (usually two or three times the main character's size) in order to win her heart. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World makes our hero, an everyday normal guy (played by Cera, an actor I like very much), fall in love with crazy, colourful-haired Ramona (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). But to gain her love, he must defeat her ''Seven evil x's'' (yes you read right. Not ex-boyfriends, just X's).<br/><br/>Straight on you can say that the cast is perfect for this kind of film. It's really hard to see anybody else than Micheal Cera fill the shoes of Scott Pilgrim. He gives one of his most dynamic performances up to date, and he is definitely one of the good points of the film. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is an actress I did not know very well (besides her supporting role in ''Live Free or Die Hard''), but she also portrayed Ramona quite beautifully. In fact all the actors in this film play their roles to the maximum without ever over acting, they just always seem to have the right amount of character in their roles.<br/><br/>This is a film that will probably appeal mostly to teenage boys (like me) and their parents, who grew up during the NES generation. Back when the consoles only had a two-dimensional Mario character who would jump once in a while to get a penny, or stomp an evil mushroom. Being 14 years old (soon going on 15 :D), I am a person who, before buying his first console at the age of 9 (a Nintendo Gamecube), played with his dad's old NES. Even today, when I'm not on X-Box Live playing Madden, Call of Duty, NHL or a variety of other titles, I do plug out this old NES and, believe it or not, I do have a lot of fun with it. Therefore, those who have already experienced the NES will be delighted by the amount of references to old consoles this film makes. Whether the main character beats up bad guys and makes money out of it, or the opening Universal logo shown in 2-D, this film makes the most of gaming references.<br/><br/>Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead) also takes comic-book adaptation to a whole other level. This film has comic book adaptation written all over it, but that's mostly due to the references it makes to comic books when it is not referencing video games. The typical ''BAM!'' shown when the character hits a baddie. The visual effects were super, and though I'm not really a geek, I do have to say that Mary Elizabeth Winstead with her purple/blue/green hair was hot. Though some of the gags fell flat on a few occasions, most of them brought smiles, chuckles and laughs to me and my 10 year old sister. The visual effects were super. Definitely going to buy this one, and while this might be a real turn down for some, geeks and parents who experienced NES games and read many comic books during their youth should have a great time watching this film."

And yes, 90% of these movies include the ingredients that I have written above. Surprisingly, though, such movies are quite popular among teens (I'm not saying that this movie should not be seen by adults), even though we have all probably already seen loads of them.<br/><br/>What I probably liked the most about the movie, were the characters. They were picked out perfectly for this movie.<br/><br/>What disturbed me at this movie was the amount of video game stuff involved. Seriously, with every single ex that Scott was battling, there was some sort of special powers involved, and we've seen some sort of a battle as we would see it in 'Mortal Kombat'. Not to mention all the people turning into coins when being defeated. Probably that is because the movie is based on a comic book? Anyhow, leaving such stuff out of the movie would certainly raise my vote up to at least an eight.<br/><br/>Overally, it's definitely still a great movie, and I'm already looking to see a few more works of Edgar Wright."
"msbetav-3","7","0","3","7 December 2010"," People need to lighten up
","Some people may not get the whole idea of the movie and its style, which is fine, but does not make the movie bad.<br/><br/>Yes it is about video games, but even more, its about the setting. A basement-band with your friends in high school, girlfriends, ex boyfriends and girlfriends, a bunch of geeky stuff. Now given that you may have grown up in the 60's or 70's or maybe you just cant relate to the story, then obviously this isn't your kind of movie.<br/><br/>If you look past the style of the presentation, you get the main story. A young guy that is caught between women and can't make up his mind easily. He also has to deal with people that are telling him what to do, and boss him around a little. But the way it was presented makes this much more unique from the SAME OLD films about people in different situations. It is interesting because it is a different way of showing a simple story.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that this is the best movie however. Some parts left me hanging trying to figure out what was going on, and others did not have much explanation. Some scenes even seemed unnecessary. But what made this a decent movie in my opinion is figuring out what the story was about in the end. The last scenes is what put everything together to make sense (which some people do not like).<br/><br/>So overall, a decent movie if you play video games or have read comics, maybe relate to the basement-band scenario, and appreciate the art of the movie then you would probably like it."
"howard.schumann","9","0","5","4 December 2010"," Hyper energy to spare
","Michael Cera (Superbad, Juno) is Scott Pilgrim, an unemployed 22-year-old who plays bass guitar in a rock band known as the Sex Bob-omb in Edgar Wright's zany comedy Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. Scott is a scrawny kid who looks and acts like sixteen, yet he is a kung fu master with super powers who seems unusually adept at breaking the hearts of good looking women. While not to be confused with a timeless love story, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World delivers high energy entertainment, connecting with its audience through smart dialogue, heaping spoonfuls of fantasy, and tons of technical wizardry that is gape-worthy. Adapted from a series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley and set in the mysterious city of Toronto, Canada, the film may be geared to adolescents, but has appeal for anyone who ever had to fight for the thing/person they most desired.<br/><br/>While it does have a story, it is relatively unimportant compared to the plethora of sight gags, pop culture references, great rock music, CG, and wild combinations of comic book and video game camera tricks. Of course, there is no separation between fantasy and reality because the characters exist simultaneously in both worlds. As the film opens, Scott has a good thing going with 17-year old Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), a student at a Catholic high school, but is teased about his relationship by his gay roommate, Wally (Kieran Culkin), his sister Stacey (Anna Kendrick) and the other band members: Stephen Stills (Mark Webber), Young Neil (Johnny Simmons), and stoic-faced drummer Kim Pine (Alsion Pill) who Scott dumped some time ago.<br/><br/>Scott's relationship with Knives pulls up to a stop sign when he sees an attractive girl with flaming pink hair at the library. Introduced later at a party, he finds out that she is Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an attractive ex-New Yorker whose straight talk and down to earth manner belies her exaggerated appearance. Scott is ready to do almost anything to win her affections but to accomplish that, he must defeat her seven evil ex-boyfriends who do not take kindly to his romantic quest. One after another, Scott must take on the ""X's"" while the viewer must confront the ""O's"" as in ""O no! not another one."" Ramona's ex-boyfriends include dangerous-looking Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha) with whom she had a one week friendship in the seventh grade, beefed-up movie star Lucas Lee (Chris Evans), Todd Ingram, a loud-mouthed vegan (Brandon Routh) who looks at ""half and half"" as his mortal enemy, and Gideon Graves (Jason Schwartzman), a sleazy music producer with a cynical smile painted on his face. All of these ex-es engage Scott in comic book type battle royals with ""Pow!"" and ""Krak!"" along with ""Yeah Yeah Yeah"" seen on the screen as visual accompaniment to the high flying combatants. With each victory, Scott gets bonus points and advances to the next level while defeated opponents explode in a downpour of coins.<br/><br/>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World has hyper-energy to spare and surprisingly more humanity and fewer stereotypes than the typical Hollywood romantic comedy. Though the fighting trickery becomes repetitious and the smartass barbs become overly self-conscious, the film successfully mirrors the struggle of adolescents to find themselves and, yes, even confront themselves before they discover their place in the world. Although personally, I hoped that Scott would end up with a different girl, the film lets us know unequivocally that we do not get what we want in life unless we are willing to fight for it. Michael Cera is an acquired taste and has his detractors, but to me he has an honest, soulful quality that makes you root for him and believe him even when he haltingly says ""whatever"".<br/><br/>Is all the cartoonish violence a bit too much? Is the film too glitzy? Does it have too much style and too little substance? Are we beginning to see people in life merely as characters in a video game? I don't think so, but even if the answer to those questions is yes, this wacky little film is not designed to be taken seriously any more than you would consider Snow White as a representation of the house-bound submissive female, or Tarzan, a white child raised by Mangani great apes, as a completely well-adjusted adult without any discernible flaws."
"Floated2","8","0","3","3 December 2010"," Fresh, funny and doesn't pretend to be something it's not
","Scott Pilgrim vs the world has a fairly simple straight forward plot to follow. Its basically the same romance story we've seen before where boy meets girl, girl leaves boy, boy wants to get her back. But in Scott Pilgrim the film focuses much more on romance and that's what makes the film pretty good. There many nice fight scenes (esp. the ones at the end), and some good comedy. It was entertaining to watch because of its video-game, comic book style. Movies that are based on graphic novels, usually don't tend to be as great as the novels, and many times end up being different which causes many of the fans from the novels to feel cheated by the film. One thing I disliked was the continuity of gay jokes, and gay themes. It got tiring and annoying after a while.<br/><br/>However, Scott Pilgrim vs. the world is an exception. Having read a few of the novels, I can say that the film follows the comic book style great and is a great adaptation. The film is original, fresh, flashy and doesn't try being something its not. Many complains are that the film is too cheesy and hipster, but that's how the comics are. The film was also pretty funny- the dialogue was great too. In my opinion, the film starts off good, then drags a little towards the middle, then comes back strong towards the ending. This film is definitely not for everyone. Many may feel it as cheesy, and weird, but at the same time their will be a lot of fans. As a rewatch 05/21/17', the film feels more so dragged down and cheesy but in ways that is more so the appeal."

","Edgar Wright is one of the best directors of this decade. He has an extremely entertaining, funny and exciting body of work. From his work in television to his two movies in Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz he hasn't put a foot wrong. This is his latest offering. Scott Pilgrim is adapted from Brian Lee O'Mailey's comic book Scott Pilgrim which I must say is better than the film. Now I don't want to nitpick about the differences in plot but watching the movie made me realize that the movie has severe constraints that the comic didn't have and it could play around a bit more with the characters. The characters, situation and dialogue had more charm in the book that at some points did not translate well to the screen. This was evident in the scene where Scott's roommate tales Knives that she is too good for Scott. In the movie the scene almost made me cringe but if the roommate had been given a back-story then maybe it would have fitted better. Regardless Scott Pilgrim is a very good, entertaining and funny movie. Unlike other movies Edgar Wright has managed to retain the feel of the comic book while adding his own flavor and giving the movie a standing in its own right as a sort of companion piece to the comic book. The movie holds much charm for anyone below 25 and I guess the adults might enjoy it if they are the nostalgia types. You could call it the John Hughes movie of this decade. The acting is pretty good. Michael Cera is playing is usual role of the awkward guy. I guess it's his looks that give him these roles and eventually he will run out of them but till then he is doing a pretty good job of it. Overall Scott Pilgrim is great movie if you are looking for a good time, a popcorn entertainer that is actually funny and has a couple of laugh out loud moments. There is also a coming of age story involved. So anyone who likes Cera, videogames and the original comic book will like the movie. Others should give it a shot too, they just might be surprised!"

","This movie is not made for people who hate games or never played a video game in their life. Director's perspective of the Character (Scott Pilgrim) is depicted in a creative way. I feel that this is the best comic book adaptation to date!<br/><br/>***Some Spoilers below*** Scott Pilgrim is shown as a straight forward person who doesn't have the mental capacity to act or feel bad. He is shown as over the top nice guy. He loves this girl Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and to win her heart he needs to defeat her 7 ex-boyfriends. <br/><br/>The movie is a funny ride throughout without a single moment and Michael Cara executes his role nicely even all the cast does their job to perfection. The fight scenes and special effects are not overdone at all. I think that the movie will go down as a cult classic and its value will be cashed in after 10 years or so!<br/><br/>This is the first time ever I have taken time out to write a Movie Review (I have been visiting IMDb for over 5 years regularly). I felt like I have to write my opinion about this Awesome, Classic interpretation of a story/comic onto cinema."

","Exhausting and hilarious in the same way that 'I Heart Huckabees' was exhausting and hilarious, and resembling 'Eternal Sunshine' in its mix between naturalism and a liberated sense of visual surrealism, borrowing for the latter from a vast range of videogaming and comics culture, this is an inventive romantic comedy confident in its own 'aesthetic overload'. It's difficult to see how Wright wrote this without the editing stage already in mind â€“ like a lot of the invisible wipes in 'Pan's Labyrinth', it feels like almost every transition from one scene to the next here has been designed to draw our attention to its rhythmic wit and technical complexity, which brings with it an inevitably tiring effect as the film goes on (the fights become increasingly intrusive to the central romance), though if the facial muscles cannot accommodate any more laughter by the final third, they'll at least be in awe of the effort and sincerity of the film's makers.<br/><br/>Join idFilm: idfilm.proboards.com"
