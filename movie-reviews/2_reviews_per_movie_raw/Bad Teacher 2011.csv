","How many millions of dollars went into this which could have been used better in some other venture? Sour premise of a dope-smoking, opportunistic junior high school teacher who skates through her job, looking for a way to fund her breast augmentation job so she can land a rich boyfriend. Ends up committing several felonies & getting a stuffy but honest co-worker blamed for everything (including drug use on school grounds) while she wins the day. The redemption is her hooking up with an angry gym teacher when he proves the affluent guy she's sharking for is a shallow imbecile.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not the sort of person who demands a moral message in every piece of cinema, but really? Who is the target audience here? To whom are the filmmakers attempting to appeal? This is just vile."

","Bad Teacher is funny in ways it shouldn't be. Cameron Diaz owns the role of Elizabeth as the foul-mouthed, pot smoking, trashy blonde teacher with a twisted outlook on life. Obscenities and bizarre sexual innuendo roll off her tongue perfectly. Justin Timberlake is hilarious and awkward as Scott. His character is complex and....well he's just awkward....there's no other way to describe it. Lucy Punch is the perfect counterpart to both Diaz and Timberlake's characters as Amy Squirrel. Her over-the-top performance is one you will remember. Jason Segel steals every scene he's in as Russell the equally foul mouthed and dirty gym teacher. Phyllis Smith is an adorable and strange addition to the movie as the confused Lynn Davis, bringing her own brand of corkiness to the plot. All in all, the casting of Bad Teacher is flawless and is really where the movie shines. The punchlines are delivered with punch and the characters are decently developed and complex in their own ways. <br/><br/>There are some setbacks to Bad Teacher which stop it from being a great comedy. The plot devices used to move the story along are unconvincing and overplayed. Character transformations are equally unconvincing, uninspired, and rushed. Some scenes feel forced for the sake of cheap laughs or shock value. None of it though is shocking enough for this to be an effective method of comedy. Sometimes the characters feel a bit too weird even for the universe of strange the movie sets early on. Jason Segel's Russell is the most interesting character in the movie and yet for some reason is greatly underused. He pops up in pointless scenes simply to interject a laugh and then disappears for long stretches of time. <br/><br/>Bad Teacher is a funny movie. The critics have not been so generous with their reviews, but who listens to them anymore anyways? If you are into dark comedies or a raunchy brand of humor, you will find yourself laughing with this one. While the plot devices are forced and some of the humor could have been better with a more subtle approach, overall this is a decent flick to chill out on the couch and laugh with. 7/10"
"xyz72","8","68","105","6 November 2011"," Not a perfect movie, but much better than some reviews suggest.
","Let's face it, the reason many people call Bad Teacher the ""worst movie ever shot"" is not rational, it doesn't have to do with the movie itself in any way. From the reviews I have read on here the main problem seems to be the moral values in this film leading many ""oh so shocked"" viewers to give bad reviews, question people's sanity for producing this movie and hate everything about it - whether they admit it's the reason they dislike it or pretend to hate everything about an objectively well crafted film. But this movie is not supposed to teach anyone life lessons, it's not supposed to have some big, moral message about how to live your life in a good way. This is a film for adults. And films for adults do not have to follow certain morals because an adult is expected to judge morals on their own without needing guidelines. An adult can enjoy movies with main characters doing things they would never find acceptable because it's not about agreeing with the character's actions.<br/><br/>Normally, I would rate this film 6 stars, but I rated it 8 to keep some of the irrational reviews on here from bringing the score down too far. It has solid jokes, a mostly good cast, OK direction but also some really bad moments and the main character goes completely out of character towards the end to achieve the usual Hollywood ""we need a kiss! FAST!!!"" Happy Ending, but overall a good comedy I would watch again with a great performance from Cameron Diaz."

","I know others will disagree with me, but this has got to be in the running for the pick for the Razzies this year. What a pathetic piece of crap. The storyline was boring and the jokes either over-the-top, or, worst, not even close to funny. It never fails to amaze me when really bad ideas not only get to be screenplays, but they actually wind up getting produced. And...Timberlake's character...what was he thinking when he took this role??? Yeah, Diaz is still a hot body and all, but even that couldn't save something so downright dumb. I won't bother with any spoilers; it's not worth the effort. Save your money. This one will simply insult your intelligence. I would give it a minus one if I could."
"diac228","7","140","237","24 June 2011"," Let's hope they paid the actors more than the writers.....
","Bad Teacher is a great concept that resulted in a style of humor like most of the Adult Swim cartoons you see today: When the jokes hit they hit well, but when they miss, they miss quite badly. The cast was delightful, but could only go so far with the material. As a matter of fact, it was the cast that saved the movie from being a total disaster by providing their comedic chops, their charm, and their good comic timing that you don't see enough of nowadays. Despite all that however, Bad teacher is a shiny apple with a few rotten parts.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Hasley (Cameron Diaz) is a foul-mouthed, bitter, and quite nasty teacher that is keeping the job only to pay the bills after her rich fianc√©e dumps her. Facing debt, aging, and loneliness, Elizabeth starts setting her sights on a boob job and on a new (rich) teacher (Justin Timberlake), whom has also captured the attention of a manipulative rival (Lucy Punch). The script was helmed by two veteran writers of The Office (Gene Stupnitsky, Lee Eisenberg) as they use their non-television ratings boundaries to mix plenty of vulgar and raunchy humor with even some tidbits of cruel humor. Unfortunately, their lack of boundaries led to a mediocre script.<br/><br/>This film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved, the script was convoluted, and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact, the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs, with one notable exception involving one of the odder ""sex"" scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon, and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script; most notably the students, the gym teacher (Jason Segal) and the main character's roommate (Erik Stonestreet).<br/><br/>Despite the writing being a fickle mess, the cast was superb, from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura, this energy that can save the worst of films (See: What Happens in Vegas) and it is no different here. Despite her smoking/drinking/vulgar/manipulative/cynical/cruel/superficial ways, we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.<br/><br/>Lucy Punch, despite having a bit of questionable material, delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often, as he delivered the laughs every time he was on-screen with his wit, sarcasm, and I-don't-care attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the far-too-few moments they were on-screen. The movie does indeed have its laughs, but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.<br/><br/>Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed, but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very, very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs, but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later, but by then its too late, the potential was wasted. Either way, you will certainly laugh, you will remain entertained, but will also be bothered by what it could have been."
"razitar","1","38","62","30 August 2012"," One of the worst movies I've seen since long
","I wanted to watch this movie because I got the impression that it could be a new kind of ""High School Rock"" or something similar. Simply a ""bad"" teacher who discovers that she really wants to do something good for her students and actually helps them in getting good grades and self-esteem. But unfortunately, there is NOTHING of that in that movie!<br/><br/>I don't even know how to begin my review of how bad this movie is. The only good thing about it is the cast: Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Jason Segal, Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith... This movie almost SCREAMS for wanting to be a big funny comedy! The cast, including Diaz, is doing an amazing job fitting their roles. Especially Timberlake, who is showing a rather odd kind of roll as the hot hipster new age idiot. But nonetheless, all their effort doesn't save this movie from falling on its knees. <br/><br/>Because this movie gets nothing right. The jokes are harsh, nasty, dirty and political incorrect. Some may find them interesting and funny because of that fact. I just find them typically MTV-generation bad. The story and the pace in which the film develops are horrible too! It starts out by introducing how ""bad"" of a teacher Diaz is. She clearly shows that she has no interest in her students and their future, lets them watch only movies each day and forces them to do national tests without them having learned anything. And when the students fail (of course), she yells and threatens them to do a better job. And what's more, because threats don't work either, she lets them stand in line at the gymnasium and throws basketballs at each kids face if the kid doesn't answer correctly to one of her questions. Seriously?? What is this movie telling us? That the education system in the US is messed up or that you can teach students better with corporal punishment? All that attitude is so unrealistic, you wonder how she got her teachers' license in the first place.<br/><br/>But sadly, Diaz is never getting away from her attitude. She is never really growing or changing in that movie. She sleeps, drinks, smokes, steals, takes drugs, is violent, cynical, lies and betrays all people around her. And gets always away with it. Right from the beginning of the movie until the end. What's worse, she even gets a colleague of hers to be forced to move to another school AND gets the guy in the end who was chasing her through the movie the entire time. Wonder what he sees in her?<br/><br/>There are only two scenes in the movie where you think that Diaz finally will change, or at least show her ""real"" nice self. The first one is when she is smoking pod in her car and one of her students is giving her home baked cookies. For the brink of a second, Diaz is softening up and gives her student the advice to loosen up a little (""stop acting like you're racing for congress""). But she immediately finishes with ""You're hopeless, kid."" The other scene is after one of the boys in her class openly confesses his love to his crush, gets rejected and runs away in his misery. Diaz chases him, and when they finally sit down to talk about what happened, she repeats herself: ""I told you so many times, a guy like you will NEVER get a girl like her. Take that ugly hat off your face!""<br/><br/>I became so frustrated by those small moments when it seems like Diaz finally will show us her nice self, only to prove once more what kind of a sad and mean psycho she really is. This movie gives you nothing and is not rewarding to watch in any way. You will get no interesting story, no plot twists, no philosophical depth, no moral message, no happy ending. It's really one of these movies where you have to ask yourself how the script got past the producing rights in the first place. I can simply not recommend this movie to anyone."
"RetroRick","Null","39","64","7 October 2011"," mildly amoral, refreshingly different.
","Am reviewing this to counter-balance the far too many negative reviews out there. This is a funny, not hilarious, but funny and sometimes cruel film about a bad teacher, who is funny because she is bad. Just like bad santa she isn't being held up an examplar for teaching or a role-model for young women (actually I'm not too sure about that). What she is is an anti-dote to the righteous, touchy-feely, moralising lesson preaching,heart-in-the-right-place films that normally dominate this genre, or at least do whenever there is a female in the lead. God knows the world would suffer if every film was like this, but a little bit of gentle cynicism is good thing in a world that is full of fraudulent fictional xmas cheer. Spoiler: As for the sensitive little boy not getting the girl, isn't about time that movies stopped lying to teenage boys that being nice & sensitive will get you laid."

","So, this movie was released in theaters around the same time as Bridesmaids. ALL anyone could talk about was ""Omg Bridesmaids is amazing! Bridesmaids, Bridesmaids, Bridesmaids!"" So, I ventured to the theater and bought a ticket for Bridesmaids. It was funny, but not incredibly so. Kristen Wiig is one of my favorites but I found her character lackluster and felt she could have done it better. ANYWAY, later, I decided to go see Bad Teacher out of complete boredom. I didn't know what to expect, I wasn't a Cameron Diaz or Justin Timberlake fan. Actually, I only really was excited to see Phyllis from The Office.<br/><br/>This movie was hilarious! Oh my gosh, how could I ever dislike Cameron Diaz? My view completely changed about her! She doesn't hold back, she delivers and has perfect comedic timing and brings insane positive energy to the movie. If it wasn't for Cameron, this movie may have been so-so. I say this because her character is very unlikable and shallow and rude on paper. Cameron brings charm to this character and doesn't necessarily make her likable, but just makes her hilarious! So funny!<br/><br/>The other actors are great as well, especially the woman who plays Mrs. Squirrel! <br/><br/>Go see it! Ignore the bad reviews! Decide for yourself!"

","Another comic ""gem"" to satisfy the cravings of an increasingly stupid viewing audience, ""Bad Teacher"" is accurately titled. Cameron Diaz, who is also a bad actress, is indeed very, very bad in this film. Her character is entirely absent any remotely positive traits. There's nothing to like about her, and yet we are supposed to root for her. A film with a title like this would once have been relegated to the porn industry. Now it's just part of mainstream ""comedy,"" right there alongside other immortal classics like ""Super Bad,"" ""Jack Ass,"" ""Kick Ass,"" etc.<br/><br/>Yes, it was awe inspiring to watch dear Cameron fire balls at the heads of little boys. Not little girls, of course- that wouldn't be funny. It's only humorous to watch little boys in pain. Ha Ha. Think of it- the writers are depicting an adult abusing children, and we're laughing at it! Reverse the roles- can you imagine a ""comedy"" where a male teacher abuses little girls, and the audience is amused by it? <br/><br/>Several obvious sequels spring to mind here; Bad Student, Bad Principal, Bad Janitor, Bad Cafeteria Lady, etc. The possibilities are endless. The American idiocracy apparently have an unlimited appetite for these mindless, immature ""comedies"" that could all have been written by 12 year old boys. I guess these ""writers"" never run out of ways to portray farting, male asses and men getting hurt (usually by getting hit in the crotch). Thank goodness their ""talent"" was recognized and is being put to such good use.<br/><br/>Everyone who had anything to do with this monstrously bad movie should be ashamed of themselves. The messages it sends are horrendous. If ""bad teachers"" start popping up in real life, they should never be held accountable for their actions, no matter how despicable they are. After all, Hollywood has told us that such creatures are hilarious, even lovable. So lighten up, it's all in good fun!"

The only remotely good thing is Jason Segel but his role was so marginal, he couldn't help anything.<br/><br/>The story is completely predictable with no lessons to be learned from it. There is no witty dialogue and not a single scene which would make you laugh like you should when watching a comedy. Timberlake's role is supposed to be dorky or something but if you've seen him on SNL, this one does not live up to your expectations. The dry hump scene is not even embarrassing funny but utterly lame.<br/><br/>The only twist in the story is so expected and poorly executed, it's just another super lame scene.<br/><br/>If seeing Cameron Diaz washing cars in Daisy Dukes for about five minutes is your thing watch it.

The actors: Well, firstly, Cameron Diaz is getting old, and I mean wrinkly, tired-looking old. Secondly, she just doesn't have the skill or charisma to pull off a film like this. That's what was most obvious. Justin Timberlake was half-decent, but that's not saying much. Jason Segel. I have no idea what he was doing in this film. The other supporting actors equally sucked.<br/><br/>The script: Terrible. I stopped counting the number of times I heard ""What?"" and ""Huh?"" from the (sparse) audience in response to the weird, unfunny and poorly delivered lines. The red haired girl (Amy, I think) was trying her hardest to be the quirky antagonist, but she just had no comic grace. Neither did Cameron Diaz either. The scriptwriters somehow thought lots of swearing and shouting were a good idea, but alas, they were wrong.<br/><br/>The real problem here was that the concept of the ""bad teacher"" just really doesn't cut it in a high school setting. It wasn't funny. I assume that the writers were aiming for a sort of cross between shock (swearing) and possibly black humour? I really can't define it other than to say it was pissweak. Weird lines, no comic timing, a half-assed romance. It all adds up to not much and a waste of money.<br/><br/>To be fair, there were a few funny points, but it was just so poorly directed.

Her only goal in life is to marry a rich guy and spend as much of his money she can. The movie starts out with her leaving her teaching job, after one year, to marry a rich man, he wisely dumps her and she goes back to being a teacher until she can snare replacement wallet. The next school year starts out and she does nothing but show her class, she seems to have only the one class, movies that somehow incorporate school (Lean on Me, Dangerous Minds, etc.). She meets new teacher Scott, played by Justin Timberlake, who happens to have a rich family and decides that what she needs to snare this man, based on a picture of his ex, is bigger boobs. To do this she needs about $10,000. Hard to achieve on a teacher's salary so she volunteers to help with the school's car wash fundraiser and dresses like a slut in order to earn extra ""tips"" from pervy guys. All the while she is being pursued by Russell (Jason Segel), a gym teacher at the same school, whom she ignores because he's just a gym teacher. She also does what she can to appeal to the naive and stupid Scott who is interested in Elizabeth's rival Amy who does whatever she can to expose Diaz as a marijuana-smoking-in-the-parking-lot crappy teacher. Elizabeth learns that she can earn a $5700 bonus if her students get the highest scores in some standardized test. She tries to be a real teacher in order to get her students to pass but when it becomes apparent that this tactic will not produce the results she desires she seduces and drugs and employee at the testing company in order to steal a copy of the test. Her students end up getting the highest scores and she gets her bonus check. Amy discovers what she's done, after almost being poisoned when Elizabeth rubs poison ivy on an apply that Amy eats and Elizabeth steals her boyfriend Scott, and turns her in. Elizabeth blackmails the test company employee and escapes those charges. Amy then uses the drug use as a way to get Elizabeth fired. That backfires as well and Amy takes the rap for the drugs in Elizabeth's desk. Amy is sent to a school full of troubled teens, Elizabeth blows of rich guy Scott and hooks up with Russell. All the while never learning a single lesson. She gets away with all of the horrible things she's done and the good teacher who actually cares about teaching gets punished.<br/><br/>Seriously?! This is the message of the movie? Lie, cheat, steal, drug and blackmail people, only be concerned with how much money somebody has, bigger boobs will make you happy, treat kids and your coworkers like crap, smoke pot, poison coworkers, use inappropriate language around kids and just be a bitch.

","¬®She doesn't give an 'F'¬® I don't know what is worse: Cameron Diaz's character as a teacher, or the movie itself. This is really a very bad movie, terrible. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it really doesn't have many funny moments. Yes there is a couple here and there, but in a 95 minute long movie you expect much more laughs. This raunchy comedy had a whole lot of raunchy, but no comedy whatsoever. I really hated this film, and expected a lot more from Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel who have done much better movies in the past. I can't blame it on them because the script they were given was really poor, but then I ask myself why would these actors want to be in a movie with a script as bad as this one. This isn't the first time that Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg fail as screenwriters in a comedy. These are the same guys that were responsible for the Year One fiasco starring Jack Black and Michael Cera. Director Jake Kasdan, however, has done far better in the past with funny films like Walk Hard and Orange County. Bad Teacher was a huge misstep for him, and for everyone else who was involved in this project. This could very well be the worse film of the year in my opinion. Cameron Diaz might not give an F, but I definitely will give this film an F for being the disaster it was.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is not your typical High School teacher; she's not interested in her students, she smokes pot before class, and she tries to avoid teaching as much as possible. The only reason she became a teacher was because of the long summer vacations. This is her last year at the school anyway because she is getting married to her wealthy boyfriend and can now enjoy life. The only problem is that her mother-in-law points out how she is only interested in his money so he leaves her with no wedding. This means Elizabeth will have to teach yet another year until she can find a wealthy man to marry. She becomes interested in the new substitute teacher who seems to come from a wealthy family, Scott (Justin Timberlake), but he has just broken up with his long term girlfriend and doesn't feel ready for a relationship yet. Elizabeth has a rival: it's another fellow teacher named Amy (Lucy Punch) who seems to get along really well with Scott. Amy also seems to point out Elizabeth's method of teaching and tries to get her more involved with the kids. Russell (Jason Segel) is the gym teacher who has always had a thing for Elizabeth, but she never pays attention to him because he doesn't have any money. Elizabeth is more interested in winning over Scott's affection (and his money) so that she can get away from school as soon as possible. She will do whatever it takes to do this even if it revolves on getting her breasts done in order to get his attention.<br/><br/>The movie really doesn't know where to head. At the beginning Cameron Diaz's character is so hateful but later out of nowhere she begins to have a conscious and is nice all of a sudden. On the other hand Lucy Punch's character seems so nice at first, but then turns up being mean. It's like they switched characters so the movie could find a decent ending. These changes in character can't happen all of a sudden without explanation. The movie is full of stereotypes and it completely fails as a comedy. It is too bad because Jason Segel, Cameron Diaz, and Justin Timberlake have proved they have great talent, but none of them are able to stand out and save this movie. Timberlake's character is perhaps the worst of all. I had no idea where the director was trying to go with his character. Diaz is just way too mean to be likable. Segel on the other hand is perhaps the most decent character in the movie but he really has no screen time and it's hard to see how he could fall for someone like Diaz. This is really one of the worst films I've seen all year, and can't remember any funny moments in the movie. I was expecting a lot more from the cast and found the 95 minute movie way too long. It's hard to like a movie when you are supposed to root for a highly unlikeable character such as Elizabeth Halsey. I could care less what happens to her.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I don't usually get this far off in judging a film before I go see it. I went to this film, because I thought Cameron Diaz could make it good. Wow, was I wrong. Ms. Diaz' acting is as bad as the rest of the film. She is a very good looking lady, but her acting is really poor and that is exemplified in this film.<br/><br/>The script is really bad. The directing is really bad. The acting is really bad by all actors. This film has no redeeming qualities, unless one wants to simply see Ms. Diaz display her body. She does do that.<br/><br/>Warning - There is pornography (not by Cameron Diaz) in this film. I didn't check the rating before seeing it, but the porno is there. One wonders why producers, directors and writers put that stuff in their films. Here it just further degrades an already really lousy film."
"freemantle_uk","3","67","138","22 June 2011"," The voids of laugher speaks volumes
","Bad Teacher had a strong premise for a comedy, a teacher is really bad and hates her job. It was marketed a raunchy hard-R comedy: sadly it was a film that was lacking, despite the best efforts of the actors.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is the bad teacher in question who leaves the profession and forced to return when her fianc√© dumps her for her gold digging ways. She returns to John Adams Middle High (JAMS) and sets out to win over Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a geeky substitute teacher who is the heir to a watch empire. He particularly likes women with big breasts and Elizabeth plans to get a boob job: but needs the money. But Scott himself is attached to Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), a quirky caring teacher who gets the best results in school. At the same time Elizabeth has a suitor in the form a Gym/P.E. teacher (Jason Seagel). When Elizabeth finds out the prize for the best school results in the Illinois State Test is a big cheque, she sets about to ensure her class is the best.<br/><br/>The jokes were just lacking through the film. I was in a cinema that was 75% full and there were a lot of teachers in it and I can say with honesty that there was very little laugher, a few chuckles and no belly laughs. That says a lot about a comedy because the point is to make us laugh. I believe one of two things happened, either, that the film was originally going to be a PG-13 film and the producers thought that the film was more marketable as a R-rated comedy, or the more likely that it was cut much of the swearing out to get a PG-13 rating, and failed. Most of the use of the F word in the red band trailer was cut out from the actual film. They were also plot points, like when Elizabeth offered to tutor her students, goes nowhere. The pace throughout was just very slow and Bad Teacher needed more snap.<br/><br/>Acting wise the best performance was Seagel best person the film, having the best lines with his role and the most grounded character in the film. He was simply natural as a gym teacher who just wants to have fun, though he has a dodgy line which makes him sound like a potential rapist. Punch is solid and she is deliberately over the top as a quirky teacher, but she does not have many good lines and Punch has to make the performance as physical as possible. She also gets very screwed over in the film. Diaz does her best but the character is not very well developed and her traits flipped like a switch. Most of the time she is shown as an uncaring person, only interested in herself and only got into teaching for the hours: but at the same time she does help some students and surely she should have cared as some point about teaching. She is also too ruthless, she needed to be a deeper character.<br/><br/>I also have to comment about the actual school On Wikipedia it describes JAMS as a school in a poor area: it was certainly not, it was in a very middle class area. I liked how the kids in the school actually looked normal and not in cliques like the jocks, the nerds, the pretty girls, cheerleaders, etc¬Ö They were mixed. But at the same time it seems like that the teachers only have one class: when I was in school the teachers had to teach classes over many years, if they only taught one class then they would have a very short working week.<br/><br/>Overall, a big disappointment."

","I can't write a complete review because for the first time in my life I actually got up and walked out of a movie, along with my adult daughter, because it was so bad. The movie was NOTHING like I expected based on the previews. I was expecting risqu√©, sexy and funny, and instead I got lewd, raunchy, and ANYTHING but funny. The couple slight chuckles I got in the first 20-25 minutes before we walked out, had nothing to do with the lewd, wildly misguided attempts at humor, but rather the subtle things like Cameron Diaz's character avoiding other teachers in the hall that are looking for a shoulder to cry on.<br/><br/>I would liken the ATTEMPTS at humor in this movie to something like Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle... but unlike the mostly very funny White Castle movie, Bad Teacher misses the laugh mark by a MILE and then some. It's just simply NOT funny, and it was pretty awkward to watch with my OVER 17 daughter (you DEFINITELY don't want to take your teenage kids to see this). To sum it up, if you liked that disgusting Battle Sh*ts scene from White Castle, then Bad Teacher is YOUR movie, go see it. If you thought that scene was raunchy, lewd, disgusting, and NOT funny (unlike the rest of the movie), then AVOID Bad Teacher at all costs. Or just play it safe and avoid it period, you're not going to miss anything."

But then his mum calls of the wedding, and Liz has to return to her reviled breadjob as a middle school teacher. To her never-ending amazement, all her other colleagues -- the middle-aged loner, the hippie, the preppy goody-two-shoed apple-cheeked nightmare -- seem to actually enjoy teaching spotty dropouts. The script does an excellent job of lining up every comedic angle of the dreary hell that is school life and linking it together with a fast-paced storyline. Cameron Diaz is excellent because she isn't afraid to actually look old, spent and wrinkled (but never unfoxy), and Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch also stand out among the excellent cast. Justin Timberlake -- eye candy for the ladies, in case you wondered. The soppy, romantic, test-audience-compatible ending -- best ignored.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy that everybody who has had anything to do with school life can dig.

","There is a certain energy in that movie. Especially at the beginning when Cameron Diaz seems invincible she has the time of her life (almost literally). There is a great sequence where she kinda falls down though which sets of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately even though it does make sense for her character, it does loose quite a bit of its pace from that point on.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is good in playing kind of against character and does not care about what people may think. Jason Segel is almost underused in this one and even Cameron Diaz did not really have that many great moments overall. And for a movie that tries to stay raunchy, it does even fail at combining that with the funny elements. While deliciously evil at times (and good), it also misses the point half of the time. Not really bad, but not that good either (I only watched the cinema release and not the extended cut)"
"brando647","7","18","32","12 December 2011"," Meh...It's Good for a Few Laughs
","First Santa, now a middle school teacher. I feel as if we're on the verge of a new trend of bad *insert occupation here*. Bad toll booth operators, bad samurai deli clerks¬Öwhere will it end? Anyway, this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan (WALK HARD) and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies; there have been some real good ones (BRIDESMAIDS) but most of them have been pretty forgettable (PAUL). This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, a gold-digging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fianc√© to tend to her every need, but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job, where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake). Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little self-improvement. Not becoming a decent person or anything, just a breast enhancement. From then on, she lies, cheats, and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery; and the only one who suffers is the good teacher (Lucy Punch) who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.<br/><br/>In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, young Alex (Malcolm McDowell) robs, rapes, and commits horrible acts of violence but maintains a charismatic personality that allows the audience to root for him. Elizabeth Halsey in BAD TEACHER, does not. The ""protagonist"" in this movie also happens to be the least likable person in the film. As a result, the movie comes off as a little backwards. The character we're supposed to support (Elizabeth) is just a horrible person with absolutely no redeeming qualities presented until the final act of the film. And I mean none. She was a gold-digging fianc√©, she's perpetually drunk/high on the job, and she coldly dismisses gym teacher Russell's advances without a glance in favor of stalking the new substitute with the massive bank account. It would almost make more sense if the film focused on Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) living out her dream teaching career when trouble-making Elizabeth comes along and steals her thunder in underhanded ways. Punch should be the protagonist, and Elizabeth the antagonist. But it's not; instead we watch as the film's ""good guy"" punishes the ""bad guy"" for nothing other than doing her job and doing it well. Oh well, whatever¬Öit's just a comedy after all. Antiheroes can be fun and it works as long as the film is funny, which it mostly is. The movie is good for some laughs, though it's tough to be anything but distant as you watch everything going down without ever really being drawn into the story.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz really is the best person for this role. Not because she's horribly unlikeable (I assume she's not) but because she's got a decent comedic background in her films and she's still capable of pulling off drop-dead beauty. In BAD TEACHER, she's the teacher we all wished we'd had in middle school. She really drives the point home when she volunteers to work the school's charity car wash so she can pilfer funds. The supporting cast in this movie is what really makes it enjoyable. Jason Segel is always great as a lovable schlub (which pretty much sums up his gym teacher character) and Lucy Punch is hilariously eccentric as Ms. Squirrel. I've also got to give credit to Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's friend Lynn. She's probably the funniest part of the movie as the soft-spoken conservative friend who wants so badly to be as cool as Elizabeth but can't bring herself to commit to the debauchery. Honestly, the main character may be crap but the movie does have some real funny moments. I just don't know if there's enough to save it from fading out shortly after watching it. If it helps, I find the movie is funnier the less sober you are when watching it."

Normally, a movie's plot centers around the hero, and does its best to get you to hate the villain. Bad Teacher is exactly opposite, trying to get you to like the villain (Diaz) and hate on the people trying to stop her and her criminal ways. This doesn't work anyway, you immediately hate Diaz right from the beginning, and are shaking your head and cussing her all the way through.<br/><br/>Now, I might be more forgiving had the writers tried to change her from a bad guy to a good guy.

The movie is also a very bad example for teenagers who watched this - the bad teacher triumphs at the end and the good teacher is punished for possessing drugs that she does not own!<br/><br/>One thing is to film a dark, politically incorrect comedy. A totally different thing is to make a movie with a terrible story and insert bad jokes randomly. Avoid!"

","Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is a bad teacher. She has only two things she is interested in: finding a rich husband and enhancing her breast size. <br/><br/>The first third of this movie broadcasts: nudity, foul-mouthed raunchy language, drug use, and in general a deep uncaring for everything appropriate to include her students and their concerns. <br/><br/>The next two thirds come in calmer but the language and the uncaring are still with us. There is nothing funny in here. Everything is a scheme to get Ms Halsey what she wants and her ways know no bounds. She is up for everything to get a rich husband and the money to pay for the breast implants. She cons everyone but Amy (Punch) her chief rival, but Amy is no match for this teacher.<br/><br/>There is no reason to see this movie. It doesn't serve anyone for anything. This is just another example of Hollywood not knowing what to do anymore. This movie is on the same level as HESHER, and BAD SANTA but not as mean-spirited, but close. Are we starting to see a trend? Perhaps, but let's hope not. <br/><br/>The only people you cared for were the ones at the butt of Ms Halsey's foul mouthed barbs. <br/><br/>The acting performances were fine -- it is the script that needed work. This could have been funny, but it just comes across as unfunny bathroom humor. There is no salvation to be found in here. At the end of the movie, Ms Halsey behaves the same as she did in the beginning. At least that is the implication I got out of it. <br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes. Drug use: Yes. Language: Yes."

Actors who have previously dealt us some high quality work having their efforts reduced to a sitcom laugh track level just doesn't make sense I can only be directing and editing to blame for this badly timed badly executed and quite possibly badly written mess. It looked recycled and labored from the first few minutes and the following 90 mins was completely consistent with that, painfully so.<br/><br/>Movies and comedy in general have moved on so far from this and the actors in this steaming pile have been in some of the better examples of that progress.

I have seen Segel and Diaz making the rounds promoting the film and it looked like a fun Friday night date movie. Lettermen was raving about it so I went to see it. I was praying to the movie gods to not this be another ""Every funny thing in the movie was thrown into the trailer...but"" SPOILER ALERT: It was and it wasn't funny at all. I wanted to like this movie I really did, but as one reviewer said, something just felt off, and it felt off for 92 minutes. I'm giving this a 3 rating b/c of the fact that had I not seen the trailer before hand those parts would have probably made me laugh. But in the theater where I watched the film there were LONG stretches of silence and very few laughs. In fact many times in the theater it was dead silence where thy writers seemed to put: PAUSE FOR LAUGHTER IN THE SCRIPT. The problem was there were none.

Cameron's character was nothing of that kind.The movie is all about her gathering money for plastic surgery of breast. She thinks that she will get any man with big boobs. Crap! She smokes, cheats, hurts people on the way of reaching her goals. <br/><br/>You hate her throughout the movie because she is a b***h. But she gets a guy in the end. I give the movie 1 out of 10.

","Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg are the credited writers of one of the worst comedies ever made: Year One, the movie where Jack Black and Michael Cera played themselves as cave men. Here the same type of mean, non-creative, only mildly entertaining humor is at play because they wrote Bad Teacher.<br/><br/>Some may even say that this is a wasted opportunity with this cast. I beg to differ. You mainly have one ACTUALLY funny person in the cast and that's Jason Segel, which happens to provide the movie's only funny moments. All these other actors would never be capable of writing funny jokes in stand-up or in a movie. They are all just actors there to just read what is given in front of them, entrusting that the jokes in the movie are going to be funny. Unfortunately, not even that happens in this film.<br/><br/>The humor in ""Bad Teacher"" mainly is about shock value only. The shock value here only comes off as repulsive and definitely not funny. Where is the wit in any of the lines? What are they expecting an adult reaction to be with some of the jokes in this. Someone farted really loudly on the toilet. Reaction that didn't happen: ""HAHAHA."" Or it shows a kid with an erection as Cameron Diaz washes a car. Reaction that didn't happen: ""OMG, did they really just show that? Hilarious.""<br/><br/>Overall, I give this a rating of: ""Bad Teacher"". (Some movies just start a whole new rating.)"

I thought that Cameron Diaz was perfect for the role. I also thought that Justin Timberlake did a very good job as did Jason Segel (his character was my favourite.) Another thing I thought was good was how they built up the characters. I would say that it had a really funny story-line and as I said some very good actors. It was my type of humour so I found it very funny, but others might not. Overall I would say that Bad Teacher is a hilarious film, but I'd stay away if you don't like sex jokes.

The writing is terrible, the whole idea of the movie is just silly and it has no substance if you think about it. It should end in like 10 minutes but a ridiculous amount of details and unnecessary events are being integrated into the flick. This movie is supposed to be funny because it's regarded as a comedy but there isn't a single scene that brought a smile to my face. The only attempts were those typical tainted tendencies of American humor ( I don't want to offend anyone here but it's the truth ): sex jokes, swearing, that ain't funny folks.<br/><br/>I feel like I've wasted one hour and a half of my life by watching this but I don't want to complain. The only reason I kept watching till the end was for Cameron Diaz because she's a good actress but this movie just wasn't for her in my honest opinion.<br/><br/>My advice is not to waste time on watching it but if you're really bored or want to give it a chance because of Diaz you can but be aware, it isn't a joyful ride."

","I went in to see Bad Teacher with fairly high expectations. The trailers were really good and I hoped the film would live up to them. Mostly, I'd say it did, although it was't quite what I'd expected.<br/><br/>Before I explain what I didn't like about the film, I'll start with what I did. Some of it is very funny and it's far better than some other recent comedies, such as The Dilemma, which has to be the worst comedy I've seen this year. Jason Segel was good in his role even though he doesn't have a whole lot of screen time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were several scenes and lines that seemed out of place and some of the film felt kinda dis-jointed. The plot was pretty thin and the first half of movie was more like watching a series of loosely-linked scenes rather than a proper film.<br/><br/>That said, it's still pretty funny and I'd recommend it if you liked similar movies, but you're probably just best waiting for the DVD unless you really want to see the film, then go to the cinema.<br/><br/>I give Bad Teacher 8/10; I know it's being pretty generous considering what I've said about the film, although I'd much rather watch this again than the likes of The Dilemma or Hall Pass."
"Bravesfan17","8","15","29","25 June 2011"," Raunchy and vulgar, but worth it
","Raunchy, vulgar: Those are just two of the words to describe the movie Bad Teacher. On that note, this movie is still well worth seeing. Cameron Diaz stars in the title role as Elizabeth Halsey, a middle school teacher who really doesn't care about how her students do in school. At the end of a school year, she quits so she can rely on her fianc√© to be her sugar daddy. When she comes home to find that he wants nothing to do with her, she has to keep her job in order to support herself. Once Elizabeth is back in school, she could care less about her students. Instead of teaching her students, she just shows movies while she sleeps at her desk. Her motivation is to just have money to get larger breasts so she can attract a guy and turn that guy into her sugar daddy.<br/><br/>Elizabeth becomes attracted to the new substitute teacher Scott, played by Justin Timberlake. Timberlake is okay in this role, but he doesn't have any moments where he shines as an actor.<br/><br/>While Elizabeth is attracted to Scott, a gym teacher named Russell, played by Jason Segel, is attracted to her. Segel continues to show how great he is as an actor. Segel does really well at making Russell a guy who will not stop until he has Elizabeth's affection.<br/><br/>A performance who really stood out to me was right across the hallway from Elizabeth. This was in the form of Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel, a sassy, overachieving teacher who is always striving to be the best. In the film when Elizabeth's motivations change so that she gets a big bonus, Amy and Elizabeth become rivals. Their rivalry is hilarious on many levels.<br/><br/>Director Jake Kasdan knows how to keep the humor intact to the story. He does great at making the story raunchy and vulgar, yet hilarious at the same time. The only flaw to me was that at times the screenplay is all over the place."

I know it's only a film, but I am the sort of person who does not want to get to the end of a so-called comedy just to find that the message is that crime does pay.

Other thing which i found annoying is how the director makes teachers look like foolish people and naive and even a little retarded.

","You know exactly what you're getting with Bad Teacher - you're getting Cameron Diaz as a bad teacher Elizabeth. In her private life she is looking to hook a rich husband for his money: she smokes, drinks, takes drugs, swears a vast amount and sleeps around. As a teacher she does all that stuff, too: she is also a slacker, can't be bothered to remember her students' names, steals, abuses the kids... The list goes on and on. There is a plot of sorts, which involves Elizabeth trying to get money through fair means or foul (mostly foul) for a boob job in order to hook rich substitute teacher Justin Timberlake, and the efforts of by-the-book but irritating teacher Amy (Lucy Punch) to foil her, but the title pretty much says it all.<br/><br/>I must confess to enjoying it. A lot of it is pretty funny, Cameron Diaz clearly has a ball and is both funny and sexy (the car wash sequence is both at the same time), and Lucy Punch also does well with a character who spirals into mania as she fails to be able to do something about what she, and she alone, sees happening (I particularly liked the references to an unexplained incident in her past). So I was entertained throughout.<br/><br/>Now to reservations. <br/><br/>One is the fact that the central character is sociopathic - her every action is driven by ""What's in it for me?"" It's not so much that she gets away with it - that happens in real life all the time, and it's not exactly unknown in movies either. It's more that the final sequences promises some sort of redemption, and that simply doesn't happen in real life. Oh well, perhaps I'm just reading too much into it. It is a comedy, after all.<br/><br/>And two is that, with the exception of Jason Segel's gym teacher, not a single one of the adult characters behaves remotely believably at any point in the movie, which makes suspension of disbelief a difficult trick to pull off."

","Comedies today keep trying to push the boundaries more and more to stand out. The Hangover movies are a perfect example of this. Much of it started with There's Something About Mary which grossed people out in a humorous way. The star of that movie, Cameron Diaz, shows her funny side once again in Bad Teacher. This one's not as risqu√© or shocking, but it tries to stand out with its premise - a teacher who treats her students like crap and could care less about educating them. In most movies like The Hangover, guys are doing all of the crude and nasty stuff. So it's a little refreshing to see a woman do it this time around, even if it's more things she says than does. We do get to see her wail on some kids with a dodgeball though. You feel kind of bad for the kids, but they seem to take it in stride. Maybe they're just happy to have a hot teacher, even if she's not doing her job. Let's face it, most kids aren't excited to learn. Here they get to spend most of their time in the classroom watching movies. I know I would've preferred that when I was in class.<br/><br/>Diaz plays money-seeking Elizabeth Halsey, a woman who somehow managed to become a teacher while waiting to marry her rich fianc√©. She completes a year at her school doing the absolute bare minimum of teaching. But her fianc√© dumps her after learning of her gold digging ways and now she finds herself stuck teaching at the school that she was just getting ready to leave for good. Elizabeth quickly learns that a new teacher played by Justin Timberlake comes from a very wealthy family. So she sets her radar on him as her next husband to be. He's the complete opposite of her, but that doesn't matter. He's very polite and rather nerdy. In fact, he's much more like Elizabeth's rival teacher Miss Squirrel. Once he starts getting close with the prissy Miss Squirrel, it becomes a battle of wits between the two women to be with him. But Elizabeth is out to get him for all the wrong reasons of course. While she sleeps through class and just plays movies for her students to watch, she spends the rest of her time trying to impress the wealthy new teacher and win him over. Advertisement<br/><br/>Timberlake, who's proved he can be very funny through all his appearances on Saturday Night Live, isn't really given much to do here. He just plays the clean-cut nerdy guy the best that he can. Jason Segal, who plays a fellow gym teacher, gets more of the laughs. His character sees right through Elizabeth but pursues her anyway. He goes along with everything she does but still makes sure to put her in check too. He's the one person at the school that she's able to relate to a little it seems. Watching the film you'll wonder if Elizabeth will find any sort of redemption and change her ways. You get the sense that Segal's character is the one person who can help her with that. The movie has some funny one-liners and interesting scenes, but I wouldn't say it's laugh-out-loud hilarious or anything. Still, it's a pretty funny premise and Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role. It's not a movie you'll remember down the road but it's worth checking out at least."

","Talk about a waste of time and talent! ""Walk Hard"" director Jake Kasdan has fashioned a predictable, 89-minute, R-rated comedy that takes few risks and breaks no new ground. The pathetic, lowest-common-denominator humor struggles to qualify as raunchy, but it all looks like bits and pieces that wound up on the cutting room floor for the hilarious Billy Bob Thornton epic ""Bad Santa."" No, nobody who worked on ""Bad Santa"" had anything to do with this uninspired, low-life laffer boasting consistently obnoxious characters. Sure, our blond, bombshell heroine spouts profanity, smokes marijuana, and has promiscuous sex with single guys. So what! Most of this borderline bad behavior that would appeal to underage urchins giggling gleefully as they inhale their first puffs from a cigarette butt and ogle a Maxim magazine. ""Bad Teacher"" isn't 'bad' based on what the characters do. Now, had our heroine had gone to bed with one of her seventh graders, indulged in sex with either another woman or a midget, and manufactured meth, then she would have emerged as a 'bad' teacher. The son of writer & director Lawrence Kasdan who made ""The Big Chill,"" ""Wyatt Earp,"" and ""Silverado,"" Jake Kasdan has only helmed one memorable film, the crudely subversive musical-comedy spoof ""Walk Hard."" Everything else that he has made ranks at best as fair to middling fare. The only thing worth looking at in ""Bad Teacher"" is Cameron Diaz. Indeed, the 38-year old actress looks sexy when she sponges down cars with her body, slinks around in skimpy outfits like a tramp, and swears like a sailor, but ""Bad Teacher"" cannot compare with something really funny like the Farrelly Brothers' comedy ""There's Something about Mary."" ""Bad Teacher"" is neither as entertaining as her earlier sci-fi outing ""The Box"" or the melodramatic ""My Sister's Keeper.""<br/><br/>The bare-bones plot concerns an Illinois middle-school teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), who wouldn't last thirty seconds in an actual class room. Elizabeth is an abrasive, self-centered, gold-digger. She had been planning to marry a wealthy guy, Mark (Nat Faxon of ""Beerfest"") until his protective mother convinces him that Elizabeth only wants his loot. She accuses Elizabeth of being so oblivious to her son that she does not even know when Mark's birthday is. Distraught over this debacle, our heroine heads back to the class room. Earlier, her colleagues had given Elizabeth a big-send off with a Boston Market gift card. When she is in the class room, Elizabeth's ideas about pedagogy consist primarily of showing her students movies on DVD such as ""Stand and Deliver,"" ""Dangerous Minds,"" and ""Lean on Me."" Meantime, Elizabeth sits at her desk and either sleeps or looks at breast implant literature! She doesn't particularly like the hopelessly chipper teacher across the hall, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch of ""Dinner for Schmucks""), because Amy lives and breathes to teach middle school. Indeed, Amy is somewhat anal about following rules! Indeed, Amy is appalled that Elizabeth is relying on DVDs this early in the semester.<br/><br/>No sooner has the semester started than the school acquires a new teacher, Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake of ""Get Smart""), who Elizabeth stoops to conquer, except that she has to tangle with cheerful Amy to land him. Marking time in the wings for Elizabeth is the only remotely sympathetic character, middle school gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""), who doesn't get her attention until the last quarter-hour of the action. Actually, the amiable Russell shares more in common with Elizabeth than any of her other colleagues. Russell puffs pot and displays a cynicism that reflects Elizabeth's own. Anyhow, our calculating heroine figures that the only way that she can get Scott is to have her breasts enlarged. Talk about cynicism! A scene with a plastic surgeon, Doctor Vogel (David Paymer of ""Redbelt"") and one of his boob job models at his clinic is about as sleazy as this saga gets. Elizabeth drools at the sight of those big knockers and fantasizes about the possibilities that they offer. Imagine her distress when she winds up in bed with Scott and all they do is dry-hump, and then we are shown an obvious semen stain on his jeans. Anybody who grimaces at this behavior has clearly led a cloistered life where sleazy movies are concerned. <br/><br/>After our heroine gets the idea to orchestrate a car wash where she uses her body as a sponge to wash the vehicles and then pockets the proceeds, Elizabeth drums up the balance of her bread for a breast job by stealing the answers to a Standardized test. Elizabeth puts on a red ""Annie"" wig, masquerades as a journalist, and seduces a timid educator, Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon of ""Reno 911: Miami""), and then slips a roofie in his drink. Again, as thoroughly objectionable and unethical as her behavior is, it is nothing new in a movie. Had Elizabeth found herself opposite a lusty lesbian educator, then that might have been a little closer to the borderline. Nothing that Elizabeth does amounts to a challenge her to her skills or her taste. Surprisingly, Timberlake plays his preppy, be-spectacled school teacher as if he were a closeted homosexual. Of course, Cameron Diaz is largely trading on her spectacular looks, but even she is looks a little bewildered playing such an inadequately drawn character. You don't really hate her and you don't really admire her. Nobody takes advantage of her and Diaz never musters any charisma as a 'bad' girl. If you are looking for something like ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" ""Mr. Woodcock,"" or ""School of Rock,"" you won't find it in ""Bad Teacher."" Altogether, ""Bad Teacher"" is not bad, mostly tame. This amoral lesson in life deserves a grade of F for forgettable!"

","Buenos Diaz and welcome to my lecture, I mean review, of the Diaz-driven comedy ""Bad Teacher"". OK, I am not going to fire away on ""Bad Teacher"" but I am not going to give it cinematic tenure either. As mentioned, on the starring dais of ""Bad Teacher"" is the applelicious Cameron Diaz, who is not bad here, actually she was pretty good. Diaz stars as Elizabeth Halsey, a Middle School Teacher who craves to get a breast ahead of the golddigger sweepstakes by finding conniving ways to get money, so then she can get a boob job so she can marry rich. Halsey's Vomit and other unethical behaviors (showing movies in class, smoking pot, embezzling school fundraising money, etc) throughout her working school day make her a¬Ö¬Ö. see movie title. She catches the eye of Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whose parents are immensely wealthy due to their lucrative watch company. Therefore, like clockwork, Elizabeth has her new victim to somehow marry rich in the future. Justin Timberlake was in sync playing the dorky Delacorte, and was hilarious in a school dance scene. Ms. Halsey's rival is fellow teacher Ms. Squirrel solidly portrayed by the up-and-coming Lucy Punch. This Squirrel teeths into Halsey's mischievous ways; and Ms. Squirrel's unorthodox, corny-pun teaching methods might just be as horrific as Ms. Halsey's behaviors. But who am I to criticize corny puns, there are plenty of those already marked in this review. Two other performances that hit the B+ barometer in ""Bad Teacher"" were of John Michael Higgins who plays the dolphin- loving Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's only teacher- friend Ms. Davies. However, the thespian valedictorian of ""Bad Teacher"" is Jason Segel as P.E. Teacher Russell Gettis, whose repeated Gettisburg Address to get into Elizabeth's pants was quite entertaining. Segel is one of the brightest comedic actors of today, and everything he is in gets automatically bumped up a grade. So why don't I put ""Bad Teacher"" in the school of stellar comedies? Due to Director's Jake Kasdan orchestration of ""Bad Teacher"" in the last semester, I mean act of the movie. He was off to a great start with some outstanding opening sequences, but as the film went on it sure could have used some creative composition. Gene Stupnitzky & Lee Eisenberg's screenplay has its sporadic hilarious comedic lines within the dialogue, but needed a script tutor for its redundant narrative. I will pass ""Bad Teacher"" with a C+, mostly due to its drama team of actors. If you were able to read this pun-driven review, thank your preacher, because I bless you for having the courage. *** Average"

His role as the love interest of two competing teachers could have been supplanted with a more believable competition for teacher-of the-year. The acting is not at all A-list quality, the plot is thin, and without anything going for it but crudeness, this film is totally passable. Demote it down and ultimately out of the queue matriculation list. AfroPixFlix flunks this with a solitary fork, one suitable for tossing this down the cafeteria garbage chute, right along with the creamed corn casserole. Boo."

","I saw this movie in mar-2014 which is 3 years after release. I am really glad that I didn't pay good money to watch this movie on theater or even blu ray (downloaded it via Dish on demand). Cameron Diaz has acted in some bad movies but this I believe was most horrible. Story line didn't make any sense. Cameron's character changes towards the end but why does it change and does it really change. The movie was supposed to run because of Cameron Diaz but I don't think she has enough star power to carry this disaster on her shoulders.

","OK, I admit I laughed a few times. But overall this has redeeming values only if you are the type who gets a kick out of dirty, trashcan humor. Otherwise its theme, of a teacher who just happens to be a very bad person, just never gets very interesting.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is that bad teacher, Elizabeth Halsey. We never really get to see if she could be a good teacher, because she doesn't try to teach. She would rather show the kids a movie in class.<br/><br/>As the movie begins, she is engaged and about to get married. But with the help of his mom, the young man tells Elizabeth to get lost, when he realizes she is only a gold-digger, only wanting someone to take care of her. Someone wealthy so she can have all the things that she wants.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake does add some interest, as substitute teacher Scott Delacorte. When Elizabeth finds out he is of a very wealthy family she takes a great interest. But he never gets interested in her. <br/><br/>Just a bad teacher who is a bad person and stays that way.

Basically, the whole movie is her sleeping in class, drinking in class, while she schemes too get the rich substitute teacher to fall for her.

"StevePulaski","5","10","19","3 July 2011"," I think I'll be excused
","Bad Teacher is a hit and miss comedy, with a fair number of laughs, but a fair number of plot holes and questions. Before I even thought about this movie after seeing it, I went and watched Bad Santa for the first time. Both films have a similar premise with the lead character being unpleasant and offensive. But Bad Santa was written with a more style of dark comedy, and let's not forget, with a corrupt childhood and a ""whatever"" attitude, Billy Bob Thornton's character had a perfectly good reason to be ""bad"" and mean. Cameron Diaz has none other than she is just mean-spirited and has chosen to pursue a miserable lifestyle.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Halsey is our main character, portrayed by the lovely Cameron Diaz. Elizabeth is a teacher had a normal school, and comes home one day to her fianc√©e and finds out that his mother has convinced him to call of the wedding. Planning to possibly spend the rest of her life staying at home since her fianc√©e was rich, Elizabeth must return to the school where she shows her class movies every day while she naps at her desk.<br/><br/>Seeing the attractive substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Timberlake), Elizabeth makes conversation to learn he has just gone through a breakup with a woman with large breasts. Elizabeth decides to under-go a breast enlargement surgery, a costly but rewarding surgery, to be more self-appreciative.<br/><br/>The main rival in the film is Amy Squirrel (Punch), another teacher in the building. She believes that Elizabeth is a fraud, scamming the school out of money (to pay for her surgery). There is also a strange attraction between Jason Segel's character as the gym teacher. The movie's biggest fault is it focuses more on Elizabeth's sometimes funny, sometimes not antics instead of building up the attraction it should with Jason Segel's character. When the film ends, we feel that the film itself didn't know how to end and just thought up something out of the blue just to give the film some sort of sun-shiny ending. The end would've been better, if we got more of a relationship between the two.<br/><br/>Another problem is that the students are never developed enough. The film has several students that speak to Miss Halsey individually, but it seems it can't make up its mind which one it wants to focus on. We have the brown nose girl and the sensitive kid who writes poetry and is crushing on the girl way out of his league. We get brief scenes with them, but we never see Elizabeth talk to one of the students very much. In Bad Santa, Thornton was always talking to kids and, despite his sour motivation, he was optimistic about the loner he picked up along the way.<br/><br/>The backstory isn't big either. If Cameron Diaz is such a miserable hack behind the desk, why did she take up teaching in the first place? How did she become a teacher? Does the principal never come in the classroom to find that Elizabeth is sleeping while the kids watch Scream? While I liked Diaz in There's Something About Mary and other things she has done, in this, she is just barely likable.<br/><br/>The jokes are funny. But boy does the writing fail it. When the jokes are funny, they are really funny. When the jokes fail, they fall flat on their face and are cringe inducing. The dry humping scene between Diaz and Timberlake is awkward, and is useless. It doesn't cause any advance in the plot or accomplishment among Diaz's part. It's simply there to have some sort of sex scene in a movie titled Bad Teacher.<br/><br/>Bad Teacher is cute, but ultimately not as dirty or as funny as it should be. The relationship between the characters is forced, no one on screen seems to be doing their best, and the screenplay, like I said, can be good but can really bad. A comedy that had potential, also had a really good movie it would be compared to for its lifetime. The result; Santa will live on while the Teacher will need an attitude adjustment.<br/><br/>Starring: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, and Justin Timberlake. Directed by: Jake Kasdan."

","Bad Teacher (2011): Dir: Jake Kasdan / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith: She is indeed, bad. She sleeps during class while the students are watching movies. She grades tests using profane vocabulary. To top it off she uses a student car wash to raise money for a boob job. She is played with great flair by Cameron Diaz and the film opens with her leaving teaching to settle down in married life only to be dumped by her fianc√©e whose mother sees through her greedy intentions. She returns to teaching the following year and sets her sights on a new teacher, played by Justin Timberlake but his affections are being competed for by the uptight Miss Squirrel, played by Lucy Punch. Director Jake Kasdan made the music mockumentary masterpiece Walk Hard: A Dewey Cox Story. He doesn't match that greatness here but he does create a fantastic stage for the comic talents of Diaz who is merciless in her quest for success. She will manipulate and scam until luck favors her. Jason Segel as the gym teacher whom she ignores is well played but flat. Timberlake is quite different as the nerdy teacher unsmittened with Diaz. He will learn a lesson or two that will leave him with no romantic resources. Punch steals her scenes as she competes with Diaz and seemingly wins until her quests for sabotage backfires. Phyllis Smith plays another teacher who befriends Diaz but she cannot steal scenes here the way that Punch seems able to. It is a crude yet often funny take on an individual unable to fit in within an area where she is clearly no good. Score: 7 ¬Ω / 10"

I loved that it was morally shameful, yet still had a heart. A little bit like Bad Santa.<br/><br/>The trailer for this movie was a bit s#*t, so don't judge it on that. I also had reservations about Cameron Diaz but was quickly won over.

"Okonh0wp","8","5","8","18 November 2014"," A great Cameron Diaz vehicle
","The comic set-up of a slacker in an important profession is getting some legs lately with Bad Teacher, Bad Judge, Bad Santa, and Brooklyn Nine Nine (which is essentially ""Bad Cop"") and why shouldn't it? TV, film and real-life are all inundated with people who take their jobs too seriously, so this is a refreshing charms. <br/><br/>The film comes in a phase in Cameron Diaz's career where she was no longer America's hot it girl (her ""advanced"" age is even referenced in Diaz's other 2011 film ""The Green Hornet) and could have fun indulging in her comic persona which generally has a bit of a bite to it. The film can be read as a commentary on Diaz actively rebelling the shorter expiration date for hot film actresses by trying in vain to raise the money for a boob job and attempting to con real life ex-boyfriend Justin Timberlake (who likely will not run out of roles 20 years from now) into marrying him. Back when Diaz was known for her supermodel looks and screen presence, her comic gifts were taken for granted which is why this has been such an interesting phase in her career.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, while the premise is risqu√©, the film is in the mold of a classic comedy. It uses the medium well (something movies have to do more and more in this age of TV comedy) by filling up its two hours with nicely outstretched character arcs and big scenes (i.e. the car wash, the field trip). Lucy Punch, Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins and the endearing Jason Segel shine strong in supporting parts as well."

","I did enjoy Bad Teacher, more than most people and more than Bad Santa. Cameron, whom I've appreciated since her debut in The Mask, did an excellent job of showing that side of dark and selfish, yet actually human. Her character actually took what most people think, whether they admit it or not, out of the mind and into action. She actually did a bang up job, including some, albeit rare, bouts of humanity. I also enjoyed Jason Segel's character and Jason's wit throughout. Sure, overall, she is a ""bad teacher"" and not recommended to stand (or bend) in front of any student or human, but it's a fun little ride when you leave your brain at the door."

"tim-764-291856","7","5","8","6 May 2012"," Crass, bad and wonderfully wicked!
","I was brought down 30 years to a besotted teenager again, as 'hottie' Cameron Diaz becomes every pubescent boy's dream teacher and she's bad. Bad at almost everything, for that matter!<br/><br/>Very much like Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"", this is an adult post- pub late evening grubby comedy that is boisterously and often raucously funny. Especially when seen in a group of those of similar gender and outlook.<br/><br/>Yes, every clich√© is explored and exploited and by far the funniest bits are when the pot-smoking, dangerously driving and self-centred egotist Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) is doing just that. Her out-and-out quest to finance bigger boobs surgery simply to net a wealthier and more financially sustaining husband and the way she bulldozes her way over and through everything and everyone is gloriously OTT and very entertaining.<br/><br/>What don't work, though, are the romantic elements, which if anything, detract rather than add to the movie. Bad Teacher only loves herself, let's leave it at that. Justin Timberlake, as the suitor on her radar looks rather stupid and awkward and the gym teacher whose advances she continuously declines, Jason Segel just looks too creepily inadequate for her personality to persuade us that 'that's ever gonna happen'.<br/><br/>Brit Lucy Punch is very funny/annoying (depending on personal choice) as another teacher with, shall we say, some very odd personal afflictions as well as teaching ones.<br/><br/>There is some very strong language and toilet ""humour"", which I've long realised is an essential part to any US comedy these days (& which I'd rather do without, thankyou!). There are some sexy scenes too - check out the car-wash antics, with Diaz posing those 1970's pin-up poses (spray, lying over the car's bonnet, you know the sort of thing).<br/><br/>Bad Teacher could easily slip into 2/10 or 8/10, depending on how you like your humour. Somehow, I feel I should give it 5/10,but I enjoyed it a lot for the most part and thus have gone for between 6.5 and 7."

","This is a movie I should probably hate. I say this because Diaz is our protagonist and she is a real bitch. Perhaps it's because I'm a teacher myself and can kind of understand her frustration at times. Still, she uses men for money, doesn't try hard at her job, is a drug user, etc. All attributes that should make me hate her. And yet, I don't. Her character doesn't even learn that many valuable lessons. I suppose it was due to the well constructed world around her. The other characters (minus Segel and Smith) just seem so fake, or happy in that annoying kind of way. They are all smiles and sunshine to the point of naivety. Segel works as the sarcastic guy that realizes how fake his job is, but makes an effort to enjoy it. Most of the humour revolves around Diaz doing things that students shouldn't, but I found it had me giggling a lot. I'm also pleased that it didn't become too preachy. Rather than turning Diaz into a wonderful caring and hardworking teacher, she just kind of learned to be happy with where she was in life."
"jbradleyclarke","7","5","8","9 December 2011"," A strong & positive message at the end
","A lot or reviewers dislike this film for its surly incivility, and I think they do have a valid point of view. Cameron's character is reprehensible throughout the majority of the film, and the humor is often crass. Regardless, I think there are some fantastic scenes of humor. For example, the car wash scene in which Cameron sports a Daisy Duke outfit is hilarious: The distracted cop hitting cars, the acne-faced boy pleasuring himself, the fathers drooling over her. It is shamelessly shallow to be sure, but the scene is a great play on undeniable realities.<br/><br/>I think the average reviewer is so overwhelmed by the dark side of Cameron's character that they fail to fully appreciate her transformation. Despite all of her deplorable behavior, Cameron's character discovers the value of helping kids. She reaches out to a girl regarding her parents' overly ambitious goals for her future. She also helps a young man come to grips with his social struggles and she helps him deal with the harsh realities of junior high student drama. She doesn't handle theses issues properly, but she does handle them effectively. Most importantly, these experiences transform her goals from gold-digging to helping people. She abandons her breast enhancement goals and she becomes a guidance counselor. She does indeed get away with committing all of her foul deeds without being punished, but she does become a better person. The film doesn't let us know Cameron's character will be a good guidance counselor or if she will adequately clean up her behavior, but I think she does learn the value of helping kids face their problems."

","It seems to me that Cameron Diaz has played the goofy diva role a ton of times, and we love her as that goofy diva. But it was good to finally see her spread her wings as the diabolically... well, diabolical teacher Elizabeth Halsey in Bad teacher, a comedy that a lot of people dissed.<br/><br/>Bad teacher has a similar premise to 2003's raunchy comedy Bad Santa, which I will say that I liked but mainly because of Billy Bob Thornton's super-bad performance.Though I laughed in that movie, I can't say that I laughed a whole lot. The movie was more of a shock value than a comedy. Bad teacher is a similar case, but I laughed a lot more. <br/><br/>With Bad Santa, you could see Billy Bob in that role. The main thing that made me laugh was seeing Diaz as such a terrible person. And it's fascinating to see her finally spread her wings and fly for the first time in a bit. But no offense to those other movies, because I liked them.<br/><br/>Diaz's Halsey is a bad person, just to sum it up. When her sham of an engagement(she was engaged for his money)comes to an end, she is forced to go back to work... as a teacher. Well, she was one, then quit, and now she's back.<br/><br/>When she gets back, she meets a substitute(Justin Timberlake) who's family has an inheritance to watches. So, she jumps on board and tries to date him. But that's not without competition. This guy has a crush on Amy Squirrell(the brilliantly perky but bonkers Lucy Punch). So, it's up to Elizabeth to, you know, do what she does best. Ruin it.<br/><br/>I liked Elizabeth. Though she's obviously a terrible person, it was a lot of fun to see her do all of the terrible things that she does. I laughed out loud a few times. I also had a lot of fun watching Lucy Punch's character. Punch, a British actress, is terrific.She was pretty perfect for this role.<br/><br/>Overall, Bad teacher isn't the funniest movie of 2011. I preferred Bridesmaids and Horrible Bosses. But it's still a hilarious ride, and, a lot of fun. I definitely think it's worth a rent, just because you'd have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>B+"

In fact the character portrayals were irrelevant because they were over exaggerated, not well thought out and couldn't be taken seriously at any level to be moved or offended.

","""Bad Teacher"" is pretty good. In fact it is funny. The story by Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg could have been more idiosyncratic, and less tangential. What they created has a certain style and flow. Amazingly, along with Director Jake Kasdan they ultimately make Cameron Diaz's totally unlikable Elizabeth humorously transform. No small feat. Cameron Diaz soars fearlessly as ""The Bad Teacher"" with graceful comedic timing. ""Bad Teacher"" surprisingly works, because she plays the character straight up, and her epiphany is deserved.<br/><br/>In ""Bad Teacher"" Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey at JAMS‚Äîa middle school in Chicago. Diaz looks vibrant and stunningly fit. Her Halsey is a vapid gold digger biding her time until she marries her rich fianc√©. This unravels when her fianc√©'s mother punctuates that Elizabeth only loves him for his money. Consequently, Elizabeth is forced to return to her job after summer break. As fate would have it, Scott Delecorte (brilliantly nerdy Justin Timberlake, also Diaz's former flame) is the new substitute teacher. Scott is the heir to the Delecorte Family watch fortune. Elizabeth finds her rival in fellow teacher Amy Squirrel (dangerously perky Lucy Punch). Intense Amy is alarmingly upbeat, and seems to have suffered a previous meltdown. Scott's apparent physical attraction to his former girlfriend, prompts Elizabeth to get surgical breast enhancement. There is a hysterical scene with Diaz trying out a patient's boob job.<br/><br/>However, the procedure runs about $10,000‚Äîeven with affordable financing. At the same time, Elizabeth squashes the charms of regular poor guy gym teacher Russell (laid back funny Jason Segal). How does one choose to become a gym teacher anyway? After an embarrassingly cheesy school car wash/ wet t-shirt contest gag with Diaz in cutoff shorts and soaking wet, she realizes the solution to her boob job fund. The teacher at JAMS with the highest average standardized test scores gets a $5700 bonus. So instead of showing videos in class, being either doped out or recovering from a hangover, Elizabeth becomes drill sergeant English teacher. There is a hysterical scene when she slams basketballs off student's heads for incorrect answers. Or when she is totally frustrated by the inept practice test results, she screams that is why the Japanese students beat their asses‚Äîhowever, in less delicate euphemism. Then the story takes a weirder turn even for itself.<br/><br/>At the predictable arc during a field trip gone nearly awry, Elizabeth has a conversation with geeky Garrett (sweet hearted Matthew J. Evans), who springs nonlinear when he is rejected by the love of his life too cool for school Chase (good Kathryn Newton). Diaz tells him that Chase will never like him, because he is not cool. She was Chase once, and likely still is. Garrett points out that the kid Chase likes is stupid. Her Elizabeth admits, ""He's a moron."" Elizabeth tells Garrett that he is sensitive, and for now cool rules. His time will come in college. Diaz is brilliantly funny and insightful. Russell (Segal) wryly says, ""That's a nice thing you did for him."" There is cute punch line; however, Diaz and Segal level out the often crass context, with a reassuring yet unsentimental human touch. Even at our most self centric, we will protect those put upon.<br/><br/>The universe has a way of balancing out in ""Bad Teacher"". ""Bad Teacher"" is not perfect. It is funny and worth your patience. Diaz, Punch, Segal, and Timberlake play together hilariously well. Cameron's boldness really makes it work. ""Bad Teacher"" is really pretty good, all things considered."

","Like a lot of you, I saw the low IMDb score and decided I would give this a pass. I thought it would be tacky and trite and clich√©d and awful. But it's not. It's really funny. A lolcano.<br/><br/>The storyline is predictable enough to not distract you from the main objective, which is to laugh at the cast of dimwit teachers and naive kids being chewed up and spat out by raunchy, manipulative, potty-mouth gold-digger Diaz. The plot line may be predictable but the humour is anything but.<br/><br/>If you like Cameron Diaz, Jason Segal and Timberlake (and I do, and you should) then trust them, trust me: ignore the low score that comes from a lot of people expecting something cutesy and tame.

The reason for this is clear with money or the idea of money can control people. Priceless is a much better film but it is French, much funnier too. I think you should see it for your self, CD is too old and to beautiful for the part any one like her could easily get and rich guy to marry her long ago and pretend to be in love. Love not long ago was a feeling reserved for God, now love in not reserved for marriage but for money.

"katepadilla","1","9","18","28 June 2011"," Bad. So very bad.
","This review is copied directly from my blog: Good.Bad.Ordinary (http://goodbadordinary.wordpress.com) From the trailer, this movie looked pretty funny. Not the least bit intellectual, but funny. And last Sunday afternoon, I needed to get out of the apartment, so my husband and I decided to try out a new theater and check out the movie.<br/><br/>Bad. Oh so very bad. For starters, we're those people who bring their own food into a movie. I usually try to stick to the safety of chips/candy/snacks, but my husband has been known to sneak an entire steak dinner into a show. We got our Chipotle to go, stuffed it in my purse, and walked into the lobby.<br/><br/>We should have known when we walked in that this was not the sort of theater one brings their own dinner into. The price options? $15 for a regular seat, $22 for the premium. This is high even for Austin.<br/><br/>The regular seats inhabited only the first three rows of the theater, and still consisted of leather armchairs with an attached personal concession tray. (The premium seats, in case you were interested, were suede chairs and came with free popcorn and your own personal concession service.) So, we're already feeling awkward just sitting in the theater, which ended up being great because the entire movie was awkward anyway. Every unnecessary sexual exploitation was noted, and blown out of proportion, every combination of profanities shouted to great exuberance, and the plot seemed to exist only as a means of furthering the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I use the word plot very generously. Usually, in a movie of any worth whatsoever, there is a climax (No, we're not talking about that scene, but rest assured that there was one and that it was uncomfortable to watch). Elizabeth Halsey, played by Cameron Diaz, returns to teaching because she needs new boobs and her uber-rich fianc√© a) broke up with her for being a gold-digger and b) refuses to pay for said boobs after their relationship ended. She manipulates her way into every penny the after-school programs raise, and keeps a fishbowl for the random singles she manages to squeeze out of anywhere else.<br/><br/>This is the driving plot, yet it is not resolved. In the ""falling action"", if you can call it that, she simply decides to not get the surgery. She's already made the appointment, and she's already paid the cash. Did she get a refund? What did she do with the money.<br/><br/>As exampled by the previous two paragraphs, not a single thread of story was ever resolved. She wanted the cute rich substitute teacher? She got him, rubbed it his girlfriend's face, then decided that he was too weird for her. She did drugs on the side? Ms. Squirrel (also the substitute's girlfriend) switches the desks in an attempt to find out the truth. Instead of getting the misfortune she undoubtedly deserves, Ms. Halsey switches the blame and ends up getting that other teacher in trouble for the drugs (after all, the contaminated desk was now in her classroom) and sent to the most inner city of schools to teach.<br/><br/>And at the very end of the whole show, there's a kiss scene. Just one, between Halsey and the gym teacher, played by Jason Segel. This is placed here, I'm confident, so the directors can say, ""See? She's not a total lost cause. She did end up falling for the not-as-rich guy."" And, because I'm such a huge Segel fan, I loved his character. However, in retrospect, what I probably loved most was the way it was acted, not the character itself.<br/><br/>So, all in all, not the greatest experience of my life. But we left the theater, drove home, and curled up to The Glee Project, which made everything better."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","3","10","21","28 October 2011"," More like Bad Movie
","I love dark comedies, it seems like sometimes to be an audience pleaser we are given more light hearted comedies that never push the edge. Bad Teacher looked like it was going to give that proper push that you could just let go for an hour and a half and have a good time. We had a movie a few years ago called Bad Santa, that had virtually the same premise where Santa is supposed to be good and jolly but instead we have a slob scum bag who later realizes there is more to being a good guy. The comedy worked very well and had actors who fit the roles perfectly. Bad Teacher is about a woman who is a gold digger and is embezzling money from her school charities to enhance her breast size to get a wealthy teacher, great idea, bad actors. Something about this film just didn't work and it's between the cop out with the story or the actors, tough call.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is a gold digging school teacher who curses at her students, drinks heavily, smokes marijuana, and only shows movies while she sleeps through class. She plans to quit teaching and marry her wealthy fianc√©, but when he dumps her, she must resume her job as a teacher. She tries to win over substitute teacher Scott, who is also wealthy. Elizabeth plans to get surgery to get breast implants, believing that she needs them since Scott's ex girlfriends have larger breasts. However, she cannot afford the $10,000 procedure. Amy, her teaching nemeses sees all that Elizabeth is doing and plans to catch her to expose her to the principal and get her fired.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz, I'm still confused on why she is such a hot commodity in Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, I do like the girl, but not enough to see her carry a film. Her comedy seems a little forced at times with the lead character, you can always tell that she's acting. I don't think the role fit her too well. Justin Timberlake, when will the boy release another album? Probably when he stops choosing crap roles. I actually do like him as an actor, he's one of the rare artists who can pull off both talents. But this was the one time where he was pretty much a fail because his character is so bland. Jason Segal, again a likable actor who has great comedic timing, but for some reason to me he seemed disinterested in the movie and I think it's because he knew it was a silly script. There's a scene where he's arguing with a student over Michael Jordon still being the best basketball player and the kid questions his response and he screams ""That's the only argument I need Shawn!"", so shouting this at a 12 year old is funny? I found it more pathetic.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to sound like a whiner with this movie, because there are a few chuckles here and there. I thought the idea for the story is actually hilarious and should be given another chance. I think they just tried to make this too audience friendly because having the main character as the ultimate jerk through the whole movie and then to have her randomly pull the lamest sympathy vote at the end not even explaining why she is the way she is not clever and was a cop out in my opinion. Most of the laughs are cheap and I didn't like the ending. It's a lousy movie that had so much more potential. I watched this with my boyfriend on pay per view, he had to leave the last few minutes of the film, when he came back I told him we had it all day if he wanted to finish and he said that he wasn't getting into it and THAT'S THE ONLY ARGUMENT I NEED TO SAY THIS IS AN AWFUL MOVIE.<br/><br/>3/10"
"talcoleman","10","6","11","25 August 2016"," Much better than expected.
","Comedies exist for a reason, TO LAUGH. this comedy is gut-bursting funny.<br/><br/>I feel as a graduate student in higher education, this is a welcome break from serious cerebral humour and other such pretension. I adored Diaz and Timberlake because they were having fun, they got to let lose and have a role that fits like a normal person. Or a normal, slacker person.<br/><br/>The word play and various satirical remarks on society and education various habits of teenagers are pretty funny. What gets me most about this is that the laugh factor doesn't go away at all. It's a cult classic I think for anyone who teaches or is in higher education as a living to laugh off what so few people actually do.<br/><br/>The thing is movie ratings exist for a reason, if people have issues with drug use and vulgarity you don't have to watch it, this movie had a set audience and has a lot of redeeming moments despite the cynicism in the film. It's realistic and funny. It is supposed to be cheerful even through the cynicism."

","""Bad Teacher"" features all the most disgusting aspects of an American comedy. <br/><br/>It mixes obscenity and prudeness, managing to make each equally irritating and painful to watch. Very few of the jokes are funny ; most of them are stupid and obvious. There is absolutely no cleverness in this movie, be it in the writing, acting, or editing. Putting drugs in a movie does not make it funny. Usually, good films designed for an mature audience do not revolve around drugs to be funny and/or interesting ; it is merely something you mention to create an atmosphere, and it's by no means supposed to be a comic relief. <br/><br/>The actors are all equally bad. <br/><br/><ul><li>Cameron Diaz is annoying, unfunny, and obnoxious in a way that wasn't planned by the film ""director"". - Justin Timberlake portrays a stereotypical prude-sensitive-faggy-dim- witted virgin, in order to provoke the hilarity of indoor-baseball-cap wearers from Suburbia, USA. - The Amy character is unbearable. - Jason Segel still isn't funny, and plays a retarded gym class teacher. What is funny though is how the director, knowing that mostly frat morons would enjoy his movie, has put one of them inside and made him eventually hook up with the hot girl to content his audience. </li></ul><br/><br/>I saw this film in Paris, where I live, and I didn't hear a laugh."

However bullies like to be told that their disgusting behaviour is justified so I'm sure many will love it.<br/><br/>I must write ten lines but have nothing more to say. If it had ended with the main character apologising for ruining the life of many innocent people in her pursuit of bigger breasts then maybe it wouldn't have been too bad.

"Robert_duder","Null","8","16","12 November 2011"," Bad Movie, Bad Cast, Bad everything...and yes Bad Teacher
","I have to start by mentioning a review I read that called out how they related to the lead character in Bad Teacher...yah that would make you a masochist and psychotic. I know that rude and over the top crude comedies are all the rage right now and its easy to see why because sadly they are insanely popular (Bridesmaids, Hangover etc.) but this is just plain stupid. Bad Teacher gives us one of the most unlikable, stupid, main characters I've ever seen in a film. You expect that something profound will happen that will change her and make her a better person but that never happens and then just to add to the stupidity someone actually falls for her which makes no sense because the character does not have a single redeemable or attractive quality. She lies, cheats, steals, does drugs, sleeps her way through men...and somehow that's supposed to be funny? The only redeemingly funny part of the film is the over the top performances by some of the supporting cast because otherwise this would literally be the worst movie I have seen in MONTHS, maybe years. I can't believe this trash made money.<br/><br/>I am not a big Cameron Diaz fan but she has done some really good films. She is better than this absolute crap where she plays the bad girl and looks ridiculous doing it. She's too old to be playing this sort of juvenile and stupid character. There's Something About Mary was probably one of the grossest crude comedies I've ever seen and even that was miles above her performance in this crapfest. She should be given every Razzie award for giving us this awful character. Lucy Punch plays the high strong, annoying fellow teacher who is optimistic about everything except Diaz. Her performance at least gives you some smiles although she really grates on the nerves by the end of it. Justin Timberlake plays the shy and insatiably positive substitute teacher and is probably the single only redeeming performance. Timberlake is a great comedian and its unfortunate he got caught up in this trash. Jason Segal is a master of gross out comedy but he is completely underused in this film and he is stuck with a character who blindly falls for this beast of a 'woman' for no reason at all. What does he like about her? Her violent streak? Her acting like a whore? The drug problem? The romance is dead in this film completely and their chemistry is less than zero. The best part of the film are the small roles played by supporting cast members Phyllis Smith and John Michael Higgins who are actually funny in their roles. Unlike most public school comedies, the kids are hardly used whatsoever but that's not surprising giving how adult the comedy is in the film. But they still manage to be completely inappropriate towards children in the film.<br/><br/>Director Jake Kasdan helms the picture and I'm genuinely surprised because he comes from a lengthy career in directing Television with cult favorite 'school' dramedy Freaks and Geeks. He's also one of the minds behind this seasons terrific new comedy New Girl. I can only imagine he was tricked into this as was everyone else involved. You can't really blame the writers either because co-writers Gene Stupnitsky, and Lee Eisenberg come from writing The Office but after this garbage turn Ghostbusters fans should be really afraid that these two are writing that screenplay next. Bad Teacher is utter crap and I hope to never see it again. There is some very minor moments of guilty laughter but my only hope in mankind is that this is only scored a 5.8 on IMDb which is still too high. Do yourself a favor and seek out something much better. 4/10"

","It's all bad so I want to mention Lucy Punch who plays Amy Squirrel. I thought she was more attractive than Cameron Diaz when she wasn't making a weird face (almost always). Did you ever go to a play where the actors all 'overacted?' This was how Lucy Punch spoke all of her lines. Maybe that was in the script, but I found it annoying (like I find most plays to be). I looked at her biography and she has over 50 credits, of which I have never seen any of (I don't watch TV much). Justin Timberlake fans: Sorry but his character is super Boring. Cameron Diaz fans: She did well with a bad script and definitely has a future in washing cars."

I would recommend this movie to anyone i know as I don't think they will be disappointed. I would say it is along the lines of 40 year old virgin, a film I felt was also a solid comedy.

I know she was supposed to be a nasty piece of work, but you have to at least have some like for the characters to enjoy a movie. The only saving grace was Jason Segel who was pretty much the only likable and humorous character in the film.<br/><br/>I am glad I have an unlimited cinema card and did not pay to watch this drivel, as I almost considered walking out half way through, and for a free film, thats pretty bad!

"chaz-28","4","10","22","23 June 2011"," Bad Santa in a Middle School
","Bad Teacher is Bad Santa in a middle school instead of a mall. This is Cameron Diaz's movie as she is in almost every scene and limits Justin Timberlake and Jason Segel to mostly throw away screen time. Diaz plays 7th grade teacher Elizabeth Halsey whose only goal is to marry rich. She almost succeeds as the movie opens, but a protective mother-in-law thwarts her plans. This forces Elizabeth to return for another school year while she schemes ways to steal money from the school for a boob job. In Elizabeth's mind, it is not her bad attitude or lack of personality which keeps her from landing a sugar daddy, it is her flat chest.<br/><br/>The other teachers are played quite well by an effective supporting cast including her main rival across the hall, Lucy Punch, and an always amusing Phyllis Smith from The Office. Justin Timberlake arrives at school as a new teacher, quite possibly with family money to spare, which inevitable creates the feud between Diaz and Punch as they attempt to woo the newbie. Jason Segel is the gym teacher who has taken a shine to Elizabeth even though he knows exactly what kind of teacher she really is. Elizabeth shows a movie every day in class while she sneaks mini-bottle liquor behind her desk and smokes weed in the parking lot. She also eats an abnormally high amount of junk food to maintain the flawless body which she flaunts around in skimpy clothes.<br/><br/>The dirty jokes are actually pretty good across the board and Diaz's obscene foul mouth produces plenty of shocking moments. Unfortunately, Bad Teacher doesn't work. The character of Elizabeth is not believable for one second, Timberlake's character is just ridiculous, and Jason Segel might be on screen for a whole four minutes. There are plot holes involving a state test Elizabeth must have known about from the year prior which she is surprisingly unfamiliar with this year and a principal's dolphin obsession which goes nowhere. Granted, there should be a little leeway on believable characters in a comedy, but this bad teacher is so left field that her antics display a level of parody and mocking rather than true comedy."
"David_Brown","10","7","14","28 July 2012"," Laugh A Minute
","This film had me laughing out loud, and I think it deserves 10/10 stars.(Perhaps the BEST comedy since ""The Hangover""). Something else: I really detest Cameron Diaz (Except ""There's Something About Mary""), because generally speaking, she is not hot, nor can she act (As an example: See ""The Sweetest Thing"" (Or better yet, DON'T)). But this film is different. Spoilers ahead: The scene at the car wash, with Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) in a wet tee shirt and shorts is certainly worth watching just for itself, and seeing what she does to the nasty Amy Squirrel (Perhaps the best name for a miserable character since Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest.""), makes the film worth watching. There is nothing that can be done to Miss Squirrel that she does not deserve: Such as when Elizabeth gives her a spiked apple, and she gets a nasty rash, and when Squirrel has the Locksmith break into her Elizabeth's desk (After dragging it into her office and saying it was hers) and finds evidence that she cheated on a test and Squirrel snitches on her, she is able to turn it around and make people think Squirrel is is a drunk and a sleaze bag, and get her kicked out of the school, and put into a real dangerous school. The funny thing about Squirrel, is how the people closest to her (Her students and Principal Snur (John Michael Higgens)are the only ones to know what a nasty B***H she really is). Squirrel reminds me of a low class version of Katharine Parker (Sigourney Weaver) from ""Working Girl."" whose character was explained perfectly by Tess McGill (Melanie Griffin): ""Look, you, maybe you've got everyone around here fooled with this saint act you have going, but do not ever speak to me again like we don't know what really happened, you got me?"" The only difference was in ""Working Girl"" only Tess knew, here others knew. Finally, although Elizabeth was a shallow, gold digging, drunk, you certainly like her a lot better than phonies like Parker or Squirrel, because she has a chance of redemption because she does not consider herself better than others, and nor does she pretend she is. Very easy grade of 10/10 Stars."

As is with some of the great R-rated comedies of the last few years (i.e. The Hangover and Knocked Up), this movie features some of the funniest writing.. making for a very raunchy but hilarious good time! I'm a pretty big fan of Cameron Diaz, anyway, so it's always fun to see her do something she hasn't really done before... and playing the foul-mouthed, junior high teacher Elizabeth Halsey was just a great casting job! While the storyline is a pretty shallow one and you won't find any moral lesson here, it is still just about everything you could wish for in a comedy. It centers around Ms. Halsey whose engagement was just broken off on the terms that she is a ""gold digger."" As she begins to work her charm on the new substitute teacher, though, she finds herself going head-to-head with one of the school's most well-loved teachers, Amy Squirrel.<br/><br/>The main cast is rounded out by the hilarious Lucy Punch, Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal, as well as a great supporting cast that includes Phyllis Smith, John Michael Higgins, Eric Stonestreet and Molly Shannon.

","Bad acting and bad screen-writing ruin ""Bad Teacher"", an unfunny comedy which tries and fails to parrot the gross-out jokes of Billy Bob Thornton's ""Bad Santa"". Mega-stars Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake are our leads, but they have no gift for comedy. Most of their jokes fall flat.<br/><br/>The film's plot, in which a foul mouthed, money and body obsessed teacher learns that money and image aren't everything, is both inconsequential and predictable. Most interesting about the film is the way Diaz's character, a 39 year old slob every bit as rude, vile and sex obsessed as Thornton's bad Santa, elicits no sympathy. Why are we uncomfortable with openly ""loose"", vulgar, hard-drinking, beautiful, demented, sex crazed women (Cameron's raunchiness was toned down because male test audience members were ""turned off"" by her character's swearing, particularly her use of the ""c"" word, usages of which were subsequently cut), but find such attributes in a male lovable and endearing? Use a less attractive, slobby actress for Diaz's role and suddenly you'd have a hit movie; put a sex bomb in there, and suddenly brains are scrambled.<br/><br/>Incidentally, on IMDb, female voters rate this film higher than males, suggesting that there is some kind of cathartic identification going on here. Meanwhile, men squirm. <br/><br/>4/10 - Worth no viewings."

And I certainly had a good time with this movie.<br/><br/>Without doubt, ""Bad Teacher"" is far from being perfect and it has its big weak parts.

","From the looks of the previews, Bad Teacher seemed to scream with mediocrity. It seemed like the kind of movie that looked funny, but ultimately would be just a headache of a time to watch. Would it be one of those movies that tried to pursue the persona of being this raunch fest with punchlines? They only go so far, and Bad Teacher looked like one of those movies where they showed all the funny parts in the previews. Still I was curious, and had no desire to be in a theater with children seeing Cars 2, so maybe this film caught me in a good mood, but I sort of enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Bad Teacher is probably going to be one of those divided movies. You either really liked it, or didn't care too much for it. I won't deny, Bad Teacher works on some levels, and doesn't on other levels, but if you're enjoying the film the levels where it does succeed on, it sort of seems to just enhance the film more. Sure there are some scenes that seemed as if they were written specifically for a punch line, or that are completely unrealistic. Like I said though if you're enjoying the movie you sort of take it for what it is.<br/><br/>The thing that makes Bad Teacher work for me, is how they cleverly avoid the clich√© romantic movie formula, don't get me wrong the movie does have that, but it's not the main film. I absolutely loved how the mean and shallow characters stay that way for the entire film for the most part. I liked that a lot, and it made it much more entertaining to watch. Plus I loved how the bad guy (ironically the one the audience is intended to identify with) wins, and gets the devious satisfaction. For example there are no breakdown moments from the main characters who have had an epiphany or moment of redemption. The film does no stray into these characters who seem damaged, but humorously mocks them. Which is what brings me into how I love how this film has a dark sense of humor, that I think really caught the audience off. The kind of humor where you don't really know whether or not to laugh, like the kind of very cruel but funny jokes that make your mouth drop in shock. I love that kind of humor, and the audience I was with I don't think knew what hit them. That's where Bad Teacher to me stands out slightly above recent comedies who seem to pursue this goal of making raunchy comedies. Sure the film blatantly talks about sexual situations, and has a few gross out moments, but ultimately it is the film's dark and very quirky sense of humor.<br/><br/>Okay there are tons of other movies I would recommend over Bad Teacher, and I don't mean to sound as if I'm over praising it. For certain subplots I felt to not be fully completed when faced with the ultimatum, and again on some levels the unreality of situations in the film is fine, but on other levels it seems to be a little annoying. Plus I felt Justin Timberlake's character to be very under written, and that should have been much more. Also the film does push the reality button, and pushes the audience into accepting what's going on. Like just how much you will be able to accept a character going to major extremes for some certain mission.<br/><br/>Bad Teacher is a movie where you just accept what it is, and I enjoyed it nevertheless. Maybe thinking about it later I'll change my opinion on certain things, but as for now Bad Teacher did what every comedy should set out to do- make you laugh, and make you feel joyful in some way."

"Jasee_1971","8","4","7","21 December 2014"," Bad Teacher: Simply Misunderstood and Judged
","Let me start by saying that this is the First time I ever write a review ‚Äì let me repeat: my first review ever! What has led me to write a review on Bad Teacher is very simple. I love it, love it, and love it some more. What's not to love about it? Before I delve into the characters allow me to say this much. The audience have judged the film, forgetting the sheer hard truth: it is a movie folks, nothing more nothing less. It has been made for pure entertainment ‚Äì and of course it is Rated R. <br/><br/>You are not supposed to show children the movie with the objective of teaching them the morals of education, educators, students and everything in-between. I have read most reviews and the feeling I gathered was that people are upset of how Bad Teacher depicts how ""being a lazy, unethical teacher"" well appears cool and trendy. And as if the movie makers were sanctioning some ""bad behavior"" from teachers. Well on that standard, we would have to write bad reviews about many, many, and many other movies. Such as the movies that glorify murder, or bank robberies and so on. There are countless movies out there that make murder and torture OK. I'm sure there's many. But what does come to my mind now is ""Entrapment"" where Catherine Zeta Jones & Sean Connery organize and succeed at robbing major banks, jewels and well whatever. Eventually Jones gets away from stealing from the World Bank in Indonesia during the millennium, like 7billion dollars or more. What about Stallone in Rambo, Cruise in Mission Impossible, Gibson, in lethal weapon? Don't all these movies grant excuses for the murder of people? The list goes on¬Ö..<br/><br/>The bottom line is, Bad Teacher is funny, entertaining and above all it has heart. Yes indeed, Diaz shows a lot of heart for her students and helps one particular student who is in desperate need. He is mocked by his fellow students for behaving like a dork, yes the way she helps him is somewhat dishonest but don't they say that the end justifies the means? Diaz does a superb job in my opinion. Let's not forget Timberlake, who is so into character that you in fact forget that this is the very cool Timberlake. <br/><br/>People, please, I must have seen this film at least ten times and I'm ready to watch it 100 more times, enjoy it, and enjoy it for what it is. Be entertained, it's a film, not a book that is supposed be on your children's curricula in year 10.<br/><br/>Of course we are all different and have different tastes ‚Äì I personally don't enjoy horror and western films. So I can understand and respect opinions that are not in sync. We are all different and like different things. I am saying though, Bad Teacher has been judged for its negative connotations about being a bad teacher. It's a film, it's not real."

","""Cameron Diaz plays a bad teacher who doesn't give an 'F'"". From this tagline you can already imagine how unscrupulous this teacher may be. She is one of the worst teachers I've ever seen, and that's what makes this film funny. It's not one of those comedies that you laugh hardly until you're out of breath, but it's an ironic comedy that makes you laugh once in a while. The biggest thing is that even thought her character would be hateful in real life, the story makes the spectator actually LIKE her and hate the honest people-- which is too strange to be true. In the end, we're all hoping that this character gets away with ""murder"". Not that the movie wants to show that you should steal, lie and cheat to do well in life; the story is meant only to be funny and entertain the spectator-- and it DOES. My only complaint is with Justin Timberlake; as always, he can't act decently, and his character could be played by anyone else-- more talented, of course. All in all, this is a modern and sometimes cheap comedy that you will probably enjoy."

She has played different roles, and always excelled, but I don't think I've ever seen her play a bad girl before. I assume that she had a ball making this film because she really gets to play one here! I remember my favorite high school teacher was Mrs. Martin, whom I'd English with, in one of her classes we read Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird. In the film, Diaz has her students read it as well and I thought my dear former teacher would have had a conniption if she could have seen the character she plays. Elizabeth Halsey is the teach from hell. There is literally nothing redeeming about her. She is foul-mouthed, an alcoholic and druggie, selfish, shallow, vain and is concerned more with her bosoms then in inspiring her students (all they do in her class is watch movies). Even when she changes and starts really teaching them, its only for a selfish reason. However, our girl Cameron still makes this a movie worth watching. You don't root for her character but she still makes this film even if she puts the ""anti"" in anti-heroine. I guess Cameron could play the devil himself and I would still pay the price of admission so maybe I'm biased. I did want to mention another scene stealing performance in the movie. A young English actress with the wonderful name Lucy Punch steals the show as ""Mrs. Squirrel"". Even with as bad a teacher as this, I still give this movie an ""A""."
"kambizs","1","7","16","23 March 2014"," Bad teacher; The experience of an empty bottle
","A comedy centered around a foul-mouthed, junior high teacher who, after being dumped by her sugar daddy, begins to woo a colleague -- a move that pits her against a well-loved teacher. (IMDb) The story has been structured weakly. The main character is a teacher (Elizabeth\ Cameron Diaz), that uses marijuana, cheats in the exams, lies, and extorts steals. The first description above has written in IMDb that makes this movie like an challenge against the rules in society. But question is; this movie can be in this field? My question strongly is NO. We face with a character that has no psychological integrity. Character hasn't been defined properly. Seems the teacher supposed to be a positive person but truth is she is not and has no right to harm others but she does. She is teacher in a school that nobody cares what's going on. Also parents don't consider the value of education for their children. Despite these kinds of behaviors, she is a hero in this movie. She is a teacher who cares about students, and also she cares about the school. Writer for being sure this movies has no way to survive, plans this character like an idiot. All of the characters are stupid except Elizabeth that she can do everything but nobody can arrest her. She lives in a city full of idiots. All of the characters (except her) are passive. Actually seems this movie has just one character and writers (Gene Stupnisky & Lee Eisenberg), just added others too show that somebody else are living in this town but they have nothing to do to push forward the story. Jake Kasdan (October 28, 1974) also has used all his efforts to make sure that film will have weaknesses much more than script. These are included the play of casts, decoupage, editing and etc., which are reason that film doesn't proceed. Inert and motionless characteristic of the movie has overshadowed on the entire film. Watching this movie was like having an empty bottle of beer exactly when I am so thirsty. This kind of movies sometimes reminds me a big question; really has finished the age of great Comedies in the world?"

","My girlfriend dragged me to this piece of garbage. It is rumored that Hollywood has been focusing on the teen audience for the past decade or so. Or more accurately, the ""Beavis and Butthead"" teen audience. This movie supports that theory. The movie is about a hot looking woman with a pot mouth, who spends 90 minutes apparently trying to shock her parents with her bad language and crude jokes. Nobody was laughing. This movie, if you can call it that, will not appeal to adults or middle-class teens either.

It was really one sexual innuendo or connotation after another which I found boring, repetitive and predictable after the first few. This was reflected in the audiences reactions in the cinema which were fairly muted throughout apart from some scenes, mainly the toilet scene, the kid with the boner at the car wash and the dig at the Japanese kid.<br/><br/>The film was desperate for laughs and reverted to attempted toilet humour to get laughs.<br/><br/>A below average film and one i wouldn't recommend seeing.

","This film is not so much about the story as it is about the comedy. The title itself eludes to the comedy, which can be said to be bad. However this 'bad comedy' is what makes it funny.<br/><br/>The story is not that interesting as it does get boring at times but it is not repetitive. The main focus is on Elizabeth and Diaz does a good job acting. You might not think her acting is good, but based on previous movies she has done I would say that this is not the type of character she is used to. Therefore I would say that she did a good job in this film as a badass foul mouth teacher. She delivered her lines convincingly and really fit into her character's shoes well. Punch does a good job of playing the uptight rule- abider, goody two shoes. I don't quite know why but it was either Timberlake himself or his character that really irked me. My friends and I were just fascinated at the possibility that Smith was probably the voice of Sadness in Inside Out (she is!).<br/><br/>There is not much to say of this film, except that it mainly plays off Elizabeth's appalling language (especially around children) to produce laughter. There is also quite a few scenes that I find a bit crude or stupid, but that just adds to the type of comedy this film promotes. Additionally, there are some pretty predictable plot lines and endings but all in all, it was not such a terrible experience.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","You'd think this sort of humour would be right up my street, and you'd be absolutely correct. The sneering at the well-intentioned, the relentless mocking of the disadvantaged, and the courage to show us sometimes nice guys (or gals) DO finish last is like ambrosia to my ears.<br/><br/>However, I can't help but compare and contrast to a similar film by the name of Bad Santa, and not just because of the name. Both movies have alcoholic, drug-addled losers in the main role who are only in their current job for personal satisfaction. They steal, cheat and manipulate every good soul around them to achieve their goal, before finding some sort of minor personal redemption by the end.<br/><br/>But unlike the Xmas film, Bad Teacher operates to so many extremes of what it mocks it all becomes a wee bit improbable. No-one for instance, could be as sickly-sweet as Lucy Punch's character in real life... you can tell this is a comic creation all the way, and she plays it too broadly. Same with Justin Timberlake.... they make him so obnoxiously nice in his part, he is never that funny, just plain irritating. And he ditches that persona entirely for a startlingly bad dry-humping scene late on, the less said about the better.<br/><br/>Thank Heaven for Cameron Diaz though... She might be damaging children's delicate mental health with her corruptible influence, but at least she's a fleshed out person. All the humorous moments flow through her and her utter disdain for the goody two shoes surrounding her. A school like this, with it's right-on attitude and it's stultifying political correctness would probably be more of a nightmare to attend than a little place I know called Potterspury Lodge.<br/><br/>It's just a shame then, that unlike the slightly superior Bad Santa, sometimes it just gets so OTT that it crosses the line between satire and silliness. It's still generally a chucklesome affair, but I just feel like it could have been better. Ah, well... 6/10"

She is a superficial air-head who dreams of making just enough money for breast enhancement so she can get substitute teacher Justin Timberlake to notice her and ultimately marry him. It seems Timberlake's family has a fortune based on owning one of the world's most famous wristwatch companies (yawn). The antagonist here is fellow instructor Lucy Punch who seems more suited to a kindergarten class than a junior high school with sickening antics which seem to belittle and annoy everyone in sight. Also along for the ride is crude gym teacher Jason Segel who is not much of a better employee than Diaz and seems to have a crush on her. I guess it is true that birds of a feather will always flock together. ""Bad Teacher"" starts off fairly enough, but the routine drops off the cliff quickly.

","Bad Teacher is one of those films that requires a certain mood for viewing, Luckily I was in the mood. In this raunchy Rom-Com the acting tends to be somewhat lacking however witty dialogue, mostly supplied by the Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz characters, saved this film from being an entire flop. The blatant disregard for any kind of class left this movie raunchier than expected and somewhat distasteful. However when the awkward moments passed and the viewer wasn't constantly hating the prissy teacher Miss Squirrel for her annoyingly upbeat can-do attitude, the comedic writing left nothing to be desired in the appropriate moments albeit far between they were.

"JohnnyV123","3","5","11","25 June 2011"," Surprisingly Bad
","I went to see this movie based on the trailer which made me laugh even on repeat viewings. Bad Teacher just does not live up to the promise from its trailer.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey who just after finishing her first year teaching middle school has to come back for year two when her rich fianc√©e dumps her for only marrying him for his money.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is broke and living in a ramshackle apartment with roommate Kirk (a funny performance from Modern Family's Eric Stonestreet). She has no interest in teaching and instead shows her class movies all day to pass the time until a new substitute named Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) arrives to the school with an implied family fortune that Elizabeth can't wait to get her hands on.<br/><br/>Fellow teacher and star faculty member Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) has her sights set on Scott as well and what follows is mostly a fight between the two to land him, which means being underhanded and conniving to Elizabeth. On the side, gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) is also vying for Elizabeth's affections only to repeatedly be turned down. A sub plot develops about a bonus for the teacher whose students score the best in testing which Elizabeth cheats to win and creates suspicion and investigation from Squirrel.<br/><br/>The actors are all good. Diaz does a good job of playing an unbelievable character believably. Lucy Punch is over the top as Ms. Squirrel but is consistently funny when on screen. Justin Timberlake has a less forceful role but creates laughs when he's on screen. Jason Segel does good for what he is given but that unfortunately is not very much in ways of dialogue or character. Phyllis Smith of Office fame is great in her supporting role as Diaz's friend as is John Michael Higgins as the principal and Thomas Lennon is adequate in his brief role as a test administrator.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this movie is bad. The writing and direction is largely to blame. In a comedy, I should expect to laugh. However, this movie attempts to be funny by having Diaz say something raunchy or drop an F bomb mostly out of context and almost none of them land.<br/><br/>I can count at least three minor plots that went absolutely nowhere 1. Diaz's character wanting fake breasts is never given a real explanation but is brought up over and over again 2. Bribing the parents and stealing the dolphin statue from one of them that she gives to the principal 3. Anything with the state of her class or the testing.<br/><br/>Diaz's character Elizabeth is just so meanly written and static while suffering no consequences from anything that it makes her impossible to root for. She already is the uncaring and rude teacher but the script takes it to another level when Scott and Ms. Squirrel legitimately fall for each other with no shadiness. Elizabeth can't take this and gives Ms. Squirrel poison ivy and gets Scott to cheat on Squirrel with her (one of the few raunchy funny scenes that work). Elizabeth never gets any reprimand from the school or even from pursuer Russell (Segel) who doesn't care how awful she is which makes her later consoling a student don't redeem her.<br/><br/>It's also strange how little we see of her actually being the bad teacher to her class. In a better movie like School of Rock we are able to connect with the kids as characters which seemed to be a large missing component from this movie save for one kid.<br/><br/>If you enjoy raunchy humor just for shock value's sake this might be for you but please don't listen to the people saying it's like Bad Santa which is a much much better movie. This doesn't have the comedy or the faint bit of heart to even touch Bad Santa.<br/><br/>I was let down by this one."

The gym teacher: too poor.<br/><br/>On the way to her survival, she takes drugs, seduces, steals, and cheats‚Äîjust generally a bad teacher who nonetheless gets asked back. Not a totally unusual situation for those of us who have been around education for a while and seen a rogue teacher or two or three.

Bad Teacher is a weak cousin for its lack of bite and Billy Bob's charming maliciousness.<br/><br/>What's interesting about Elizabeth is that she's not very likable; she's just a hard case doing her wicked best. In fact, she has enough moxie to make her more interesting than just about any other colleague, administrators included. The antics she pulls like smoking pot in her car or giving a boy student her bra are indefensible and would lead to most teachers' dismissal, but for the purposes of fiction and comedy, she gets a kind of audience tenure.<br/><br/>Then, too, if I had a teacher who looked like that, I might have learned something, anything, just to keep her around.

However, the laughs are also provided by various other characters such as Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) providing that quirky, ridiculous, and energetic one liners and Lynn (Phyllis Smith) who brings that innocent and ignorant comedy to the table. <br/><br/>Halsey's immature, drunken slanders, and clich√© one liners intimidate the kids in the movie, but seem to charm Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) the lowly gym teacher with a heart of gold. Gettis, and most of the audience during the show, found Halsey's constant jokes to be hilarious, fun, and rather entertaining. Although I found it funny at first, I grew tired of the same comedy and words being thrown at me over and over again, never really deviating from alcohol and drugs. When Mr. Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), arrives the floodgates for sex and boob jokes opens up and is introduced to the audience. Although Timberlake may have performed a fantastic role in The Social Network, his character has been greatly diminished to a na√Øve, impressionable, boob obsessed nerd who provides a little bit of comedy, but really nothing special. Instead Delacorte acts more as a tool used to spur jokes from Squirrel and Halsey, typically centered on rivalry for the watch heir's heart. <br/><br/>Despite the flood of vulgar comedy, I did laugh at some other comedic styles found in this film. In particular I enjoyed Segel's comedy as the dialog was well written and perfectly timed, though a few of his lines matched the same style as Diaz's character. I enjoyed his interactions with the kids, in particular the sports argument with one of his students. The comedy styles of Diaz were okay for me, but nothing really new of what we have seen in the past. Diaz still brings that don't mess with me/don't care attitude that grew stale with her constant repetitions. However, her sarcasm, devious nature, and her delusional view of herself were entertaining at most times. Lucy Punch played her part well as the annoying, chipper, and over achieving teacher, but I did grow tired of her as well. Many times I think the dialog was written to make her too air headed or attempting to be too funny, which annoyed me more than anything. However I must admit her Al-Gebra terrorist line was very hysterical for me and cleaver. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most entertaining comedy for me though was a combination of Lynn and Kirk, Halsey's roommate. Lynn in particular relieved the audience from Diaz/Segel's comedy by saying some of the most innocent lines ever. Other times, she would take forever to make a decision and her reactions to the consequences were hilarious. Kirk on the other hand provided that dumb and ignorant comedy that made me think of Joey or Chandler from F.R.I.E.N.D.S. I was in tears from some of his lines and although he was only in a few scenes, he somehow managed to steal the show for me and make him the highlight of the movie. <br/><br/>The last thing I wish to mention is the large amount of predictability in this movie. Many times I could see the jokes coming or see the direction the thin plot was heading, which made the movie less enjoyable for me. Most of the shenanigans the cast pulled were not the most original and even the changes in character could be seen thirty minutes before they happened. However, I am happy to say that the ending to the movie did catch me off guard and I applaud the film crew for the twist in the movie, though I will not reveal it to you.<br/><br/>Overall Bad Teacher is not that Bad, it's just definitely not original. The comedy is slapstick, beat you over the head comedy, the acting is lots of fun, and it's a movie with a good fast pace that keeps it interesting. Throw in some great comedic timing, a little comedic diversity, and of course that classic car wash scene from the trailer and you get a fun Friday night movie. The bottom line is I give this movie somewhere between a 6.5-7.0 and highly recommend it for NetFlix/Red Box. My only advice for those who wish to see it in the theaters is to get there before the trailers start, because I found a lot more laughs in the trailers than I did in the movie. <br/><br/>Until next time my friends, enjoy!"

(I thought possibly that they were trying to make her look younger since she seems to be too old for the part, by covering over facial lines.) More important for my low rating is that 'Bad Teacher' is a poorly written farce and at times, is excruciating to watch when it subjects some of the supporting characters to humiliation to get a laugh. More lines now to meet the ridiculous 10 line minimum: There is a scene in the gym where the plain looking, highly overweight teacher 'friend' of Elizabeth (Diaz) shows up. She's coaxed and bullied into taking her first toke of pot and then, nothing is made of it and the scene ends!"

","This was a light, fun movie, however the message and plot was a bit twisted. Elizabeth Halsey (played by Cameron Diaz) was the proverbial bad teacher that tried any and everything to jump to the finish line and in the end she did. The only problem with this movie is what kind of message does it send to viewers after all the laughs are over? Is it that drug abuse, breaking the law and cheating are okay and you get rewarded in the end? The movie is about a teacher who starts teaching for all the wrong reasons ‚Äì she doesn't take the children seriously and the only thing she is concerned about is making a quick buck to get a boob job. Her engagement is called off at the start of the movie when she runs up a 16 grand bill and her fianc√© and his mother realizes that she is just interested in his money. She ends up having to go back to teaching and makes the kids watch movies for the entire class instead of following the syllabus. When she finds out there is a five grand bonus for the teacher whose kids gets the highest scores on the state test, she pulls out all the stops and goes back to the books. It is only then that the audience realizes that if she really applies herself she is not that bad a teacher after all. However, she realizes how little time she has and goes to great lengths to con her way into getting a copy of the test before it is administered.<br/><br/>During the course of the movie she latches onto a new (nerdy) teacher Scott Delacorte (played by Timberlake) only because of the fact that his family has money. All the while she ignores the advances of the gym teacher who is really genuinely interested in her. Meanwhile another female teacher Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) is plotting against her to have her fired but it backfires each and every time and in the end she loses her boyfriend (Scott) and is accused of drug use when she purposely switches desks with Elizabeth. It ends with said teacher being transferred to a non-performing school and Scott now suddenly interested in Elizabeth. She turns him down and starts dating the gym teacher who transforms her into a better person and next fall she is promoted to Guidance Counselor. Of course she does not get the boob job in the end.<br/><br/>I give this movie 5 stars."
"mirwais-orbit","5","3","6","3 August 2011"," Badness is missing.
","I've always considered Cameron Diaz a good actress, even sometimes making average movies or accepting weak roles that never required much of her capabilities. Even though, she sporadicly make movies with quite interesting roles like: My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Being John Malkovich (1999), Any Given Sunday (1999), Gangs Of New York (2002), The Box (2009), among others. Even in Charlie's Angels (2000) and in CA: Full Throttle (2003) she gives very funny moments.<br/><br/>Bad Teacher seemed to be the movie she was waiting to be able to use all her powering beauty and strong presence together with a heavy dark humor, since she already had experience characters with some dark sides but they were never entirely bad as the bad teacher seemed to be.<br/><br/>Well, the teacher is bad, but not heavily and totally bad, and a lot of badness is missing. She's just a bitter woman that lives an unhappy life with no money and no big tits. She isn't intelligent enough to be a teacher, but is enough to be placed as one. Some kind disappointing for those ones who expected not a very interesting plot or something like that, but at least a character that could use and abuse all the meanings of what is to be bitchy and mean. But the concept of the word may be different for the writers and also the development of the movie is quite poor. If being bad means smoking pot and sleeping during classes, pff... please, I've met worse. Maybe writers should have watched some Bette Davis classics as inspirations about what the meaning ""bad"" means between humans, like Of Human Bondage (1934), The Letter (1940) or The Little Foxes (1941), just as a start. <br/><br/>But anyway, Cameron is getting better with the age, her timing is really great, and she seems to be just having fun in this one. Lucy Punch, as Amy Squirrel, is incredibly funny and talented, and for those ones who are not familiar to her I always recommend Being Julia (2004), maybe her first major role. Justin Timberlake does his part well and also the rest of the cast, helping to save the movie from the drowning. But in the end is all about Cameron. Even the movie being weak, with a tedious plot and not even a memorable scene or great sequence, Bad Teacher is watchable just because of her presence."

And despite there only being about 10 or so of us in the cinema, I heard quite a bit of laughter coming from them too. But to me, some of the humour was very hit and miss. The scene with the teachers in the men's toilets didn't get even a grin out of me, it felt very forced. But it seemed to crack the others up, so I guess it's down to your kind of humour.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie isn't hilarious. But it is definitely watch-able with quite a few laugh out loud moments.

","'Bad Teacher' is a film that sounds as if it should be fun: Cameron Diaz plays someone meeting this description, a young woman with no real desire to teach. But the result is very disappointing. Firstly, with typical Hollywood sexism, her professional indifference comes from an expectation of securing a rich man to look after her. But more importantly, not a lot happens in the film. We don't see extraordinary displays of bad teaching or bad behaviour; there isn't even that hoary old chestnut, the redemption story. Instead, another (not particularly sympathetic) teacher tries to expose Diaz, and fails, and that's about it. It's neither realistic nor entertaining, while Diaz, to be frank, looks a little odd, her approaching middle age hidden behind a peculiar face-mask - she neither seems young or old, but a rather curious twenty-going on-forty. There's surely the potential for a rich black comedy in the basic idea; but sadly, this isn't it."

We have a teacher who really despises her job, so why did she become one in the first place? You need to train/study to become a teacher and pass exams, things in which the lead character would clearly have no desire to go through. And if she has lost all passion for her work then why doesn't she just quit? What is keeping her in this job she hates so much? The plot in itself doesn't work either as the lead wants a boob job to attract the attentions of a nerdy, goody-goody Justin Timberlake (a man that quite clearly does not have a big boob preference, or at least never mentions it, so why is it even required?) who has fallen for the main rival of the movie (a very annoying Lucy Punch) but the fact is that they are both at least compatible with each other rather than Diaz's character who takes most of the movie to realise that he's clearly not the right man for her. What is it with comedies staring Cameron Diaz (""What happens in Vegas"" springs to mind) that have such dire, poorly constructed plot-lines? The movie is just about entertaining enough to be just about watchable, but its poor script kills this turkey from the off."

","I saw the trailer for this film once or twice during the time of it's release, I could tell it was going to be one of those films that wouldn't really grab many people, even before I saw any critics giving negative reviews, but I still tried it, from director Jake Kasdan (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story). Basically Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a teacher at John Adams Middle School in Chicago, but she is immoral and makes no effort to actually teach, she curses her students, she drinks heavily, she smokes marijuana, and her lessons all consist of showing the class movies while she sleeps. Being a gold digger she plans to quit the job and marry her rich fianc√©, but he dumps her when he realises she is only after him for his money, so she is forced to stay in the job in order to get a potential boob job she is saving for, and then then she is told that there is a bonus for the teacher who has high scoring classes. So she makes much more effort to improve her students and actually teach them stuff they need to learn, her competition dedicated but overly enthusiastic teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), and substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is wealthy, but she may be much more interested in winning him over than his money. Elizabeth makes more attempts to look more dedicated, raising money for good causes and preparing her students for their exams, and during this gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) keeps telling her he is romantically interested in her, but the feeling is not mutual, and Amy is trying to find dirt on her female rival to expose her for bad teaching and stop her getting the bonus. In the end, after the downfalls go away and normality is restored, as you would expect, Elizabeth proves herself a good member of staff, she rejects a relationship with Scott and forms one instead with Russell after all, she does not go ahead with the breast enlargement feeling comfortable as she is, and she gets a new position as student and teacher guidance counsellor. Also starring Phyllis Smith as Lynn Davies, John Michael Higgins as Principal Wally Snur and Dave Allen as Sandy Pinkus. Diaz does relatively alright as the hopeless educator, occasionally being sexy washing a car or whatever, Timberlake and Segel and other supporting cast do fine as well, but this film is indeed a misfire, there just isn't anything original, with the title you just know it is predictable, only one or two of the jokes made me titter, but no really big laughs, overall it is a disappointing comedy.

Trailers give you that impression? Well, don't expect any surprises.<br/><br/>This movie had potential, but I believe something disastrous happened once they come to understand the benefits they could reap from exploiting Diaz' sex appeal. For you see, rather than focusing on the characters with potential; the giddy, glee, zany teachers.. They instead decided to shift their focus on who I assume was initially implied as the antagonist, Teacher Elizabeth (Diaz). Do you enjoy seeing likable characters torn apart through misunderstandings, inflicted by a man-hunting gold-digger, only to have things go exactly her way? I know I do! Okay, I know what they were going for -- and honestly, I wouldn't have been so critical, and probably would've seen the light in a cock-tease comedy..<br/><br/>Two (monumental) problems: 1. It's not funny, boringly so. 2. I fail to see the point in making a movie that centers itself around an unlikable character, when there are charming, far funnier characters at their disposal.<br/><br/>Finally.. 3. It left me feeling miserable. Right from the beginning, our ""Protagonist"" got under my skin.. I was expecting, oh, maybe she'll come full circle and display some respectable character traits.. No. She splits two likable characters apart, manipulates people, and even ruins someones life, to invest in a new pair of false breasts.. And she didn't even bother getting them! What is the conclusion? Well, she's got a f*ck buddy. Riveting, isn't it? Okay, she decided to settle for someone not wealthy, over chemistry -- fair enough.. Problem is, it's exploited within the last 5 minutes of the flick. Yes, after spending the entire movie exploiting this character for the manipulative, money-hungry bitch she is.. We're expected to fish for positive traits within the last 5 minutes, just because she didn't hook up with the wealthy wrist-watch bloke? Well done, you get a gold star.<br/><br/>Not really.

I think she's great in it. Similarly, there are good turns from Timberlake, Jason Segel and a really excellent Lucy Punch. But the problem is that they are good actors in an uninspired and bad film. The writing is mainly boring; the story is constantly boring; and you're left at the end feeling, well, bored. I did anyway.<br/><br/>It's a disappointing film, because a lot of talent is being sorely wasted. With a better script, this could have rivalled the near-perfect 'Bad Santa'. As it stands, this rivals the likes of 'Four Christmasses'. And that's a bad thing, for the record."

","This film is pretty okay. I kinda chuckled in some places, while in others was left with having the expression of a brick while the punch line fell short. That really wasn't my problem with the movie though. My problem was having Justin Timberlake play in the movie. He isn't a bad actor, but when he does anything in any movie all I can think is ""Look Justin Timberlake doing stuff."" it blocks all the enjoyment I can get from the movie. Like in another work of his, In Time, I expected him to start singing ""I'm Bringing Sexy Back"" while shooting a gun. Maybe I they made his name be Justin Timberlake in every movie it would help with my problem. <br/><br/>So, if unlike me, you can get past Justin Timberlake not being Justin Timberlake, you might laugh roughly 3-4 time in a slight giggle."

","None of these characters are likable. Not all movies have to contain likable characters, but cookie cutter Hollywood comedies do. Diaz's character is not likable even after the mandatory change for the better moment. Jason Segel's character is vaguely likable, but shallow. Phyllis Smith's character is lifter almost completely straight out of The Office. I wouldn't mind seeing her play someone who isn't bland and generic. <br/><br/>The humour: Profanity seems to have replaced humour for most of the movie. The funny parts are all in the trailer. To be honest the trailer was funnier. Jason Segel's character Russell is probably the funniest and I attribute that to his delivery. He breaks up the stupidity. Timberlake not being able to sing has a subtlety to it that's quite good. His O face seems to be the funniest thing he actually did though.<br/><br/>The story: The plot is interesting. Sort of like anti-Dangerous minds(which was hinted at some point). The thing is it's formulaic, which makes it boring and predictable. And what's with all the drugs everywhere? Seriously! Weed is fine I guess, up to a point. It's contrary to the main character's behaviour, but I guess she drinks and takes pills as well. A generic happy ending wraps this boring piece of mindless tripe up.<br/><br/>Nothing else is really worth mentioning. Avoid this movie if you're looking for something actually funny or entertaining!"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Cameron Diaz stars as Liz Halsey, the worst teacher in the world, who sets the worst example to her students you can imagine. When she's dumped by her sugar daddy, she finds her self forced to return to her job, where she casts eyes on hot new teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) but faces competition from butter-wouldn't-melt fellow teacher Lucy (Amy Squirrel.) After learning the teachers will receive performance related bonuses, she smartens her act up a bit and starts to become a more approachable human being, while never losing her balsy attitude.<br/><br/>After a barrage of bad reviews at the cinema, I finally caught Bad Teacher on it's DVD release and was pretty unsurprised at it's negative feedback. While the 'bad' idea worked well in recent efforts (Bad Santa) the concept here just fails to materialize and is just dumb. And, most killingly of all, not funny. It's unbelievable someone as stupid and irresponsible as Halsey would even be a teacher in the first place, and from this small acorn the whole forest crumbles. By the end, this flimsy concept has been stretched to breaking point and, after just a few minor laughs, it's shattered you to pieces. *"

To top it off what Justin Timberlake brought the film was limp and poorly sung. Why would Cameron Diaz do this to her career. Who is writing this material and how can they be allowed to put this stuff through the pipeline in Hollywood. I'm not sure if irresponsible is even the correct word for such a poorly conceived movie. It isn't as if the actors involved had not made movies before, but it seems like this was a bad auditioning pilot for them. Seriously, stop making movies to grab some coin.

I have NEVER seen such a ridiculous plot being made into a movie, hats off to Jake Kasdan for the courage, and the audacity to make this.<br/><br/>Without going into spoilers, the movie boasts of one terrible, pathetic (read: bitch) protagonist who has to make a fresh start as a middle school teacher, and then does everything wrong to earn a potload of money. One ridiculous attempt after another, the movie tries every trick in the book that a teacher might use to make money, and clumsily glues them all together. All the while, the good teachers try to befriend her, and she keeps on taking advantage of them.<br/><br/>Worst of all, the movie portrays the nice in such a negative life, that it is actually a serious concern, if the trend is carried on. Wake up Hollywood, we don't like good people being ripped off! And lo and behold, the bad teacher suddenly turns good (Really? I was shocked! What an unpredictable plot twist). Would it kill you to at least give ONE reason behind this miraculous transformation.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz tries her best to portray the cold bitch, with success, but with such a terrible plot, it's hard to applaud. The co-stars do have their moments (if only far apart). The music and cinematography was dull, the editing botched at best and the visuals - glum (if not for a few shots like the car wash and a portion of the trip)<br/><br/>Here's to an hour and half of my life that i am never getting back, though I tried my best to redeem my warning others about it.<br/><br/>Tip: If you hate someone, there's no better revenge than making them sit through this movie"

","It is said that for humor to work, it must contain an element of truth. I work at a school similar to the one in the film, and it's obvious the writers never spent time in a secondary school as anything other than mediocre students. They know nothing of teacher characters or how they interact with students or each other, unless they think the scandalous headlines of child abuse and drug usage are the norm. Perhpaps that is what the writers were thinking while hoping everyone else was on the same soiled page.<br/><br/>I found myself questioning why I found this film to be so unfunny and offensive while I quite enjoy raunchy comedic exercises like Get Him to the Greek and Celebrity Roasts. First, the latter don't involve children. Second, there is actual truth-wrapped-in-humor, not insulting the intelligence and often catching the viewer by surprise.

","Cameron Diaz basically plays the same character in every role she takes on. For me, the only time that role paid dividends was in 'Vanilla Sky', when she played the psycho sex partner to Tom Cruise. With 'Bad Teacher',it's now clear that that role is playing a little thin. Maybe she's just not being offered any good roles, but taking on this one surely won't increase such offers.<br/><br/>The movie only avoided a one star rating because of a few one-liners and a couple of sight gags. Plot, well, there really isn't anything to make the viewer stay to the end of the film. What you have here is basically a series of sight gags, 90% sexual in character, which are loosely strung together. There is no character development and you really don't care what happens to anyone in the end.<br/><br/>The supporting cast doesn't live up to that billing. They seem to be doing their own unrelated stand-up comic routines. Justin Timberlake should fire whoever told him to take a role in this movie.

The dry humping scene with Diaz and Timberlake; awkward and way too long. The movie is supposed to be graphic, but it could have been done in smarter ways. They tried too many jokes, hoping one of them would stick. And only a few did. <br/><br/>A lot of the problems rely within the characters. Not a lot of them are likable or relateable.

He is so funny in anything he does on Saturday Night Live, and he was really good in Social Network. So what happened?! He was kind of irritating in some of the scenes for being kind of boring and just nerdy, nothing else. We'll have to see what he can do in Friends With Benefits."

","Diaz plays money-seeking Elizabeth Halsey, a woman who somehow managed to become a teacher while waiting to marry her rich fianc√©. She completes a year at her school doing the absolute bare minimum of teaching. But her fianc√© dumps her after learning of her gold digging ways and now she finds herself stuck teaching at the school that she was just getting ready to leave for good. Elizabeth quickly learns that a new teacher played by Justin Timberlake comes from a very wealthy family. So she sets her radar on him as her next husband to be. He's the complete opposite of her, but that doesn't matter. He's very polite and rather nerdy. In fact, he's much more like Elizabeth's rival teacher Miss Squirrel. Once he starts getting close with the prissy Miss Squirrel, it becomes a battle of wits between the two women to be with him. But Elizabeth is out to get him for all the wrong reasons of course. While she sleeps through class and just plays movies for her students to watch, she spends the rest of her time trying to impress the wealthy new teacher and win him over. Advertisement<br/><br/>Timberlake, who's proved he can be very funny through all his appearances on Saturday Night Live, isn't really given much to do here. He just plays the clean-cut nerdy guy the best that he can. Jason Segal, who plays a fellow gym teacher, gets more of the laughs. His character sees right through Elizabeth but pursues her anyway. He goes along with everything she does but still makes sure to put her in check too. He's the one person at the school that she's able to relate to a little it seems. Watching the film you'll wonder if Elizabeth will find any sort of redemption and change her ways. You get the sense that Segal's character is the one person who can help her with that. The movie has some funny one-liners and interesting scenes, but I wouldn't say it's laugh-out-loud hilarious or anything. Still, it's a pretty funny premise and Cameron Diaz fits perfectly into the role. It's not a movie you'll remember down the road but it's worth checking out at least."

","Bad Teacher is a comedy about one who is precisely that and the title role is played by Cameron Diaz. She thinks she's through with teaching, but a bad breakup convinces her that she needs a little frontal enhancement to get the man of her dreams. But cosmetic surgery doesn't come cheap so it's back to work and at a teacher's salary it won't be easy. Remember her insurance won't cover it.<br/><br/>Diaz is the kind of teacher that you don't learn much from, but does give those junior high school boys a lot of wet and sleepless nights. But when she finds out that a $5700.00 bonus will come with a class that has the best scholastic achievement, it provides a powerful motive for her to actually teach and cut a few corners.<br/><br/>In the meantime Diaz has to deal with fellow teachers Justin Timberlake and Jason Segal who both thinks her measurements are just fine as they are. She also has to watch for Lucy Punch who plays a popular teacher looking to nail her in a scandal. Punch has some of the best moments in this film, she apparently modeled her character on the happy homemaker character Betty White created on the Mary Tyler Moore Show back in the day. Jillian Armenante best known for being on the Judging Amy Show a few years back plays Diaz's confidante among the teachers.<br/><br/>Bad Teacher was an interesting idea for a film that didn't quite make it. It has some good moments, but I never could develop a rooting interest as to whether Cameron gets her money for that boob enhancement. In fact males of junior high school and high school age will like Bad Teacher, but I think it will fall flat among adults."

Lucy Punch plays her perfectly, she's so unbearable cheerful that you really can't wait for bad things to happen to her. If that sounds disturbing, well it's just the effect that the movie has on you. Because that was going to be my ""secondly"".

Particularly Justin Timberlake is fantastic in this (no, seriously), he's not the centre of attention but he should be damn it.

Like both of those characters, Cameron's character remains mostly unrepentant throughout. Most of the humor comes from her couldn't-give-a-care attitude (which reminded me of another film creation, Billy Bob's Bad Santa) and raunchy language. The other part of the equation is the conflict with the bubbly teacher across the hall, Amy Squirrel. You don't forget a character like her, and Lucy Punch was cute while building towards increasingly unhinged behavior. Justin Timberlake was over the top as a gee-whiz never-could-exist-in-the-real-world idealist, and Jason Segal gets to be a regular guy. Out of the other supporting roles, I liked John Michael Higgins as the principal that also could never ever exist anywhere ever. I was glad they didn't go too far with making the lead character have some kind of change of heart or show some huge emotional growth, because that didn't fit the tone of this movie at all.

She lets her rich boyfriend know how bad she is spending his dough before the pre-nup.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, she has just finished her first year of teaching, and when the relationship breaks, she has to return for another round at school. The second year does not start any better, but then as she settles in more it gets even worse. That is because her co-workers get to know her better than year one, and find out she really is bad, especially Ms. Punch who plays the obsessed Amy Squirrel to a tee. It doesn't hurt that Ms. Squirrel and Ms. Halsey are both after the same teacher Scott (Timberlake). <br/><br/>After losing the rich boyfriend, Halsey decides she needs to get $10,000 to build really big breasts on her frame in order to get another rich boyfriend. Halsey is not in touch with reality here as her breasts were not the problem with the first break up. <br/><br/>There are some moments in the film where Halsey actually helps some of her students in this version. The film has quite a few funny moments and follows a plot through. I've seen much worse Comedy efforts than this one. I will not spoil it but the ending is more to my liking than I thought it would be. In spite of Diaz washing my car, for some reason I want to make it with a squirrel. Maybe I'd better say that so you know where I am coming from."

","This is one of those films that when you see the advertisement you think that it really isn't going to be all that much, but when you watch it it turns out to be pretty entertaining. The plot and theme are pretty simple, but I guess the appeal about this movie is the question as to how such a rude, crude, and pretty much uncaring person actually becomes a teacher let alone survives at one.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Miss Halsey (Diaz) finishing up after a year of teaching where she pretty much tried to do as little as possible and interact as little as possible with the people around her. However, when her dream husband, namely a guy with a lot of money that she could sponge off the rest of her life, dumps her just before the wedding, horror upon horror, she suddenly discovers that not only is she single, but she has to work for a living.<br/><br/>Thus when she returns to the school for the next year she decides that he goal in life is to marry a man with lots of money so that she doesn't have to go back to school. Once again, I ask the question how could such a person actually become a teacher, however we must remember that this is Hollywood, and a lot of times Hollywood really does not make much sense. Miss Halsey spends her nights roaming singles bars looking for wealthy men, and then spends the day sleeping in class while showing her class movies.<br/><br/>This of course upsets the teacher that teaches across the hall from her, Miss Squirrel. Miss Squirrel is the do-gooder to starts of attempting to befriend Miss Halsey, however this quickly turns sour when Miss Halsey makes it very clear that she doesn't want friends at the school. Same when the Gym Teacher, Mr Gettis (Seigal), attempts to ask her out on a date. She pretty much tells him to get lost. Then the substitute teacher, Mr Delacourt (Timberlake) turns up. Not only does Miss Halsey find him cute, but also discovers that he is the heir to a family fortune. The catch is that Miss Squirrel is also very interested in him as well.<br/><br/>There are a couple of inconsistencies in this film, and also it pretty much runs like a romantic comedy, however the comedy is a lot more low brow, and in a way, in the gutter, which is probably why I liked this film. I find it also odd that it turns out that at least two of the teachers at the school are smoking marijuana (Miss Halsey, surprise, surprise, is one of them, but then there are all the other drugs that she keeps in her desk as well).<br/><br/>Much of the movie is about how Miss Halsey is attempting to find $10 000 for breast enhancement surgery, and how she believes that by making herself even more beautiful that she will be able to attract the man of her dreams, which happens to be Mr Delacourt. It, in a way, goes to show how shallow and empty people are, though as is expected in a film like this, Miss Halsey ends up getting the guy that she should have got in the beginning. So, yes, this is not so much a movie where the girl chases the guy that she wants, and gets him, but chases the guy that she wants, only to discover that he is not actually the guy that she really wants, but rather turns out to be the other guy, the one that likes her, no matter the size of her breasts."

","BAD TEACHER is an enjoyable comedy featuring Cameron Diaz on the main role. It's funny, entertaining and it shows us a ""bad ass"" Cameron Diaz, which is a teacher that does everything except instruct her pupils¬Ö The plot is quite nice and even a bit uncommon, at least for this type of comedy. The jokes are very good, especially some of them which are very subtle but effective. One thing that I did appreciate - and it's not very common in this type of movies - is that the main character ELIZABETH (played by Cameron Diaz) didn't get punished by her ""dirty schemes"". In fact the end surprised me a little bit because her personality and her behavior didn't change as much as I had imagined when the movie started. And that is good because it didn't feel clich√©d. Overall I think BAD TEACHER is a refreshing comedy that deserves a 7/10."

","That dry humping scene is the most skillful comedy I have seen in a while. Both Cameron and Justin rock it. To be expected from Cameron as a more established comedic actress - but Justin - wow, he's really becoming a skillful comedian. And there's definitely chemistry and ease between those two in that scene.<br/><br/>As a total movie, Bad Teacher has its predictable elements but I loved the casting. Cameron is spot-on as the rebel placed among the teachers whose most rebellious act is to sit at the back of the room at a staff meeting. Cameron and Justin are red hot and this is nicely balanced by the craziness of Justin's sympatico love interest. Definitely worth watching twice."
"dee.reid","8","2","4","19 October 2011"," A good ""Rotten Apple""
","There will be those who watch Jake Kasdan's ""Bad Teacher"" and automatically think back to the cult classic Billy Bob Thornton-starring, Terry Zwigoff-directed comedy ""Bad Santa"" (2003) and think that the two movies are somewhat similar: Both pictures center around a drug-abusing, alcohol-swilling ""protagonist"" who doesn't give an ""F"" about anything but abusing drugs and swilling alcohol, yet somehow by the end of the story is forced to change their ways... just a little bit.<br/><br/>""Bad Teacher"" is a rotten apple of a dark comedy about a Bad Teacher, Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), whose gold-digging ways are exposed by her fianc√© at the beginning of the movie and left with little recourse, she is forced to return to her much-hated job as a middle school teacher at John Adams Middle School (JAMS). On her first day back, she makes the acquaintance of the geeky new substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), who also happens to be heir to a watch fortune; he also happens to like women with big boobs. So taking advantage of this fact to get him to become her new sugar daddy and concocting a scheme to get a $5700 bonus for getting the highest standardized test grades, she'll then use the money she earns from that to get breast implants. And she must also fend off the romantic advances of pot-smoking gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) and a caring goody-good rival named Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch).<br/><br/>This is not a bad film. Some thought ""Bad Santa"" would scare people because little kids would go into it thinking it was a new Christmas movie about Santa Claus (and we all know how well that turned out). Some of the humor is very dark and very crude (and sometimes forced), but I welcome it as a change to the usual run-of-the-mill ""light comedy"" being pushed upon us week after week. I laughed at many of the jokes here, and maybe some people have difficulty finding this sort of dark, crude humor funny. Some of the sub-plots involving a bullied unpopular kid and his crush on a pretty classmate are fairly underwhelming.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, some of the characters are pretty colorful. Diaz is still looking great (I have to fake it here because I just can't get into blondes), but she relishes her role as a Bad Teacher with pill-popping, pot-smoking, alcohol-swilling pizazz. She shows up to work hung-over, and spends her nights hanging out at bars trying to hook up with any rich guy willing to take a chance with a gold-digging middle school teacher. I think it's a welcome change from her usual light-hearted comedic fare. In a nutshell, she gives the film's best performance.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, Justin Timberlake, I think, continues to grow as a performer, especially after his well-received roles in past movies such as ""Alpha Dog"" (2006), and ""The Social Network"" (2010). While his work is not ""great"" here, it is at least showing that he is indeed capable of giving solid performances if given the right material. Phyllis Smith is also hilarious as their slightly neurotic fellow co-worker Lynn Davies. Segel probably gives the film's most grounded and realistic performance as the gym teacher who is only concerned with simply having fun, even though by his own admission he doesn't have a whole lot to have fun with.<br/><br/>""Bad Teacher"" is a rotten apple that gets a ""B+"" for effort.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Film was directed and produced adequately enough.

She just has that appeal to some of us. One cannot deny her sexual magnetism and charisma in the most generic of gestures and exclamations. She's just a joy to watch. Additionally, I'm sure all of us have a person like her character within our social circle, it's just that they don't usually say the things she says or do the things she says quite so obviously (or perhaps simply within our purview).<br/><br/>So, either you get it or you don't: she's pretty, she's sexy, so put her up on the screen to . . . well, do something, anything--who cares?

","I went into watching ""Bad Teacher"" thinking I would hate it. I did not hate it, so it gets a gold star thanks to my low expectations!

I personally laughed twice, the laugh ratio will be different person to person, for example: a person I watched it with was pushed to tears by the car wash scene. The laughs are there, whether or not they find you is up to your own sense of humor. You may want to dumb it down a bit.<br/><br/>As a movie though, it lacks a good story. It is a funny simple plot basis, funny concept, but the execution is wonky.

For him, it is hard to watch. Cameron Diaz embodied her character and played the role well. Jason Segal was amazing as always.

","In medias res this movie has no atmosphere at all. It could have been a fun mediocre flick, but its really not. Cameron Diaz ""plays"" an anti hero, but she clearly bad for this kind of role. I mean she isn't even likable, a bit. I felt more sorry for the bad guy. Yeah, I felt more sorry for the comic relief, and also the bad guy Amy Squirrel, for almost the entire movie. Justin Timberlake was surprisingly okay, (but what the hell was that ""sex with clothes on"" scene? It was beyond weird.) Jason Segel was the major deciding point to watch the movie, but he isn't in it really that much, and his scenes in the trailer, which He calls a student ""Twilight"", not actually in the movie, it was just shot to drew attention...I hate that. I cant believe that i am saying this but Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel was the best actor in this movie. Except at the end, she really goes over the top. But she freak outs were funny, and she was smart and edgy. I don't know how could i like Cameron Diaz in this, there is nothing likable in her (except in the very end of the movie). She is a bitch, cares about nothing but its money and her tits transplant (yeah its a major plot point, to get her breasts bigger,brilliant). The kid actors were just terrible, there were a lot of plot holes (like what the hell kind of teacher she is? I don't know what is she teaching, in a brief clip they show us that she is teaching to kill a mockingbird, so i guess she is an English teacher...I guess..., and what change her mind about helping students, and giving up on the rich guy? Nothing.). The editing was horrible, they used a clip like 3-4 times when a kid is surprised that his mouth is open (Its not even a good shot). This movie is not worth watching, maybe once.

","There have been many memorable acting performances in which teachers are portrayed: Edward J. Olmos as Jaime Escalante in Stand and Deliver; Michelle Pfeiffer as Louanne Johnson in Dangerous Minds; and Robin Williams as John Keating in Dead Poets Society just to name a few. Add Cameron Diaz as Elizabeth Halsey to that list. All four had a strong influence on their students; Escalante, Johnson and Keating were positive influences, whereas Halsey's influence is enough to make one question a school's hiring practice. She's lazy, disinterested in her students, and clearly has one goal in mind¬Öto find a rich a man that will take care of her. If that's not influencing your kid on how not to turn out, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>The cast of Bad Teacher is terrific, from top to bottom. Cameron Diaz is a riot throughout the movie, whether she's being seductive, devious or a cold hearted bitch. Elizabeth Halsey is someone easy for her colleagues to dislike, but as a viewer I found myself rooting for her. Diaz appears to genuinely enjoy the role she's been cast in. Justin Timberlake looks and acts the part of a geek, which appeared to be the intended result. J.T. is a rising star in film, and with his good looks, charisma and talent is capable of standout performances in anything he does; I can't say that he's very memorable, but he is convincing in the part. I was unfamiliar with Lucy Punch, but thought she really held her own surrounded by a talented and experienced cast. The back and forth between Punch's Amy Squirrel, the 'good teacher', and Diaz's Halsey is extremely entertaining and is what drives the film. Jason Segal isn't in the movie very much, but when on screen he adds additional hilarity in a subdued way. Minor supporting roles played by John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith assist in drawing attention to the fun.<br/><br/>The closest comparison to Bad Teacher I could think of was Bad Santa. The difference being that I felt Bad Santa was excessive in its use of profanities. There would be cursing when there just wasn't a reason or need for it. In Bad Teacher, the profanity and raunchiness were hysterical, regardless of how over the top. There's one particular scene that comes close, but it's done with purpose to further the story. There are easily going to be people who find this type of movie offensive or excessive. I'm just not one of them. I'm confident that with a weaker cast that Bad Teacher would have just been a bad movie. Thankfully that wasn't the case, and the strength of the film lies in the performers.<br/><br/>Oscar worthiness: none Summer movie Grade: C+ Age appropriate: 18+ (not something you want to take your mom to)<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

","Bad teacher gave the audience exactly what encased in the title of the movie, a bad teacher and nothing more. This movie wasn't bad in the means of comedy or acting, but what kills this movies attempt in becoming a great comedy is the terrible screen writers that could have done a better job with the story. For me not being a fan of Cameron Diaz acting I have to say she has done a great job at the role presented towards her and makes this movie worth watching. Her acting has never been something that has been identified as great, but in this film her acting shines brightly and enjoyable to watch. She displayed the worst kind of teacher I have ever viewed on screen and in real life and did it so well and was very convincing that she was that uncontrollable. I was shocked in the first few minutes of the film witnessing her character because having seen many of her movies over the years I have never seen her act this way. It put me in the state of mind of when she played her role in The Sweetest Thing. It was great to watch her curse at kids, stab teachers in the back and becoming real sexual in a way towards the male cast. She nails the character to the T, but not even her great acting in this movie could save it from still being fairly bad. Other then her and some of the cast having funny moments the script and plot turns dry. The movie starts off going one direction, turns towards another route and takes a u turn towards a critic and audience disliking. This movie is not a terrible film to watch, but is one of the worst movies in Diaz film career. This movie lacks in the many categories that it presents through out the running time. The comedy is the only thing that makes this movie bearable to watch. The director did a good job of making the audience sort of believe what was talking place during the film. The actors did the best they could do with the script that they were given and were fun to watch. As I said before Diaz was great at her role and Lucy Punch, Justin Timberlake, and Jason Segel were enjoyable to watch and gave this movie have some depth in viewing teachers in a different light. With all their effort that they put in the movie still doesn't pass the test. This movie shows the audience that a poor story can ruin a film no matter on whats taking place during the movie. Bad Teacher is funny at times, but I give this movie an A for effort and a C- for execution."
"moviemaniac008","6","3","8","27 June 2011"," Good comedy, but not without it's faults...
","I must say that my hopes were kind of high after seeing the red band trailer for Bad Teacher. In Bad Teacher, we are shown the story of Elisabeth Huksey (Cameron Diaz), who is a teacher in a junior high. She smokes pot, drinks alcohol in class, swears like a sailor and doesn't care about the education of her students (makes them watch movies like ''Scream'' instead). She's just in it for the money. Throughout the film, her goal is to save up as much money as possible in order to pay for her breast implants, which she desires a lot in order to seduce Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a new substitute teacher, even though Russell Gettis, the gym teacher (played by Jason Segel), has a crush on her. Meanwhile, the state bonus for the best teacher in the state could help Elisabeth get her breast implants, but she will have to tough it out with Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch)...<br/><br/>In short, I guess that anyone who read the above synopsis knows where the movie is going. Although the film isn't always predictable, there are many times where it is. In fact, I predicted what the ending would be 35 minutes into the film (well at least part of it, because another part of the ending is totally random). The gags are, for the most part, hit-and-miss: when the gags are funny, they make you laugh, and I mean they make you laugh a lot. But there are times where they miss, and when you can easily hear a little cricket sound throughout the silence of the audience. Elsewhere, Lucy Punch's character was probably meant to be shown as an obnoxious woman, but she got onto my nerves so fast that when her jokes appeared, she just didn't make me laugh so much (although I don't blame Punch for that: Maybe directing???)<br/><br/>But my main complaint with this film is that the story really seems to go nowhere. The story focuses on Elisabeth trying to get her implants all along. It never/rarely does anything constructive or creative to elaborate on her situation. There isn't much of a story in there, just a bunch of situations here and there where Elisabeth is in some kind of a pickle. Also in the story, the character of Russell Gettis (pleasant though is, all thanks to Jason Segel) wasn't necessary at all to keep the story going. As far as I can tell, he's pretty much there as a minor tool to make sure the movie keeps going on. And what about the kids? The movie is called Bad Teacher but we rarely see what's become of her students except for two of them. I was expecting something a bit (yes that's a bit of a broad comparison) like School of Rock, where the children do play a role in the story: maybe her kids helping her get the money for her implants would have actually brought the story somewhere.<br/><br/>However, as much as I am bashing about it, there are a lot of positive things to say about this movie too. Cameron Diaz as Elisabeth Hulsey was perfect: The role seemed written for her. She shines in this film. Timberlake, Segel, and Punch also shine in their roles due to roles that also seem to be written directly for them, which sort of makes you realize how natural they feel in their characters's shoes. And just like I mentioned before, there is some pretty funny stuff in this film, and when it's funny, you will laugh out loud quite a bit.<br/><br/>That being said, this film is far from being a masterpiece. I felt it was lacking pace and that it lacked a real story to interest the viewer. If you're a teen (movie's target audience) and are searching for a raunchy comedy, then maybe you should go see it. But for anyone else, I'd recommend to wait for the DVD release or for it to air on TV. All in all, a disappointing film, but still one that shines in some places thanks to the performances of it's actors and some clever jokes here and there."

Some may suggest they are meant to be annoying. But there is a vast difference between annoying and having a personality that the Dalai Lama would be driven to kill over.<br/><br/>Fourthly, now because these characters are so unrealistic it means the story jumps around without making a lot of sense. While it doesn't take an average I.Q to keep up with the story, it's still blatantly obvious that scenes explaining events were ripped out to try to keep the movie flowing.<br/><br/>The biggest failure on all these behalves is that the movie is not funny, the characters suck and no matter how much they cut the movie up, it's still around an hour to long.<br/><br/>Now in regards to the sex appeal of this movie, I can't help.<br/><br/>See, to me, since free and explicitly messed up internet porn became readily available of sexy women, who are also 20 years younger then Cameron Diaz, I have not gotten remotely excited at the idea of sitting through an hour and a half of bad jokes to see an attractive middle aged woman strut around in revealing clothing.<br/><br/>Or a set of random boobs.<br/><br/>But that's just me.<br/><br/>Call me simple, or cheap, but when the only block between me and 1000 videos of XXX sexy teacher fantasies complete with corny one-liners and hard core scenes is a simple search engine, I fail to understand the 'pulling power' of a terrible movie with a hot woman who doesn't get naked.<br/><br/>But each to their own.

Diaz has always been the sunniest of performers, a happy-go-lucky beauty with a smile that's as warm and pleasing as a spring day. But more than that, she's a fearless comedienne in a way that many of her contemporaries are not. I always admire actors who aren't afraid to look like a jerk.<br/><br/>In Bad Teacher she plays the jerk role for all it's worth. She plays Elizabeth Halsey, a shameless gold digger whose goal in life is to marry a bozo millionaire who will keep her in the lap of luxury for the rest of her days. She supplements her waiting period by working as a high school English teacher and, as the movie opens, is leaving the job to marry her fianc√©. Unfortunately he ‚Äì and his mother ‚Äì break off the engagement, which means she has to return to the school and start all over again.<br/><br/>What to do? She figures that the best way to land a man is to beef up her assets ‚Äì a boob job! But she needs the cash, so she reluctantly returns to her teaching job where she will work until she gets the money. What follows is ‚Äì or rather should be ‚Äì just an exercise in bad behavior. She's got plenty of that, including getting through her classes by putting on inspirational teacher movies like Stand and Deliver, Dangerous Minds and eventually The Faculty while taking a nap at the desk.<br/><br/>A clever plot element kicks in later that the most valuable and dedicated teacher will get an award at the end of the year which comes with a cash bonus. Ha-HA! Just the solution she needs. With that Liz throws herself into her job, and becomes strict and extremely demanding which trying to get her class through ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" That scene has some energy, but it goes nowhere. The whole movie is like that. Diaz is game, but the movie gives her nothing to work with.<br/><br/>The supporting characters are all underwritten. The school principal (John Michael Higgins) is an aimless clown. The love interest (Justin Timberlake) is a clueless dolt. The happy-go-lucky rival teacher (Lucy Punch) is annoying. Diaz's brother (Noah Munck) is a coward. And the students are hardly in the movie at all. Notice that these characters are played by some really talented comedians, but they have nothing to do.<br/><br/>There's a pointless love triangle in which Liz catches the eye of the Timberlake character while the gym teacher (Jason Segal) seems perfect for her. The Timberlake character is as dull as desert sand. Segal is really kind of charming here but he isn't given nearly enough to do. The movie presents scenes that seem to come out of nowhere and have no payoff. Abruptly a scene pops up with Diaz and Timberlake dry-humping while on a class fieldtrip. There is not set-up so you wonder if there was a scene that was cut out leading up to it. The point of the scene is to get Timberlake to break up with his girlfriend, but it's so poorly written that we just don't care. Watching the scene, you wonder if it wasn't originally written as a sex scene but then re-written to get a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>Watching the movie, I thought of Bad Santa and The Bad News Bears ‚Äì for obvious reasons. Both of those movies work a lot better than Bad Teacher. What they have that this movie doesn't is a world that seems to feed their badness. The problem here is that the bad teacher is interesting but she wades in a world that is soft, dull and uninteresting."

","Okay, I'll admit I'm a bit fan of Cameron Diaz (please don't ask why), so you must appreciate that this review is heavily biased.<br/><br/>Comedies are fun, only many aren't funny. This one actually is. Okay, so it doesn't offer anything particularly original and it is a bit vulgar at times (even I was shocked by the language - without the few four letter words, it could have been cut down to a 12 certificate!), but it's just fun - fun, fun, fun. Daft, silly, frivolous and perfect to unwind to.<br/><br/>Like most people, you're probably used to seeing Cameron Diaz as a nice girl-next-door type. She probably relished the chance to let her evil side shine (and shine it does). She should be bad more often.

","A movie that is simply very funny, I'm surprised at the many people who hated it. There were plenty of laugh out loud moments, and the outrageous behavior of the Cameron Diaz character was done is a clever enough way that it wasn't crude, everything that is done is motivated by the situation. It's been suggested by some that reaction to it is generational, but I'm 77 years old and I thought it was great humor.<br/><br/>Maybe some people are sensitive to using the public school environment as the basis for humor, that it's in poor taste, but given the state of the U.S. educational system it's hardly a sacred institution.<br/><br/>The whole cast is excellent, comedy isn't ever easy but characters are created that are effective without being overdone, which is the common and fatal flaw of most comedy. You expect good performances from Jason Segel, Phyllis Smith, and Justin Timberlake, and Lucy Punch pulls off the role of Diaz's ditsy competitor very nicely, but for the movie to work Cameron Diaz has to do a comedy role convincingly and without exaggeration, and she does a great job.<br/><br/>I kept waiting for it to fall apart somewhere along the way, but it didn't at all, another thing that's not easy to do with a plot like this. It's got some originality, and is outrageous for effect, but it works, it's just plain funny."

","Bad Teacher is one of my guilty pleasures giving on how offensive to some people this movie can be. This reminded much of Bad Santa in the way of how we get to see that the usual normally good people can have bad people too. Despite some crude and offensive jokes, I found this movie to be quite hilarious. I didn't expect much from the trailers so I was pleasantly surprised when I reached the end of the movie.<br/><br/>This film is about a teacher with really bad manners who is desperate for a breast job. She then goes all out against a rival teacher to do all she can to win the bonus even if it means breaking the law.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz isn't that bad actually. She does seem to have a gift for comedy. She still looks hot but we can see she's getting older. Jason Segel as always is good and heartwarming in his role. I loved Lucy Punch as the rival teacher. I didn't care much for Justin Timberlake. I thought his character was stupid and did not belong in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a funny movie even if it tries to break barriers. It relies on the charisma of the actors to succeed which it mostly does. I loved the car wash scene because I thought it was kind of sexy. Easily the scene in the movie. I did think this movie had problems with the flow of the plot and some unexplained things plot-wise but in the end, it doesn't matter much. I rate this film 8/10."
"manendra-lodhi","6","2","5","25 January 2013"," Highly Predictable!
","The story of the film itself is not new and lacks any originality but the way characters were presented has made matters worse. There are a whole bunch of movies like this and one movie comes in my mind for now. Easy A, a movie like this filled with similar elements but had sensible way to show everything. Here the story suffers from overpowering a particular individual and in this case Cameron Diaz character. The place and the people around her are shown as if they are living under some burden and indirectly Cameron looked to be dominating all the time. The ending was particularly unimpressive where we see a lot happening suddenly. After seeing the ending I am genuinely confused about the motto of the film regarding good and bad. Performance wise Cameron performed OK and not astonishingly, but a big letdown was from the supporting cast owing to their wooden dialogs. The story itself was highly predictable. I could not sympathize with the central character at any point of time.<br/><br/>VERDICT: 'Don't bother.'"
"nykm","6","2","5","22 August 2012"," Don't turn her into good guy if you want to make a bad guy win movie
","This is an unorthodox school / teenage / teachers movies NOT FOR KIDS. A lot of foul language and we have a teacher who was looking around to marry a rich guy. To cut it short, a gold-digger. The protagonist or may be antagonist for 3 quarters of the show, Elizabeth Halsey, played excellently by an old, ugly, way off her prime, Cameron Diaz. Which is why I understood totally new arrival teacher cheesy rich kid Scott (by Justin Timberlake) totally put her aside for her colleague, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), an enthusiastic, dedicated and certainly has a bigger bust young teacher. It's simple, we have a twisted and evil woman, who was street smart enough to bend the rule and even go to the extreme (even broke the law) to achieve her goal, which ironically turn out to be just collecting a mere 10K for her boobs jobs. A goal which she believe will enhance her chances to dig a goldmine.<br/><br/>Well, the only bad part of the movie, the last 15 minutes or so, where out of nowhere, the filmmaker decide she would have this sudden self-awareness of being shallow and superficial all the while and turn her, ultimately, into a better person. Honestly, I would have gave the movie a 7 or even 8, had they decide to stick her to continue shallow and EVIL (but in an idiotic way). Though that will make it looked like ""Talented Ms. Ripley"" in second thought. OK, may be let her learn some hard lesson. May be the guy Russell (played by Marshall from HIMYM) who always has crush on her, whom in the movie she choose her over Scott (because she decide to turn FACE, lame!) turned out to be some Paul Allen (or his son) and he passed her out when she realized it a little too late.<br/><br/>Good pacing, solid scripting, some funny moment here and there, OK acting, basically a GOOD WEEKEND movie in modern day term. This movie will not pass the creative dept 20 yrs back IMO. BTW, think Lucy Punch make some good comedic moment, while Cameron despite not in her top form appearance wise give a steady performance."

","I loved this movie. I laugh every single time I watch it. Forget the writing and the direction! It is to be fun and comedic and IT WAS! Diaz brought to the screen something different. Every word out of her mouth was deliciously funny. I think the biggest injustice was Justine Timberlake. To me his part could have gone to someone else with a little more depth! lol But seriously. I loved everything about this movie... the sleeping, the cursing, the hateful behavior that some teachers wish they could do and cant. As a teacher, I only dream about doing some of the things she did. Hopefully, people will stop the hating and look at this movie as what it should be.... a raunchy comedy devoid of the usual crap!"

","'Bad Teacher' sets the bar low and clears it with ease.<br/><br/>The film's unalloyed tastelessness is its best quality. Diaz bludgeons the viewer with vulgarity and coarseness, and I admired the way she tears into her role. She has no redeeming qualities, yet I rooted for her. If you can surrender and allow yourself to be dragged into the muck, it's an enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>The jokes come fast. Not all are funny, but enough of them score to keep things moving. The supporting performances are superb. There are many experienced comedic actors here adding funny bits with great timing. Timberlake had the weakest written part, but even he ripped off a few zingers. I probably got the biggest chuckles from the bits in the unrated version that were cut out of the theatrical cut. They were truly crude. I'm not proud of it, but there it is. Such is the charm of this one if you go for that sort of thing."

","Cameron Diaz, plays a stuck up, gold digging, manipulative 7th grade English teacher in this movie. She lets the students watch movies every day in class until she finds out that the teachers receive a bonus for having the highest test scores. Then she starts to teach. She humiliates 7th grade students who get questions wrong and then hits them with dodge balls. Then she cheats to win the bonus. Then she gets promoted to guidance counselor. Unfortunately, Cameron Diaz's character reminds me of many teachers in Virginia schools. They don't really teach. They get away with so much. They cheat so their students can have the highest test scores. And they never get in trouble with the principal, despite their horrible teaching. Teachers who are dedicated like Mrs. Squirrel in the movie never get any respect. This movie was creative and a slight exaggeration of what really goes on daily in public schools in Virginia."
"vladtopliceanu","9","2","5","1 January 2012"," Maybe the best comedy film of the summer
","First off I want to say that I am impressed with Justin Timberlake. He is one of my favourite singers, so before 2010 I would have never regarded him as something else other than that. But I see he is getting into film more and more. After minor roles he had a breakthrough performance in The Social Network in which he played one of the main roles. This year he started off with this movie and I can't wait to see Friends with Benefits and In Time. In this film I think he nailed his role. I can't even say how much I liked his performance in this film. I think he might have a bright future in this line of business.<br/><br/>The concept of the film is silly, but I liked it. The movie was cute and funny, it was adorable. For this type of film I think you do not need that much of an experienced director but talented screenwriters that can offer us a funny and imaginative script. That is exactly what Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky gave us. I also liked the performance Cameron Diaz offered us. At first I was holding off on my opinion concerning her performance because she is actually one of the actresses I dislike. But bottom line her performance was pleasing. Who am I kidding? She was actually great in this movie. So with a cast that didn't look that strong to me, all of the main roles were interpreted in a good way, including those of Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel and Jason Segel as Russell Gettis, the other two main roles I didn't mention.<br/><br/>For me this is one of the best comedy films of the summer."

","Bad Teacher is a refreshing change from a lot of the mediocre, sloppy romantic comedies that crowd the comedy genre. It launches full-on from the start and is neither politically correct, nor for the faint-hearted. The acting is natural and sharp, and Diaz dominates not only with her looks, but also with cutting wit and dialogue that - looking at some of the more negative reviews - will perhaps appeal to a younger audience who can relate to some of the prissy characters that one bumps into in the real world, let alone a Hollywood comedy.<br/><br/>A fun, fast-paced comedy, of course not to be taken seriously in any way, but well worth a look."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","5","28 November 2011"," Not Nearly As Bad As It Thinks
","Bad Teacher (2011) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>After being dumped by her sugar daddy, teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) returns to work where instead of helping her students she just tries to get through the day getting high and doing various other bad things. She gets a crush on a co-worker (Justin Timberlake) who she knows how a lot of money but she thinks in order to get him she must get larger breasts. Her plan of being rich takes a turn for the worse when the guy falls for her rival (Lucy Punch). BAD TEACHER is far from being a bad movie but at the same time outside of a couple big jokes the overall feel of the movie is rather disappointing. I think there's some good moments here and there but not nearly enough to make this comedy work. I think the biggest problem is with the screenplay itself. Yes, the idea of having a drug taking, cussing, worthless teacher is something that could have been very funny but sadly the screenwriters seemed to forget that you need something more than just cheap little scenes that really aren't all that funny. I'm sure most people will remember when they're young and certain students would think they were funny simply because they said a bad word. There wasn't any punchline and not even a real joke but instead it was just a simple cuss word. As you grew older you realized that there wasn't any really talented or funny about simply saying a bad word but this film doesn't seem to realize that. The majority of the jokes here simply feature Diaz saying something raunchy and that's simply not funny enough or ""bad"" enough to make the film. The weird thing is that this movie was sold for being ""bad"" yet the material here isn't very shocking when compared to other raunchy comedies of today. I'm sure had this been released in the 80s that some of the material might have been more shocking but in 2011 there's just nothing over-the-top here. Another problem with the film is that the rivalry between the two teachers isn't very interesting and especially because of the ""other"" teacher being so annoying. With all of that said, there's no question that Diaz is pretty good in her role as is Timberlake and Jason Segel in his part. The three certainly give it there all and manage a few nice laughs here and there. Some of the film's best moments are when it's not trying to be ""bad"" by dirty language and this includes a scene where Diaz helps a student who has just been embarrassed by admitting his love for a popular girl. BAD TEACHER is at best mild entertainment but at the same time you can't help but wish the screenwriters had been more creative and come up with something better than just profanity and smoking pot."

Cameron Diaz is a good actor and she has something to offer in this movie. The supporting cast is more than average and sometimes excellent with cheesy situations in hand.

","In Bad Teacher, Hollywood tries to convince us that what's good is bad and what's bad is good.
In fact, the protagonist - Camron Diaz - does everything that you teach your children NOT to do: sex appeal, sabotage, extortion and outfight cheating
We have a lazy, good-for-nothing English teacher - Cameron Diaz - who finally gets her act together when she wants money for....breast implants?
Then she goes about everything that only makes sense to Hollywood and angry teenagers. She runs a charity car wash with her big, wet boobs. Then she keeps the money for herself? Isn't that for the unrepentant evil-doer?
She also steals a state exam by using false identification and drugging a bureaucrat, which is how people get blasted by news headlines then go to jail.
The teacher we should root for - Lucy Punch - is - of course - the badguy. She wants to do well in every way. Her only drawback is this somewhat annoying eccentricity.
Here, the good teacher sees all the wrong doings of the Bad Teacher, and wants to right the wrong. But the bad teacher foils her evidence, so the good teacher gets the punishment by a proper demotion to an assignment from hell. That's only after getting a bad case of poison ivy (thanks Cameron) and a sound public humiliation.
What's also enraging is the writers could just as easily have made Cameron Diaz see the light and work sincerely towards her goals. And the actual good teacher helps her.
But no. Lets encourage low expectations, misplay and cheating.
I can really believe the conspiracy theories that Hollywood wants to corrupt our youth."
"CANpatbuck3664","6","2","6","25 February 2017"," Bad Teacher Comes Across as a Bolder and More Exciting Comedy Than it Really is
","R-rated comedies are now a very popular genre due to the success of mainly the Judd Apatow comedies (e.g. 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad). What once was a very popular style of film with unique comic genius sprouting it has become a little diluted, watered-down and it can be hard to distinguish between or remember them. In the past, we had a case of extremes with some movies of this kind doing really well at the box office (Horrible Bosses, Bridesmaids, Ted and Deadpool) to some doing only okay business (Fist Fight, The Nice Guys and The Boss). Bad Teacher was able to drum up that kind of business through the sex appeal of Cameron Diaz. Whether that translates into a good movie; you will have to decide for yourself.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We begin the movie with middle-school teacher Elizabeth Hazley (Cameron Diaz) who is retiring after the finished school year. She is too young retire but she is more interested in sponging off her rich fianc√©e. The other teachers do not seem to be to upset about her departure because it is a widely held belief that Elizabeth is a horrible teacher. She has no relationship with her students and does not a care at all for their well being. After she gets home, her husband is at the door with her bags packed. It turns out he caught on just in time and he kicks her out of the house. After sulking in her apartment and after smoking some very potent weed she returns to school at the start of the year because of her lack of other options and is befriended by Lynn Davies (Phyllis Smith) who is more of a sweet sycophant who lets Elizabeth bully her around. Elizabeth decides that she needs to attract another wealthy man and to do this, she should have breast augmentation surgery. She is willing to lie, cheat and steal to achieve this but she is currently without the funding.<br/><br/>She is immediately attracted to the rich, substitute teacher Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is na√Øve to her plot and very nerdy to be honest and she also makes an enemy of Amy Squirrell (Lucy Punch) who is a very committed teacher but is also a type a control freak who is less than impressed by Elizabeth's teaching philosophies (e.g. having the students watch movies all class while she drinks and sleeps). Things do not go well for her off the start. Even through her manipulation she cannot interest Scott who is better suited for Amy and she cannot raise the money even though she steals from parents for ""tutoring sessions."" She also berates the kids and steals the money from their charity car wash. At the same time, she is having to resist the subtle advances of the gym teacher Russell Gettis (Jason Segel) who is very genuine and cool but he d does not fit her criteria for her ideal man. After this she hears from Principal Wally Snur (John Michael Higgins) about a bonus given to the teacher whose class finishes the highest on state test scores. With this information, Elizabeth changes her style on a dime and becomes a bullying authoritarian who is abusive to her students to try and get them to learn the material faster.<br/><br/>Whether you will like this movie or not will come down to where you fall in terms of crass humour; the jokes are mainly done through extremely vulgar language and pratfalls and I found them to be really hit or miss. Cameron Diaz did make me laugh a few times but her language and character are so vulgar and nasty that it really turned me off. I don't care if she is hot, it's to the point where it would get her smacked. There was also very little arc to her character which disappointed me. I don't expect her to change completely but she only came to self-realization on a selective basis. Now on the flip side the acting was pretty good even though most of the characters were unrealistic. A lot of the character actors were solid including Smith and Higgins. They definitely made the most out of what they were given. Jason Segel had by far the easiest character to like but he really wasn't central to the plot at all. <br/><br/>The writing was pretty lazy here and it really depends on your sense of humour. I fell somewhere in the middle. Some of the stuff worked, some of it didn't. I would say the jokes hit on a rate of 40/60. Now the plot did offer some twists and turns and I actually liked where they decided to go with the ending but it is by no means exceptional. It happens just to be one of the few things I did like about the movie.<br/><br/>Now some of the performances weren't bad but my sheer dislike of their characters brought them down. I thought this was probably the weakest I've seen Justin Timberlake, he played Scott as a passive aggressive douche/wimp. Lucy Punch really did try as Amy but again the fact that her character turns out to be as bad as Elizabeth even though we're rooting for her off the start, ruins it.<br/><br/>I'm split on this movie. I liked about 40% of it but I still keep coming back to the point that this movie hinges on Cameron Diaz and I just fell that she failed to carry the movie. Did she try? Yes but you have to make the audience care just a little bit which didn't happen. The movie did make me laugh several times though so it does earn a 6/10. I'm glad that Cameron is taking different roles though. This is a decent but ultimately forgettable summer comedy. I would recommend it only to die hard fans of the genre."

An aspiring trophy wife whose hopes are dashed when her spineless fianc√©e calls off their wedding at the urging of his mother and financial advisors. So she returns tail between her legs, to teaching middle school. A job she took because she believed it required little effort and offered a summer vacation. And, almost immediately, she discovers a teacher from a wealthy family trying to find his classroom. She makes her intentions very clear, though Scott, the teacher (played by Justin Timberlake) doesn't catch on. And soon her efforts appear in vain when Scott (Timberlake) encounters the ridiculously named Amy Squirrel (played by Lucy Punch) whose hokey goodhearted nature ranges from annoying to nauseating. In addition, Diaz's character maintains a friendship with the gym teacher (Jason Segel) based in shared apathy and sarcasm.<br/><br/>Is it funny? It has its moments, but overall the comparisons made between this and Bad Santa are accurate. Bad Santa being the role Billy Bob Thornton liked so much that he played it several times in ""different"" movies as characters with different names. This facsimile, on the other hand, is tame by comparison in addition to being largely dependent on the looks of its 38 year-old star who really should've passed this sort of thing.

I expected her to return that stolen glass dolphin statue and to give her students some real lessons. But who the a.....e who made up that end?

He might be a brilliant performer on stage but i don't think he has what it need to support a leading role in a movie."
"pensman","4","2","6","6 January 2012"," What might have been
","There is nothing really redeeming about this film. One has a hint it might have developed into something if it had decent writers. Justin Timberlake must have taken this role either to goof on himself or he just lost a bet. Cameron Diaz might have been hoping for a career reviving There's Something About Mary but there's no magic here. Her character vacillates between caricature and honesty. I know that sounds paradoxical but watch the scene between Garrett Tiara (Matthew Evans) and Elizabeth Halsey (Diaz) while they are on the school trip. The only thing that makes you root for her is the ongoing battle between her (Diaz) and Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch)."
"alexandruflavian23","Null","2","6","3 November 2011"," Definitely not what you would expect
","While Cameron Diaz never quite struck me as an Oscar Award Winner, this has to be the all time low of her performance as an actress. The truth is that her name still manages to sell and the movie made a more than reasonable amount of money, but for the viewer looking for a full and great movie experience, this is something they can skip. <br/><br/>The plot is really shallow and the movie is basically made to make money and I think it is pretty safe to say that it has nothing to do with art. Justin Timberlake might have stepped up a notch with ""Friends with Benefits"", but this is beneath even him.<br/><br/>The characters are really poor in what concerns the artistic impression, so don't expect this movie to be nominated for an Oscar anytime soon. If you are looking to kill some time in the afternoon, then yes watch this movie, but if you want to see a great movie and truly enjoy it, it's probably in your best interest to skip this one.<br/><br/>Would I watch it again? That is a definite no. I want my money back!"

","Let me begin by saying that the producers must be hanged for approving such a film. Although it is built as a comedy, I saw no justification of that. At least the parodies try to make you laugh and occasionally succeed in doing so, but I do not think they made an honest attempt to make anyone laugh.<br/><br/>There is nothing new in the film and the story, if at all there is any, is not given a chance to come out. There was only one character in this film, that of Cameron Diaz and she swung like a pendulum, never giving an identity to the character.<br/><br/>The most disappointing factor was that, it seemed like the production team was unsure as to what kind of comedy they wanted to pursue in the film, it is still unclear if they meant it to be a blue comedy or black comedy.<br/><br/>The acting was not convincing either. Nobody seemed interested in the film and it seemed obvious that all they wanted was to get the cheque and scoot. And now, all of a sudden parodies start seeming funny ... maybe it is a matter of perspective.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT : Please do not watch it if you have a respect for comedy."

","Trust me, there are no redeeming qualities about the character that Dameron Diaz plays in Bad Teacher, nor in the movie, for that matter. What I wonder is, who actually looks at a screenplay for something so empty, so worthless as this movie and says, ""Oh yeah, this is something I want to put time and money into producing."" Surely not anyone with the ability to judge good from bad, entertaining from non. There are movies I've enjoyed, that have characters in them you simply want to slap, they are so despicable. But in those films, there is a reason for them being so unlikable. Not so in this effort. This main character is simply a waste of time as a human being. Has Diaz's career sunk so far down that the thought of accepting just any role that comes along is fine with her? Why else would she associate herself with this garbage? Money? Frankly, there isn't enough money offered that would allow me to want my name and face associated with this movie. A great big zero as far as entertainment.

Where Lauren Graham added naturalism to the love interest role, Justin Timberlake's geeky man-child is forced and cringe-worthy. Most importantly though, where Bad Santa was funny, Bad Teacher is downright boring and devoid of anything even remotely resembling humour.

","Bad Teacher is a bad movie. Billed as the raunchiest film since Bad Santa, my expectations were high. As far as I'm concerned, the raunchier the better, but seldom is a film that calls itself raunchy, actually raunchy. Cameron Diaz was terrific, but the story was extremely weak. There is zero character development, I wanted to punch most of the supporting cast, and as far as being funny, it's only good for a snicker here and there. It's a predictable story about a gold digging whore seeking money to get her boobs done. Parts of it are painful and the rest of it is just stupid. Honestly, if it wasn't for the F word, this movie would be rated PG-13. Diaz is a fantastic actress and the story had so many possibilities, but they were all overlooked. The result, another mediocre, overrated comedy billing itself as raunchy."
"MovieProductions","Null","2","7","16 July 2011"," Everything this movie does right can be done better
","** out of (****)<br/><br/>""Bad Teacher"" is politically incorrect, exuded a few giggles out of me, and left me with a better impression on Diaz. That's about as much as I can say for this film. The problem with Diaz's latest film isn't that it's bad or not well done because those would be harsh statements, it's just not as good as it could've been. I will say though that that dry humping scene was just awkward, not erotic in any sense of the word, and left me hanging. <br/><br/>""Bad Teacher"" revolves around the namesake character role who has to teach for a leaving after getting dumped by her ex. Along the way, she gets more indulged in her teaching when she finds out that the class with the highest scores gets a bonus. <br/><br/>The question I'm sure everyone wants to hear is how funny the movie is. And to answer, it was funnier than I expected but just not as much as I would've liked. It seems like the film always resorts to foul humor, which is okay, but always being titillating and pushing the envelope gets tiresome. <br/><br/>How's Cameron? She's okay. Although, I have to admit I wasn't very fond of her but this movie made me start to like her more. She seems like a fit actress (not just literally but metaphorically speaking). <br/><br/>And lastly, how does this film stack up to other raunchy R-rated comedies of the year? Well for one, it's slightly better than ""No Strings Attached"", but nowhere near as great as ""Bridesmaids"". I'm curious to see how ""Friends With Benefits"" stacks up.<br/><br/>All in all, I had a fun time with ""Bad Teacher"". It had its moments and entertained for most of the time, but I felt it could've been more than what it was. Let's just hope more R-rated comedies raise to their fullest potential."

","Liz is a brassy blonde who, at the end of her thirties, is on the verge of fulfilling her lifetime ambition: marrying a rich simpleton. But then his mum calls of the wedding, and Liz has to return to her reviled breadjob as a middle school teacher. To her never-ending amazement, all her other colleagues -- the middle-aged loner, the hippie, the preppy goody-two-shoed apple-cheeked nightmare -- seem to actually enjoy teaching spotty dropouts. The script does an excellent job of lining up every comedic angle of the dreary hell that is school life and linking it together with a fast-paced storyline. Cameron Diaz is excellent because she isn't afraid to actually look old, spent and wrinkled (but never unfoxy), and Phyllis Smith and Lucy Punch also stand out among the excellent cast. Justin Timberlake -- eye candy for the ladies, in case you wondered. The soppy, romantic, test-audience-compatible ending -- best ignored.<br/><br/>This is an enjoyable light-but-dark comedy that everybody who has had anything to do with school life can dig.

Now if a director is new to making a film which contains a lot of vulgarity in it may i suggest calling up the king himself Judd Apatow and getting some suggestions on how it's done.

"CSHaviland","5","2","7","30 June 2011"," Bad Teacher, Worse Movie
","A truly uninspired comedy with lackluster writing, weak plotting, and very little comedy. Apparently conceived to capitalize on the bathroom-humor fad, this entry by the makers of The Office should have gone through more rewrites, and perhaps -- dare I suggest it -- given to some other writers for some fresher comedy and character arcs that actually make sense. <br/><br/>Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey who has no interest in teaching. When the movie opens, she's already been there a full year. I can't imagine how she made it through the first year without anyone realizing how horrible she was. She quits the job because she's found a rich boyfriend and is using him for his money, but her boyfriend's mother wises up and their pending wedding is canceled. So she must return to her dreaded job, and based on what we see on screen she's so incompetent that it seems ridiculous that the principal and the school board never notice. <br/><br/>It would have been far more believable if she had been a new teacher who was forced into the role for some clever reason. Maybe she should have been trying to make moves on the principal, who became love blind and pulled strings to get her the position -- which she didn't want but needed to take in order to get something out of the principal she needed. She's a user in the extreme, superficial to the last, with no moral values that I can see. So it makes no sense for her to have ever pursued teaching as a career.<br/><br/>Now, it is normal for characters to grow and transform as the story progresses. That is what story's are all about, in fact. But Halsey doesn't grow or transform at all. She only ""tries harder"" at teaching so that she can win a contest to get money to pay for a boob-job, which she believes she needs to attract another teacher who comes from a wealthy family. When her students seem to be failing to meet the standards she needs, she finds a way to steal the answers to the school tests so that she can train up her students on how to pass it (they don't show how she manages this). This plot works, but she is caught by another teacher. Does this teach her a lesson? No, she adds blackmail and other tricks to her list of crimes and wins that battle too. <br/><br/>By the end of the movie she has not redeemed herself at all, and I had to wonder how these writers can consider themselves professionals.<br/><br/>I'm giving the movie a 5, which is being nice. Cameron Diaz is too good for roles like this, she needs to choose more carefully."
"MBunge","4","2","7","29 June 2011"," Only proves how good Bad Santa was in the first place
","What is wrong with people in Hollywood? I don't mean the drugs and the egomania and the somewhat questionable sexual practices. I mean how do people who make a living telling stories to human beings consistently show such poor understanding of the intersection of storytelling and human behavior? Bad Teacher is another in a long line of movies that feels like it was written by some COBOL-based computer program and filmed by the stand it for the robot from Short Circuit. It has no idea what makes characters interesting or how to present them to the audience in an engaging or sympathetic manner. All this thing does is cycle through a bunch of superficial stuff cribbed from other films while a few random jokes get shoved in with all the subtlety of a proctologist with that disease that turns your hands into lobster claws.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is an inwardly grotesque and outwardly past-her-prime woman who gets dumped by her rich fianc√©e and is stuck teaching middle school. The plot parades through a series of situations we've all seen before, though with the twist of having them unfold from the perspective of the character who would normally be the villain. There's Elizabeth and the hapless wallflower co-worker, a feud with the sunny-faced teacher across the hall, the rich guy Elizabeth vainly pursues and the other guy that's obviously the one who's right for her. Throw in the old ""big test coming up that the students have to pass"" and an unfunny mixture of Bill Murray from Meatballs and Walter Matthau from The Bad News Bears and that's this motion picture.<br/><br/>The obvious comparison of Bad Teacher is with Bad Santa. The comparison, unfortunately, is that the latter is an hilarious dark comedy and the former is prefabricated dreck that's about as funny as a tax audit. That's because the folks who made Bad Santa understand how people think and feel and respond. The makers of Bad Teacher understand people about as well as a Lyme disease-carrying tick.<br/><br/>The stark distinction is nowhere clearer than between Billy Bob Thornton's Willie and Diaz' Elizabeth. Willie, the titular Bad Santa, is a catastrophically awful person. He's a degenerate alcoholic, consumed by self-loathing and possessing zero self-control, who is rude and mean to everyone in his vicinity. But what allows people to care what happens to Willie is that his problems are produced by his own dysfunction and as much misery as he inflicts on others, he attracts even more to himself. Willie is damaged, he knows he's damaged and the whole film is about Willie trying to escape the prison of his own flaws.<br/><br/>Conversely, Elizabeth is a narcissistic bitch and that's all. She doesn't have any profound personal weaknesses. She does bad things to others without ever really suffering herself. She never truly acknowledges or repents of either her miserable personality or baser instincts. There's nothing about the character for the viewer to latch onto and nothing that would ever make anyone root for her. She starts and ends the movie as an utterly unlikable hag who still gets a happy ending, while Willie struggles to become a hero only to wind up in the hospital after being shot multiple times by the cops.<br/><br/>That emotional and dramatic illogic extends through almost all of Bad Teacher. Take the main characters' love interests in both films. Willie is pursued by Sue (Lauren Graham), a Jewish girl with a Santa fetish. Elizabeth is pursued by Russell (Jason Segel), a gym teacher who has no reason to be interested in Elizabeth except to try and screw her. But while Willie welcomes Sue's advances, and any pathetic drunk would with a woman who looks like the smokin' hot Lauren Graham, Elizabeth is constantly rejecting Russell in frequently blunt and caustic fashion. Even though she has no attractive qualities other than being good looking, and Diaz stopped being insanely beautiful a few movies ago, Russell continues to throw himself at Elizabeth no matter how many terrible things she does to him or others. One of these relationships makes sense within the context of its story and is even charming in a rolling-around-in-the-gutter way. The other makes no sense except as the product of the Almighty Plot Hammer.<br/><br/>Bad Teacher does have a few laughs, though they have little connection to either the plot of theme of the movie, and it's probably rates a 6 on the Judd Apatow Raunch-O-Meter. It's not aggressively repellent and you might enjoy it if you're in the right mood, but it follows Green Lantern as another big movie of summer 2011 that appears to have been made by people who didn't know what the smeg they were doing."

","It's almost quite obvious that Cameron Diaz is hitting 40. An actress who had me at the word go since I was a young l lad in the ever so famous ""The Mask"" to me was always sssmmoking! Sadly I have to come with terms that the once super-hot Hollywood princess is showing faint signs of aging in her new release ""Bad Teacher"". This is my first reaction when I saw her, however let me not discourage you readers; she still has it in her! She has it a lot! Some may even love her like this! With her 10/10 screen presence and also with the mixture of her diverse talent and bad girl attitude justice is rightly served to Elizabeth Halsey. Alongside her, Jason Segal (I just love his talent) & John Micheal Higgins were the show stealers in this fast paced summer comedy release. The 2 boys bring it up a notch from the average, and keep on trying to bring laughter at us and deliver at every possible time. Justin Timberlake on the other hand, tries something new (he has never done a role in this degree), where he has to underplay a lot of the times, in fact the script is as such that he has to always underplay a lot and maybe this gets to him a bit, and I personally felt this is a directorial flaw rather than Justin's. Phyllis Smith was a sweetheart and a lady with a lot of talent; I sincerely hope she gets explored more in the future as I feel there is a lot of bottled up talent within her. Lucy Punch, I loved to hate her and so will you. A healthy and wise blend in talent within the cast. <br/><br/>Director Jake Kasdan;considerably a newbie in my terms to my mental hard drive on movie trivia fairs averagely. I am going to and fro and trying to find the reason why the movie didn't take off as expected with such a noteworthy cast, Also to mention ""Orange County"" by director Jake Kasdan was wildly entertaining. On a personal level I feel it's the writers that should take the hit, however on a professional approach I feel it should be evenly laid across as a directorial and writing drawback. I am certain when Columbia Pictures picked up this script they saw massive potential and I am also sure there has been many re writes on several levels since it was picked up on a pre- production stage. Furthermore I am certain at the point the script was read it did sound more hilarious than it is post production. For a comedy Rated R there is always high expectations from the audience. I am no high rolling million dollars' worth producer, however I am serious lover of the art of entertainment and sometimes one should always think that we the viewers are the reason they the producers are in business!<br/><br/>Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) a stunningly good looking teacher who loves the green bills is dumped by her ever so rich fianc√©. Having to come back to school to actually WORK for her bread is not something Elizabeth is comfortable with. Work becomes more fun when she runs into the new sub Scott Delacortte (Justin Timberlake) who has no shortage with his supply of green dollar bills. Trying to get back her lost rich life, Elizabeth tries to win Scott over by trying to show him that she too can have a big heart just like his ex! Her efforts to get her new hearts pushes her over the edge from being a below average teacher to a ""Bad Teacher"" Well for formalities sake; should one watch it?

","A foul-mouthed, hard-drinking, pot-smoking, gold-digging, self-obsessed teacher (Cameron Diaz) tries to raise money for a boob job so she can land herself a rich boyfriend and give up working for a living. In the course of doing so, she embezzles cash from a school fund-raiser, lures an exam-board worker to his office with the promise of sex before drugging him and stealing the latest test sheets, and frames a hard-working and honest co-worker for the possession of drugs (after stealing her boyfriend). By the end of the film, Diaz's character is still as morally reprehensible as ever, having learnt nothing about the value of teaching (except for the monetary rewards that comes with results), which makes the whole sorry mess a totally pointless exercise. The moral of the movie seems to be 'do whatever the hell you want, no matter how it affects those around you'. What a lovely sentiment!<br/><br/>Jake Kasdan, director of the recent Jumanji movies, fails to raise many laughs, working from a puerile and vulgar script that is more embarrassing than it is funny. Diaz is there, of course, to flaunt her body, which she does a lot, and she is still in cracking shape for someone knocking on the door of 40; however, time has been less forgiving on her face, which prevents her from being the complete sexy package that she is supposed to be in this film.

","17 April 2015. If one can stand an un-redeeming, mostly unlikeable character than perhaps this movie may be tolerable.

Most people would be better off watching Jack Black in The School of Rock (2003). Almost the whole movie shows Cameron as a lazy, disinterested teacher who only cares about getting in the pants of anyone who can help her find a sugar daddy. Only rarely do we see her care about someone else and its pretty juvenile. So unless one has a temperament of an immature teenage adolescent, this movie isn't for you."

I watched it and had mixed feelings. I mean, it was rather funny, what with the whole 'bad teacher' and all, but they could have made it a lot better. For example, they could have included more aspects of a teacher's life, or more information on their personal life, instead of focusing on one thing the whole time. They could have made it a lot better if they had had more side stores and other dramas, like in all comedy movies (where the main character has a stress buildup, then has a breakdown).<br/><br/>Comedy notwithstanding, the film overall was generally good- the actors were fantastic, the effects (if there were any) were flawless and the film was balanced.<br/><br/>I would recommend this for a night in, maybe with some friends or family, on 'comedy night' or whatever other people do."

","Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is a beautiful, foul-mouthed, gold-digging teacher, whose wealthy fianc√© has just broken of their engagement. Ms. Halsey is now stuck teaching the kids that she was trying so desperately hard to get away from. But when a substitute teacher by the name of Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) catches her attention, she sets off on a mission to gather enough money for her boob job. <br/><br/>The film fails on multiple points, but also strikes with a lot of good laughs. The film is called ""Bad Teacher"" and it should have been called ""Mean Teacher"", because Diaz's character says and has inappropriate behavior, but she is not the mean spirited and heartless bitch of a teacher that I was hoping for. <br/><br/>Justin Timberlake is fantastic. Im not a fan of his singing career, but I most certainly am a huge fan of his acting. His comedic timing is great in this film. There is one joke that is on his character's behalf and its a great part because it shows how weird he is, but I just wish they would have explained why his character was that way. <br/><br/>Jason Segel is the stoner gym teacher who will stop at nothing until Elizabeth notices him. It felt like Segel was not in the film that much, but every time he came on screen, he killed it with his jokes. Jason Segel is one of my favorite actors/writer/comedian, and I can't wait to see his take on The Muppets. <br/><br/>The film has great cameos from Thomas Lennon, Nat Faxon, John Michael Higgins, Molly Shannon, and Eric Stonestreet of ""Modern Family"" fame. This is definitely one of those films where all of the supporting cast gets all the great lines, while the main character falls short, and has all the stereotypical dialogue.<br/><br/>Jake Kasden has directed some episodes of the cult classic ""Freak's & Geek's"", the entertaining and heart-felt film that is ""Orange County"" and the wildly hilarious ""Walk-Hard: The Dewey Cox Story. It is really disappointing when a director goes from making a couple of great films, and then adding an alright film in the mix.

The pace of the film is pretty steady and makes it's audience curious as to what is gonna happen next. There is some unnecessary lookin' sexual references and scenes that although I don't have any problems with them, they could've been portrayed in a much better and even funnier way. I think one of the main characteristics of a movie is whether it has scenes or dialog that you'll remember a few years from now and this film has got'em. Not many of them though!

","This movie Bad Teacher is not a great movie, but it's fairly enjoyable. Cameron Diaz gives a noteworthy performance but I found the other people gave average performances. <br/><br/>This movie is about a woman named Elizabeth Halsey who is forced to take a career in teaching when her sugar-daddy boyfriend (Nat Faxon) dumps her. Elizabeth is an amoral, arrogant, hateful woman who clearly hates teaching. She cusses at her students, drinks heavily, and she smokes- marijuana! The reason why she took the job is because she wants to raise enough money to get a BOOB job! A real woman would not need to get a boob job. Besides Elizabeth, there is the very sweet and VERY annoying Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), another teacher, and the semi-antagonist who begins to hate Elizabeth when she finds out what she's doing. Amy is a beautiful optimist who enjoys teaching and speaking with her students while Elizabeth hates it. Elizabeth and Amy are complete opposites, which is one the plots of the movie. But deep down, REALLY deep down, Elizabeth does have a good heart but does a lousy job of showing it. Other people on this film include Jason Segel as Russell Gettis, a gym teacher who is smitten with Elizabeth, Justin Timberlake as Scott Delacorte, a substitute teacher whom Elizabeth likes, Phyllis Smith as Lynn Davies, Elizabeth's best friend and assistant, and many more. I really liked Jason Segel in this, just like I did in other movies, especially Knocked Up! He is a very funny man. This is a good movie, but it's definitely not for everyone. <br/><br/>This movie, Bad Teacher is not really as funny as it could be, but there are still a few laughs in this. I enjoyed it.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","1","4","14 November 2011"," Diaz is a fitting bad girl in this clever albeit completely illogical comedy
","She might have been a rom-com darling for most of her career, but there's no mistaking now that Cameron Diaz is a natural bad girl. Sure, part of it might have to do with survival of the fittest; raunchy R-rated comedies are the new cool kid in class and those who can't play that game will find themselves jobless. But Diaz might have even upped her stock with her performance in ""Bad Teacher,"" a movie that's unapologetically crude if not to the fault of absurdity. Nevertheless, foul-mouthed middle school teacher Elizabeth Halsey makes for an amusing character study (no worries, you can skate by on the cliff notes).<br/><br/>Writers Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky have essentially taken the laundry list of what qualities constitute a good teacher and ensured that Elizabeth embodies or does the opposite. To top it off (no pun intended), her motivation throughout the entire film is to raise enough money to afford breast implants, or as her character would be more apt to say, ""a new pair of t***,"" so that she might be able to woo the attractive and wealthy new substitute (Justin Timberlake). <br/><br/>Entire films have been built from shallower foundations, but for those bothered by issues of plausibility, ""Bad Teacher"" will be offensive in more ways than the many it already intended. How someone of Elizabeth's nature ever got a teaching position in the first place will be the one question that crosses the mind of every viewer at some point during the film. Once you get past that whole in logic, it becomes easier to appreciate the way ""Bad Teacher"" allows us a chance to imagine what the world's worst teacher would be like.<br/><br/>Elizabeth is about to finish her first (and only) year at John Adams Middle School somewhere in Illinois and wed the ""man of her dreams"" only he and his mother are on to the fact that she only wants him for the money. Her plan having failed, she returns to ""JAMS"" as a means of keeping herself (and her poor lifestyle) afloat. Her return reignites the gym teacher's (Jason Segel) advances and a rivalry with her polar opposite, the spunky learning-lover Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Other than Diaz, Punch is the only one who seems aware of how absurd the film is and consequently she pushes it further with her delightfully quirky performance.<br/><br/>The depths to which both Elizabeth and Amy will stoop to get what they want or ruin the other have no limit. Their schemes are cleverly concocted, though they're along the lines of your typical high jinks. Putting aside that their entire story relies on an unusually large suspension of disbelief, Eisenberg and Stupnitsky show a knack for writing easily digested crowd-pleasers. The array of other supporting characters could be described as either run-of-the-mill or perfectly adequate. Timberlake makes few waves as a socially oblivious dork who as it turns out has a passion for dry-humping and John Michael Higgins delivers exactly what's expected of him: acting like John Michael Higgins. Phyllis Smith brings her ""The Office"" character over to this film with a measure of success, but only those unfamiliar with her will be impressed.<br/><br/>The small ounce of a ""good message"" comes with a slight lowering of Elizabeth's superficial expectations after her grand plan unfurls. The natural thought here would be to completely ignore any sort of moral responsibility to end on a warm and fuzzy note considering all previous material dismisses it anyway. Yet some sort of Hollywood obligation must have nagged for awhile. Forget Elizabeth, the fact that Segel's character Russell would want anything to do with her beginning, middle or end of the film says a lot (though quite little) about his character.<br/><br/>The R-rated comedy trend continues to thrive with ""Bad Teacher,"" though for better or worse it's hard to say. Calling it a guilty pleasure comedy might be the most apt description, as even those who really enjoy it will admit just where it falls on the preposterous spectrum. Considering many previous Cameron Diaz vehicles have fallen into the guilty pleasure category too, maybe the actress has been in her comfort zone all along.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site! moviemusereviews.com"

","2011 has been an above-average year for female-driven comedy, with recent films like ""Bridesmaids"", and ""What's Your Number"", proving to be the good and the bad. Today, we have ""Bad Teacher"", a Cameron Diaz film that falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum.<br/><br/>It follows Elizabeth Halsey, a morally corrupt middle-school English teacher, whose plans to quit her day job, to be a kept woman, were derailed. She's not necessarily a bad person, in my eyes, but she really shouldn't be teaching. She drinks, smokes weed, and puts on movies for her class, on the first day of school. She plays films for her class about good teachers, like ""Dead Poets Society"" and ""Freedom Writers"", while she pours airplane bottles of vodka into her coffee mug, ignoring her students completely.<br/><br/>All of this is very funny to me, because this part of the movie is pretty well-conceived. Cameron Diaz gave a great performance, and proved herself to have above-average comic timing. She isn't to blame for where ""Bad Teacher"" went wrong. It leaves this viewer underwhelmed, at a film that should have been a lot funnier. However, it isn't necessarily a bad movie either. It's just never as funny as it should be. <br/><br/>Written by ""The Office"" alums Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky, the film slightly resembles a long episode of ""The Office"" - something that has a brilliant concept, and the fully capable actors, however, it never really comes together in the end. However, there are a lot of reasons why this movie did work.<br/><br/>One being that it makes pretty good use of the time that it's given. It runs about 90 minutes, on the dot, and it feels full and decently conceived. One big reason is Cameron Diaz, proving herself not to be just a pretty face, but something of a cunning comedienne. She plays one of the most detestable characters that American cinema has recently seen, however, the audience can't help but root for her. <br/><br/>However, when the movie approaches moments of golden politically incorrect humor every so often, it's not what it should have been. A standard has been set for R-rated comedy films in the past few years, by films like ""Knocked Up"", ""The Hangover"" and ""Bridesmaids"", showing that there's a new point-of-no-return for comedy. This involves raunchy humor, yet it proves every so often, that new comedic punchlines and ideas haven't run dry.<br/><br/>However, ""Bad Teacher"" shows us nothing we haven't seen before, recycling jokes from other (and better) movies. From a lame school car- wash scene, to a borderline degrading subplot about a boob job, there isn't enough good to outweigh the bad. As I said, it has its moments, but there aren't enough of those moments to make this a great film.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","""Bad Teacher"" is one of those movies where the audience just agrees with the movie that their own teacher is a mean, ruthless, antagonizing, and a messed-up (fill in the blanks). Cameron Diaz stars in a new comedy, where she plays an inappropriate teacher who starts crushing for Justin Timberlake as the new substitute teacher, and starts raising money for useless boob jobs. Then she ends up having Jason Segel's gym teacher trying to crush on her, tries being friends with John Michael Higgins as a dolphin-obsessed principal, and tries to avoid the antagonizing advantages of Lucy Punch's across-the-hall teacher. Now, ""Bad Teacher"" may have its moments, but it's quite disappointing. First of all, one of the only things I liked about this movie was Cameron Diaz's surprising performance. She is really charismatic, and her stupidity and sexy looks makes her funny. Also, I'm a total fan of Jason Segel, and I really loved him in this movie. Although there were some funny moments, ""Bad Teacher"" has its negative moments. ""Bad Teacher"" is not really a perfect comedy, because it's not well-written, well-raunchy, and not even well-comedic like ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Horrible Bosses"". Also, Justin Timberlake makes an average performance that any other actor can do, and John Michael Higgins was okay. But Lucy Punch created the most weirdest and stupid performance ever on screen, and I hated her so much in this movie. She is such an annoying role, and I hope she gets a Razzie award nomination. ""Bad Teacher"" may have it's funny moments, and maybe Cameron and Jason delivered hilarious performances, it's not as good as all the other better comedies of the year.

","Bad Teacher was this overly hyped event promising humor on par with 'The Hangover' and largely was unable to live up to such expectation. However, Diaz plays the part of a money grubbing and social climbing malcontent spot-on and really saves this film. It's her goofiness from 'something about marry' meets the self-centered character types she's played in other roles. The humor is crass at times, almost too much (like bridesmaids) but the level of it in her character is absolutely hysterical. She is consistently a bad teacher and the lessons learned by her actions are interesting - in short, sometimes being bad can be good. Despite the mistakes, it's unmistakable that this movie is hilarious. This movie is not perfect by any means but it delivers some serious comedy at the expense of political correctness and a morally ambiguous messages. If you ""get it"", you will set that Bad Teacher is an honest look at a bad person, with lessons more subtle and in some ways more real. Some may liken this movie to Bad Santa. I recommend."

Tis the season to venture out of your comfort zone, like what Jennifer Aniston did with her role in Horrible Bosses, and now it's Cameron Diaz's turn in this film by Jake Kasdan.<br/><br/>So Diaz plays middle school teacher Elizabeth Halsey, who thought she could finally escape a life of mediocrity having hooked up with a rich man, only for that impending marriage to be broken up, and her life come crashing back down to reality again, rejoining the school she can't seem to leave, and then setting up a new goal in life - getting boob implants because of her belief that the bigger the boobs, the richer the man she's able to attract. In between she's the teacher you'd love to have, not only looking good, but possessing just a one track educational plan - screening videos in class everyday so that she can sleep off her hangover. Comedy comes in the form of watching how this teacher is anything but a role model, swearing, embezzling and abusing drugs being her daily routine, in front of and behind her kids in school.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as a friend commented, the trailer for this film was miles better than the movie, and he's correct. Whoever did the trailer for the film inserted all the best bits in a typically logical order, only for the film to reveal that it's episodic in nature and scenes somehow felt they were pieced together quite forcefully, where the flow doesn't feel natural especially when it's supposed to take place in middle school over a period of a school year (for instance it's suddenly a winter break), but the school kids themselves are largely invisible here save for 2 kids for Elizabeth to show how naughty and nice she can be. There's a perplexing overemphasis on Elizbaeth's boob ambition which brings on the laughs of course, but little else, and a number of subplots and characters that come, go and got themselves forgotten.<br/><br/>There's the infatuation with Justin Timberlake's relief Math teacher Scott Delacorte who comes with a pedigree family name and bank account, which sets up the subplot of a three way romantic battle between Elizabeth and the resident teacher she loathes, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch), who is hell bent on exposing Elizabeth for the bad teacher she is. Nothing fancy here except rolling your eyes at Amy's exasperated antics, much like Coyote and Road Runner where you'd just know whatever stunt Amy tries to pull, she's never going to get the better of Elizabeth because it's just written in the stars of film plotting. Jason Segel plays gym teacher Russell Gettis whose scenes seemed to have a huge chunk of development dropped from the film, relegating him to back up plan status especially when there's a need for something to insert into the finale.<br/><br/>The scene stealer in the show happened to be Justin Timberlake, who played his immature teacher to perfection, scoring probably one of funniest (and strangest) scenes in the entire film that have to be seen to be believed. He's on a roll in recent times since his outing in The Social Network, and his filmography bursting this year with two more upcoming films (in Singapore) with Friends with Benefits, and In Time. Cameron Diaz tried hard to break out of her ditzy blonde roles with the mean streak inherited from her character Elizabeth, but try as hard as you may, it still isn't wild enough to totally break the typecast Diaz is known for.<br/><br/>Ultimately Bad Teacher isn't bad but it still fell short in delivering where it mattered - the laughs - lacking the distinction it could have gotten if it had found a smoother narrative flow, and not let its trailer set expectations up for a fall."

","BAD TEACHER ‚Äì CATCH IT ( C+ ) Bad Teacher is not as funny as it is in the promos. The best thing about the movie is that Cameron Diaz is as good or should I say Better than she seems in promos. Bad Teacher's premises Is really interesting and R-rated humor makes it blunter. The only thing it's lacking is characterization, if Cameron Diaz character had more characterization then movie would have been brilliant. Cameron Diaz is truly amazing as Bad Teacher, this role is truly for her and she proved yet again that she is one of the best female lead comedians around. Justin Timberlake provided the perfect freshness and weirdness. FYI watching real life Xz Justin Timberlake Dry Humping Cameron Diaz was really Awkward. I don't remember watching dry humping in movies like Ever and then between JT and Cam, never imagined that! Jason Segel didn't get much scope but Lucy Punch was hilarious. This girl has potential if right character is provided. Overall, Bad Teacher is a good concept but poorly executed. Cameron Diaz saves the movie for me. Flawed but Worthy."

","I planned to do two reviews this week, Jane Eyre (2011) and Bad Teacher (2011); luckily, I decided to watch and review The Cameron Diaz movie first. I can assure you the result would have been different had it been the other way around. Bad Teacher is your typical Hollywood movie about California people, ""it's like really¬Ö"" you get my drift. The trick here is to plan. I considered the best circumstance to watch this flick was to eat pizza and have a few beers, as many as it took to avoid negative vibes. As it turns out, when eating an oily (that's how I like it) pizza and drinking beer, the movie is entertaining. You have a slutty, dirty talking Cameron Diaz shaking her booty and showing some skin; what more can a guy ask for on a cloudy rainy summer afternoon slacking off. The movie goes extremely well with the aforementioned food and beverage I've sufficiently promoted. There were several scenes with Justin Timberlake; I don't care for him, I'm a guy. Jason Segel also plays in this movie and him I could tolerate even with less beer; not so for Timberlake. I won't need to recommend the movie; those who will choose to see it, will. If you have a few beers and hunger for some pizza, are in a horny mood and don't have a clue what to do, you might consider it. I like it when Cameron Diaz says¬Ö Sorry, IMDb guidelines have strict rules about words that can and cannot be used."
"JasonDanielBaker","Null","1","4","22 August 2011"," One of the Most Eloquent Narratives the Language of Film Has Ever Related
","Diabolical teacher Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz), an abrasive, rude and exceptionally vindictive woman is on a mission: get wasted, go through the motions of teaching middle school, get wasted, earn enough for new implants, get wasted, marry a rich dude who will take care of her, get wasted, destroy a perky rival Ms.Squirrel (Lucy Punch) and of course get wasted.<br/><br/>The public postulate on teachers is that they are underpaid, overworked and generally under-appreciated members of society on a collective mission very nearly looked upon as a charitable donation of time. That is a postulate not reflected in this movie.<br/><br/>Miss Halsey is presented as an exception to the reality - a composite of every parent's nightmare, one who by her very nature defines solipsism and provides an example so poor that Mussolini's teaching record looks exemplary by comparison. She wouldn't last the morning in a real school even as a sub.<br/><br/>The key thing to note about this film is the inverse moral scale. None of the people depicted are particularly virtuous though several are faking it. If you have kids in middle public school you might be a little disturbed by a film like this. Perhaps enough to consider home-schooling.<br/><br/>Think of Youtube videos where you see teachers going ballistic over kids cellphones (Anyone knows kids shouldn't have cellphones in class) ringing or stories about women who have sex with their students and you'll get an idea of the worst case scenario they are tapping into here.<br/><br/>There is always that fear in the back of the minds of parents about what educators are doing. Where this might be helpful is giving us a sense of the wrong kind of teacher.<br/><br/>Like a film that is, say a comedy about health-care this production mines an institution in crisis - in this case the education system - for comedy. There are a lot of comically subversive films out there but few actually invent new ways to be offensive the way this one does."

","As I have said in other reviews (see Knight and Day), there is something special about Cameron Diaz. Look into her eyes in a close-up...<br/><br/>She is not just gorgeous, she is interesting. And she carries this off again in this enjoyable movie. This time, she is not the good girl, or the good guy's gal pal, she is BAD. She throws herself at anyone with money; she keeps her job as a teacher only because her sugar daddy dumps her right before their wedding. She smokes, she drinks, she does just about anything except f--k. She lives with a totally clueless room mate who thinks she is a nurse. Her initial idea of teaching is to show educational movies... all the time.<br/><br/>Her goal is to get a boob job (as if she really needs one) to attract ""someone who will take care of her."" Justin Timberlake plays the role of the guy who is as clueless as he is rich, and her target. Lucy Punch is the goodie-two-shoes rival. And Jason Segal is the waiting-in-the-wings would-be boy friend. The actors all play their roles with skill and precision.<br/><br/>This comedy should remind just about everyone of their school days and the one (and only) babe teacher who was the object of their lust, obsession, and infatuation. If so, then the somewhat stereotyped comedy will seem a little funnier, a little more enjoyable, and like a film you will want to watch again.<br/><br/>Diaz makes much of her great body, acting ability, and a complicated personality to make this a flick you will enjoy, and enjoy again."
"Hocklife","Null","1","4","17 August 2011"," Slow and Only Moderatley Funny (at Times).
","This movie has the feeling of being so simplistic it makes the plot of 30 Minutes or Less ( another recent comedy) look sophisticated. The story to sum it up in a few lines is Cameron Diaz must go back to being a teacher after her rich husband leaves her. The rest of the movie is her journey of being an awful person and trying to earn money for her boob job along the way.<br/><br/>Since this movie does more harm then good to itself I'll lay out what it does right up front. If you're a male attending this movie there's a good chance you'll find Cameron Diaz hot in this movie. In fact many shots go out of their way it feels to establish her great looks. She fits her character well because she also plays the role of a jerk well and the volatile combination is used to manipulate multiple characters through out the movie. Another strong suite of the movie is Jason Segal's character as the lazy underachieving gym teacher is always stealing scenes but remains a relatively underutilized. That pretty much describes all I felt was done right in this movie.<br/><br/>Now that we've moved onto what's not so good with this rather dull comedy , I'll begin by saying too many jokes fell flat and some scenes kill the pacing to make a relatively short movie feel much longer then it had to be. The story is very similar to Bad Santa except not nearly being as pleasant. The comedy seemed forced time and time again using many weed and alcohol jokes to push itself along. While the movie goes for the look of being a film with no morals at all I felt the comedy was constrained hardly utilizing the ""R"" rating it was given.<br/><br/>Overall it was at times fun , never hilarious and annoying quite a bit 5/10"
"The_Light_Triton","Null","1","4","29 July 2011"," Not that funny, but worthwhile.
","Why would this film be worthwhile? well, for one, Cameron diaz is still hotter than fire at age 38 (and a great actress) and she fills the role of a gold digging woman perfectly. throughout the first half of the movie you wanna punch her for being like that.<br/><br/>So Cameron diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a sexy schoolteacher first, but a sleazy gold digger second. When her Blueblooded Sugar daddy is forced by his mother to dump her, she is left living with some guy on craigslist, and working a bare minimum as a school teacher. to make herself feel better she wants to get fake boobs, but doesn't have the money for them like when she had a sugar daddy. so she uses all her manipulative powers to raise the money for them.<br/><br/>Also, I can relate to one of the characters. Garrett, who always wore that Gymnastics hoodie to class all the time. That was me in 6th, 7th grade. I just really felt like walking up to that poor kid and telling him to dress different. if he really wanted Chase to like him, he might have worn different shirts in the future.<br/><br/>but I think what miss diaz did for him was more awesome than anything. just watch the film and you'll see why.<br/><br/>7/10"
"sabretooth91","Null","1","4","12 July 2011"," Good for some laughs
","I read the reviews for this, and was instantly turned off. However, it was my girlfriend's turn to pick the movie, and she picked Bad Teacher. I wasn't looking forward to the movie after the reviews I read. The theater was quite empty, too. First of all, I agree that there will be no prize for a brilliantly written script. The morals were absolutely horrible, and no one still in grade school should be allowed to watch this movie. It is for adults, and adults who understand that this movie does not depict actual teachers. In fact, a vast majority of teachers are closer to the goody-goody teacher, Miss Squirrel (who annoyed the h&!! out of me by the end of the movie) The real problem with our public school system is with the lack of support at home regarding discipline and backing up the teachers from the parents (but I digress). There may not have been laugh after laugh in this movie, but the funny parts were really funny. I laughed out loud quite a lot. Much more than I thought I would. The gym teacher was my favorite character/actor, by far. Diaz did very well with what she was given. I found myself rooting for this shallow, poor excuse for a human being. I think only Diaz could make me do that. yeah, the moral of the story was horrible and it painted teachers in a bad light. But it was funny, and it isn't meant for people who still need morals to be taught to them. So, while I don't suggest it as your first pick, there's no reason to dread seeing Bad Teacher. I don't know why it is so funny to hear gorgeous blonds and little kids swear, but it is.... and it doesn't hurt to look at Diaz for a couple hours. (thank you, car wash scene!)"
"chandra-201","Null","1","4","12 July 2011"," Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed
","Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Bad Teacher was a great idea, poorly executed, but relentlessly saved by the energetic cast. This movie could have mixed the dark charm of Bad Santa with the subtle workforce ridiculousness humor of Office Space to become something very, very special. But neither style of humor was dwelled upon deep enough. The first half had its laughs, but was far too convoluted and was salvaged mainly because of the hilarity of Cameron Diaz. The movie definitely picks up later, but by then its too late, the potential was wasted. Either way, you will certainly laugh, you will remain entertained, but will also be bothered by what it could have been."
"coolness5520","5","1","4","1 July 2011"," ""Bad Teacher"" wasn't bad enough
","""Bad Teacher"" kinda threw me for a loop. As comedies go, it truly wasn't that bad. I got a few laughs out of it, but really nothing more. And there's the problem, I needed more.<br/><br/>The film seemed to want to exist in a similar realm as that of the far superior film, ""Bridesmaids"", but it simply isn't good enough. There are a few problems holding it back, the first of which is the absence of the big laugh. There isn't a single moment in this film that pushed the audience over the edge. The movie didn't go far enough, primarily in two key areas, the film wasn't crass enough, and it didn't have enough heart.<br/><br/>First problem is with the casting of Cameron Diaz. I'm sure she's a lovely women and it seems as if she's having the time of her life being insulting and rude, but perhaps that's the problem. Underneath all the insults and the drug use, is still America's sweetheart, acting like a middle schooler, who thinks all it takes to act grown up is to drop a few f-bombs.<br/><br/>It's not that Diaz isn't funny, she is, for the most part. It's just that her jokes(whether they were written or she improvised) lacked a punch that a more experienced comedic actress could've provided. Granted the shock value of seeing Cameron Diaz in such a role would have been lost, but perhaps the final product would have been more satisfying.<br/><br/>But also lost is a depth of character usually found in these kind of films. Since ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" audiences have been expecting a dose of heart with their crude humor, and while an attempt is made at redemption for the main character in this film, her intentions are so vain, and her actions so selfish, that in the end the character arc falls flat, and by the end of the film I just didn't feel like rooting for anyone.<br/><br/>So is ""Bad Teacher"" a successful comedy? Did it make me laugh? Yes, but this film just barely reaches average, which makes it a huge disappointment. I wanted to like ""Bad Teacher"", I'm a sucker for Judd Apatow films, and the countless copycats that have emulated that formula ever since ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" came out. But ""Bad Teacher"" didn't go far enough, and that has to be the biggest disappointment of all."
"devcybiko","4","1","4","25 June 2011"," Camron Diaz is still Hot
","ONE LINE REVIEW: Camraon Diaz is still hot.<br/><br/>RATING: Wait for the Instant Download, if you like Camron Diaz. Otherwise, Don't waste your time. <br/><br/>(Ratings: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the Instant Download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>DANGER : SPOILERS (but no surprises)<br/><br/>""Bad Teacher"" features Camron Diaz as Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher of some ill repute who just lost her sugar daddy fianc√© and is trolling for her next victim. She finds him in Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake) who is a substitute teacher with well-to-do family connections. But getting in her way is goody-two-shoes teacher Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch) who has attracted his attentions. Elizabeth decides that to win the man over she needs breast augmentation surgery (costing $10,000) and will do whatever it takes to get the money. Meanwhile PE teacher Russell Getis (Jason Segel) has the hots for Elizabeth. And our little love triangles are complete.<br/><br/>The basic premise of this movie is that Elizabeth Halsey is cool, and everyone else is a dork. Elizabeth smokes pot, and drinks, and lures men to their fate with her sex appeal.<br/><br/>No, that's not true. That's the secondary premise of this movie. The basic premise of this movie is that Camron Diaz is still hot. And to prove it she was shot from every possible angle that you can shoot an actor. Long shots, two shots, sexual dry humping shots, and extreme close ups. She looked great in every scene. There is also a very seductive car wash scene.<br/><br/>I think it takes a lot of balls to title a move with the word ""Bad"" in it. The reviews almost write themselves ""Bad Teacher is bad news. Badly Directed, Badly acted... blah blah blah"" The fact is that ""Bad Teacher"" is okay entertainment. This film is pretty juvenile in places and includes plenty of gross-out and fart humor. The best lines are already in the trailers.<br/><br/>Elizabeth does a lot of bad things including seducing the head of the Illinois state testing organization to steal the answers to their standardized test. This enables her to ""teach to the test"" and win a cash award that allows her to get her boob-job. But don't worry, she never does.<br/><br/>If this plot device of teaching the students to cheat sounds familiar, you are probably a South Park fan. See season 12, episode 5, ""Eek, A Penis!""<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that Elizabeth has no redeeming characteristics. She is so bad that we wonder why we care about her. But the film pulls it off because Camron Diaz is still hot. Also, every other character in the film is a dork, making her look exceedingly cool. Amy Squirrel (a sort of female Frank Burns) attempts to get Elizabeth fired and in so doing gets arrested herself. But she fails miserably in no small measure because Camron Diaz is still hot.<br/><br/>Justin Timberlake does a good job of playing off-type as the dorky innocent substitute teacher. I liked Timberlake in ""The Social Network"" and here. He's not afraid of making fun of himself both in this film and in his occasional SNL appearances.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a Hollywood feature and so the dorky PE teacher gets the hot bad girl in the end (no pun intended). And the transition of Elizabeth from superficial gold-digger to warm, caring gold-digger happens overnight and with relatively little on-screen impetus. But it's OK because Camron Diaz is still hot."

","Bad Teacher is directed by Jake Kasdan and written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky. It stars Cameron Diaz, Justin Timberlake, Lucy Punch and Jason Segel. <br/><br/>It's a solid premise to work from, it features an audacious and sexy turn from Diaz, while Punch steals the movie from her more illustrious co-stars. Yet Bad Teacher never achieves all that it can as a comedy. It starts off promisingly as Diaz's money grabbing teacher (Elizabeth Halsey) proves to be one big bluffing babe. She drinks, smokes pot, acerbically talks down to her students and does as little work as possible. This is funny stuff, for about 15 minutes, then the joke quickly wears thin. It's then that it dawns on you that the trailer, with it's brief running time and condensing of the premise, is the best thing about Bad Teacher.<br/><br/>But wait! There's a hook, a new addition to the teaching ranks turns her head, the not harsh on the eye Scott Delacorte (Timberlake) is maybe her way to wealth and lazy happiness. Only he likes breasts and poor Elizabeth isn't well flushed in that department, perhaps she can get hers enlarged? If only she could afford the procedure! Wait! (again) There's a financial bonus given to the teacher with the highest results in the state, can Elizabeth reform and spur her class on to greatness whilst snagging the twee Delacorte? Can she win the vicious personal battle with scholastic rival, and major achiever, Amy Squirrel? (Punch) Do we care? No not really, unless you find dry humping the pinnacle of comedy?<br/><br/>There's also the nagging doubt surrounding the confused messages once it's all mercifully over. I mean the bitch wins here. The shallow self centred charisma free Halsey actually triumphs when really she doesn't deserve to. Has she got the viewers to root for her? Well you would hope not since she's cruel and a bit of a moany hole, with Diaz not done any favours by a weak script full of empty spaces where character development should be. It seems that Kasdan thought that dressing up a superficial character in pretty Cameron Diaz clobber was going to be enough to see his film across the winning line. It wasn't and quite frankly Bad Teacher should go to the back of the class and stay there. 4/10 for the efforts of Punch and the underused Segel."

","This is a summer movie that I heard positive things about from people, so I was expecting a pretty darn good comedy. But that just wasn't really the case, most of the laugh just comes from how much of a bitch a person can be and it wasn't all that funny. I don't know if I said this in the past review that featured Cameron Diaz but she is getting old and she ain't none of those top class actresses over 40. So I guess she was desperate or something but I personally found it more nauseating than sexy and the audiences reactions in the theater was basically the same. Although I think she is having a midlife crisis cause she seemed to try to be sexy a bit too much while the characters in the movie constantly fall for her. Maybe that was why she took this role to try and prove to the world that she is still attractive. Actually I noticed this with a lot of aging female celebs, they always seem a bit too hard with the sex appeal when they reach mid 30's. Which might be sort of understandable because of how the music industry work and when you lose that popularity your just about finished. I don't know but she just seemed a bit too desperate. If it was Anna Faris who was in the trailer for ""What's Your Number?"" before it started it might have seemed a bit different. Lucy Punch was pretty good as the psycho teacher but than again she sort of reminded me of teachers with similar character traits in the past so it was a bit nostalgic. Jason Segel is alright as the P.E. Teacher and Justin Timberlake managed to fit the role but there is plenty of actors that could have pulled off that role. This movie also didn't want to force a moral, but the moral of this movie is terrible.<br/><br/>5.9/10"

","I love(d) Cameron Diaz in many of her previous comedies, but this movie is beneath her, because this story is just full on cheap and tacky and most of all NOT funny. Kind of embarrassing even to watch Cameron Diaz slide down to this cheap level of movie making, with an equally unimpressive silly supporting role of Justin Timberlake.<br/><br/>"" Grab some tits and we will score some laughs"", that's basically the attitude which this movie must survive on and what the marketing department probably was thinking of while they made it. This movie is an embarrassment to the teenage comedy genre.<br/><br/>Poor Cameron, she deserved a better end of her great acting career, because ever since this movie was released, her career went downhill..."

","I'm glad I'm not a critic and didn't read any reviews before I watched this movie because I just enjoyed it for what it is - A fun and silly comedy. I loved this movie and although I know it's not an Academy Award nominee, nor would it ever be, I thought it was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it for what it was.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is smoking hot and pulls off a very funny performance. Watch the unrated version for added dirtiness."

","Jake Kasdan's ""Bad Teacher"" is an unabashedly silly movie. Given Cameron Diaz's characters antics, Jack Black or Melissa McCarthy could've just as easily played the role. There's also the occasional bodily function humor.<br/><br/>Obviously the movie's nothing to take seriously. Just a big excuse to be ridiculous. Probably the sort of movie that they had fun making. It was a surprise to see that one of the screenwriters shares a name with me (he also wrote for the US version of ""The Office"").<br/><br/>Basically, it's the sort of movie that you watch if you want nothing except to get entertained. Watch for Paul Feig (the director of 2016's ""Ghostbusters"") in an appearance as a dad at the car wash."

","well.. I'll try to make this as short and forward as possible..<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed. You know why? I already knew that this movie was gonna be bad but I watched it anyway. I was just looking for a way to pass the time. This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. After watching it, I didn't even know what I was feeling.<br/><br/>First of all, it had a crappy plot. It was built around a ""teacher"" trying to find a way to raise money to buy herself some new tits. Don't even get me started on what the problem is with that. It's pretty self- explanatory.<br/><br/>Second, Justin Timberlake's acting. I've never really seem him as an actor before so I didn't know what to expect. Needless to say, he should stick to singing. But I can't blame him 100% for it because his character was just equally horrible. <br/><br/>Third,...well you know what? I'm just gonna stop right here and let you figure out the rest.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I gave it a 3 because of Jason Segel (would've given it a 2 without him)"
"Hellmant","6","0","2","4 August 2011"," 'BAD TEACHER' is an OK movie.
","'BAD TEACHER': Three Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Cameron Diaz stars in this raunchy dark satire, continuing the popular trend of female powered vulgar R rated comedies. She plays an uninspired and useless Chicago junior high teacher who treats her students like annoying stepping stones to her dream life. The movie is obviously a jab at tenure but is mostly just a light hearted dark comedy rather than any kind of political commentary. Jake Kasdan directed the film and Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg wrote it. It's not the best example of it's genre but it could have been a lot worse, definitely not a bad way to spend your time.<br/><br/>Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey, a teacher with no passion for teaching who drinks a lot, gets stoned a lot and swears a lot (in front of her students). She's always planned on marrying rich and leaving the working life behind and as the movie opens she's all set to do that. Then her fianc√©'s mother catches on to her scheming ways and talks her son in to calling off the wedding. Halsey despairingly returns to work and sets her eyes on a new rich sub (Justin Timberlake) but realizes in order to impress him she's going to need a boob job. So she plots one despicable scam after another ripping her school off of money in order to pay for the expensive operation. She faces competition from a fellow teacher (brilliantly portrayed by Lucy Punch) and also has to deal with the unwanted affection of the gym teacher (Jason Segel).<br/><br/>The movie is most importantly funny, it might not have any huge laughs but the jokes for the most part work. Thanks in large part to a nearly flawless cast. Punch is the scene stealer but Diaz holds her own, Segel is convincingly cool and witty and Timberlake is adequate (at least he's been sticking to roles he can pull off lately). There's also nice supporting turns from John Michael Higgins and Phyllis Smith (from TV's 'THE OFFICE'). Kasdan's directing is fitting to the material and I can see why the screenplay attracted the cast it did. It's got heart here and there but the lead character is definitely too unlikeable to ever really care about and what she gets away with in the film is kind of sickening. It is a dark comedy but it would have been nice to have someone to root for (besides Segel, who's part is way too small).<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A"
"scarletheels","6","0","2","6 August 2011"," Not the Funniest Comedy of 2011 but It Works
","Gold-digger Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is forced back into the teaching position she despises after being dumped by her rich boyfriend. Instead of instructing the students and nurturing their young minds, she shows them movies like Lean On Me and Dangerous Minds while sneaking in sips of booze and cat napping at her desk. She hones in on Scott Delacorte (Justin Timberlake), a handsome substitute teacher who belongs to a family of considerable wealth but, to her dismay, he falls for the star teacher, Amy Squirrel (Lucy Punch). Intent on snagging herself another sugar daddy, she starts saving money for breast implants but her efforts to afford the $10,000 price tag aren't enough.<br/><br/>After she learns the teacher whose class receives the highest state test scores is awarded a $5,700 bonus check, she starts making her students apply themselves but her aggressive teaching style yields nothing but bellyaching and malcontent. Determined to win the money, she poses as an investigative journalist following up on claims that the state exams discriminate against blacks and minorities, allowing her an the opportunity to steal the test questions from Carl Halabi (Thomas Lennon). The hostile rivalry between Elizabeth and Amy turns into full- scale war after Elizabeth's students scores are, not only the highest in the entire county but, enough to unseat Amy's three year victory.<br/><br/>There are plenty of rotten pranks and downright nasty schemes that go on throughout the film, along with drinking and drugs, lots of swearing, an awkward dry-humping scene, and a pair of surgically enhanced breasts that will have men's eyes popping right out of their sockets. The humor is hit-and-miss but when it succeeds, it's shamefully funny. It's no comedic gem but it does satisfy a guilty pleasure to see Diaz play a greedy, thoughtless, conniving bitch. In Hollywood years, she's 'old' but, damn, she is looking better than ever and I give her props for flaunting what she's got in Bad Teacher.<br/><br/>I loved Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel. Who is this woman who nailed the role of a well-intentioned but batshit crazy teacher so perfectly? She captured all of Amy's neurotic tendencies, exasperating competitiveness, nervous tics, and the smarmy smile that I kept hoping Elizabeth would knock right off of her face. Thumbs up to Jason Segel as Russell, the school gym teacher pining for Elizabeth, John Michael Higgins as the overwhelmed Principal Snur, and Phyllis Smith as reserved, mousy Lynn. The only person I didn't get was Justin Timberlake's character - he was just plain weird and dull.<br/><br/>This was a mediocre comedy saved by its cast. There is a lot that doesn't make sense and you basically have to toss your morals to the wayside. Don't get too analytical. This movie is not an attack on the fine men and women who sacrifice salary for their passion to teach. It's a short-sighted, bawdy summertime flick that wants to tickle your funny bone, even if it doesn't always succeed."
"triganomix","5","0","2","2 August 2011"," Surprisingly good performance by Diaz saves poor script
","This was the opposite to what I expected. I was pleasantly surprised by Diaz's character, 'Elizabeth Halsey' being a money scrounging, pot smoking gold digger who has no regard for anyone but herself and will back-stab anyone to get it using whatever resources available........mainly her body. She was really taken out of her comfort zone with this one (similar to Jennifer Aniston in Horrible Bosses). This is probably the strongest performance I have seen from her to date.<br/><br/>Probably just as well as the majority of the script content was pretty shocking. It really did drag for large parts. Throw Justin Timberlake into the mix and you'd think That would spice things up. However although I love how he plays himself up, large chunks of his input were pretty boring and he does not feature as prodominately as you would expect. Don't get me wrong I actually rate him as an actor but they could have made a lot more from his character.<br/><br/>Jason Segel is very good as Russell the, 'Gym Teacher' who has a subtle but solid input throughout the film. He provides some much needed laughs when things start to dull down.<br/><br/>The fringe characters (rival teacher, friendly teacher and the ridiculous school principle) are all worthy cast members but again suffer from lack of content at times.<br/><br/>Look out for the small but brilliant performance from Thomas Lennon who it seems has a natural knack to deliver comedic lines flawlessly. <br/><br/>In summary, it is worth watching for the laugh out loud moments although they are few and far between. Generally strong performances with the script available but I would have expected better content from,Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg."
"ShelbyTMItchell","Null","0","2","19 July 2011"," Cameron Diaz delivers in a OK movie!
","Cameron Diaz as the first reviewer puts it, is great and really saves this movie from being all that bad. It wasn't that good. It was OK. But with her presence, Hollywood doesn't give her enough credit. As she's cast against type. And does well with the material she is given.<br/><br/>She plays a foul-mouth, money grabbing, and worrying about aging teacher who is really awful to her students and even the staff. She gets dumped by her rich fianc√© for using money without his permission. And thinking that she doesn't have to work again after the school she works at gives her a going-away party in the first half.<br/><br/>She is forced to work at the same school to pay the bills and fight off romantic advances by Jason Seagal who is in the film, far too short and not given enough material in the process. To showcase his talents.<br/><br/>She finds another gold digger in Justin Timberlake. A substitute teacher as he's going with Diaz's comic-rival played by Lucy Punch. Who also is great in the film. Timberlake is only there is eye candy. Even though he tries to make the most of what he is given.<br/><br/>The film has it's funny moments. But at times, it can be a little mean-spirited as Diaz's character is that way. But she does have a soul inside of her. But she rarely uses that as well. As it wouldn't be called ""Bad Teacher"" for nothing.<br/><br/>But only Segal and Timberlake with what they are given, try to make the most of it and comes off likable. But Diaz is cast against type of her sweet, innocent women that she plays in. Like ""Knight & Day"" last year. Delivers in an OK movie. Lots of language and sexual innuendos. But she does deliver."
"diehard-305","Null","0","2","12 July 2011"," Smaller plot lines were never resolved,
","his film's biggest falters come in the form of the script. Despite the promise in the premise and the cast involved, the script was convoluted, and didn't have much structure until the second half. As a matter of fact, the film switches up the pace very unexpectedly when the next act approaches. Pretty much almost all the crude and vulgar humor failed to draw laughs, with one notable exception involving one of the odder ""sex"" scenes in recent memory. The movie was a great idea not exactly explored upon, and was full of smaller ideas that were not utilized. Many good smaller characters did not get enough time in the script; most notably the students, the gym teacher (Jason Segal) and the main character's roommate (Erik Stonestreet).<br/><br/>Despite the writing being a fickle mess, the cast was superb, from the small roles to the big ones. Cameron Diaz I can honestly say is one of the most underrated talents in Hollywood, because she rarely ever delivers a mediocre or weak performance. She has this aura, this energy that can save the worst of films (See: What Happens in Vegas) and it is no different here. Despite her smoking/drinking/vulgar/manipulative/cynical/cruel/superficial ways, we still secretly root for her to succeed in reaching her goal. Very few actresses can pull off this type of charm.<br/><br/>Lucy Punch, despite having a bit of questionable material, delivers as Diaz's rival. Jason Segal could have helped the movie a lot more if he was in it more often, as he delivered the laughs every time he was on- screen with his wit, sarcasm, and I-don't-care attitude. Television staples Phyllis Smith and Erik Stonestreet were hilarious in the far- too-few moments they were on-screen. The movie does indeed have its laughs, but the potential was so much greater considering all the talented actors involved.<br/><br/>Jake Kasdan as a director doesn't have much of a resume, but he does have the comedic chops and timing, and he proved this with the underrated Walk Hard. With Bad Teacher, he did not have as much good material to work with but could have still helped the movie if he had tightened the first third of the movie better. There was a lot more unnecessary fluff in the first half of the movie compared to the second half. Smaller plot lines were never resolved, certain jokes literally fell off without a punchline, and certain situations were brought up but never explored. Many concepts were also never explored: especially that of how shallow and shady we all become towards each other in the workforce."
"aharmas","6","0","2","10 July 2011"," Cameron vs Lucy
","I can only imagine what this would have been like if the writers had been inspired enough to give these gifted ladies the material to have the match of the century. Diaz has already proved herself as a gifted comedian. She employs her witty delivery and couples it with some very funny physical turns. She is not afraid to take chances and handle some raunchy material; somehow taking a detached and naive approach. She was really wonderful in ""There's something about Mary"" and ""The Mask"", and I had great hopes for ""Bad Teacher"".<br/><br/>The worst about the movie is the typical easy way out of the filmmakers, relying on some material that borders on the vulgar and tired. We understand Cameron's character is well, flawed. There is really not much of a need to use the language she uses, and the situations she becomes involved in. There is even more disappointment when one sees how much Lucy Punch is trying throughout the film, and she's genuinely funny, delivering bad line after bad line, with much gusto, sometimes even saving some of the material. There are moments when one can't believe how great she is, and whether her scenes belong in other movie.<br/><br/>Of course, all of this takes place in a Middle School, what could have been an endless supply of types, situations, stereotypes, etc., etc. There are a couple of funny moments, and those are given away in the preview, leaving us with pretty much nothing to experience in the film. There is also Timberlake, who well, has much potential, but can't do much with his role.<br/><br/>I would probably say this should have gone straight to video..."
