","I often find that in order to be captivating, a film these days needs to be stressfully suspenseful or have a complicated story line. This film had neither, and yet I found myself hoping it wouldn't end while at the same time, anxiously awaiting its conclusion. I have to admit, I was distrustful of Burton as many of his more recent films have had less-than-satisfying conclusions. Nonetheless, I went to see Big Fish (3 days before its release in Canada) with no expectations and was astounded. This movie is an absolute treat for our hearts, ears and especially our eyes with each cartoon/fantasy-like scene painted with Tim Burton's reliable brilliance and magical touch. Ewan McGregor is pure sunshine and Albert Finney gives one of the greatest performances of the year- he *is* Big Fish. But I suppose that when you strip away the beauty, the doll-house sets and all the abracadabra of cinematography and modern day technology, all you have is a very simple story, and therein lies the heart of this film; that one can create their own legacy, ""the story of my life."" Not through either extreme of extraordinary adventure or unbelievable lies, but through the art of storytelling- and THAT is what this film is about. It is through our *stories* that we are immortal.<br/><br/>Go see this movie, bring the kids, bring your date, bring your parents! It is for everyone...everyone who appreciates a visually and emotionally beautiful irregular story about a regular person's life.<br/><br/>***** 5 stars!!"

","My father was a brilliant sculptor and a great visionary. When I was a kid, I never could explain what he was doing. I got it a month before his death when i was 26. This film filled my eyes with tears, because it reminded me him. he had a lot of ideas and brilliant and original ideas for improving the world, but for all his life he could not sell it to anyone, because those ideas filled his whole day. Literally. His whole apartment was filled with papers. Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. I would add a note that when we dream, we are escaping from the world of facts and truths. When my father said that if you think of anything in life, you have to write it down because what comes to your mind it never comes again it changed my life. Now I'm writing a book - a novel from environment of Mesopotamia and that just because my father was someone who believed in imagination and creative values​​."
"Low Man","Null","395","459","8 August 2004"," Lying as an Art Form
","What do you say about this movie?<br/><br/>I am at a total loss to describe it.  The concept itself, a son tries to come to terms with his dying father that he knows nothing about but an enormous catalog of unbelievable stories, doesn't sound very promising.  It sounds like a tired old formula, and I expected such when the rental started playing<br/><br/>It's not.<br/><br/>Werewolves, giants, witches, siamese twins, bank robbers, hidden cities, sirens, etc. are all present in the fantasy, but they seem unremarkably to be part of the life of an otherwise ordinary traveling salesman.  Whether they really are or not is never made completely clear, but that's the rub.<br/><br/>I once read a review by Harlan Ellison in which the main point was how a well told lie illuminates the truth in far better clarity than a simple recitation of the facts ever can.  At one point in the film, the questing son remarks to his bed-ridden father that he's heard all of his stories thousands of times, and he has know idea who his father really is.  The father's reply is, `I've never been anybody but me from the day I was born. If you don't know who I am, that's your failing, not mine.'  Later investigations make the point clearer.  I'll bet Ellison loved this movie. It is an extraordinary lie.<br/><br/>Did I like the film?  You bet.  It's Tim Burton's best work without a doubt. Is it for everybody?  Probably not.  Many will find it confusing and pointless, but good fantasy is like that.  All I can say is, relax and let it happen.  You won't regret it."
"ticdoulouroux","10","254","297","16 February 2004"," Tim Burton's Surprise Heartwarmer
","I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation.  Will it be ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Batman II?""  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.<br/><br/> ""Big Fish"" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.<br/><br/> Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.<br/><br/> Burton deals with mythic themes in ""Big Fish.""  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.<br/><br/> The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long ""suffering"" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.<br/><br/> I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same."
"blademalfoy","Null","169","203","27 December 2003"," Cohesive and a feast for the eyes
","I've had high hopes for this movie since I first heard about it some time ago.  After all, most of the Tim Burton movies I've seen (barring Planet of the Apes) have been really wonderful.  To say the least, Big Fish did not disappoint me.  The story - by no means complex or suspenseful - was simple enough to allow the viewer to really take in the fantasy and mythology in Edward Bloom's tales.  One didn't need a surprise ending or secret identities to make this film enjoyable.  Rather, it was the simplicity and universal nature of the story that made it interesting. While some reviews have mentioned that the film can seem choppy at times, I didn't see this at all.  The transition seemed smooth and logical, and while sometimes I found myself wishing for more scenes of younger Edward Bloom, I never felt bored by any of the movie.  Nothing seemed to 'drag'. I was also quite impressed with the quality of acting in nearly the entire cast.  Billy Crudup didn't really hit his stride until the end, but he was tolerable through the first three-quarters of the movie.  Albert Finney did a great job of portraying a lion on his last legs, bigger than his body but unable to show it.  Jessica Lange was amazing and added the emotional oomph that Billy Crudup often failed to provide.  And while Ewan McGregor's role was not particularly difficult, at no point did he overplay the character, and his accent (to my ear anyway) never slipped. Though this wasn't as dark as Sleepy Hollow or as bizarre as Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice, Big Fish definitely had the Tim Burton touch in its scenery.  The colors - whether dull for Elder Bloom's time or bright for Younger Bloom - matched the mood perfectly, and everywhere you looked (especially in Bloom the Younger's timeframe) there was something else to marvel at.  Tim Burton fans will not be disappointed."

","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is informed by his mother Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is terminal, and he travels with his French pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) to his parents' home. Will and Ed have broken relationship three years before, because of the imaginative and fantasized stories told by Ed Bloom about his accomplishments in his youth. Will tries to find the true story of the mysterious life of his father, coming to a surprising discovery in the end. <br/><br/>I am a great fan of Tim Burton, and I really believe that ""Big Fish"", together with ""Ed Wood"", are his best works. Beginning with a wonderful and very optimistic fairytale in a magic screenplay, about a very supportive storyteller and dreamer, who sees the world with beautiful eyes. The selection of the cast is another point to be highlighted: the resemblance between the outstanding actress Alison Lohman, from ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"", and the still very gorgeous and also excellent actress Jessica Lange, is amazing. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney are also a great choice for the role of Ed Bloom. Although having a convincing performance, Billy Crudup is in a lower level of performance, when comparing with the rest of the cast, which has names such as Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito. ""Big Fish"" is the type of movie good to be seen many times. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Peixe Grande e Suas Histórias Maravilhosas"" (""Big Fish Abd His Wonderful Stories"")"
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","109","141","3 February 2004"," Movie Magic
","Every other year you get a movie that oozes magic and charm. Think ""Chocolat"". Think ""Amelie"". Think ""What dreams may come"". Perhaps even, ""Being John Malkovich"". And this year, it's time to think big... ""Big Fish"", to be precise. All four of these movies have some things in common. Merely describing the premise is not nearly enough to do justice to the mood of the film. And the mood, the emotional reaction of the audience, is in many ways much more important than the actual content. Still, there's no way around it in a proper review: We meet a disillusioned young man and his father, a charming old guy who knows exactly how to tell stories to fascinate first-time listeners and children. Unfortunately, there's barely any of those left, as he retold his magical stories once too often. When his health and life are beginning to fade away, his son wants to finally learn the truth about his father. Meanwhile, we hear his life story, as he tells it... Tim Burton is probably best-known for visual eye candy movies. Few directors can compete with the imagination he's shown in movies like Batman, Nightmare before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow. Outside the realm of darker, more gothic visuals, Tim Burton has so far been somewhat less prolific. Planet of the Apes was an expensive embarrassment, and Ed Wood is a decidedly acquired taste. Big Fish, then, is a new direction for him. Yes, it is eye candy, or perhaps even eye H""agen Dazs. But this time, the movie has much more of a soul than his monkeyplanet. This soul is achieved by two means: a great story (or collection of stories) and great acting. If you don't believe that the story is great, watch the audience. At key moments, everyone was chuckling or laughing, at others, I heard dozens of sniffs and tissues being unpacked around me. Yes, this is heartwarming stuff that a colder, more cynical soul would call cheese. Finally, Burton has found a story worthy of his talents again. And, better yet, he did not forget to encourage his cast to act. For a case study of such failure, see Christina Ricci's completely flat performance in Sleepy Hollow. In Big Fish, the cast is so carefully selected that failure is simply not an option. Ewan McGregor (playing the father in his youth) may not have much more to do than smile, be charming and sustain a Southern US accent, but he does it brilliantly. Much more important are the performances of Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, playing the aged father and mother, respectively. And they both deliver character performances worthy of prizes.<br/><br/>After cheerleading so enthusiastically for this movie, perhaps it is time to take a step back and look at it from a more critical perspective. Yes, it managed to enchant the audience, but it did so the Hollywood way. Special effects and big budget feature heavily. This is in stark contrast to the seemingly much less organized and much more intuitional charm of Amelie. This movie is also much more comfy about its pace - it takes its time just like a good storyteller would, but perhaps leaving behind the five-second-attention-span MTV generation kids in the process. On the other hand, I am tempted to say that its biggest vice is that there just isn't enough of it. Given the episodal structure of this movie, I can almost imagine what it would have felt like as TV series, or multi-part TV movie. I am not sure whether to wish for this to happen or shudder at the thought of ""Big Fish: The Animated Series"" or some such atrocity. Every story told in this movie is perfect, and a series of such perfect stories would be wonderful. Yet can perfection be sustained for a large number of stories? Either way, I wonder what is going to become of Big Fish - a franchise or a single movie. It definitely is more deserving of praise, awards and viewers than any other movie released during the past six months, including LOTR-RotK."
"nycritic","10","50","63","10 May 2005"," Lyrical.
","Tim Burton continues to demonstrate his maturation as a director despite having a soft spot for the fantastic and the weird.<br/><br/>It's probably not a surprise that this film would receive generally mixed-to-good reviews but was virtually ignored by the Academy. It's a little too visually eccentric for its own good and that somehow translates as a film that uses beautiful images as its means to tell a story, and that in 2003 was not quite the type of movies that were being told with the exception of LORD OF THE RINGS which in itself is a triumph of effects serving a story, albeit deeply rooted in fantasy, but not too dissimilar to this one.<br/><br/>Tall tales are a part of Americana. Here they come under the guise of hilarious situations and extremely poignant, compassionate moments. Essentially, this is a humanist fable dressed in deep, poetic magic realism, because it's the story of a man who is dying and who has one last thing to do.<br/><br/>This man is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), and he's over the years become estranged from his son William (Billy Crudup) because William has gotten increasingly jaded from these tall stories Ed tells him over and over again. We can call it the syndrome of someone who has lost touch with his inner self and has accommodated himself to the norms of Society and what It considers ""normal"" and ""acceptable.""<br/><br/>In his last days he recollects his memories from his much younger days (played by Ewan McGregor) when he hadn't found his calling until he came across a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) who foretold him his future. From then on he had what can be called a ""hell of a life,"" going from seemingly implausible adventure to another. These exaggerated tales infuriates William until a crucial event forces him to acknowledge the essence of the matter -- Ed Bloom's reality -- and in one overwhelming tour de force of direction, William (clumsily at first, but then more sure of himself) creates his own storytelling, which I won't talk about. Suffice it is to say that its transition into reality is one of the most beautiful and moving sequences I've seen.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the best films Tim Burton has made in his curriculum of offbeat films. Solid performances are in leaps and bounds from the main actors to minor players -- the sad expression of a circus clown who has to shoot Ed because the wolf he is about to kill is actually Amos Calloway is a haunting shot, for example. Jessica Lange's quiet scene in a bathtub filled with water, hugging Ed and weeping. Alison Lohman caught in a frozen moment of time, which enhances her beauty. The moment when William re-enacts his own story and ""carries"" Ed out of the hospital which segues into the otherworldly, emotional climax. A beautiful ensemble piece, with otherworldly images, this is only second to LORD OF THE RINGS, a distant cousin, in absolute beauty and simplicity of its message."

Married, having a son, a house, etc, etc, etc and so on and so on and so on and so forth and so forth and so forth, pans out to whereby his emeritus years become those of expounding dissertation about his exciting dare devil nefarious life as an impervious adolescent.. Spinning Yarns? We know better!!...Try telling his son that...Too incredible!! Too spectacular!! Too heroic!!...Ed Bloom's blindly motivational love and devotion towards the woman he cherishes, makes Romeo and Juliet's relationship seem platonic... Crazy dreams, the supernatural, and negligence of compassion via the compelling illustration of the cold cruel world, make Big Fish a reality as far as being a five star film!!<br/><br/>In the end, Big Fish shows how the aspect of positive human nature prevails, and how a person's life is intricate and meaningful!! The impact your father has on you is indelible, and recognition of unconditional love for your family, and the people around you, manifest themselves in many distinguishable ways, all of them being indispensable!! Ed Bloom is the picture-book example of how exaggerations and erroneous behavior in your life are an integral part of your existence!! You have realized you are fortunate to be human because you are not perfect, the adjective perfect is for calculators, Hallmark Cards, and martinis after work...Ed Bloom had an anything but John Doe in an orange crate funeral.. A numerous cross section of socially diverse individuals had a grass roots recognition of who Ed Bloom was, in that sense, Ed Bloom died a very rich man!! Big Fish was a melting pot of proclivities and acute misconceptualizations that established a colorful obituary as being the ultimate trophy we can be the recipients of for our agenda here on earth!! More significantly, the aggregate affection, as well as the life experiences all of the characters in the movie have had, and would not trade for a million dollars, is something that this film brilliantly portrays, by way of a hail Mary pass that winds up being the game winning touchdown!!.. It was this convoluted philosophical disposition that ""Big Fish"" so perfectly executed that puts this film in the category as one of the best films ever produced. Expediting faulted emotions is a sink or swim endeavor, and, in this case ""Big Fish"" swam, (No pun intended) Metaphorically, all of these accolades are a way of saying that the ending to this film was very powerful and cohesive...surprisingly and effectively so!! I give Big Fish a five star rating, and a perfect 10!! This website ranks it as one of the top 250 films ever made!! I totally concur!!"
"MovieAddict2016","Null","110","163","18 February 2004"," Tim Burton's career equivalent of ""Forrest Gump"" is an ultimately rewarding adult fable with some beautiful cinematography and memorable ideas...
","It was either ""Cheaper by the Dozen,"" ""The Haunted Mansion"" or this. I didn't exactly feel like watching my favorite comedian run around with a horde of little kids cracking bad poopy jokes behind them, and I didn't want to see Eddie Murphy do this either (it was bad enough in last year's ""Daddy Day Care""), so I chose to see the more adult-oriented of these three films, and I'm glad I did, because Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a marvelous film--full of wit and imagination and eerie vibes that sometimes don't fit into Burton's films the way he wants them to--but actually have a purpose here.<br/><br/>""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" is simply one of the best films of all time, and you can quote me on that. That was Burton's breakthrough--then came ""Batman,"" which was very good but slightly lacking in substance, and then came ""Edward Scissorhands""--one of my sister's favorite films, a beautiful love story and an eerie fable...but just missing a very small ingredient that kept it from becoming a great movie (perhaps the same with his film ""Ed Wood""--a very good film, but not exactly one of my all-time favorites).<br/><br/>I have my doubts as to whether anyone other than Tim Burton could have pulled off ""Big Fish."" Here's a movie I expected I would dislike and come away feeling a little bit empty--but that's only partially true. The movie doesn't quite exceed on the level it tries to, but as a film, it's one of the best motion pictures of the year.<br/><br/>It stars Albert Finney as Edward Bloom, an old man who loves to exaggerate tales of his past and pass these on to his friends and family. One night his son, William (Billy Crudup), tires of hearing the story about how he caught the town's largest fish in a lake using a gold ring--so he ignores his father for three whole years, until his mother (Jessica Lange) informs Will that his father is dying of cancer, and that he wishes to speak with his son one last time.<br/><br/>Drawn back to his old Alabama hometown with his new wife, Will finally learns the truth about these so-called ""exaggerated"" stories--and we, as the audience, get to see them in flashback mode. It begins with a young Edward (Ewan McGregor), a ""big fish"" who was just too small for his own town and had to move away to search for brighter prospects. On his journey he comes across an assortment of odd fellows, including a ""Gentle Giant,"" a failed poet living in a heavenly town named Spectre, and a strange circus ringleader who also happens to be a werewolf.<br/><br/>All of these stories that Edward Senior tells his family relate to their current positions, and to call the film simply beautiful would be what John Candy once said is ""the understatement of the year."" My particular favorite character was the poet living in Spectre, played by Steve Buscemi (a wonderful supporting actor), who I had no idea played any role in this film prior to viewing the opening credits and seeing ""with Steve Buscemi"" appear on screen.<br/><br/>Buscemi's poet has been working on a particular poem for twelve years whilst living in Spectre. ""Can I see it?"" asks Edward. It says, ""Roses are red, violets are blue, I love Spectre."" ""But it's only three lines long!"" says Edward. ""That's the reason you don't show your work to people,"" Buscemi says.<br/><br/>Danny DeVito also appears as the circus ringleader, and the most regretful scene in the film is that in which we see him naked from behind. I shudder at the thought. But, for what it's worth, DeVito's second re-teaming with Burton is magnificent--he's a supporting character, but the film certainly benefits from his performance.<br/><br/>Like all of Burton's films, ""Big Fish"" teeters on the edge of greatness, but it never quite crosses the line. This is a marvelous film, full of warmth, kind-hearted fables and beautiful cinematography, and it's one of the best films of the year. It's certainly a unique film experience unlike any you've ever had before. Unless, of course, you've seen ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Ed Wood."" Then some of it may look a bit familiar.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed it more than ""The Lord of the Rings."" And I could actually relate to this film.<br/><br/>Trivia note: ""Edward Scissorhands"" was a Tim Burton film. The main character of this film is named Edward. Sometimes when people pronounce his name with their thick Alabama accents it comes across as ""Ed Wood."" Mere coincidence or something more? We may never find out.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

If you really sit and ponder on the main message of the movie (A fish only grows as big as the pond he builds for himself), it can really change your life. Another strong theme through the movie is that you never know when the crazy stories about the good old days that your elders tell you are true. Sometimes the people you know are greater men than you realize, greater men than you think can really exist in the world. Then one day you look around at your life and you see what they really did, what they really sacrificed and you realize that the greatest among us are those who are there for our friends and family all the time, no matter what the cost, no matter what the mission.<br/><br/>Absolute 10 out of 10, a must-see for anyone who wants to know anything about great movies or great men."

I mean, the fact that we finally get to see what was in the witch's eye (regardless of the fact that it was all made up) is reward enough. Not to mention that we find out throughout the last bit of the movie that not EVERYTHING Edward Bloom told was a lie.

","Big Fish is nowhere near a perfect movie. Sometimes the dialogue is awkward, the pacing drags at times, and Steve Buscemi is, as always, a weirdo. There are bizarre and fantastical ideas that can take you out of the movie. For all its flaws, I can't give it more than an 8. That being said, this is my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Big Fish strikes a chord with me. It examines the value of a life, our modern-day myths, and, ultimately, the nature of our humanity. I don't cry easily, and I'm not just saying that - I didn't cry at Schindler's List, or Titanic; but Big Fish makes me sob every time. The ultimate catharsis, where a man's identity, value, integrity, and family are all validated, and his life has been a life worth living. <br/><br/>Tim Burton was definitely the man for the job on this film, and if you like his other classics like Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Batman, you'll probably enjoy this one, too. What else can I say, this is my favorite movie."
"Quinoa1984","10","8","9","14 December 2003"," The director- as well as character- as illusionist: a Tim Burton treat
","Director Tim Burton is notorious for his inventive, unique brand(s) of images he puts into his films, and a style that seems to regenerate in each film he does (though not always successfully- Planet of the Apes proved that).  Now there's Big Fish, a film loaded with visual spectacle, and it shows Burton working an adaptation to his own advantage for the first time in years.  Here he tells a story about storytelling, using both make-up, sets, and CGI at his disposal, and it's about one man's own imagination and how he carried it on to others, whether they were delighted by the tall tales or not.<br/><br/>This man is Edward Bloom, played by both Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, and they both deliver wonderful work here as the dying Bloom still telling stories of adventures and the young Bloom playing them out, respectively. As do Billy Crudup as Edward's son William, who's grown weary of his father telling the story of his birth (involving a catch of a big fish), among many others, and all he wants now at his deathbed is the truth.  Jessica Lange is also dependable as Edward's wife Sandy, the love of each other's lives.<br/><br/>What's so alluring about the world Burton creates (based on the novel by Daniel Pierce, which I imagine must be loaded with vivid description) is that he simply builds on the world Edward created for his and his family's amusement.  Stories like the visit to the town of Spectre, and that town's most known poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in one of the film's highlighted supporting roles); the years spent working for nothing in the circus for Amos (Danny DeVito, another note of interest) just to know more about Sandy, whom he sees frozen in time; his stint in the war, etc.  All of the people and environments that are reveled are done so with many visual effects, but they're the kind that help build on Burton's vision instead of depleting it.  Even if a scene may have dialog or acting that could be taken as over the top, the storytelling is on par with some of Burton's best work (i.e. Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and even the somewhat recent Sleepy Hollow).  <br/><br/>The best thing that can be said about Big Fish, even to those who might not like it, is that the journeys and stories taken in the film, by real and 'elaborated' real characters, generate a film as a delight for all ages. That it also has comedy along with drama (grounded in a sense of humanity for both) is also a feat accomplished well by the actors.  To me, this is one of the better films of the year.  Grade- A"

","Subtle, delicate, touching and fascinating pledge for the life as fruit of dream. About the ambiguous taste of imagination and about existence like a spectacular trip. About desire and reality like warm bread.<br/><br/>The director of ""Big Fish"" is Tom Burton. It is only decent definition of a film -mixture between childhood and small miracles, about a special image of ordinaries gestures and about hope in eccentric aspects. The texture is same of grandmother's tales in Christamas Eve or Sunday morning. A brave hero, strange village, temptation and huge love, success and discoveries, miracles and public,secret sense of life and courage. So, in many cases, the reality is only boring passage and the dream, the childish game, the sound of angel's voice or the strange facts are heart of magnificent act of contemplation.<br/><br/>It is a moral story but, in same measure is source of a way to look the world. The life is not a punish or bag of routine. The faith is not only part of a relation with God but with yourself. The others are, in great measure, parts of funny miracle and ineffable expectation.<br/><br/>The Ewan Mc Gregor acting is brilliant. Nuances, accents, inflexion of words, smile or gestures are bricks of a magnificent character, touching, warm, credible. In some moments, the film is spectacular dialog between McGregor and Albert Finney interpretation.<br/><br/>In fact, ""Big Fish"" is a tale.

","Big Fish...<br/><br/>What made me watch this film in the first place was solely based on the fact that Pearl Jam got nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song. That's what got me to the theatre the first time. What made me goto the theatre two more times after and purchase the DVD the second it became available was the greatness of the movie. It's not often that a love story so deep comes along. This movie encompasses two types of love, between a father and son, and a husband and wife. But it's not a sappy romance. How Tim Burton did this, proves how genius he is. Though the movie itself seems so far-fetched, it could not be more real. If you've already seen this movie, and like it, you'll know what i mean. For those who don't know whether or not to watch it brings me to the next point. Someone who doesn't even like the story to this movie, could still love it. It's one of the few movies I can tell people has some of the greatest imagery. Sure, movies these days have cool effects and stuff, but with Big Fish, you will be captivated by the use of colour and parallelism. From the town of Spectre, to the cool carnival, everything is so magical. Now onto two very important things that give this movie the 100% rating i gave it, and why it was nominated for Best Picture at the Golden Globes, Acting and Sound. Surely, everyone knows Ewan McGregor. But it's his supporting cast that make this film amazing. The chemistry between Billy Crudup (William) and Albert Finney (older Edward Bloom) is amazing. Though they have few scenes together, the ones that they do have together are very touching, and again extremely realistic. Jessica Lange (older Sandra Templeton) and up and comer Alison Lohman (Sandra Templeton) suit their respective parts perfect, and they both compliment each other by their characters. They we have the always funny Steve Buscemi (no one could have played his part better) and Danny DeVito who is also incredible in this movie. Helena Bonham Carter also provides a very unique role in this movie... her mystique and subtle beauty suited this movie perfect. Then came sound. A great original score, a fantastic soundtrack and an amazing, and I'll say it again AMAZING original song by Pearl Jam made this whole movie come together in perfection. Elvis Presly, Buddy Holly, and the Allman Brother to name a few of the old school music in this movie are an excellent choice to showcase what time periods we look at in this movie. All in all, Tim Burton, Danny Elfman, and the casts best pictures in my opinion. <br/><br/>Just a side note: Billy Crudup hasn't appeared in many films, but to mention two of his other movies (Almost Famous and Sleepers) seems appropriate. He's casted in some great movies if ya ask me. :)<br/><br/>Thanks"

","A flat mug of beer that should have been a bubbly flute of champagne<br/><br/>I was very frustrated and disappointed by Big Fish . clearly a lot of time, money and talent went into the production of the movie, but for me it never really came together.<br/><br/>At its center, ""Big Fish"" is a movie about storytelling.  Yet, I think that its fundamental flaw is that its stories are poorly told.  The older Ed Bloom is clearly meant to be a delightful raconteur, who charms his wife, his daughter-in-law, friends and acquaintances with his ""tall tales."" Yet, it's hard not to agree instead when his son accuses him of being an embarrassment after Dad takes the floor at his son's wedding to tell (obviously for the 100th times) his elaborate and version of the story of his son's birth.   As played by Albert Finney, Ed Bloom does seem more like the drunken uncle from whom you try to wrest the microphone, than the Aesop (or Garrison Keillor, if you prefer) of his day.<br/><br/>But it's not just Bloom who can't tell a story, sad to say Tim Burton seems to suffer from the same deficiencies as his protagonist.   In Burton's hands Bloom's stories seem always to be more about the production design than they are about any human emotion or contact.  As always, the LOOK of Burton's film is impressive, but in most of the stories, we have nothing but the design to which to react.  The actual people involved are either too flat, or too deliberately odd, for the viewer to relate to.   As the younger Bloom, Ewan McGregor stands around with a charming little grin on his face, but with no real connection to the action around him --- he plays Bloom like a genial optimistic idiot.  So things like Spectre, Bloom's war service, even his courtship of Sandra all come across as incidents, rather than important emotional points in Bloom's life.   We are therefore left feeling much as Will does ---- that Bloom's stories are just so much blarney, being spread by a man who's determined to keep his emotional life hidden.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Because the storytelling is oddly flat, it is difficult for the viewer to participate in the catharsis that Will is supposed to experience at the end of the film.  When Will helps his father ""finish his story""/finish his life in the last few scenes, obviously we are meant to believe that Will, having learned that there was more fact to his father's stories than one would expect, had somehow emotionally connected to his father after all.  But frankly, I don't see how.   In most of the stories we are told, Bloom's only ""emotional"" quality seems to be tenacity --- he's going to marry Sandra, he's going to get home from the war, he's going to fix up Spectre. Emotionally, he seems as indifferent to those he meets along the way -- Norther, Amos, Karl and especially Jenny -- as he seems to be to Will. (Blooms connection to his wife does seem to be the one exception). Certainly, although Bloom is portrayed as a decent fellow, but there is nothing in Bloom's stories, at least as they are told here, that gives us any reason to believe that Will is wrong to find his father distant and unapproachable. Indeed, Bloom seems always to have been a rather self-involved, lucky hack indifferent to those around him and adept at using cheap sentimentalism to get his way with people.   Sadly, even when his son is trying to make some sort of deathbed connection, Bloom falls back on the same sort of hucksterism to avoid any real emotion and to coerce Will into participating in a last tall-tale finale.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that I think Bloom's stories were SUPPOSED to draw us in and show us Bloom's emotional depths but fail to do so because they were told wrong.  The last couple of Albert Finney's scenes are actually quite good and would have worked wonderfully if they followed a better film.  If Bloom's stories were better told ---- i.e., if we were able to feel an emotional connection to his life --- then Will's conversion would be both credible and satisfying and the film would, I think, be a charm.<br/><br/>
Miscellaneous asides:<br/><br/>Jessica Lange is wonderful, as always.   What a shame she's sort of wasted in this.<br/><br/>With VERY few exceptions, people who aren't from the South just SHOULDN'T attempt southern accents.  As usual they are awful and all over the place here.<br/><br/>Nothing is helped by the fact that the ""big fish"" is crappy CGI and looks fake."
"bob the moo","Null","81","148","8 February 2004"," Very sweet, imaginative story despite lacking a strong conclusion
","Will Bloom feels like he doesn't really know his father - his habit of telling exaggerated and untrue stories instead of the truth.  They don't speak for several years until Will hears that Ed is on his deathbed and returns home.  He hopes to find out the truth behind the stories but can only get more of the same without doing some digging.<br/><br/>Even having watched the trailer I was unsure exactly what this film was about, but I trusted that Burton's imagination would carry it.  Having seen it, the film can best be described as being about story telling in that the film is more about the wonder of the stories told than the actual narrative in terms of start/middle/end.  In terms of the traditional idea of narrative, the film is not perfect - it is not as meaningful or as satisfying as I would have hoped, and this is shown in an ending that, although sweet, is not as neat as I would have hoped.  However the telling - that's where it is at.<br/><br/>The stories told are wonderfully whimsical and amusing, like the film states the stories have elements of truth but also be coloured by Bloom to add life to them.  For me, it was very simple to get involved in the tall tales and I was held in the spell of Ed's stories easily - even thought it never came to a `real' solution I was still captivated by just how sweet and imaginative it all was.  If it sounds like I'm having trouble putting my words together it is because I found the film quite hard to quantify - all I know is that I found the whole experience to be very sweet and enjoyable despite it not really amounting to much in the grand scheme of things.  In this regard the film is a consistently imaginative fantasy film that is gently humorous and outright funny at times.<br/><br/>The cast are pretty good.  I was originally a little put off by McGregor's Alabama accent and it took me a minute to get past it, but other that his performance was very good and he helped create the film's mood of wonder and whimsy.  I think both McGregor and Finney needed to have that sort of accent - I don't know why but it is a storyteller's accent and it does help the material.  Finney is good and manages to keep the spirit of McGregor's character going despite not being surrounded by the images to support him. The support cast works well whether they be tall giants or well-known cameos from Buscemi, Carter and Devito.  Lange, Crudup and Cotillard are all good but it is easily McGregor and Finney's film.<br/><br/>Overall some will find the lack of structure and real substance to be a problem - after all, this is a film about tall tales and not everyone will be able to enjoy that.  However this is a wonderfully light and fun bit of whimsy that is a lot better than I expected it to be.  While it may not amount to a great deal more than that, it can still be enjoyed for what it is - a great fun story!"

","Tim Burton has moved us with Edward Scissorhands, to me his most brilliant original work..being that it was a screenplay by him and Caroline Thompson... but BIG FISH is by far his MASTERPIECE. Based on a amazing book, he connected with the material beautifully. The visuals, the acting, the craftsmanship in putting all this together in a very touching... tug at your heart strings... laugh out loud... Oscar worthy production was handled to perfection. How could you not like this film? I simply wouldn't understand it. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny Devito all give A+ performances... Jessica being left out of most of the reviews I had to bring her in... not to be unnoticed are also a stellar performance by Billy Cruddup, Alison Lohman, and Helena Bohnam Carter. In fact I think every person in the film had one of their best performances. Just stellar all around. One whopper of a story that gets you pulled in and doesn't let you go till the ending credits! Big Fish will be in my movie library along with Edward Scissorhands and be a favorite in my heart, my 15 year old Daughters, my Wifes, and everyone I talk to about it. Great, great, did I say Great film Tim Burton... you definitely got your magic back!"

After seeing him in Big Fish alongside Jessica (I in no way look 80) Lange, I love his acting even more.  I thought the entire tale was wonderful from beginning to end, and I did not want to see the story end, which, I would say, should be considered a defining characteristic of a feel good movie such as this. I felt all of the acting was superb as was the writing, directing, etcetera. I have only one thing about this movie that really baffles me... are you listening Academy?  Why wasn't this movie the winner for Best Picture? Ohh, yeah... LOTR... my bad... on any other year, it should have been."

","Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a larger-than-life kind of guy, has always told miraculous stories about his life where fantasy and reality are seemingly interwoven. This has lead to years of alienation from his son Will (Billy Crudup) who feels he never heard the real stories and who doesn't appreciate his father's fantastic tales. When Ed Bloom is on his deathbed, his son returns. Feeling like he never knew his father, he hopes to separate the lies and fantasy in his stories from the truth, hoping to find the true person underneath the tall-tales.<br/><br/>In the movie, Edward Bloom recounts stories from his life. We see the younger Edward Bloom (mostly played by Ewan McGregor) as the main character of these fantastic tales. There are many themes in this movie as they vary with the story being told, but the main theme is the relationship between father and son as his son rediscovers and comes to terms with who his father is.<br/><br/>It's a heart warming, adventurous, funny movie where fantasy and reality go hand in hand and the possible is as likely as the impossible.<br/><br/>To me, this is Tim Burton at his best.

"coffeyaddict","1","44","86","8 January 2004"," sentimental bullhockey
","Tim Burton has made a number of films I really like (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Pee Wee's Big Adventure), but this is not one of them.  The son trying to figure out his father is a wholly unlikable character.  If I were his dad, I'd disown him.  Like everyone else in the picture, he is successful, very clean cut, and middle class.  In fact, these words can be used to describe the film in its entirety, and I don't mean that as a compliment.  <br/><br/>It's possible that the Burton films I like were carried by quirky actors like Johnny Depp and the young Winona Ryder.  As good as he was in Trainspotting, Ewan McGregor has become a dull, middle of the road, mediocre actor.  His role in the midst of these extended fantasy sequences is too bright-eyed, too naive to be at all involving or interesting.  The only reason I was able to sit through this entire picture was the presence of Steve Buscemi, in a relatively small role.<br/><br/>How a film is able to involve a lot of carny sequences and remain pure as the driven snow is beyond me, but I think the more important question is WHY would a director do this?  Tim Burton's film has a very Disney-fied quality to it, everything is squeaky-clean sweetness and love once initial misunderstandings are overcome.  There is not nearly enough humor in this film to make it worthwhile.  Burton's wide-eyed fantasy world has become unbearably boring."
"shecrab","2","51","103","10 January 2004"," It has no idea what it wants to be
","I have to start this by saying that Tim Burton has always been one of my favorite directors. I like his skewed point of view, his Edward Gorey-ish surrealism, his way he will show the not merely odd in his films but also the unpleasant, the ugly, and the weirdly bizarre, and show them in a lovable, accepting manner that makes them sometimes hauntingly fascinating. Instead of that ""train wreck you can't look away from"" feeling, Burton always leaves you with a voyeuristic sense that makes you want to watch his films more than once, to see the things you missed the first time. Instead of hammering away at the viewer with the weirdness of the characters, Burton lets the personalities speak for themselves; and perhaps this works because his characters have always been inherently likeable.<br/><br/>Not so this time with his latest effort, Big Fish.<br/><br/>To tell this nested set of stories, Burton assembled a cast that is top notch: Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, Albert Finney as the elderly Edward Bloom, Jessica Lange as Bloom's wife Sandra, Billy Crudup as their son William Bloom; with a host of minor roles filled by such notable performers as Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, and Steve Buscemi.  He even includes folksinger Louden Wainwright III in a not-so-invisible role, for what reason I cannot imagine, and insists on spelling his name incorrectly throughout the entire film's opening AND closing credits. This puzzled me a great deal.<br/><br/>In fact, I was puzzled many times throughout the film, but mostly after, when I should have been nodding and smiling, and not wanting to wait until it came out on DVD; instead, I was itching to leave the theater as soon as possible, and sat there with a distinct frown on my face when it finally ended.<br/><br/>Very /few/ films have made me feel as if I wanted to leave. No matter how bad a film is, I rarely walk out on it. Maybe that was the problem with Big Fish; it really isn't BAD. It's pretty. But it's also hollow. You keep watching, and watching and watching, hoping that it will eventually turn into the film you think it should be, then it ends and you realize it never will.<br/><br/>Basically, the story line is simple enough. Edward Bloom is a storyteller. He tells stories about his own life, and adventures, and entertains for decades with these fantastical tales--first his friends, then his wife, then his own son, William. But as William grows up, he becomes irritated with, then angry about, these ""lies"" that he was told. He wants to know the ""real"" father--the one that he can't see for all the stories that he feels act as a smokescreen. Yet, he cannot get any closer to the truth, so he falls away from his father emotionally, until his mother phones him to tell him that his father is now dying.<br/><br/>So William packs his suitcase and pregnant wife and moves back home to help sort out the end of his father's life. Immediately, he is faced with the same stories, the same lies, the same fantastic tales of his father's adventures, and cruelly and selfishly cuts the old man off time after time. He refuses to accept either the stories, OR the magic they contain, and most of all, the fact that they are very entertaining stories. But he is forced to remember the stories, as his father relates them to William's wife, who seems to be entranced by them, and him.<br/><br/>As the stories get told, we are 'treated' to them. ALL OF THEM. These are not SHORT stories. These stories are long, they are convoluted, they have many moments that make you want to question Edward as he tells them, and they contain many many MANY dead ends that lead---and this is the really frustrating part---nowhere at all. And they go on and ON.<br/><br/>For example, take the story about his walk down the ""haunted road."" Edward ploughs his way through mists, and trees that grab him (literally) and strange sounds and (ick and double ick!!) a HUGE nest of large black jumping spiders (!!) and a town that shouldn't even exist, and these things get barely a mention at all (except for the town.) The entire time, the voice-over is yammering on and on about perseverance. About ANOTHER story that was told earlier. About NOTHING. After several dozen of these sorts of scenes, you are left with a feeling that you are missing the point--if you knew where to look, maybe it would pop out at you. But it never  does. Because it isn't there. You are constantly trying to reconcile what you are seeing with what you are hearing.<br/><br/>In fact, if you removed the soundtrack and voicetrack from this film entirely, and just WATCHED it, you'd be so puzzled you wouldn't be able to make sense of the plot--but what you /would/ have was an entirely different impression of what was really happening!  This feeling of being pulled in two different directions is not only unsettling, it's highly irritating.<br/><br/>The film has two major flaws in addition to this.  First, it is about the South--to be precise, Alabama.  There is an ingrained ""southernness"" about the movie that needs to be there, because there are several references in it that would only make sense in the Southern U.S.  Yet, Burton uses three British actors, one from New Jersey, and a New Yorker, and only ONE person has even a HINT of an Alabamian accent. He doesn't go so far as to allow his Brits to speak with their normal accents, but they don't do ""Suth'n"" either. And neither Albert Finney NOR Danny DeVito speak in consistent accents. Devito wavers from exaggerated hillbilly to his usual ""Noo Joisey"" intonation, and Finney can't decide where he's from. This smacked of really shoddy dialogue coaching, and did nothing for the continuity.<br/><br/>
Second, the film is FAR FAR TOO LONG. It needs a good edit. The pace is snaillike, the acting sometimes seems improvised and directionless. And it just has no idea what it's supposed to be ABOUT most of the time.<br/><br/>
There are many little oddities all through the film: a street shown briefly in one scene mirrors one seen in Edward Scissorhands; The 'martial arts' in the Chinese army scene is idiotically choreographed; the ""twins"" seem to change size in their various scenes, as does the giant. The ""banjo man"" on the porch in Spectre is not only playing the song from ""Deliverance,"" he IS the young man who played the banjo in ""Deliverance!"" And why Louden Wainwright? Did Burton owe him a favor? He's no actor. He sticks out like a sore thumb among those who ARE actors.<br/><br/>There are things that make /no/ sense, visually OR plot-wise. Why does the kid steal shoes? Who, or what, is that naked ""fish woman?"" How can so many barefoot people dancing on grass make so much noise? What's up with the bits about Edward's need for water--about feeling ""dry""? (He soaks in a tub, fully clothed!) Even some of the camera angles are downright awkward--as if an amateur camera operator had been given free rein to be as ""arty"" as he wanted to be.<br/><br/>And probably the weirdest one of all: Tim Burton has made another movie about someone named Edward.<br/><br/>None of these little items, or the other dozens of such things, are explained or illuminated in the film, especially not at the end, when one might expect them to become clear, or at least say why they cannot be clear. They are simply /there/. And they build irritation throughout the course of this very long film, and the pacing is slow, slow, slow. Never have I felt so much like getting up and leaving a film, just to take a break from it all.<br/><br/>This film isn't a fantasy. It's not an allegory. It's not a drama. It's not a comedy. It's not even a decent Tim Burton film! The characters aren't all that likeable or believable; if Jessica Lange had ducked and nodded and smiled ONE MORE TIME in that film, I'd have thrown a tomato at the screen. And NO ONE--I repeat NO ONE--should have to see Danny Devito NAKED, OR repeatedly watch Albert Finney slurping.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film. From the previews, it looked like an entirely different film than the one I saw. It looked lighter, more magical, more surreal. Instead, it was a hodge-podge of bad writing, uncertain goals, unexplained events and senseless details. It just didn't gel."

It is a great story that chronicles a strained relationship with a father and son.<br/><br/>Will Bloom grew up listening to the wild and fantastic tales of his father Edward Bloom. As a child, Ed was able to captivate his son with these wonderful tales, and even convince him they all happened. As Will matures, he grows to believe that these stories are just an invention of his father's imagination, and he starts becoming tired of them. The final straw occurs when his father takes the opportunity at Will's wedding to share a story of his life with everyone there. This frustrates Will because he believes that his father always has to make everything about himself, even at his only child's wedding. With their relationship too severely strained, Will and his wife Josephine move to Paris. But when Edward's health starts failing, Will feels it is time to come home and see his father before he passes away.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie contains many of the adventures of Edward's life while his son is trying to discover the real truth of his father in hopes of renewing their relationship before Edward dies.<br/><br/>Tim Burton does an amazing job in directing this masterpiece. Unlike most of his films, the story does not have a dark and Gothic tone. Instead, it relies heavily on symbolism and imagery, and actually has a heartwarming story. The acting throughout the entire cast is superb. Billy Crudup does a fantastic job playing the son who feels his father has not been enough of a true father for him. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both have wonderful performances as they depict different parts of Edward Bloom's life. Even the original score is wonderful as Danny Elfman once again lives up to his moniker.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a wonderful masterpiece.

","As a lifelong Burton fan, I approached this film with high hopes, and no trepidation whatsoever. Honestly, I have never met a Tim Burton film I haven't liked for one reason or another, but Big Fish is only the second to make me cry (Edward Scissorhands being the first). I was expecting a deep storyline, wonderful cast of characters, and little confusion from time to time, but I got so much more than these things. We have all had a ""big fish"", it's the one that grows and grows until it takes on a life of it's own, before long you don't need to tell the story anymore, because that fish is just one step ahead of you. Bloom didn't lie, he told his own version of the truth, a heartwarming, romantic, and enthralling truth. The cast was nothing short of stellar (especially Billy Crudup making one of his rather rare on-screen appearances). The characters made Big Fish what it is, each and every one influencing the progression of an incredible story you can only hope holds some truth. The elements of love, friendship, and family are embedded in the symbolism and dialogue. The visuals are captivating and awe inspiring. No one does it like Tim Burton, and Burton will struggle to ever create a film to match this...I would (and do) recommend it to everyone."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Here we have a folded project: a story about storytelling where life is defined in part by fiction. It is by a one time master of folding, peaking with `Ed Wood.' It has key actors who understand folding: Lange (`Titus' and mate of folder Shepard), McGregor (started with `Pillow Book,' then `Moulin Rouge') and DeVito, the purveyor of comic folding in the tradition of Nabokov, most recently in `Death to Smoochy.'<br/><br/>Heaviweights all. The story is a common edition, something between `Baron ` and `Guinevere,' with more than a dollop of Redford's slick, dumb flyfishing-as-life mentality.<br/><br/>The intent was surely to have the `stories' and `real life' overlap, affect each other, and merge like the conjoined twins. If this worked, the labored metaphors would have been fine  we could even have tolerated more. After all, we are dealing with Proust here, the notion that a life is defined by memory  an elaborate life by an elaborate `story.'<br/><br/>But it doesn't work. I think that is because in film we have such a strong tradition of a framing device. That expectation is so strong that when we have two overlapping stories and one `generates' the other, you have to pull some fancy tricks to avoid it falling into a static frame, like Falk in `Princess Bride.'<br/><br/>Burton didn't do this well at all here. This same week, I saw a nearly identically structured project, `Conceiving Ada.' It failed in exactly the same way. The `past' story was interesting and fantastic, where the `present' story was lifeless. This lack of equivalence prevented their intended overlapping.<br/><br/>A real shame. Probably Depp would have helped.<br/><br/>Ted's evaluation: 2 of 3  Has some interesting elements."

","When I heard that director Tim Burton (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow) directed this tale, I assumed that an extraordinary saga would unfold on the screen as something unnatural and weird, yet entertaining.  Weird it was, yet it often failed to convey a story.  Rather it made some attempts at reconciling Edward Bloom's (Albert Finney as the dying old Bloom and Ewan McGregor as young Bloom) tall yarns he would tell repeatedly to anyone who would listen and especially to his son Will Bloom (Billy Crudup).  Will soon learned to disbelieve all of his father's fantastic stories and ultimately became totally estranged from his father, whether as a result of shame or the lack of intimacy and connection with his father.  His mother, the ever-smiling Sandy Bloom (Jessica Lange), lends little of her stellar talents to this wooden role.<br/><br/>
The fables as they unfold are truly implausible and often border on the ridiculous.  Clearly, one is left with the same mindset as the son Will, that Edward is a huge bulls***ter who may have trouble separating fact from fantasy.  The story or stories are told in confusing flashbacks, sometimes in a true Tim Burton fantasy and sometimes in what appears to be a vaudeville style.  The characters are indeed colorful and weird such as the ringmaster of the Circus Amos (Danny DeVito) and the Colossus (George McArthur).  It borrows heavily in fantasy style from other recent fantasies like the Truman Show, Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, yet does not come close to telling a story with clarity and style.<br/><br/>The film jumps from clarity to confusion and back to rationality and clarity.  We are touched that the son ultimately appears at his dying father's bedside and attempts to find out who his father really is.  There are many seeing the picture who will be quite taken by its symbolism, fantasy, and fatherly machinations.  For myself, this film could have been written in a much more coherent manner and revealing much, much more of the possible intimacy that can exist between father and son.  The comedic routines are quite funny and Burton seems to have the timing down quite well.  However, its humorous sequences are not enough to carry the film or to carry the story from scene-to-scene.<br/><br/>The ending is predictable early in the film and clichéd at best.  Helena Bonham Carter's talents are wasted as Jenny, the child becoming adult who had her eyes on Edward since he was a young man.  She also plays a more interesting role as a witch in this flick, but it also falls flat and gets placed on the shelf with the rest of the cast that have not been adequately developed.  This is a picture that you will either love or simple discard as too much weirdness and lacking coherence.  Obviously, you know where I stand.<br/><br/>Opens everywhere December 25th in the Bay Area."
"promich","1","37","78","18 January 2005"," Burton reaches a new low
","A really unfortunate waste of a film, chock full of contrived, manipulative, false-sentimentality that would almost, but not quite, make Spielberg blush. Okay, that sounds a bit harsh, but this is bland, un-affecting Hollywood tripe. Burton doesn't insult his audience's emotional intelligence to the Spielbergian degree, but nor does he inspire us the way he once did my sharing his unique vision. This film has the emotional subtlety of a jack-hammer and it contains none of the imaginative wonder of 'Beetlejuice' or 'A Nightmare Before Chritmas.' Sadly, this is what Hollywood/Middle Age can do to a former bright light. The kind of movie that guy from 'Good Morning America' would call 'loads of fun' in one of his lobotomized reviews. Skip it. Skip it. Skip it."
"MaxBorg89","10","5","7","14 February 2006"," Burton's most touching movie
","After the quite disappointing Planet of the Apes remake, Tim Burton returned to form with Big Fish, a strongly underrated gem which is one of the best pictures of 2003, along with The Return of the King, Lost in Translation and Mystic River. It's the most heartbreaking, poetic and romantic movie he's made since Edward Scissorhands, and it's a shame it didn't get the recognition it deserved.<br/><br/>At the movie's center is the relationship between the dying Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, excellent) and his son Will (Billy Crudup) who wants to find out the truth about his dad: for several years, Edward has told some amazing stories concerning his life, and Will is the only one who has stopped believing them. Now, he wants to know what really happened.<br/><br/>That's when the film properly kicks off, as we're shown young Edward's (Ewan Mcgregor, absolutely comfortable in the role) life exactly as he has described it, alternating facts and, for most of the story, fiction. Expect giants, witches, werewolves, a hidden town (appropriately called Spectre), a Fellini-inspired circus, fish which look like naked women and lots more. This is Burton as we like him: bizarre, unpredictable, hard to summarize. You have to see the movie to truly understand why people love it.<br/><br/>Still, behind the adventurous and romantic facades lies great human tragedy. Big Fish will make you laugh, but by the time the end credits start rolling you will most probably have tears in your face. Life can be funny for a second, and very sad right after wards. Never has a Burton film been so dramatic.<br/><br/>As I said, this is a wonderful film, yet sadly it was heavily overlooked (it received only one Oscar nom, for Danny Elfman's gripping score). Watching it is a marvelous experience.<br/><br/>One scene is worth the entire viewing: Edward sees his future wife for the first time. According to some people, time stops in that moment. Burton makes it happen on screen. That one sequence is pure movie magic."

","December 28th, when i passed my psychology exam, i immediately went to our bookshop to celebrate the event , that's my odd nature - and i saw the book called Big Fish there. It was thin and thus cheap so i bought it , went outside and started reading. I was charmed by the way it was written, the style reminded me of American folklore (actually that was a Russian translation, and a book of American folklore i had was also on Russian , so, maybe ,it is only a wrong impression) , and the story was so unusual , and so unusually told , and i loved it.<br/><br/>On the back cover of the book it was said that Tim Burton have filmed it not long ago, so the only thing to do was buy the film immediately. Often , when you read a book and image the characters and events quite well, a film based on this book becomes a disappointment for you .But this was not the case. The film is excellent. Doctors call it schizophrenia or something like that ,when your imagination becomes real and surrounds you , but what to do if it's not just an imagination? You can't tell reality and fantasy apart only because they are the same.If something you face ain't alright with you, think it up the way you like it more."

","This movie is described by many people here in great detail, and I don't think there is much more I could add about the characters. The storytelling throughout the entire movie is just wonderful.<br/><br/>It is so easy to get caught up in the stories being told about the young Edward Bloom, that we forget that we are being told the stories by the dying Bloom. And thus we are taken from the youthful tales of wonder, to the sweet old man dealing with his bitter unbending son. Slowly throughout the movie, the son learns who his father was, and who he still is, and that is the wonder of Big Fish. There is no big ""Turning Point"" from the son, just a gradual understanding of who his father is. And the ending is a joy as well - over the top, fantastic, and an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>Someone before me in these reviews stated that men might like this movie more than women - that I am not sure about, but I can say, as a man who didn't always have the best relationship with my own father (and what man HAS had the perfect relationship with his father?), this movie is especially poignant to men in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>10 / 10 (and as a note, my father received a copy of this from me as a gift last year!)"
"keep7925","10","5","7","31 October 2004"," Social Commentary in Big Fish
","On first viewing of Burton's Big Fish I was easily dazzled by the wonderful visionary effects and heartwarming story. I immediately loved the film not only for these reasons but also because I felt there was something deeper being touched on in the film though I didn't quite grasp it all at first viewing. Since I have watched it several times more and clearly seen the social commentary the film makes.<br/><br/>Culture today is moving into a period called post-modernism, which has many aspects to it, but chiefly the movement from modern logical thought to something beyond. Shown mostly in the younger generations, post-modernism has turned away from science and logic. The way to reach a young person these days is not by lecturing facts, but through stories and experience. This film explores this cultural shift brilliantly, whether it really intended to or not.<br/><br/>The film continually keeps you guessing as to what parts of Ed's stories are real and what aren't, but that's not the point. The point is that regardless of how much the stories are true (or make logical sense), they are who the man is. Indeed logic even has no place in them, shown by multiple absurdities and illogical time sequences with the witch. Edward is the character representation of post-modernism, with his son William representing the modern world and it's lack of understanding of post-modernism. <br/><br/>I would elaborate more but the film is so rich in scenes and characters that display different aspects of this point that to do so would require a more in depth study than can be given here. So look for it in the movie yourself if you know anything about this cultural change."

","Many people have said how great they found this film, personally it didn't really do it for me.<br/><br/>I thought it was quite sickly actually. Plus points for the special effects; Tim Burton rarely disappoints in that area, but what got me was the obvious way it tried to toy with the viewers emotions, it tried too hard to upset me, and at the end I didn't care, I knew it was manipulating the viewer and I didn't fall for it's narrative tricks. But this isn't about how clever I am, rather, how superficial I found the acting and the writing to be.

It just seemed like a generally pointless storyline but in the end, it was well compiled into a story as big as life itself. It's a classic film, don't get me wrong just not one of those memorable classics. But I hope you get what I'm saying. This movie just didn't seem necessary and they could've come up with a more complicated storyline. It didn't feel urgent and it wasn't out to stress a point but that's what you need in films like these. Sure, maybe it had a main idea or two but there were more than two ideas scattered throughout the story, which made it not stick, not stand on a basis for an important movie structures. However, I did give this movie a ten because once again it reminds us of life and that's always welcome in movies. shows, or whatever because we can all relate to it. Everyone has a life and everyone has stories to share. Sure, this is a fictitious story but it really captures the intensity and mystery of life, which reigns above all in any movie. Big Fish was so very well done but it was not urgent and it didn't fit in as well as it could and I know that's the case with a lot of movies but I think Big Fish really could've used a main, thorough, substantial idea."

Of course William says that this doesn't make sense as the witch was old when Edward was a little boy, and she explains herself by saying that all the women in the world who were not his wife Sandra were the same to him He did not distinguish between them.<br/><br/>However i am unclear as to whether she actually is the witch or if she is lying and none of her story was true. Why would she say that the little girl she used to be grew up to be a witch? There must be some significance there. Also I wonder how she knew about the witch in the first place if it wasn't her.<br/><br/>Also, going back to Edwards view that there are only two women, his wife and all the rest, how does the lady of the lake fit in?

One minute you could be smiling in melancholy happiness and the next, eyes filling with tears. The characters in the film represent all the adolescent and adult emotional feelings one develops as they adapt within families and societal life. The dark undertones sort of represent the overall mood you ""the viewer"" experience within each progressive scene. <br/><br/>Actor Billy Crudup (Will Bloom)plays the son of (Ed Bloom)Albert Finney with such convincing manner:everything from the facial expressions down to the speech and vocal tones conversed between the two. Ewan McGregor plays the part of (Ed Bloom) coming of age. And does it so well. The struggle of son living up to father's expectations is very real. <br/><br/>Showing that a strong family structure is key to success in most nearly everything.

","If you're Irish, you realize that the story is the key. If you're not Irish, we'll pray for you. 'Tis said that the Irish never allow the truth to get in the way of a good story. A very logical and pragmatic son has struggled with a great story teller of a dad and doesn't know fact from fiction about his father. He comes home as his father nears the end of his life and begins to investigate to try to separate the truth from the fiction in his father's tales. Tim Burton directs a wonderfully suited cast in telling this tale. As the story unfolds, the son discovers that his father isn't as crazy as he has thought and discovers a message about life that his father had been trying to pass to him. Fortunately for the son, he finds the message his father wants him to find and thus inherits a wonderful legacy of enlivening the dullness of routine existence with the wonder of fine story telling. Perhaps, for the more rational mind, the father had failed in his quest to share who he was and denied his son many years of closeness. I can certainly see that point of view. But, as a story teller myself, this movie will become one of the shining stars of my collection and I will share it with my grandchildren in the hope of widening their visions of life and their abilities to see beyond the obvious and the mundane. What a boring world it would be without great story tellers. The imagination is a wonderful thing that allows us to probe beneath the obvious. This is a wonderful film. I highly recommend it."

","Director Tim Burton's surreal & illusionary cinematic techniques have taken us to mystical lands such as: Gotham City, Planets of Apes, Scissor Worlds, Edywood, and Mars. However, mainstream film buffs have been appalled by Burton's outlandish direction. Along comes `Big Fish', Burton's latest flick. Without a doubt, this is Burton's most mainstream film. `Big Fish' will hook those conservative moviegoers along with Burton's cult fanatics. Ewan Mcgregor stars as Ed Bloom. Ed is definitely not a late `bloomer' because of his vivid life and the eccentric characters he befriends along the way. Albert Finney co-stars as the late `bloomer; or should I say the older Ed Bloom who tells his suspicious off-center life tales to his estranged son. The tales might sound fishy to his son Will, played by Billy Crudup, but he listens to them because of his dad's near mortal condition. Alison Lohman, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Devito round out the acting pond in this thespian school of fish. `Big Fish' possesses sentimental humanistic elements unseen in Burton's previous films. The film, which runs to 130 minutes, could have been shorter in duration but `Big Fish' is still worth the bait. **** Good"

Of course the father lies about his life and comes up with a lot of stupid tales about himself as young (Ewan McGregor).<br/><br/>What I don't get about this movie is how people can like a person as reprehensible as Ed Bloom. Not only is he an arrogant S.O.B. who can't talk about anything but himself, he was also a bad father and probably also a bad husband, which is somewhat implied by Jessica Lange's restrained and depressing performance. Also, Ed Bloom seems to get sad every time someone tells him that he's not funny and tries to make him act sane for at least one time in his life. Wait scratch that, first he's sad and then he tells another story. I found it impossible not to hate him. Which is strange because everyone in the movie loves him, and I have no idea why. The only scene I really enjoyed was when he got beaten up.<br/><br/>Some things aren't awful though. The sets and Alison Lohman look great and... Well that was about it.

","Some Spoilers<br/><br/>Billy Crudup is estranged from his charming father Albert Finney because he resents being used as part of his father's habitual tall tales.  Years later working in France, Crudup gets a call from his Mother, Jessica Lange, that Dad isn't going to make it.   Crudup and his dutiful pregnant wife head back home so that he can try to understand the man his father really is. Earnest Crudup must sort out the real man from the tall tales he was told before his impending death.   One can smell the life lessons a mile away and the 'heartfelt', golden lit redemption that will be trotted out on a gigantic scale long before it happens.<br/><br/>This being a Tim Burton (great believer in misenscene as the star of most of his directorial efforts) film we dutifully sit through over-produced, colorful flashbacks featuring a young Finney as played with nauseating earnestness and a wide-eyed can-do chutzpah by Ewan MacGregor.   The flashbacks resemble skits from the Muppet Show with their overblown hyperbolic imagery and cutesy art direction. Each story within the main frame of the film reeks of obvious symbolism and tiresome morality lessons. So shallow is MacGregor's goody-two shoes character and the seemingly endless good deeds he chirpingly performs one wants to ask Mr. Burton to please stop begging for our approval and get on with the central narrative.<br/><br/>
When the narrative finally emerges from its steady stream of narrative side trips to soft-focus fantasy lands and we deal with the pending reality of Finney's impending death - there is virtually nothing to care about. Crudup has a thankless task of being the doubting son of the tale teller. Frankly, there is no forward motion to Crudup's character and he learns nothing. Finney, a consumate professional, spends most of his time choking through illness or smiling, with benign crust, his all knowing grin.   Lange is completely wasted doing a 'dutiful southern belle wife with no personality' turn and speaks about 8 lines which consist mostly of `did you get enough to eat honey' sentences.   There's a large cast of celebrities who play colorful but unmemorable roles and run about as if lost in a Fellini film as Big Fish moves into its sudsy final act.<br/><br/>The deliberate tear-jerking and low brow attempts and humanism only result in laughable Hollywood schmaltz that is absolutely relentless in force. Clearly, in the final sequences of the film it is as if the swelling music, 'warm-hearted' characters, and gauzy cinemtography have been orchestrated with the sole intent of wringing tears from even the most jaded of brick walls.  CRY DAMN YOU, CRY!!!   The brow-beating self importance of Big Fish is pure 'high-concept' filmmaking at its most manipulative.<br/><br/>
For a few of the audience members at my screening last week (kleenex wiping away their tears), maybe your aunt Gladys, her henpecked husband Phil and 'special' cousin Jimmy with the slow eye, Big Fish is what they might call a `goooooood moovie'.   For the rest of us, bring a large barf bag and keep your seat belt fastened at all times.   If anything, it will be so much fun to watch the sanctimonious Oscar chatter this stinkeroo will raise.

For a hanky movie to work you do have to care about the characters. The second time Albert Finney asks for water you'll guess what's coming.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is getting much attention for his newfound maturity. What that means is that whatever the merits of his quirky, poorly-scripted previous movies, he's now signed on to one of the two acceptable messages for Hollywood dramas to have: 1) You gotta have heart. 2) Believe in the magic. Both of which are pure cornball. In this case it's #2. Ready-made themes excuse viewers from developing or even thinking much. <br/><br/>If you're an adult with the mind of an eight-year-old you're in for a treat.

","This movie is an unsalvageable wreck.  The acting is wretched with apologies to Bonham Carter and Cotillard who do not belong within a hundred and fifty miles.  Burton seems confused as to which of the 4 or 5 different movies he wanted to make.  None of them is fully realized.  There is the sappy fun-for-the-whole-family melodrama that has infected his recent work.  There is the 'trademark' weirdness that he has failed to develop significantly since Scissorhands.  It just seems recycled and out of place here (Burton himself absolutely pillages Peewee's Big Adventure, which by the way, is a far superior film).  There is a contrived story between father and son which leaves me with the impression that Burton not only never had a father but has never seen a father and a son interact in the same room.  And there are at least three moments, horribly short, where one sees what the film could have been.  That is the most infuriating part.  The most disappointing film I've seen this year.  2/10 stars"

","In my lifetime, I have come across very few movies (""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""The Champ"") that will make grown men care enough about the stories/characters to weep. ""Big Fish"" is one of those select films.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of a dying old man (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup). For his entire life, the son has been overshadowed by the tall tales of his father, and is resentful of that fact. In the final days of the old man's life, however, his stories featuring the younger version of himself (Ewan McGregor) prove to indeed be the most important link between father and son.<br/><br/>Since this is a Tim Burton-directed movie, trying to explain it in words is like trying to describe a work of art hanging in a museum. You know it is great, but you just can't quite put a solid explanation pulling together all the reasons why. Suffice it to say, however, it is one of the rare Burton efforts that is rife with his flare for the cinematography craziness but yet manages to not get lost in the imagery and still make sense in the end.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is also one of the most emotional movies one could ever watch. It will particular touch fathers and sons (as that is the backbone of the story), but there is something for everyone to enjoy. Actors such as Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, Alison Lohman, Marion Cotillard, and Steve Buscemi play key roles that enhance the emotion all that much more.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Big Fish"" is a movie that must be seen in order to fully be understood. Look at all the five-star reviews here on Amazon and know that it isn't because of a ""fad"" or a bunch of fanboys. This is just a solid movie featuring top-notch storytelling, emotion, characters, cinematography, and even humor."

","Simply an amazing movie. Well acted, great story. I've seen this 1000 times and still get tears eyed up at the end. Every story keeps you wanting more, and the present breaks your heart. There are few movies I can watch over and over and still get excited to watch again. In my opinion there is simply not a better told story of family and regret. The casting couldn't have been any better. I get involved with the characters at the start and want to embrace the whole family dynamic. More symbolism in this movie than any I could think of. I can't remember why I watched this movie for the first time, but am so glad I did. If you are into fantasy, acting, fun, and want something to awaken your imagination i couldn't suggest a better film. Tim Burton's masterpiece."

","An utterly fantastic journey from start to finish. Every second of it brings a complete smile to my face. There is a quote from the film that is something like ""Sometimes things can be so strange, yet seem so familiar."" That directly applies to this entire film. It is filled with events that are so strange and magically bizarre, but everything feels so close to home. It was just two hours of what I felt was the best day of my entire life. Of course, coming from Tim Burton, the visuals and cinematography are absolutely breathtaking. All of the surreal happenings are just breathtakingly beautiful. The set designs are possibly the best I've ever seen. The performances are all phenomenal, as expected from such a superb cast. Helena Bonham Carter is absolutely exceptional, and Albert Finney makes me feel some of the most strong sympathy I've ever felt. Billy Crudup does the same. Alison Lohman is just gorgeous. Her beauty radiates across the screen and makes it very easy to believe why Edward Bloom would fall so madly in love with her. Ewan is as charismatic as ever, creating one of the most likable characters I've ever seen. It's a fascinating film full of greatness from a standard suburbia to a Utopian commune to a roaring circus and all the way across seas to the war."
"billion_mucks","8","3","4","28 November 2007"," Burton's view on Burton
","Each director has his movie that would sum up as his experimental catharsis. Woody Allen and Charlie Kauffman write every single script with this allegory. With ""Big Fish"", there is nothing great and difficult to understand, because it is done with a great magical, simple sense that entangles multiple interpretations: it beholds on the viewer to know what he/she will grab of the story.<br/><br/>Many saw the form of creating a legacy. Of how a man is nothing more than his interior world, thus being the Big Fish the Big Story. Doesn't really matter whether it's true or not. Others see how to view the world and put on the charge on the warmed-heart direction. It has a panoply on light colors and cozy art direction, of likable actors and fantasy characters.<br/><br/>All of this views are excellent. But what I see is Burton's most personal film. Yes, of course. But he admits and perseveres that he is a conflicted artist and his salvation relies on creating lies, stories that don't exist. He is a filmmaker, he lives by creating stories. Ed Bloom is Burton's hero, his unsuppressed self. All what he created, every inch of lies and fantasy he garnishes into his story, it's just a derivation of his interior oasis (may that be good or bad) and all of this movie is an intimate approach to his mind and heart. Burton is every character in the story, waiting to be heard in his most pure and dire form.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is Tim Burton view on Tim Burton."
"Jbird7777","8","3","4","27 November 2007"," A pleasant surprise
","Big Fish is an interesting movie for me to review. For one thing, it is directed by Tim Burton, and I generally don't like Tim Burton's movies. (What he did to Charlie and the Choclolate Factory was despicable in my opinion) But Big Fish did something that I thought any Tim Burton movie would never do: make me think that this was an enjoyable movie. Big Fish stars Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episodes 1-3, The Island, Black Hawk Down) as Edward Bloom, a man who considers himself to be a big fish in a small pond, hence the title of the movie. Now, the story of Big Fish is told on two fronts: the first front being Edward Bloom as an old man in the present day dying from cancer, telling his son's wife all of these stories of his own youth, however, the son believes that the stories that his father tells are nothing but lies, and this whole part of the movie is the son, William, trying to know more about his father by getting his father to tell him the truth about his life before his eventual death, The second front is told in the late 1950s and mid 1960s with the young Edward Bloom living these stories that the older version of Edward Bloom is telling, even though the stories told are pretty exaggerated. There are also nice cameos of Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, and Steve Buscemi. I thought that Big Fish was a very good movie, and it easily earns a place on my Top 100 Movies of All Time list. Now this movie does suffer from a few weaknesses. One weakness is the fact that the movie has the same Burton-style animation, and I have never really been that big of a fan of his animation style. The second weakness is that I personally thought that there was a little bit of deadweight. However, I find these weaknesses to be pretty minimal. I'm surprised that this movie only got a very limited release when it first came out, because I think that it would have done very well in the theaters. Overall, Big Fish is a very nice movie, and it really surprised me, because I loved this movie. I give Big Fish 8.5 stars out of 10, and if you see it at your local video store, I say pick it up and give it a chance. It could very well worth your while."

Obviously I own it and watch it regularly and I never get bored of it.<br/><br/>a) the cinematography is fantastic b) there are so many underlying themes that I think one view of the movie just does not pick up on c) it has so many messages, it makes you think and think some more - a lot of movies don't do that<br/><br/>It is truly up there on my list of favourites, but ever since I saw Big Fish for the first time, I don't seem to enjoy other movies as much....That's just my opinion!"
"dragavan","10","3","4","9 August 2007"," Amazing movie of love, acceptance, and the line between fantasy and reality
","I am a self-professed fan of Tim Burton (even after what he did with Batman, which I enjoyed because he did it), so I can not believe I had not see this movie before. It was one of the first things I added to my NetFlix Queue when I opened my account to correct that. I am now going to have to run out and purchase this one for my own collection. It's just that good. It has not only instantly become my favorite Burton movie ever, but has move onto my list of favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>The way this movie was filmed, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography, and all of it, combined to create a magical feeling to all the stories it tells. It gives each one a different look and feel, while allowing them to also stay part of the same life story they tell. Throw in the very down to earth style used for the scenes of the ""real world"" as the son tries to find the truth about his dying father and you have a truly magical mix of styles that work perfectly together. Sprinkle in the fantastic music of Danny Elfman and you have what I can only call a perfect movie.<br/><br/>The acting was top notch and the story was a great mix of reality and fantasy that keeps you wondering where the line between the two actually lies. The story is about fables and folklore, which are usually based in some truth, and those who are not willing to accept them for what they are. It is about the troubled and difficult relationships between fathers and sons trying to understand and accept each other. In then end it is about love and acceptance, in a world where fantasy and reality truly mix. It is one of the few movies that actually had me laughing and crying, sometimes at the same time.<br/><br/>The DVD itself not only contains the movie, but includes a number of good behind the scenes featurettes, a commentary track, and a Burton trivia game that leads to one of the hidden bonuses. The commentary track, although good, is more of an interview than a real commentary on the movie."

"saarvardi","10","3","4","9 July 2007"," In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish
","Big Fish is director Tim Burton's most mature film to date, taking his regular fantasy elements and vivid imagination, and planting them in an adult environment, where they can be both visually entertaining and emotional shattering. And yes, the film is that good.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Ed Bloom (Albert Finney), a dying father who receives a surprise visit from his estranges son, Will (Billy Crudrup) while on his death bed. Ed has the tendency of telling tales of his past, most filled up with imaginative figures and mythical places. Will speaks with his father and asks him to retell the story of his life (a major part of the film is told in flashbacks, where the marvelous Ewan McGregor of Star Wars and Trainspotting fame portrays the young Ed). While listening to his father's gripping autobiography, Will tries his best to overcome his overlong cynicism and doubt towards the tales, and try his best to separate fact from fiction  a task he finds particularly hard to accomplish.<br/><br/>In the bottom line, anyone who's ever lost a parent (unfortunately, I lost both) would automatically relate to the sentimental and ever so touching nature of Burton's Big Fish. The film is a moral tale that teaches us the importance of family and nostalgia, and emphasizes the sad truth that sometimes we really get to appreciate and understand what we have when it's too late. When the movie ended, and the credits started to roll, I really wished I would've known my own father better (he passed away when I was 9 years old). <br/><br/>Honestly, why this film didn't race for the big Academy Awards of 2004 (for 2003 releases) is way beyond me, since this is purely one of the more complex and layered dramas of the 2000's."
"jpschapira","10","3","4","19 June 2007"," Like Tim Burton...
","Have you seen when something's magical? But I'm not talking of the magic magicians do, I mean when something is so incredible that it completes you inside; therefore it's magical. I'm talking about the unavoidable feeling when watching ""Finding Neverland"" and about the obliged feeling when watching any Tim Burton movie. All of the magical things we live in life, one way or another, Burton has expressed them in images throughout his career...In movies.<br/><br/>That I have seen a big part of Burton's films and that until today I have only written about ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" is beyond me; but I'll try to make it up talking a little bit about his, undoubtedly, best film. By far the most underrated movie of 2003, ""Big Fish"" is a journey of the imagination to its greatest extreme; the vision of life in the eyes of a man who couldn't seem more ordinary.<br/><br/>This man is Edward Bloom, and I would like to see life the way he does: ill and about to die, and telling his son Will (Billy Crudup) the true story of his existence, in an attempt to reconcile their differences. The thing is that Will ha always questioned his father's 'distortion' of the truth he has had to deal with all his life; and maybe this last story of Edward has the same little amount of truth as the others...Or maybe it is the whole truth.<br/><br/>""I tell stories"", the father simply declares to his son. It's a fact that everyone who likes listening to stories (and even the ones who don't) likes people to tell them with a little bit of seasoning; as you'll see Edward does. And that's also Tim Burton's main characteristic as a director; to give something extra to all of his films, which becomes a completely personal touch.<br/><br/>So it is like if Daniel Wallace had written his novel knowing that John August would adapt it creating a marvelous script that Tim Burton would later turn into this excellent film. With the images of Phillipe Rousselot's photography, the filmmaker lets his imagination loose, letting us see that he has pretty much in common with the main character of the story.<br/><br/>The movie is, of course, coherent as a whole; but it's nice to say that it is a collection of beautiful scenes that don't cease to amaze us for a minute. One scene is particularly spectacular, for any cinema lover as for a lover of love itself. Edward is narrating the day he met his wife. ""The say that when you meet the love of your life, time stops"". Burton literally freezes the whole image, allowing the movement of the main character only, who takes some 'frozen' popcorn in the air out of the way, to get to the woman he's looking for. Instantly, everything's moving again and the scene reaches its end in a funny way you must appreciate.<br/><br/>That scene is pure cinematographic art, the magic I'm talking about: flawless. Actually there are not many flaws in ""Big Fish"", with Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney portraying the young and old Edward, respectively; both in a way so moving that it's difficult to differentiate them. Starting from Billy Crudup, the rest of the cast is perfect: inspired Danny DeVito, big presence from Matthew McGrory and Steve Buscemi playing a role that couldn't have been for another person.<br/><br/>Burton knows which actors to choose, and which actresses. Jessica Lange shines unstoppably in her role of the faithful and loyal wife; Alison Lohnman (a promising young actress) gives interest to a part that doesn't seem to have it, and the always mystical Helena Bonham Carter doesn't do more than stealing the show. Danny Elfman's score also steals the show but it's really one more character, as in any Burton film (if you haven't seen ""Edward Scissorhands"", give yourself a chance: it's a great movie, but the music...).<br/><br/>In conclusion, ""Big Fish"" is no more than the piece where all the things Burton has worked on come together. That fantastic atmosphere of each film is present in this film with a lot more characters: here we find, at least bits, of a Jack, an Ed Wood, a headless horseman and even the other Edward; scissorhands. Coming to think of it, I would like to see life not so much like Edward Bloom, but maybe like Tim Burton."

And without doubt of it and happy i can say that ""Big Fish"" is, not only the best movie that he ever made, is too one of the best movies that i have ever seen and it probably (No matters if I'm going to a topic that is so discussed) one of the best movies ever made. <br/><br/>The story of ""Big Fish"", which was based it in the novel by Daniel Wallace, talk us about Will, who has lost affection for his father. One day, he receives a phone call from his family... his father is dying. He remembers then what was the cause of that lose of affection: Will hates when his father entertains all telling them all the stories of his youth. All of that stories are fantastic ones. Will hates it. When he was a kid he loves it. But now he hates it. When Will go to home again to take care to his father... he don't know that he is going to live the most big adventure of his life.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a real nostalgic experience in a beautiful way (Few movies that i have ever seen, in spite that i have not seen much, makes that feeling on you, like ""Smultronstället"" by Ingmar Bergman, ""Meet me in St. Louis"" by Vincente Minelli, ""City Lights"" by Chaplin and ""Le Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" by magistral director Jean-Pierre Jeunet), makes it cares in the REAL facts that makes so important life. I talk about your father, your mother, your sister, your brother, your family, your family or the people who loves and you love too. ""Big Fish"" is too a kind of time machine that returns us to that paradise of our childhood that much times we reject as adults. And in spite of that you'll be and adult, you can enjoy all that fantasy, all that story that, anyway, makes us human beens.<br/><br/>This movie is perfect is perfect too in the direction (I think that if is Tim, is very obvious), the performances ( My God, what cast! Ewan McGregor who was too in ""Trainspotting"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" ""Albert Finney"" ""Billy Crudup"", ""Jessica Lange"" who was in ""Crimes of the Heart"" , Helena Bonhan Carter who was too in ""Getting it Right"" by Randal Kleiser, Alison Lohman, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi who was very funny here and in ""Ghost World"" by Terry Zwigoff, Danny de Vito, Mattew McGrory who was wonderful as the giant, Ada Tai and Arlene Tai who was great as the paper of Ping and Ting, with other magnificent cast) and the scenario is real beautiful, in any detail. ""Big Fish"" is a real masterpiece, not only of the contemporaneous cinema, too of the history of cinema. Of course is just my opinion, and its maybe that movie with a touch of fantasy, surrealism and at the same time about present time, where the human been makes a world of corruption, some people can shows that we can change it a little with a tiny piece of sugar of fantasy, we can change the world and our lives in an inexplicable way. <br/><br/>Thanks Tim.

","If the movie is an art form that deliver the personal interpretation of the world what the artist see and feel. Tim Burton's world is exaggerated in darkness and sadness of a boy who is rejected from the world, so he creates his own world in darkest colors from a crayon box he has. Thus the movie is full of those wonderful dark colors such as charcoal black, dark blue and purplish Grey. All the characters are rejected from the society or rather intentionally ejected themselves and lives in an alienated world of their own, full of mysterious characters with those tortured dreams.<br/><br/>This movie isn't too far away from his previous creations but it shift little. The movie is full of colors, warmer and brighter. The camera moves faster. I assume that that's how the director's view is heading, almost dreaming and also forgiving.<br/><br/>The movie is totally a 'make-believe' itself, by the end of movie, you are starting to wish, to see if the 'big-fish' is real, still swimming around in the pool. Even if you know you are deceiving, you left in charm. If the cinema is fake as same as the 'big-fish', this is real cinema that makes the cinema 'real'. Make the movie as a genuine 'Big-Fish', so you feel like criticizing nothing at all when finally the ending credits rolls.<br/><br/>Helena-Bornham Carter's almost perfect New Jersey accent, also, Ewan Mcgregor's not-so-perfect New Jersey accent is also another 2 'Big-Fish' in the movie, we are all here to believe (so we forgive).<br/><br/>Albert Finney was always great, as I see him as an American answer to Britain's Sir Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>How wonderful to see a movie is so different from others that are full of 'Freud-sque' oppression of sexual desires,tortured dreams and weighed pressure (name the Kubrick). A one's life could be dark and also full of sinful mistakes from a viewpoint of psycho analysis's. This movie will open your hardest heart and will leave you to dream, once more.

","There is no movie quite like this one. On so many levels it is different, unique and utterly mind-boggling. It is not just the visual pleasures, like so many movies out there, but it is mostly the story and how it literally ends where it begins. It is Tim Burton's best work, in my opinion. This movie is a charming, simple, child-like film that is easily misunderstood.<br/><br/>The whole point of this movie is not that it's one great lie, it's point is that a great story is not just facts, facts are boring. It is telling us that a great story is always somewhat over exaggerated. In the beginning, the adult Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) tells the guests of his son's wedding about the day his son was born, the day that he caught the biggest fish in the Ashton river (which was rumored to be left over from the Cretaceous period) using is golden wedding ring. Later in the film, Dr. Bennett tells Will (Edward's son, played by Billy Crudip) the factual story of how he, Will, was born. Which version is do we remember? Edward's, of course, because it was over-exaggerated. This movie tells the story of the beginnings of a tall-tale.<br/><br/>Before watching it, I must warn viewers, this film is not for everyone. This movie is strange and only those who can think like Tim Burton will understand it. However, there is so much depth to the story that it requires some thinking to it. It is not a movie for parties and sleep-overs. It is not a movie for action-lovers.

Albert Finney plays senior Ed Bloom, a story teller who pores his heart into his never ending stories to his son, Will.  Billy Crudup, Will Bloom, is perfect in his underplay of the son searching for a portion of communication with his estranged father.  He has not spoken to his dad in several years, and he searches for a line of communication through the adventures that he recalls as childhood fairy tales.  Robert Guillaume plays the family's doctor taking care of the dying father with a gentle and understanding hand.  He gives a very comforting performance.  Mathew McGrory plays Karl the Giant, and the camera angles are very convincing in solidifying his character.  All moviegoers with a sense of imagination should see this movie.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","4","22 March 2004"," Fish vs Lions
","Spoilers<br/><br/>I was a little surprised that among the half dozen of my favorite IMDB contributors, no one mentioned the similarity between Big Fish and Secondhand Lions. Maybe everybody was focusing on Tim Burton's own work. Fish and Lions however are strikingly similar in their main theme, BELIEVING. Furthermore, in both cases, underneath the allegory of the tall tales are human relationships which are re-affirmed by them.<br/><br/>
The plot for Fish, if it can even be called one, is exceedingly simple. Estranged to his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewart McGregor) for three years out of a resentful embarrassment at his tall tales, Will (Billy Crudup) is summoned to the bedside of his dying father by his mother Sandra (Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman). With him is his seven-month pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard). Disturbed at the prospect of becoming a father himself, he makes a last ditch effort to understanding his own. Ed, however, living form day to day to the extent the state of his health permits, continues to recount his tall tales involving a parade of bizarre characters: a giant called Karl (Matthew Mcgrory), a circus ringmaster cum werewolf (Danny DeVito), Siamese twins joint from waist below Ping and Jing (Ada and Arlene Tai), a girl who became a Witch, but backwards through time (Hailey Anna Nelson/Helena Bonham Carter), a poet turned bank robber (Steve Buscemi)...<br/><br/>We see the signature of Burton quite early in the movie, in his otherwordly visuals during Ed's brief sojourn away from the giant. The foggy forest and the quaint town remind us, respectively, of Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands. On the other hand, there is less Burton flavor in Fish than in these two earlier movies. What he seems to be doing though is to make more references, intentional or subconsciously, to other movies. The first time Ed enters Specter Town, there is a very brief shot, maybe not even two seconds, of someone playing a banjo. Although we only hear no more than one bar, I could have sworn that it is the famous Banjo Duet from Deliverance (1972). The ringmaster's nocturnal transformation brings back images from Cat People (1982). The bank robbery scene may have been inspired by many movies, maybe Bandits (2001)?<br/><br/>Burton seems to be rather fond of the travelling salesperson character. In Edward Scissorhands, Peg Boggs is an Avon Lady. Here in Fish, Ed is a travelling salesman, although one that is distinctly different from Arthur Miller's tragic Willy Loman. Still, his constantly being away does lead to the ever widening gulf between him and his son.<br/><br/>The two pairs of Ed and Sandra Bloom are finely cast. However, the balance (or absence of which, rather) is not what I expected. Talented Alison Lohman basically serves as the sweet, pretty, young thing and has far less scope than in White Orleander, where she is the entire show (with due respect to Michelle Pfeiffer) or even Matchstick Man (where she convincingly played a grown-up plying a 14-year-old). Ditto Jessica Lange, whose mesmerizing charm still radiates, right from the very first shot when we see her approaching Ed lovingly with a kiss, after his usual speech. From that point on, every scene with Lange resonates with warmth.<br/><br/>This, then, is really the guys' show. The last time I saw Albert Finney was a totally delightful surprise and I had no idea that he was in Erin Brockovich, and playing a substantial role too. This time, it's with full expectation that I went, and those expectations he fully met. Finney clearly has not lost his touch since the days of Tom Jones (1963) and Two for the Road (1967). The true star of Fish, however, is Ewart McGregor, who in last year demonstrated his versatility and acting ability in roles ranging from Catcher Block in Down with Love to Joe Taylor in Young Adam. Then, in Fish, he tackled a somewhat Carrey-ish role in young Ed Bloom. However, Jim Currey would have probably overacted it.<br/><br/>Of the rest of the cast, Billy Crudup provides solid support to anchor the whole plot. His merely saying `Dad' draws a lot of empathy, underpinning a real world, to balance the exaggerated world of his father. I particularly like French actress Marion Cotillard who played Josephine. The father-daughter-in-law relationship, while delicate, can be really sweet, and Cotillard brought it out very nicely.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the characters in the unreal-and-yet-real world enrich the movie considerably. DeVito is always a joy to watch. Buscemi and Bonham Carter bring to live Specter Town. The giant is a real giant and the twins real twins (although not really linked). And we need not demand an explanation why nobody seems to have grown old in the funeral scene. The final reconciliation is quite symbolic in any case. If I have one beef, that is why does it have to be a car chase (not literally, just the speed), as in every Hollywood picture. In this particularly case, it has the strange effect of making the big gathering look like the ending of Cannonball Run (1981)."
"momofbcs-1","Null","4","6","11 January 2007"," Big Fish speaks of truth and eternity
","Big Fish is quirky, funny, and deeply moving with significant literary merit. If you understand how authors use symbols and metaphors to convey meaning, you'll have a rich viewing experience.<br/><br/>BF deals with profound questions: 1) what is truth? 2) Is man eternal? 1)The story revolves around a father who uses ""tall tales"" to communicate truth to his son. As his son grows up, he believes all the tall tales were total fabrications, creating alienation between them. By the end,(spoiler warning) the son is transformed, and is able to use the ""tall tale"" format himself to communicate truth. This brings reconciliation (he also discovers they were not a total fabrication). The message: truth is more than ""information."" Narration can convey profound truth in addition to narrative truth. In this respect, it is much like a Biblical parable. The parables are not historical truth, but they are truth nonetheless. Moral truth can be conveyed via narrative invention. In this sense it is what some modern critics call ""myth."" On another level, this aspect of the tale is a metaphor for what all authors of fiction do.<br/><br/>2) The ""big fish"" symbolizes the eternal part of the father. (Spoiler warning) As he prepares to die, he goes to the river--i.e., the boundary between this world and the next. As his son drops him into the water, he morphs into a fish, i.e., the physical part of him disappears and the eternal part is released. There is a tremendous amount of water-river-fish imagery, all of which points to the eternal part of man. He has two encounters or visions of partially-clad women in the water, symbolic of his wife's eternal nature (""my girl in the water""). This is not gratuitous nudity, but a vision of marital intimacy with the one person to whom the hero is powerfully committed for life, and an acknowledgment of her eternal nature."

It's the first movie I see with Alison Lohman, who is lovable and pretty.<br/><br/>Ed Bloom is sick and close to his death.

","Big Fish is a beautiful and sensitive piece of work, combining the trademark weirdness of director Tim Burton with the discovery of their true inner selves by both father and son. The cast is nothing short of impressive.... from Albert Finney as the father Edward Bloom, Ewan McGregor as the young Edward and the timelessly gorgeous Jessica Lange as the mother Sandra Bloom. Not to mention the surprise choice, French stunner Marion Cotillard as the daughter-in-law and the highly versatile Alison Lohman as the young Sandra. Even resident scene stealer Steve Buscemi makes an appearance, which further livens up the already excellent casting.<br/><br/>However, it is the relatively unknown Billy Crudup who left the greatest impression on me. As Will Bloom, his understated desire to be the filial son is often pecked back by his father's insistence of telling him stories that to him are merely exaggerated tales concocted by the senior Bloom. Will yearns for the truth, true facts that will enable him to understand the man he thought he never did. The most touching moment comes in the end when Will finally accepts his old man for the way he has always been. Will conjures up one last story on behalf of the dying Edward, a story befitting enough for the sending off of the master storyteller himself.<br/><br/>As touching as the film was, it somehow fails to reach the level of sensitivity shown in Edward Scissorshands -- to me, still the best effort from Burton. Perhaps it isn't fair to compare them because ES had THE two masters of weird, Burton and Johnny Depp, easily a perfect match to tell a perfect story. Big Fish certainly has the creative elements, if given a more consistent treatment, would no doubt have made it a more outstanding film that would've left a greater impact on audiences.<br/><br/>Who should watch: Those who want to sit through a good touching story with excellent and unique visuals <br/><br/>Who shouldn't watch: Burton fans who have set their expectations way too high since the 1st glimpse of his brilliance 15 years ago.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5"

","I haven't been this drawn to a film since I saw Edward Scissorhands in the theater. When the movie was over I was completely ready to go back to the ticket booth and buy myself another ticket for the next show. I would have if I had enough money to but $8.50/film is pretty steep. Tim Burton is nothing less than a genius. He is my favorite director ever and after viewing this film it made me realize all over again why I love his work so much. He has the ability to create such a fantastical world that you almost wish you could have been part of that magic. And Danny Elfman did an incredible job composing the music. He is a modern day musical genius. Him and Tim Burton make the best team in the history of cinema (in my opinion).<br/><br/>I can't believe this film was nominated for only one Academy Award. Blasphemous! It should have been at LEAST be nominated for 5! At LEAST! Best picture, best cinematography, best direction, best actor, and still including Best Musical Composition. Although I do have to admit Danny Elfman should have won a long time ago for Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, but the Oscars don't seem to actually care about talent. Anyways...aside from that...This film is truly wonderful and delightful and amazing and I HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend watching it! EsPECIALLY on the big screen! I, of course, gave it a 10/10 but would much rather give it an 11 because it's off the charts. :)"

","A fantasy film where telling tall tales should play right into Burton's strengths as a filmmaker. But for an imaginative film that relies on blowing the viewer away with fantastic scenes, I found it all too pedestrian and if you will...unimaginative. The storyline was slight and forgettable, and its sweating hard attempt to act the part of the aggressive traveling salesman to make me buy a product I didn't need with such a sugary sentimental pitch, never worked. After catching all those wild stories that blur the lines between reality and fantasy, with no tension coming forth and not anything real happening, I'm left wondering what it was all about. It would be too inane to believe that the filmmaker actually wants us to go for the bald-faced lie over anything real because it is so charmingly told, which is another way of adopting Hollywood's moneymaking code of giving the paying customers whatever they want as long as they feel entertained and the investors are happy with the box-office returns. But that is exactly what this film is about. Along with the superficial metaphors disclosed about death and love and an idyllic life, which are supposed to be poignant pronouncements for the film to cover-up all its emptiness and its attempts at doling out false hopes for those who buy into its premise."

I know nothing about this man except that he irritated his son. What did his wife think about his behavior? What about his sons very charming wife? Why did he make up these stories? Some sappy music when he died told me to be sad, and I learned that a fantasy life had a good side as well as bad.

","There's no harm in glorifying everything a little.. This is stressed in the scene where the doctor relates to will bloom the events as they happen at the time of his birth and then tells him people actually like the version that his father( Edward bloom) tells everyone that involves the story surrounding a big fish that invokes in people the interest to listen to the story of the otherwise not so interesting story of the birth of will.. This is the scene where the essence of the story lies.. The whole story is about the trade off between what actually happened in the life of Edward Bloom and what he tells everyone about his life. Everything he relates is the truth but not without a little glorification. Everyone except Edward's son seem to enjoy his stories while Will refrains from talking to his father because of his habit. But finally realizes that his father wasn't lying about anything and therefore starts liking him. The very last scene is the best scene by far in the story where we get to see the actual characters and we can make out the difference between the real life personalities and the ones in Edward's stories. The giant is actually around ten feet but in Edward's stories he is portrayed as a twenty odd feet giant which makes him sound dangerous.. Also the twins are actually not conjoined but in the story he describes them as having only two legs between them. This is by far Tim Burton's best film. The films draws comparisons with Forrest Gump in more ways than one. Both the stories are the biographies of diverse personalities. But one of it is glorified and the other is true both great in their own respects. Either watch the movie for its brilliance in creativity or watch it simply for the brilliant portrayal of the role by Ewan McGregor or watch it for its brilliant background score. If that is not reason enough to watch the movie you are missing out on something in life. This is a must-see movie is all i can tell. Enjoy!"

","Heartwarming tale that starts off rather awkwardly, but slowly picks up steam until the fantastic finale, which is executed very well and is surprisingly emotional. The frame tale of the father-son relationship is pretty weak, and slows the film down for much of it - partly due to Crudup's annoying character - but manages to evoke a sentimental reaction by the end. The fantasy elements of the tale range from innovative (the town) to dull (the romance), but all have Burton's signature touch. McGregor and Finney really carried the film, it's too bad that a large portion of it has to be focused on Crudup. Among the females, only Bonham Carter is memorable, as she is quite good in her dual role. There's some good supporting work from DeVito and Buscemi, and the visuals are frequently fantastic. A bit of a letdown, but still a good flick."

You garner no points on my scale by simply saying a movie has merit because its director has had some prior successes.

It moves away from his typically dark Gothic undertones and into whimsical fairytale land with giants, witches, Siamese twins, hidden cities, mermaids, sirens and werewolves, coating the film in a rich fantasy glaze, but it keeps its storyline grounded and simple throughout: it chronicles the life of Edgar Bloom (Albert Finney; Ewan McGregor) as he, on his deathbed, retells his experiences and stories for his son to mend their broken relationship.<br/><br/>This is one of the most beautiful, elegantly-crafted visual films I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Yet it is evident that Burton does not neglect other aspects of film-making by focusing too much on stylistic devices. He is, first and foremost, a storyteller and never lets visuals alone carry a tale; the visuals facilitate the story, and not the other way around. This is seen by the strong performances by the cast, and in particular, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney who both portray the lead of Ed Bloom at different periods in his life. They help carry the story, as do the unusual humour and the magical score by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Toward the end of Big Fish, I realised how smitten I had become with all the quirky characters, the central father-and-son relationship and the overdose of style that Burton presents--to the extent that I was sad when the film ended even though the conclusion was very satisfying. The film most probably has a few flaws (there were some segments that felt too long) and if you don't like strange or whimsical, then Big Fish isn't for you. <br/><br/>Lastly, anyone who likens this offbeat gem to the studio schmaltz that is Forrest Gump should be shot in the knees. <br/><br/>9/10"

I would say that these well known faces had no more than 15 minutes of screen time throughout the film but they were instrumental to the total performance: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter (Tim's main love in real life), Robert Guillaume, and Danny DeVito. If you have watched HBO's ""The Sopranos"" then you will also enjoy Steve Buscemi's (Tony Soprano's cousin Tony Blundetto) performance as Norther Winslow (although he has been in 89 films since 1984!).

What he comes to learn is exactly the opposite, which is that his father with his amusing yarns has been telling the world volumes more about himself and the real truth of his vision than any fact sheet could hope to reveal. In essence he's come closer to baring the inner dreams of his soul than most men do, no matter how ""honest"" they might attempt to be.<br/><br/>This is a Tim Burton masterpiece and a gem in storytelling in itself. Of course the trademark Burton visuals are here and never used to better effect and have never been more appealing. This one stands high right next to ""Scissorhands"" and ""Nightmare"" as a film that will mark Burton's place in film history. This one's a bona fide 10.

","In a time where the movies industry can build a 2-hour show with plenty of precisely timed plot twists and epic audiovisual effects it needs, at least, patience and courage to enjoy a film like 'Big Fish'. Tim Burton wishes to deliver a deeply human myth and begins his effort by the obvious trick: all tricks to the minimum! Even those used, are, more or less, a mere visualization of the spoken tales: how many times have you listened to your grandpa talking about his giant friend who could move heavy rocks (500kg each), or of his second friend who once caught a 10kg fish using his sardine fishing line?<br/><br/>The story behind 'Big Fish' has many readings. I used the word 'myth' because, in my opinion, Burton knows precisely what a myth IS and in the same time IS NOT. He can feel the simultaneous truth and lie behind the act of storytelling, which might be the essence of our civilization, or more accurately the essence of all mankind.<br/><br/>Pause your DVD a quarter before end credits and you will be disappointed. Fragments of stories, interesting but not connected tales, characters that are merely explained etc etc. Be patient until the ending and you will get wiser. Every loose element finds its position and there is not a 'solution', but more important, a FEELING that floods you and bears the key to the whole movie.<br/><br/>I will disagree with the rest of the comments in that the film is not only about a man that made his life. In the end, all the poles of the story find their opposites: father/son, myth/reality, family/individuality, utopia/feasible, destiny/self-control, discrimination and conduct/self-esteem and recognition. I think that the strong point of the movie is this feeling of reconciliation that floods its end. A situation where all the opposites don't claim their victory and prevalence over their counterparts but stand in a equilibrium that, essentially, is the essence of what is an everlasting myth."

","Tim Burton has completed his masterpiece. We see so much symbolism along with all the heartwarming messages. Ewan McGregor plays a man from a small town who sees a world that is so big and wants to explore and experience everything he can. Through many adventures, he finds hardship in some, but life changing experiences in all. Aside from the brilliant writing of the script, the use of color certainly boosts the viewers interest. I have watched this movie several times. Often, If I come across a friend or family member who has not seen it, I will set aside time to watch it with them to see their reaction. Everyone I have watched it with has truly enjoyed it...some more than others. But I would have to say, I recommend this film if you have not had the chance to see it."

","Well, I'm a fan of Tim Burton, I like almost all of his movies (except The Planet Of The Apes, which I appreciate but I don't like much), and let me tell you, that this one is probably one of his best movies, of course it doesn't reach the perfection of Edward Scissorhands (the best movie I've ever seen), but after seeing Planet Of The Apes, I was scared about the fact that Tim Burton would not be able anymore to make great movies, when I first saw Big Fish, my fear was gone, it is really, really great. It has the usual Gothic atmosphere of burton's movies, the same magic.

There are so many elements and levels here, but a real slow burner (which has put a lot of people off). A father-son film, my small son was cuddled on my lap when we watched this, which made it more meaningful.

They all find him to be fascinating in a way that makes one think that the filmmaker has as much touch with how real human beings act as the main character in this film appears to have with reality.<br/><br/>Of course I won't relate the ""touching"" conclusion, but my reaction at the end was ""Bah, I've wasted another two hours."""

","I guess expectations will get you more often than not. I'm a fan of much of Tim Burton's work, and the accolades declaring this to be a new ""Wizard of Oz"" were encouraging, but as it turns out, I was more entertained by that other recent film with the similar premise - Secondhand Lions.<br/><br/>
Big Fish started with promise as it sets up the metaphor and mythos of its story, but about halfway through it all becomes rather ho-hum. I like where Burton was reaching with this, which was higher than Secondhand Lions was reaching, but it really failed to resonate or captivate in the way it seems to try so hard to. Secondhand Lions knew it was a light comedy, seen from the eyes of a child coming of age, and it was successful in that sense. Big Fish didn't seem to know what it was... it wasn't really all that funny... or dramatic... or romantic... though it had slight aspects of each. And with the protagonist a jaded adult (Billy Crudup), it just wasn't as captivating to experience as compared to Haley Joel Osment's youth in Lions.<br/><br/>Some good performances, especially Ewan McGregor as the younger Edward Bloom, but unfortunately the film is nowhere near as entertaining or resonating as other Burton fare such as Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood. Hmm... Burton likes characters named ""Ed"", eh?<br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"dcobbimdb","Null","2","3","30 April 2004"," I don't see how this movie got an 8 out of 10...
","It would be strong to say that I hated the movie, and maybe my expectations were too high going into it, but other than the story being a pretty original idea, I didn't really like it and wasn't entertained much at all. I hadn't seen this in the theater and as soon as it came out on DVD I checked IMDB for ratings & reviews.  When I saw that it had got 8 out of 10 rating, plus it was a father son / fantasy movie, I raced over to blockbuster to rent it thinking for sure I would have liked it.  Sadly enough and to my surprise, it did nothing for me.  I did watch it pretty late in the day and found myself yawning and wondering when it would pick up, but in my opinion any good movie would keep me awake no matter what time I watch it.<br/><br/>As I said, it had a pretty original story, and the acting was certainly believable.  For me though I had a hard time just simply enjoying the fantasy and imagination of the stories and how they unfolded when instead I focused on the credibility of them and the damage it was causing to his son. Don't get me wrong I am a movie freak and my favorite movies are action, Sci-Fi, fantasy, and horror, so I depend heavily on the make believe.  I like a good drama too, but in this movie, I think too because I am a father, I sided more with the son in that, I just saw him as a terrible father, possibly terrible husband too.  I kept thinking to myself, now here's a guy who apparently wasn't satisfied with his normal life so he creates this second life, most of which is fantasy, but you don't really know which is fact and fiction.  But because he was a good story teller and such a social person, the stories were enjoyed by most rather than just passed off as a pathological liar.  I might have been able to get in the spirit of that, but his son resented him for it and I guess so did I.  I think too it struck to close to home for me as it reminded me partly of my own father in that I can't ask the guy what time it is without him telling me how to build a clock.  Or if I try to tell him about something, he'll interrupt me and go off on some tangent story himself.  Another pet peeve of mine is that it pains me to see parents mistreat there kids or tell them lies and from one perspective that's all this movie is about.  In one scene the son told his father that he didn't know anything about the real him because all he got were these fantasy stories rather than stories of how his father really was. And because he too was going to become a father he wanted his son to know the real him.  In this scene I cried out `Amen!'  But in the end (which was pretty un-climactic), because his father was dying and more or less to make piece with him, the son reluctantly told him a story of how he dies, or moves on I should say.<br/><br/>I guess another issue that bothered me was that the father was always seen as a man who was a good person and who helped others out because he was such a good person.  And here he ended up buying up a whole town (which appeared to be a true story) in order to preserve it.  But again rather than admiring him for that I kept thinking, that his son and wife never saw him because he was too busy working and keeping up this other life.  It's kind of like feeding others when your own family starves, and I guess that's the feeling that I came away with on this movie.  It shocks me quite frankly that it received 8 out of 10 as very few movies hit that mark.  I have thought that Tim Burton's past movies have been really good, this one just didn't sit too well with me.  But as it stands now, it's in the top 250 movies of all time (shocking), so it must be worth a watch.  Hope you like it and get more out of it than I did."

","Big Fish posits a strong ideal: that a story can be full of immense truth even if it never literally happened. Burton's Forrest-Gump-esque personal epic is his sweetest film, full of whimsical silliness and fable-like hyperbole. As a whole, the film never quite sinks into me the way Finney's stories do with his audiences, but it's still a good parable about living in the shadow of a larger-than-life character."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","1","21 June 2017"," Not Just the Facts, M'am...
","""Big Fish"" tells a story about a man who tells stories. I think we can do better. It's about an ordinary man telling extraordinary stories, thus being extraordinary by proxy. His name is Edward Bloom, a man who spent most of his life inventing tales about how he met his wife, how he proposed her, how he built his house etc. In fact, all the ""who"", the ""what"" and the ""why"" that cover the chapters of his life seem to drain their inspiration from tall tales and fantasy. It gives a man a certain charm, he's like an old grandfather whose rambling is easily forgiven, but the film presents him from the standpoint of his son Will (Billy Crudup) and he doesn't exactly share this view.<br/><br/>It's understandable because we've only met Edward (Albert Finney) for five minutes and he just told us a nice little story about a giant catfish he caught with his wedding ring, but the son heard it a thousands times, so much he can recite it, even tell it better than him. Will has had enough and can't stand the fact that his father would steal his thunder, the very day of his wedding, and to babble the same old story, over and over again. There starts a shift of three years, until he learns that Edward's at the verge of death, so he travels from France with his pregnant wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard), convinced that it's time to settle that old record. Will might not be likable but we kind of understand his troubles, it's not about the stories but what they hide. <br/><br/>Maybe Will hates his father's stories like people hated Ed Wood's films but Tim Burton, wizard of imagery and at times, storytelling, can turn any lousy premise into a beautiful and emotional experience. Maybe that's what Edward meant by sugarcoating or reinventing the things of the past. I'll make a chronological leap: near the end of the movie, Will hears the real story about his birth, and it's certainly less colorful and memorable than the way Edward Sr. described. it had the merit to be the truth. Will obviously loves his father but blames him for his incapability to make a distinction between what is true and what is not. Burton doesn't allow us to make the distinction either because the point is elsewhere, the frustration of the son is duly noted, but the trick is to lead him to reconsider his personal frustrations.<br/><br/>The movie, through regular flashbacks, enlightens us about the life and times of Edward Bloom, his younger self, played by Ewan McGregor. The story is obviously exaggerated, we don't really care because within the framework of the film, it's the only story we'll take for granted, especially since Will won't get many real ""versions"" apart from his birth. The film's premise is a real paradox, we know we don't follow Edward's story but his personal vision, from our perspective, it's ""his"" story because he's the storyteller.We're basically torn between the anger of the son who only wants to know what kind of a man his father was and our personal enjoyment that doesn't necessarily seek any truth, unless we would care for Will. <br/><br/>Obviously, Roger Ebert cared enough for Will so he was genuinely annoyed by the father and his wrestling with the truth, but Ebert must have been in a wrong day, because the point of the film is obviously to make us relate to Edward and accept our liberty to look at our lives with the narrative we chose. It's Burton's vision as it's Edward's, there are times though where Burton gets carried away by his usual tropes, the colorful suburban small town like in ""Edward Scissorhands"", the many encounters on which the hero's journey depends, a gentle giant, a circus ringmaster, Siamese twins, a witch, all played by endearing actors like Danny De Vito, Steve Buscemi,and Helena Bonham Carter, but there is something that remains oddly consistent: these lies have a purpose, they represent the way a man looks at his life, he manipulate the facts because he knows these facts will die with him, while stories will contribute to his own myth.<br/><br/>That's the key, that's the purpose of that ending where Will literally says ""the hell with it"", swallows his pride and 'take' his father to a last farewell ride. The emotionals raised at that moment has something that borrows from Spielberg's movies but it works because it finds the right touch, the son doesn't reinvent a story or make up an adventure from the scratch, he just takes his father to a last trip where he meets and says goodbye to all the people who populated his life and turns into that 'big fish"" he always mentioned in that ring story. This is not the son 'understanding' his father, Edward will always be a mystery, but it's the son loving his father enough to at least be part of the last thing that defined him, and maybe understanding him a little.<br/><br/>As a son, and also as a father, I could strongly emotionally relate to the film, because like I say sometimes, it's not about love and respect but understanding. So, on the surface, ""Big Fish"" is a colorful and visually entertaining picaresque journey of a man who found his destiny the oddest way, who told stories about his life and made it his reason to be, but beneath the surface, it's a poignant father-and-son story where the outcome is two persons finally coming to terms. <br/><br/>The film doesn't overplay the emotions and the visual delights and there's a simplicity in the story you want to fully embrace as if the right attitude was from the wives played by Jessica Lange and Cotillard, let the old fool have his dreams, and be fool enough to enjoy them. Isn't that what Cinema, or life, or everything about, suspension of disbelief."
"mayx-10208","9","1","1","19 April 2017"," An amazing tale or a normal truth
","Big Fish is a movie produced by Tim Burton, it ran in 12 December 2003 and stopped in 12 March 2004. The movie is adapted by Big Fish, which is written by Daniel Wallace. John August rewrote it into screenplay. The aim of the movie is to remind paternal love in people's hearts. I think the movie is good enough to be one of the most important movies in history.<br/><br/>The director, Tim Burton, had a tough period in childhood without enough parents' love. He had to stay in a small house with little information from outside. The most interesting thing that he could do was drawing pictures and watching horror film. He used to work for The Walt Disney Company but tried about Disney style of movie. Then he went to Hollywood and built his own style of movie. Most of Tim's movies are Gothic style, most of them talk about zombie, vampire, witch and strange animals. Big Fish hardly uses Gothic element and creates a peaceful environment. Father and son's relationship is the superficial story of this movie. But Tim Burton talks about freedom, lies and life's attitude in deep level through chief actor's whole life, a fish-to-fish life.<br/><br/>The Chief actor, Edward, was a salesman who always told amazing story to his little son: Will. One of the tales was that Edward caught a big fish in Will's birth. But Will was tired of father's story and left Edward after Will's marriage. Their following meeting was close to Edward's death. Because of many people's help, Will reminded the whole tale of his father. Edward was different since his birth. Because he knew his death, he did everything ideally without fear and hesitate. He found that the town was small and decided to go to the world outside. Edward met different kinds of people and things, one day he met Sandra and married with her. Then he was conscripted into the army. After his national service he became a salesman and left his home frequently. He went back to a town, Spectre, which he went before and decided to revive it. Back to real life, Edward was sent to hospital. Will went to the hospital and met a doctor, the doctor told Will the truth of Will' birth. The doctor asked Will whether a normal truth was better than an amazing story. Will understood his father and decided to finish Edward's life in a wonderful ending.<br/><br/>The weakness of Big Fish is that the pace of the movie is a little slow, some of people might feel boring at the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>The structure of first three fourths of this movie a little like another movie, Forrest Gump, and talks about the amazing life of Edward. But the meaning behind of life is different from Forrest Gump. Edward known he won't die before his true death, so he could do everything in full of his ability. But Gump had some problem in his intelligence, so he could simplify many difficulties in his own way. Edward's real life is hard, but he is optimistic and translate his life into many good tales.<br/><br/>The effect of Edward in will's life is very special. At Will's opinion in his childhood, Edward was a big hero and did plenty of adventure. But with time lapse, Will thought Edward was only a salesman with a life telling lies to others. During a dinner after Will's back to Edward's house, Edward found that will had already told everything to Will's wife, he couldn't attract her curiosity. Then Edward ate silently. This seemed Will's victory. But the heart of Edward was hurt deeply. Will's father reminds me another father: Guido. The effect of Guido to his son in La Vita è Bella is similar of Edward's, they both told lies to their son. But Guido succeed in protecting his son from Nazi's hurt, Edward failed to create a fairy tale world for Will. The life of Guido and Edward were tough, they used the best way to protect their son, telling lies. They were great and deserved the respect of audience. I think protecting parents' heart by believing their lies is the best way to repay their effort.<br/><br/>The image of fish is important. At the beginning of this movie, a big fish dived and met a hook. At the ending, Edward became a big fish in Will's arm in Will's tale. After Will's child talked about Edward's life, a big fish came out of the water in a moonlit night. Fish maybe referred to freedom and Edward got freedom with the spread of those tales.<br/><br/>Tim Burton became a father in 2003, the same year of Big Fish's ran. A son means a lot to a father, Edward warned will that the child is big trouble for parents in the movie. I believe that is the real feeling in Tim Burton' mind. The coincidence reminds me to another director, Hayao Miyazaki, and his movie: Porco Rosso. Hayao Miyazaki felt confused because of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and pressed a strong feeling about escape in Porco Rosso. But at the last part of the movie, the chief actor understood his responsibility and decided to protect lover in his own way. In real life, Hayao Miyazaki produced On Your Mark after Porco Rosso to express the willing of achieving dream. Then Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away came to people's life and changed many children's mind in many countries and regions. I think a series of movie means the life of director. With the experience of living with kids, Tim Burton might give us another surprise in the future.<br/><br/>In a word, I will give 8.5 of 10 for Big Fish, it deserves to watch especially when you stay with your family, especially with your father."

"SaarahN","8","1","1","15 August 2016"," Magical!
","This is a film about a young man, Will Bloom, who grew up with his father's stories. His father, Edward Bloom, is quite the storyteller, his stories are peculiar- magical! Though they have resulted in Will feeling as though he doesn't know his father- that his father is almost like a character in a fairy tale. It is to be expected since, Edward Bloom's stories revolve around witches, giants, creatures who are man by day, and wolves by night. And all these creatures, Edward Bloom, tells stories about, he also claims to have met them and, that they exist. Cute when you tell these stories to a five year old, but to a thirty year old? Not so much.<br/><br/>And so, Will is convinced that: 'A man tells his stories so many times that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way he becomes immortal.' Edward Bloom can tell the same story over and over, and Will is getting tired of all the silly stories. For, he is now presented with quite the challenge: to tell his father's story. His father is battling with cancer, and doesn't have a lot of time left. And Will is wondering what he will describe of his father, to his future children? He finds it near 'impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth."" But still, when he makes plans to visit his gravely ill father, it is with the intention of finally being able to understand him, even if his father doesn't always make sense.<br/><br/>This film touched a nerve with me. I'm the type of person who likes to tell children stories. The weirdest sort: from how animals speak English when people are sleeping, and the latest being that werewolves are real, as are vampires. I'm still trying to convince them of tooth-fairies. But I see little hope. How they believe in werewolves of all things, but not tiny flying people, is beyond me. Especially when they get a coin after every tooth. They have no such proof for the existence of werewolves! See why I see little hope? Anyway, I'm sure you've now concluded that I receive a great deal of satisfaction after successfully 'lying' to a child. Of course, when the child is older they'll tell the same lies-that I'm sure. But in some ways I feel like this is the sort of film that makes you guilty for all the lies you've ever told. I mean, what if my child grows up believing I'm nothing but a liar? That because all my stories were lies, that I too am a liar? Or what if I take a lie too far? Personally I don't see this happening, I am in a habit of forgetting whatever it is I lied about, but this is what Edward Bloom did with his son. Of course, this is a film based on a story. But it still raises a valid point.<br/><br/>But then, there's the flip side. The magic, the wonder, the incredible change in perspective: you have the power to change a child's life. All, by shaping just how they see the world. That's some power, and I'll like to put it to a good use. As Roald Dahl says there's magic in everything. So why can't we give our children a small peek at what they will one day find for themselves?<br/><br/>The film represents both sides: Will is the realist, he wants the facts. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And then there's Edward Bloom, he's the crazy storyteller who may just convince you his stories are more than stories. When their two perspectives meet, what will happen?<br/><br/>I recommend this film for parents to watch with your young children. For those times when you're struggling to have them believe in tooth-fairies! Maybe I just care too much since my own parents weren't much for telling stories, I was that kid who would look forward to the story telling sessions at school and shushing the others when they so much as whispered something over the teacher's words.<br/><br/>NB: I gave this film four stars only because it left me feeling a little confused at the end. So parents, be warned. But with children, I don't see how you'll have any problem! Well, in my experience."
"sdmeshotto","9","1","1","11 July 2016"," A Very Unique Film
","I just really like Tim Burton. Why? He makes movies that are different. Movies that don't follow the exact same pattern as every other movie. This movie is just one of his finest examples. With this movie, you just stay pleased the whole time you are watching it. Wonderful story telling. It's heart-warming, and typically I hate that type of thing in movies, but this movie makes it enjoyable. This is no action movie, I'm an action movie guy, but i love this movie. Ewan McGregor's performance just enhances the film even more, definitely his second most memorable role to me. The colors in this movie are bright and vivid during the story telling portions of the film, and I've always found that extremely appealing to the eye. Its a very adventurous movie. I mean it's hard to explain, because this movie is so unique. You just have to watch it for yourself. It's one of the best stand-alone movies I've ever watched."
"jaimerebo","8","1","1","3 July 2016"," Odd characters in extraordinary situations
","Legitimate daughter of her director, Big Fish is a film about odd characters in extraordinary situations, a summary of the magic of many fairy tales told throughout our childhood. Tim Burton, the father of unforgettable fantasies (Bettlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Sleepy Hollow) tells us the story of a common man who usually tells his son the most scarcely possible facts about specific situations of his life. <br/><br/>As time goes by, the child becomes a fully disappointed grown up who gets obsessed with finding the blurry line where the truth and lies meet. The camera on the other hand, is determined to show us pieces of a human being's fabulous life in the sunset of his days.<br/><br/>The magic and the setting which both appear with relative success throughout the entire story, would've perfectly had our blessing to pop up in each and every frame of the film. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the love story, the unforgettable characters, and it's thrilling ending (an unstoppable stream, a mix of both real and fictitious waters) are the elements that make us gasp and breath hard before the credits. Finding out that the man that we have been mistrusting for more than two hours is more clearheaded than we thought, and that he's given a desperately tender meaning to his life (he's not a liar nor a trickster, he just tends to exaggerate), fact that reduces any resistance, ennobles the tale."
"sharky_55","8","1","1","29 August 2015"," All the facts, none of the flavour
","The framing device of a father's tall tales is the perfect vessel for Tim Burton's Big Fish, which narrates the young life of Edward Bloom through a series of vivid vignettes segmented by the more mundane reality, where an elderly Bloom is at his last days. Albert Finney plays the ageing storyteller and is the best of the cast; his wheezing insistence in getting his yarns across is affectionate enough that you have to question Will's (Billy Crudup) distance at times. There's no such problems for the pregnant Joséphine, played tenderly by Marion Cotillard. She approaches Bloom with no such inhibitions and therefore their scenes are warm and satisfyingly sweet. The uncanny likeness of Ewan McGregor to a young Finney isn't the only similarity; there's enough nuance in the dying father's performance that shows hints of the amiable and adventurous young man that McGregor lights up the screen with. <br/><br/>In many ways Burton is allowed to run free with the flashbacks to Bloom's past because of the assumption of an unreliable narrator. The stories, like an elder's rambling, occasionally drift unto unfocused territory which lingers on the absurd, like the revelation of Danny Devito's character of a ringmaster to be a werewolf. You can erase that part and still have the respect between him and Bloom which eventually leads him to the young Sandra. Most of the time it works well, allowing Burton to deliver settings and characters that venture easily into fantasy and fairytale. The visuals shine most strongly in these segments. Take the wondrous and heavenly town of Spectre, perfectly symmetrical in its lines of buildings and picturesque with its highly saturated green lawns. It becomes even more beautiful at night, framed by a cluster of lights and that strange string of stolen shoes hanging overhead. Or maybe the endless sea of bright yellow daffodils that Bloom woos Sandra with. <br/><br/>It never gets too serious like a good bedtime story. The scale and terror of the Korean War is minimised to a small set where Siamese twins perform for the wartime troops while Bloom parachutes in to steal plans. It's bizarrely charming even through the broken Cantonese; instead of a gritty action sequence, McGregor pauses the scene for a second to take out his night-vision goggles, pulls the light string and a series of looney-tunes like sound effects serves his escape instead. You can't help but laugh. When Bloom struggles through a murky forest covered in spiders, the score turns ominous until he suddenly realises this isn't how he dies and he escapes casually. That later becomes the push for the penultimate scene where the father-son relationship is finally reconciled and Will takes on the mantle of the storyteller, finishing his father's life story. Elfman and Lebenzon work closely together here; the tender voice-over narrates the escape from the hospital, the score spirited and encouraging and urging them onwards. The fantasy sequence is warmly coloured and brisk while reality is colder, bluer and more intimate, as the close-ups dictate. <br/><br/>The most solemn and revealing scene however is the final one, the funeral of Bloom where the entire cast of characters from those tall tales end up being, well, not so tall after all (in Karl's case, quite literally). Burton lets us quietly contemplate in that instance, which perhaps makes that final voice-over grating when there's plenty of meaning and subtext in the children's gossip and that final shot of the enormous catfish. There's certainly little bits here and there in Big Fish that could be trimmed; Burton is at times guilty of using the storytelling device to showcase fantastic visuals but not actually show us anything new about our characters. Bonham Carter certainly doesn't need to play a double role, and Buscemi's character is peculiarly uneven (for once I would have preferred Depp, even with his marriage to Burton). But overall, Big Fish is a great and nostalgic viewing. The set design and cinematography perfectly capture the time period, the colours wistful and vivid and the architecture whimsy. Foregoing veracity is the right choice for this magical tale, because Big Fish becomes grandiose in its own little sphere, yet modest and intimate. Bloom is dying yet ironically more alive than any other character, living vicariously through the stories of the past. And we can easily join in."

","Bizarre and entertaining story about a son (Billy Crudup) trying to learn more about his dying father (Albert Finny) by piecing together the stories and myths he's heard his entire life, which eventually leave them estranged.<br/><br/>Tim Burton definitely brings the imagination to this and Ewan McGregor is excellent as the young William Bloom, can't fault his Southern accent or enthusiasm. Actually everyone involved in the ensemble cast is pretty good.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where you just go along for the ride, like Forrest Gump or Benjamin Button. you never know what's going to happen next or which strange and influential character will cross his path. The father-son relationship is bittersweet as he sets about trying to unravel fact from fiction and I loved the ending. Amusing and magical. 6/19/14"

","That was a lovely surprise. Another film on my Watchlist that I eventually got round to watching on a lazy day, not expecting much, but expecting something. But not what I got.<br/><br/>I guess I wasn't expecting the fantastical element - the flashbacks to a past life full of carefree and wondrous adventures. On the other hand, being directed by Tim Burton and with a cast including Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi, Albert Finney and Helena Bonham Carter, what else was there to expect? A straight story told my an old man to his straight son, in a straight up-an-down past? Hardly at all.<br/><br/>A well put together story in the vein of Forrest Gump - not quite at that epic level, but still a fascinating and endearing narrative, calmly told and full of hope.<br/><br/>There was nothing cheesy or overly exaggerated about a film which, in reality, is just a fabricated tale of events. Think about the Chinese twins at the end. Did you expect them to be joined at the hip, or not? I have no idea how much is true, exaggerated or completely fabricated. But I don't have a problem with any of that.<br/><br/>Is there an underlying message to this story? Will I be thinking about it in starts and fits in two or three days time?

I thought the movie was cute and quirky and I loved how people could interpret it in many different ways. There are many different stories that can mean different things to different people and the extent to which the father's stories are true are also up to interpretation. But every part seemed very well thought out and there was not a single wasted detail throughout the entire movie. Every detail tied into something important. The ending was nice and happy- I loved how the son finally understood his father in the end and realized that he is not an attention-seeking liar but a man who loves to tell entertaining stories!

"clopzat1","5","1","1","30 January 2013"," beautiful looking film fails to move
","Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"", like it's main character is extravagant, earnest, and likable. Unfortunately also like it's main character it is distant, narcissistic, and delusional. Big Fish has the wrong main character. The one emotionally resonant part of the film is unfortunately sidelined by acres of entertaining glitz. The story concerns the son of the main character {Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finny and Ewan Mcgregor} realizing how little he knows about his father who is slowly dying. That would be the emotionally resonant part of the movie. Unfortunately that is reduced to about 10% of the movies running time, the other 90% concerns the life of Edward which (like the movie) is pretty much 90% made up, hence the frustration of his son. Ideal there would have been a 50-50 balance between the real and the very unreal, though since that is not so it is often jarring when the story briefly switches gears to catch up with real life only to shift right back again. It's frustrating and unsatisfying. My thought is that Burton sees himself as Bloom, who refuses to conform to reality, in a sort of response to critics who have said that his films feel fake. I have always disagreed ( Edward Scisorhands and Sweeny Todd are masterpieces of time and place, anything but fake) though ironically this film feels at times kind of artificial. Not always though, and for the most part it's entertaining and thoughtful. With fine performances by everyone, all though Finny is sometimes garble voiced, and Marion Cotillard and Jessica Lange's characters are underwritten they do their best. Of course the film has a normally gorgeous Burton look to it, and he does a fine job of at least visually underlining the difference in feeling of reality and fantasy. Though by the time it's over your brain might be whizzing your heart will likely remain curiously untouched. At least I thought so. The ending however is pretty fantastic and would probably have had a profound emotional impact if Burton had decided to forgo some of the admittedly trite fantasy in favor of a a more full portrait of the relationship between the father and his sons. There is a heartrendingly real story in lurking Big Fish so it's a shame that Burton ditches it (until the end) for an amusingly fake one."
"diac228","9","1","1","15 May 2012"," The beautiful Southern Belle in Burton's entourage of films
","Tim Burton in recent years has dwelled into a very familiar look, a familiar style, and to an extent a familiar cast of actors and actresses that continuously follow the man's career. But in the midst of this consistent approach to directing films in the past decade is a movie so magical, so majestic and so unlike Burton you can hardly believe it was him behind the camera. That's because Big Fish is the most emotionally-driven tale he's ever done, and this requires quite a different tactic. Big Fish is his Schindler's List, a movie that emotionally touches home to not only the viewer but to the director making it.<br/><br/>Big Fish is about a wrecked father-son relationship that tries to heal before the father passes away. But the father continues to reveal himself through tall tale stories that blend tons of fiction with plenty of reality—although the son is determined to figure out the truth behind all the life stories. Based on a late 90s novel by Daniel Wallace, this movie follows the life of the father (and all his crazy moments) leading up to the present with him inches from death.<br/><br/>Argue what you will about Burton's look, his selection of actors has always been superb and it's no different here. From the young Billy Crudup and Ewan McGregor running the show to great smaller performances by Jessica Lange, Helena Bothman Carter and Albert Finney we have ourselves a great cast representing a great group of characters we can easily grow to love and associate with.<br/><br/>While Burton has divulged into the typical dark Gothic look with dark gloomy backgrounds and dark gloomy material, Big Fish's Southern Gothic roots demanded a different look. And this is where Burton excels in more ways than one. The visual effects blended with the story quite well, the imagery was a beautiful mix of warm, dark, and downright colorful, and the cinematography made Alabama shine beautifully in ways that not even Forrest Gump could achieve.<br/><br/>Beautiful is the best way to describe Big Fish; from the writing to the acting to the overall look and feel. It tackled the father-son dynamic extremely well, flowed peacefully without ever feeling boring, and kept your interests and emotional investments nice and high up until the very end.<br/><br/>While overall this will never go down as his most popular or more iconic movie, I can and will safely say that this is one of his best films and easily his best directing performance he's ever going to deliver.<br/><br/>And unless he can learn to expand his directing horizons, this will remain true."

Danny DeVito, Jessica Lange...a cast that is at its, their best being incredible. Billy Crudup might be the most underrated actor of his generation, and he doesn't disappoint in this role. It's a fairy tale sort of. Maybe not. It's a fantasy or many fantasies or a big lie or the hard truth about a father and his son. Their journey together or alone through their life. Lot's of tales told by a master. Lot's of questions and doubt from his son. Great tales though. Incredible stories. Unbelievable characters. Or are they? I don't know how to explain this movie. Let's just say that when it ends, you just might find yourself wanting it to start all over again. Not because it has any kind of socially redeeming message or is to difficult to understand. Far from it. But simply because it is almost impossible to get the grin off your face and you just don't want that magical feeling to end."

","Tim Burton always produces remarkable motion pictures, whether they're ultimately that good, or not. With 'Big Fish', with its fluorescent colours and lovable weirdness, some critics have dared say that it's not very good.<br/><br/>A few of the parts on their own are a little iffy but it's the huge scale of extraordinariness that verges into Terry Gilliam's territory and the way they unfold that literally takes one's breath away. In the best Tim Burton way, the surprising turn into something even more surprising, letting our imagination run riot. He doesn't even seem to rely on CGI - just look at all those individual daffodil flowers and that bright green lawn, where you think you can see where the turf has been stitched together.<br/><br/>Those of us used to Ewan MacGregor being in Trainspotting, might find it difficult to adjust to this naive and often seemingly rather simple fellow with his quite strong American drawl of an accent. Having Albert Finney play him in later life seems more natural somehow as he seems like an eccentric granddad, telling us all these very tall stories. Helena Bonham Carter is cast to type as a sort of modern witch and possible love interest for MacGregor and is as good as she always.<br/><br/>The in's and out's of the story are too complex to write with any brevity and in any case are best left for the viewer to experience as they let the film unfold. The way I saw 'Big Fish' was as a fairytale for adults, with adult-ish themes plus all the wacky weirdness of Tim Burton."
"valadas","8","1","1","1 April 2012"," Big lies great truth
","A poetical movie mixing reality and fancy so well and effectively that we cannot say where one ends and the other begins. Albert Finney makes a splendid role as a father telling his son stories of his life where he mixes real facts and events with fanciful narrations full of poetry and romanticism. The story begins when the already adult son is called from France to come near his dying father's bed and begins to revive all those stories that filled his childhood but had ended up by revolting him against what he later began to consider a pack of lies. But now he realizes that he doesn't know his father well and he approaches him willing to know really what and who he is indeed below the top of the iceberg to which he thinks he can compare his father's moral appearance and thus reach the true nature of his personality. It's a very beautiful story in itself and the fancy included in the father's tales are beautiful too both visually and in words. All the performers do an excellent work personifying charming characters. A landmark in the history of recent cinema indeed."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","1","13 December 2011"," Destiny in the witch's eye
","With Burton, it has always been a propensity for telling stories that drives his films. He surrounds this with a kind of wondrous imagination derived in a slick manner from old horror movies, a commercial imagination if you ask me, but which often dazzles attention away from the real design of the thing, which is a story at the center. He is the most successful when he can align these, visual outer layers and storytelling mechanisms, when he can devise ways to point at some kind of maker folding the elaborate origamis that we experience decorating the surface. <br/><br/>So, Beetlejuice, with the nightmare world nested in the attic; Ed Wood even better, a subtler kind of magic, with the visionary maker marshaling movie characters into a fiction that does not matter how cheap as long as it creates real bonds that enrich lives, the real magic hiding in the shared passion for adventure. And this, perhaps the most direct of all.<br/><br/>So again at the center we have a storyteller weaving fanciful episodes involving kind giants, dark woods, the circus, a wartime adventure. It is all shaped around a singleminded devotion to discover and hold onto the love of a lifetime, love as destiny, this is the precious knowledge he is trying to impart from his deathbed. Of course we are seeing the whole through the eyes of the son, a journalist, a cold pragmatist, himself a storyteller from facts, at first outright disbelieving but gradually coming to unfold the wondrous origamis for some truth of their maker in the pattern.<br/><br/>The son himself is coming into a life that is mirrored from the one narrated from, newly married, awaiting his first child. <br/><br/>The idea is that there is truth at the heart of fiction, always has. We fold the real world into a more elaborate version of the mind, the truth being this; the hard facts alone would not do, it is the adventure of discovering for ourselves that has the power to impart some essence or wisdom. It needs to be our journey in these shoes. From our end, we have to learn to not merely think, but to embody, to situate the world at the heart.<br/><br/>It is an essay on how to engage fiction, the film itself, in order to be enriched with a love that is true, the essay nested as our effort to apprehend the tall tales. We make the discovery with the son. <br/><br/>Eventually it was all true, or so it goes in the film, this is a major blunder on Burton's part trying to directly address our inner child, when the point is to cultivate an openness of seeing that would allow us to abstract what matters. So the giant was as we imagined him to be, the circus owner, the twin singers except no longer conjoined. Seeing truly, this part collapses. No doubt, he trusted us to have invested enough emotion by then to not pay any mind.<br/><br/>Overall it is not a bad film to absorb, even if the way Burton has made it we'd rather spend time inside the fantasy; real life is bleak, but also badly integrated with the other segments, each segment badly integrated with the rest. As a result, it feels longer than it is. It feels syncopated, always starting again from where we'd left it.<br/><br/>Still, if you feel you have sufficiently absorbed this, made your own, freely traveled back and forth, got to know that the person is not telling the stories but the other way round, you are ready for bigger, more challenging adventures at the hands of more eloquent makers, more talented folders of visual origamis; start with the great Raoul Ruiz who recently passed away, and move backwards to Wojiech Has where the blueprint of fiction is metaphysical, Welles as an inspiration for both."

","Big Fish should be filed under 'what could have been'. Having been a big Tim Burton fan in my formative years, having loved Batman and Beetle Juice in my early teens and then growing into Ed Wood later on, my interest was dwindling with Sleepy Hollow and turned into real concern with Planet of the Apes. Out of nowhere came Big Fish - which seemed to signal a complete shift for Burton. He was finally growing up, rebelling against his own predictability and the style that he himself created and single-handedly turned into a cliché. On Big Fish he was reinventing himself and recreating himself as a legitimate filmmaker. Sadly, it remained a completely solitary incident. Burton sunk further back into his own clichés and never once created anything as fresh as Big Fish since.<br/><br/>And so, Big Fish must be considered as a film by its own right, rather than a transitional step in Burton's filmography; and when seen as such, it's revealed as a gorgeous film, a drama/fantasy combination that's considerably more positive and whimsical than comparable films like Heavenly Creatures, The Fall and Pan's Labyrinth, all of which use the fantasy in the darkest ways possible. In Big Fish the fantasy isn't about escaping from horrible reality - it's to enhance a ""regular"" reality, to make it more interesting and more spectacular. In a way, it's about the very essence of storytelling, and by extension, of filmmaking, which may explain why it's Burton's most emotional and personal movie - since Edward Scissorhands, at least.<br/><br/>Burton's knack for visuals is obviously on display here too, but for once it's not the main attraction. Big Fish is gorgeously shot, the lighting and coloring construct the mood, but this time the characters are the centerpiece - the characters, astonishingly, not the actors (looking at you, Johnny Depp), because not one of the actors actually delivers a shattering performance (Albert Finney is the best one, as well as the only one who makes the fake accent work) but the characters are all remarkably memorable, and the credit should go to the cast but most of all to Burton. It's shocking that he could ever make a movie as emotionally potent as Big Fish, and sad that he never tried to repeat it.<br/><br/>You can completely ignore the fact that Burton directed this; if you hadn't been told, it's possible that you'd never notice. Just sit back and enjoy a beautiful, touching, sad, hilarious, magical story, and be glad that someone talented took the time to make it."

","Tim Burton is a genius, with a child like imagination that translates onto the big screen blissfully. Big Fish is an incredibly imaginative portrayal of the book version, with a refreshing style, and beautiful cinematography. Big Fish is a movie that takes you on a dream like trip through incredibly unique worlds. This is a movie that really sucks the viewer in, allowing them feel every emotion, and inspiring them to never give up their ability to imagine. <br/><br/>The casting was incredibly well done. Helen Bonham Carter, just as she is in all Tim Burton films plays her characters wonderfully, giving us her dark side, and her light side. Billy Crudup was an excellent choice for the bitter son of Albery Finney. Ever since seeing him in Without Limits, I have really appreciated his acting. His frustration with his fathers overactive imagination and his search for answers runs smoothly with the fantastic plot of this story. <br/><br/>We also are lucky enough to catch glimpses of Steve Buscemi, Missy Pyle, and Danny Devito who really fit in with the feel of this film. <br/><br/>If you want to laugh, even cry, and ultimately be inspired, this is the movie for you. It will leave a mark on you and you will keep coming back to it. It begins well, and ends perfectly. I recommend this movie to everyone!"
"bostic06","10","1","1","6 November 2010"," Amazingly creative and carefully portrayed
","Big Fish is a timeless film. The story of a struggling father/son relationship can be had in any family, past, present, or future. Director Tim Burton does an amazing job combining humor, wit, and emotion in this film to create characters that almost anyone can relate to. Will Bloom, played by Billy Crudup, and his father Edward Bloom, played by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, have a chemistry throughout the film that is enthralling. The relationship they build and portray is believable, realistic, and genuine.<br/><br/>As the story begins, we learn that Edward Bloom is quite the story teller. His embellishments are the reason that his son feels he never really had the opportunity to learn who his father is. Edward's extraordinary stories are portrayed as flashbacks as he recounts the remarkable events of his life to his pregnant daughter in law, Josephine (Marion Cotillard), as he lies sick in bed. He tells tales of how he met his beloved wife, Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange), and of his adventures as a traveling salesman, that which include giants, two headed women, werewolves, and a bank-robbing poet. These tall tales build Edward Bloom into a lovable character and make us want his failing relationship with his son to work out, but for this to happen, Will must first learn to not take life so seriously and accept that sometimes, the big-fish tales can be healthier for the soul than reality and facts. A second theme in Big Fish is that of unconditional, nonjudgmental love. Will must learn that he does not need to change his father and instead, should accept him, because the stories may not be as embellished as Will believes. Comparable to the main theme in Little Miss Sunshine, this theme resonates with the idea that pure, honest love is unrestricted, unreserved, and tolerant.<br/><br/>Beyond the basic elements of film, this movie illustrates unique techniques to depict the storyline and themes. The texture of the film is distinctive to Tim Burton. The flashbacks of Edward Bloom's life have a surreal, fairy-tale dream feel to them. While most films subtly walk the line between fiction and reality, this film visually embraces it. In the scene where young Edward first sees his future wife, a modified freeze frame allows us to focus on Edward's thoughts and emotions as he approaches the girl of his dreams, only to be snapped out of it as time races to catch back up. This scene begins Edward's reckless journey to find his true love. Another cinematic device used in this movie is voice over. The use of voice over in this film is vital to the storyline. Since a number of the scenes are stories that are being told, the voice over narration helps transition between scenes and gives essential background information. The film begins as being told by Will as the story of his father, but after the intro scene, the remainder of the narration is by Edward, until the final scene, where Will again narrates the final story. This final scene is when Will realizes that the tall tales truly are an amazing, powerful part of his life.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a heartwarming film. The combination of real life conflict and dramatic fairy-tale stories is touching and uplifting. It also is a wonderful reminder that acceptance, approval, and abandon can enrich all of our lives."

","A charming tale from Tim Burton but without really any of his characteristic demented element that I think most of us expect from him. A personal yet utterly universal, and near-perfect Tim Burton's film, that ""celebrates the one's right to be different.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's films have always carried a similar theme: a stranger in an average world. Big Fish is his both his attempt to reverse this theme and his masterpiece. As the main character peels back the layers of his father's deceptive past, the viewer gets closer and closer to the warm heartbeat of Big Fish. A place where dream characters are introduced into reality, and places in reality are so hard to find in your dreams. Beyond the magical story itself, the film has a sort of magic of its own as the film continuously takes shortcuts but arrives at moments with enough weight behind them that you think the whole film was about it, when in reality it was merely built up for 5 minutes. So is the way of dreams, hard to understand, but sometimes feel much more real than anything we ever experience in our waking life<br/><br/>10/10"

I haven't read the novel too, but the movie is at its best in showing the entire fiction in the given 125 mins. The credit may go to two people, Tim Burton and Ewans, who are really behind the success of the movie. Both have done their best. The other key thing which also has contributed to the movie's success is the back ground score of Danny Elfman, who has really made the audience taste the ambiance of the whole scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is combination of Art, Fantasy and Music.

","If this is Tim Burton's apology for the pretty awful ""Apes"" then any fan will surely forgive him completely. This daring, highly stylized fantasy is everything I ever loved about his movies.<br/><br/>The driving force of Big Fish is its characters and the casting is simply superb. Finney's scenes were apparently filmed first, allowing McGregor to watch and assimilate some of his mannerisms into his younger portrayal. Crudup is able to amply portray the Will's frustration as he finds himself unable to connect with his father. And the resemblance between the wonderful Lange and Lohman as the younger and older versions of Edward's wife is uncanny. McGregor is particularly successful in walking the same fine line as the story itself, balancing between the real and unreal without ever seeming absurd or silly. Will's wife is an especially beautiful character, being both the perfect wife and a charming fresh audience for Edward's anecdotal stories, he brow knotting prettily in concern as he tells the delightfully twisted tale of the prophetic crow. The performances are all heartfelt, but McGregor manages to blend this with Burton's quirkiness perfectly.<br/><br/>I follow Burton since Vincent(1982) and I honestly think that Big Fish represents Burton's most mature and personal work to date. Perhaps it marks a new and more honest direction for the director, but it certainly ranks among his best with it's delicately balanced poignancy and humor."

","Tim Burton continues to prove himself as a creative genius in Big Fish. His imagination is realized in the form of magical creatures and fairytale plot lines as a young man, Will Bloom, embarks on a journey in an attempt to capture the essence of his terminally-ill father's (Ed Bloom's)life.<br/><br/>Unsatisfied with the stories his father had told him about his young life, Will had severed all ties with his father, believing that such stories were for children, and he was no longer a child. When his mother (Sandra Bloom) had notified him of his father's condition, Will and his wife Josephine come to make a final visit, and even on his death bed, Ed continues to tell his son the same stories, and Will continues to feel the disappointment of being lied to, which inspires him to find the truth for himself.<br/><br/>In a colorful, magical world of circus creatures, Ed befriends werewolves and giants, finds and pursues the love of his life, and strays from the beaten path more than once, which inspires those who watch the movie to rise above the typical and make their own world a fantasy land.<br/><br/>The underlying clichÃ© of a ""big fish in a small pond"" is what leads to the touching culmination of the film when, as Ed is about to die, Will carries his body to the pond, where he swims away and, as if to say a final goodbye, leaps into the air as an enormous fish before the funeral scene begins. The symbolism is almost too much; the wonder it stirs about if after death there's a larger pond for everyone is enough to leave one to reflect on his own life."

","Of entire thing I got to say this - I love this movie. And it is really head to describe how good this film was.<br/><br/>This movie is about life, love and friendship told in the most magical of way. A story of a son tries to reconcile with his dying father by trying to retrieve the stories that his father used to talk about himself and his unbelievable adventure.<br/><br/>I must admit at first I have doubt if I'm going to see this or not since it seem pretty dreadful and also there not much of anything show or word of mouth saying much about this film. Three years later I finally got to see it, I feel like I was wasting all those times not getting to know how brilliant this film was.<br/><br/>This film is great in everyway from the very second the film start to the very last second the film end. It will fill you with lots of emotion, dream, mythical adventure, and an art of storytelling. I must praise screenwriter John August to be able to bring all that into the screenplay making this one of those rare screenplay that surpass its novel.<br/><br/>Another thing that really standout is the cast of the entire brilliant actor, Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney was so believable that they will make you cry. And Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange is so look-alike and they are so good. And it is great to see Helena Bonham Carter with a blonde hair. That make up is great and the costume is beautiful. And what best is the acting that is very believable and very emotional that they will make you cry and feel for each and every character.<br/><br/>What another point that I like about the film is the fact that this is unlike anything that Tim has done before but somehow he still able to make it his own. The magnificent set, the style of the film and mood are very much his own. Maybe also it has something to do with the great score that add lots of mood to the movie.<br/><br/>The movie consists of great number of metaphor, which is another thing that I like about this movie. There is a meaning to everything and it has been written beautifully and directed brilliantly. This is a truly a must own movie.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Yes, Worth Every Penny To Buy DVD.<br/><br/>Reason To Watch: Imaginative, Brilliant Writing, Great Directing and Acting.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: You'll Left Wonder How The Hell This Didn't Get Any Oscar For It.<br/><br/>Rating: 10/10 (Grade: A+).<br/><br/>Please Rate After Read Y/N, Thanks."

","Initially I wasn't enjoying this film; the characters I was meant to like I didn't, and the characters I was meant to dislike I liked (poor old Don Price, what did he ever do?). But this changed as the tall tales progressed. To be sure, there's nothing surprising about the direction it heads in and the conclusions it reaches; you always know that eventually all participants will agree that if the legend is more exciting than the truth then print the legend. But there's something in the telling that makes the trip enjoyable, and like any tall tale this one may just improve with a few more retellings. This is a film about a man whose recollections of possibly dull encounters become taller and taller with each telling. I have a friend like that."

","Watched this somewhat reluctantly with wifey. Beforehand thought it looked a bit wish-washy, plus I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan. Glad i saw it.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Ed Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney). Ed, according to his stories, has lived an amazing, basically unbelievable life. In his travels he tells stories of giants he has befriended, finding a magical town, joining the circus to met his wife and so on. His son decides one day to start searching for the truth- are all his stories tall tales, is their some truth amongst them, or are they all as told? The movie unfolds really well, McGregor and Finney both do a great job. To my surprise it held my interest, and at stages amazed with the excellent cinematography. Worth seeing. My friend Gary won't like though."
"mstomaso","9","1","1","16 June 2005"," Delightfully bittersweet fantasy
","This may be my favorite of Tim Burton's films. It's a clever, literary, memoir about a man who embellishes his life with fantasy and his son, and how they come together at the end of his life to reconcile the tall tales that weave the tapestry of his life. It's also a story about parental bonds, and learning to love as unconditionally as a parent may.<br/><br/>Albert Finney is remarkably moving as the father in his old age, with Ewan McGregor playing the fantastic flashbacks with equal skill. The cast is excellent all around, the cinematography is - as with most Burton films - lush and gorgeous, and the story is endearing. Some may find the pace a little slow, but trust me, it's all very worth it in the end.<br/><br/>Billy Crudup plays the son of Ed Bloom, an all American boy who has lead a charmed life. Bloom has created fantasies to embellish every major event in his life and does not distinguish them from reality. His son, who feels alienated by his father's penchant for tall tales, wants desperately to know his father before he passes on, but must slowly come to realize that he already does.<br/><br/>While not entirely light-hearted, this is a very entertaining and good feeling film, which touches emotional depths that Burton's work rarely reaches. I recommend it without reservation to anybody who wants a bit more than simple entertainment."
"aequitasveritas311","Null","1","1","14 February 2005"," Visually stunning, wondrous and charming.
","When I first saw this film, I was completely blown away. Ewan Mcgregor was perfect for the role, because he has a boyish quality that comes through in such characters as this. The different periods of the life of one man are seen with the progression of one town, certain tall tales, and mythical beasts. The conjoined twins were a nice touch, as well. The town of Spectre (spelling?) was a wonderful idyllic place, which represented the innocence of the main character. With the different stages of his life, it underwent certain changes. At the end, it was gone. Danny DeVito as a werewolf was exceptional. It was a great image, seeing him coming out of the woods with a stick in his mouth... Parts like that made me laugh out loud. There were parts that made me cry, as well. I am not really a sap, except for certain things (I can't hear Kermit the Frog sing the Rainbow Connection without bawling), but I could not contain myself when the son was telling the story. The old man reminded me of my grandfather, and his performance was so touching, I could not keep myself from crying when I thought of it. So, when I say the movie was visually stunning, I mean that it was a film chock-full of giants, monsters, impossible feats of strength and ego, and an entire field full of daffodils that won a beautiful woman's heart. When I say that the film was charming, I mean that the performances of the actors and actresses were carried off splendidly, and that the director (nods to Mr. Burton) was in top form. In short, any faith lost after a certain pongid-ridden film was restored with plenty to spare."

","Big Fish is another great film from the genius director Tim Burton, who has made such great films like Batman, Beatlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. Tim Burton's films are conceived differently by certain people. Many people love his movies, but some think he's too bizarre and others just don't bother with his movies because they think the idea is too stupid. Those people don't understand the concept of Tim Burton's movies. His movies are kind of odd on the outside, but they have a great message deep inside. That is what it takes to appreciate his newest film Big Fish.<br/><br/>Big Fish is about an older man(played by Albert Finney) who tells stories about his life. These stories seem very far-fetched, but are true deep inside. This man's son doesn't believe these stories and is seeking to find the real truth behind them. While doing so, he realizes that sometimes it takes imagination and creativity to appreciate the message behind it.<br/><br/>In Big Fish, there is a lot of imagination and brilliant visual effects, as well as great acting and a good message. Before I saw this movie, somebody told me it was very odd. It is a different kind of movie, like all of Burton's other movies, but being odd isn't always a bad thing.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend Big Fish to anyone. If you experienced this movie the way many others have, then it will change the way you look at the world around you."

","What a movie. I am not entirely sure what I was expecting considering this is a Tim Burton movie, but I was drawn to it since it stars Ewan MacGregor and Albert Finney.<br/><br/>What I found was a surprise. Although it packs the usual Burton bizarreness, it contained a lot of simple family drama, and in particular analysis of the ever present Father-Son relationship issues.<br/><br/>It struck me that the usual bizarre facet to Burton didn't end up controlling this movie, nor did it overpower the sections which contained it. In fact in the context of the story they were very accessible and unintrusive, and more to the point they were extremely relevant to the plot.<br/><br/>The tall tales were very much part of the story, part of the Fathers life, and this is what the Son could never understand. He felt he didn't know who his Father was, and to an extent he never. However the conclusion and how the story comes to it's double end is wonderfully satisfying, and for a man who has experienced any similar type of relationship (which could be high in the 90% mark I would think) very, very moving. I was so moved I was bubbling like mad! It's also interesting how you travel on this journey through the movie. When it began I was struggling with the story and felt very much outside it with the movie failing to pull me in. Little by little however, it did, and before I knew it I was enjoying each of the little quirky tales of the Fathers past and looking forward to the next.<br/><br/>The performances are very good, from MacGregor and Finney in particular, Jessica Lange also puts in a wonderful performance with little words, but pulling off a very natural and strong performance, it's hard to believe how beautiful she still looks, stunning."

The motions and scene shifts, the colors, the vibrancy, created a magical sort of feeling. Billy Crudup, handsome as ever, seemed perfectly made for the role of pissed-off son. His wife Josephine, seemed a little one-dimensional in the beginning, but by ten minutes into the movie I was in love with her, too.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS HEREIN.*<br/><br/>Albert Finny's Edward Bloom was spectacular. His portrayal of a dying, pouchy old man, coming to the end of a life, was so accurate I felt myself wishing for a different ending. And Jessica Lange, as his beautiful wife Sandra, practically stole every scene she was in.<br/><br/>But the best part of this film wasn't the scenery, or the characters, although both were phenomenal. It was the plot, the mystery. One man's life--- born and raised in a small Alabama town, going through the war, meeting his wife in college, building a family together, working as a traveling salesman in the south--- a fairly mundane life, at face-value, became something transformed. He told the tales of his life with unbelievable characters. People he'd met throughout his travels became giants, conjoined twins, werewolves, witches, the entire amazing gamut. I was transfixed with the story, reading between the lines, trying to see the truth in the magic mythology. I was right there with Will Bloom, the son, as he tried to sift through the entrancing tales and see the truth.<br/><br/>When the reality was finally told, the characters revealed to be who they really were, I was blown away. Staring, wide-eyed, a smile on my face, I felt like I was coming to the end of a beautiful, circular mystery, filled with light and sound and magic and surreal images.<br/><br/>I thought his stories, the little anecdotes he told, were actually pretty entertaining. The one about the crow's dream telling him his father was going to die was hilarious. While definitely a lie, I found myself laughing.<br/><br/>This film is excellent. It's a little weird, if you aren't used to inexplicable things, but I loved it for that very reason.<br/><br/>At the end, I was disappointed to see the credits roll.<br/><br/>My recommendation: See it if you think you can appreciate strangeness and beauty together.

The softness of the color tones set the mood for the whole movie. The brightness in the flashbacks symbolize the happiness of that time. The somber tones of the reality signify the distress of the present time. The movie over all is excellent. The editing was excellent as well. The way that they break up the somber mood of the present with the whimsical flash backs causes the watcher to feel the moods strongly. Jessica Lange does excellent work at portraying emotion on camera. I suggest everyone see it at least once."

","At first I just saw the movie as really good. It entertained me while I began to wind down from a sunny summer Sunday of church, friends and bike rides. Then I began to look deeper. Just below the murky surface of the Mississippi river. I began to see more than just a grand tale. There is something fishy about this story. I began to ask myself some questions.<br/><br/>
Do we sometimes take life a little to seriously? Do we ever leave out details that are important to save time? Is it sometimes hard to tell the whole truth? For me all these things are true. Big fish isn't just a fish story. To me, it's about loosening the firm grip on the facts and just having a good time with a story. Learning how to truely live. Making people smile. A really good tale can do all these things. You'll see... In the end. :)"

","In short, one of the best films I have ever seen. The story is funny, but not comic and very touching, but not sad. It caught me from the beginning and held me, captivated, through the end. The distinctions between reality and fantasy are clearly defined and beautifully intertwined. I should think that all who see this film, with the exception of the young perhaps, can relate to some our all of the emotional aspects behind the story. In fact, the film has made me anxious to read the novel. Having not read the novel I can only comment on the story itself and hope that the screenplay represents as much depth as I anticipate that the novel will. The cinematography is stunning and at times breathtakingly beautiful. The acting is superb, especially from Finney and McGregor who complete the main character both precisely and with supreme conviction. The entire cast simply fit in to the story, made it real and brought it to life. The direction? Well it is Tim Burton after all and that is what really drew me to see the film in the first place. So being a fan I can't say that my opinion would be completely objective but I believe this to be perhaps his best work to date, in the commercial realm at least. Well done once again, Mr. Burton! This film, much as the life of the main character, will live on for a long time. I certainly will carry this story with me, like a few of the more flamboyant and colorful people in my life, in my heart until I can't remember anything anymore."
"kedunlap","8","1","1","1 May 2004"," Outstanding, in spite of ...
","I did not care much for the performance of Ewan McGregor and I am not a fan of Albert Finney.  In spite of that, I thought the movie was absolutely outstanding.  My wife and I watched ""Love Actually"" the night before and after seeing ""Big Fish"" we had no doubt that we saved the better for last. Perhaps, for those who didn't care for it, a certain amount of experience with people you don't care for until you come to understand them and then realize how nice they really are helps.  The fact that it reminded me of my dad who passed away several years ago and whom I miss very much made the ending more poignant for me.  But, I liked the movie before that.<br/><br/>
In a way, the movie was a bit of a mystery with the viewer trying to figure out just what was true and what was not as the story progressed.  Such clues as the fact that older Ed was always thirsty, which implied that the fish story was more significant than the others, and the obvious significance of the town of Specter gave the viewer a lot to think about.  I think that for me, trying to solve the riddle was what held my attention: and then, given all that, the ending made perfect sense."

"CitizenCaine","8","1","1","21 April 2004"," One Of Burton's Best
","Along with Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, this is Tim Burton's best film. Big Fish is a whimsical story about one Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, as the elder Bloom & Ewan McGregor as the younger Bloom), who goes through life experiencing fantastic adventures and spinning yarns taller than an Iowa cornfield. His son Will Bloom, Billy Crudup, has grown tired of his blow-hard, social bore of a father, but he returns to see him after several years at his mother's request (Jessica Lange as the elder Sandra & Alison Lohman as the younger Sandra). Edward Bloom proceeds to spin his yarns once again during this visit, but with revelations Will has yet to grasp. Burton cuts loose with several colorful, extraordinary set pieces, many reminiscent of scenes in his previous movies: Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, and Sleepy Hollow. The casting is extraordinary with McGregor and Lohman perfect replicas of Finney and Lange. Helena Bonham Carter is effective as Jenny and the witch as well. The music by Danny Elfman is as enchanting as ever. Several of the sequences from Bloom's life seem to add up to very little until we reach the end, but even then, the film does not reveal the profoundest of truths as it would have us believe. The film is more episodic and less uneven than several other Burton films. There are several good supporting actors in the film, including Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, and Matthew McGrory as Karl the Giant. However, Robert Guillaume as an obstetrician or gynecologist stretches credibility in the deep south for the time period. Film buffs will delight in the many in-joke film references sprinkled throughout. More than anything, the film is about being alive, staying positive, and accepting life just as it comes. *** of 4 stars."
"jotix100","7","1","1","6 February 2004"," It's a wonderful lie
","Judging by most comments submitted to this forum, this film has become an all time favorite. Coming from Tim Burton, however, the movie doesn't measure to some of his best films at all.<br/><br/>Edward Bloom is a dreamer, a quality he thought he would pass to his son, only to find out that it only causes embarrassment in the young man, who has to go through life listening to the same stories over and over again. Where did Edward Bloom go wrong? That point is never clearly explored by anyone connected to this fantasy. Was it all in Edward's head, or was it real? Well, let the viewer follow the clues and let him arrive at his own conclusion to see if this Walter Mitty of a man really lived the lies his son Will seems to believe he is telling, or did he actually encountered all these adventures in the process of growing up.<br/><br/>The triumph of the film is the casting. Young Edward, played by Ewan McGregor, suddenly transforms himself into Albert Finney, the older Edward. The same can be said of Alison Lohman turning into Jessica Lange. This was a most felicitous event because in most occasions actors playing a younger character don't bear any resemblance of the actor who plays the older version. In this movie this process seems seamless, as far as how uncanny both McGregor and Lohman might look like Finney and Lange at a later stage of their lives.<br/><br/>Since the film is basically about Edward, his wife, Sandra, has very little to do in it. Jessica Lange is totally wasted, or Alison Lohman, for that matter. One would have liked to have seen them  more on screen. Billy Crudup, as Will, is fine. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor are very good playing Edward."

"Ben_Cheshire","1","7","18","18 July 2004"," Three tales about Big Fish - one man's impressions of a very busy, ambitious film.
","Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a sick old man. His son (Billy Crudup) is frustrated by the fact that he's spent his entire life telling tall tales instead of really talking about himself. So, to tell us about his father as a young man (Ewan McGregor), Crudup only has these stories to tell us.<br/><br/>Obviously an intensely personal film for Burton, who is really here telling us a tale about his own father.<br/><br/>* I could imagine it all before I saw it. Or maybe I felt the exact content of it wasn't relevant - the initial idea said everything there was to say: man tells tall tales instead of talking, son is not impressed. I could imagine these fairy tales from watching the previews. Just tall tales.<br/><br/>* Or maybe its because I just found the character of Burton's father so frustrating. Always claiming he cares so much about people and about life in his stories, yet not caring enough to talk with them like a human being. Stories make nice movies; but would i take them instead of life?<br/><br/>Burton isn't naive to this. Its the conflict at the centre of the film.<br/><br/>
But i just couldn't forgive Albert Finney's character. Burton clearly can. That's the problem with too-personal projects. You can't be objective about what you expect the audience to be experiencing while they watch it - because your own experience of it is informed by so much that's offscreen. So of course Burton can forgive Finney, because he's his own father! You love him despite the fact that he's a selfish, frustrating old rat. But he's not my father, or anybody else's - why should we forgive him?<br/><br/>* Its such a busy film, too. Burton really shot for the moon with this one. He tries to tell us a million movies at once: every five minutes a new movie, and frankly I didn't care about any of them. The twenty minute tangents into his fathers' stories had about as much dramatic tension as my own grandfather's stories. They were all just silly stories his father was telling. I thought the gawdy colours were too much for the same reason.<br/><br/>6/10. I find his simpler films like Edward Scissorhands more profound and beautiful: less is indeed more. Maybe I just didn't like Billy Crudup (BO-RING! Think robotic Hayley-Joel in Secondhand Lions). It didn't work for me."

The biggest fish gets that way by never being caught? It has no meaning or context as all as far as I can see. They key to Ashton?

If you liked this movie, and you haven't seen Magnolia, then you should definitely check it out.  An All Star cast, great acting, better writing, and all around a better film.

","First, I've got to say Tim Burton movies are always visually great to look at, and this is no exception. Unfortunately, the visuals are about the only good thing going for this movie. It feels like it tries too hard to be sentimental and forgets to actually make a good story that's interesting. The stories where just plain boring and didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt his visual style and to appeal to the most sentimental of viewers. And this movie wears on you; the longer it goes on, the more it becomes unbearable to watch, which makes the 2 hour runtime seem like an eternity.<br/><br/>I guess people that like their movies mawkish would like this one (which by looking at the IMDb rating it appears that there are a lot of people like that), but I'm not one of them.

The political correctness is the main lie, by no means the only one: Britons speaking like southerners? 33 years old guys acting as teenagers? Etc. This fantasy, decorated with corny FXs and clichés, does not deserve its fame as a great movie. It's just a medium entertainment if you don't have anything else to do.

Father tells a story to son, who knows it's another one of his many, many tall tales he has told throughout his life, and son is irritated because he had hoped his father was going to stop telling such stories and tell him what really happened throughout his life.<br/><br/>Some examples: In his younger years, the father has fought in the Korean War and helped a set of Siamese twin ladies to defect. He goes through a dangerous wild forest to visit an idealized small town where nobody wants to leave, and in fact the father was expected to visit, albeit he arrived too early, so he leaves it. He meets a poet and a giant living in a nearby cave. Both characters would eventually leave the town themselves, and the town falls into decay.<br/><br/>There is more, but this should be confusing enough. None of the individual stories, or the characters who are part of them, are developed enough to become interesting. We never learn why the father tells all these stories. Could they really be true (as implied by the ending)? Yet there is no overall payoff, and we don't figure out in the end why things happened as they did.

The director, Tim Burton was making fun of his illiterate compatriots and the audience bought it. Had he made a footnote or give a credit to the book author who lived in Germany in the 18th century, that would be an honest attitude and a few professional movie critics might go to the library and read the book afterward.

","Anyone who has followed Tim Burton's career should be able to see this movie as what it is: the half-assed product of a director well past his prime attempting to recreate and collect pieces of his former films (most notably Edward Scissorhands and Pee-Wee). Throwing shallow rehashes of previous cinematic glories at a strip of celluloid is no way to make a film, but it is a good way to trick a lot of people into thinking they're seeing something of substance (or, dare i say, ""genius""). The lack of cohesion is only surpassed by the awkward acting of the father and son leads.<br/><br/>What's most offensive about this film is the heart and sincerity that it tries so hard to put across to the audience through the story, when none of those passions seemed to be present in the people who actually made this epic piece of mediocrity. Tim Burton long ago forgot how to make a good film. His projects of the past ten or fifteen years have felt more and more like the products of a detached assembly line. it's sad that this former, unique visionary in mainstream cinema finally allowed his art to be wholly corrupted by Hollywood and settled on making filmic equivalents to Disney World rides."
"roger-212","3","4","10","3 October 2004"," Overly manipulative, poorly written, but PRETTY. Not Burton's best.

Ed Wood, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, even Scissorhands all work with his perhaps overly designed baroque films.<br/><br/>Sleepy Hollow, Planet of the Apes, and this film are not very well written - the stories are clearly on the back burner to the set-pieces, and his favored casting of HBC in some quirky turn. Big Fish has a potentially very affecting story here - the story of a son trying to understand his father, almost when it's too late, to try to find the ""truth"" in the lies, and maybe embrace the ""love of life"" those lies may represent. <br/><br/>But that story is not effectively TOLD here - Burton is more concerned with giants, shoes on a line, Elfman musical interludes, Danny DeVito in weird make-up, set design. People love Burton's ""quirky"" touches, but quirky touches do not a good film make. Bad casting (McGregor, as good as he is, does not convince as Finney's young self) doesn't help. Finney COULD have gotten an Oscar nomination if he had been directed properly here, but is wasted in a role that should have been his for the taking. The movie, incredibly, doesn't seem interested in his story, or his son's quest. <br/><br/>Much potential, frittered on a soft-headed, overly- and transparently manipulative film that is under-written and poorly executed. Big Fish is beneath Burton's talents, when he's firing on all cylinders. <br/><br/>As an earlier poster says, too many clichés and ""Disney""-esque b.s. in this film that is handed to us rather half-assed-ly only makes it seem like a cynical attempt for Burton to have a big and popular hit.<br/><br/>I didn't love Mars Attacks, but at least it seemed more heart-felt."

Some would say story drives all films, but I disagree -- it's possible to make a great film without much of a story -- witness Jarmusch's Dead Man, Kurosawa's Dreams.

The one character who changes by film's end is the son, and, wow, he realizes that if his dad wants to tell stories, that's who he is, and that's okay. (Not a spoiler -- you know this is coming after the first scene.)<br/><br/>The photography is fine, and there are colorful sets, as well as some colorful, but flat, characters -- these aspects of the film allow me to give it a 2 out of 10.<br/><br/>I'm a Tim Burton fan, but this is not a good film.

","Let me start by saying that Tim Burton will always be a great artistic director/production designer. His movies will always carry that weird, offbeat imagery which will please fans to no end. Unfortunately, he will always be at fault for choosing such weak scripts for his projects. John August's run-of-the-mill script for Big Fish leaves much to be desired because of the shallow storytelling and flimsy characterization. Most of the characters involved are either too flat, or too deliberately odd, for the viewer to relate to. Big Fish introduces us to Ed Bloom, a man who tells some unbelievably amazing stories. But these episodic stories didn't seem to have any point other than just to flaunt Burton's visual style and twisted imagination. I failed to see young and old Bloom as inspirational or even likable, rather he came off as annoying. Old Bloom droned on for hours, talking nonsense. Young Bloom was a self-centered dolt, who always got what he wanted. His son, Will, had all the reason to resent his father, but even he came off as a jerk at times. On the bright side, the movie delivers good results in the acting department, although McGregor's southern accent isn't quite convincing. All in all, an unsatisfactory effort."

Turned out they felt the same way I did about the movie, so I could've just thrown in the towel and fallen asleep.  The fact that this snoozer is in the top 250 is absolutely mystifying."

","I couldn't wait to see Big Fish, A nightmare Before Christmas is one of my all time favorite movies, which is why I was so disappointed by the over long, dull, sometimes magical, but often misbegotten story that these actors were forced to partake in.<br/><br/>From time to time a magical moment will arise, and then the film seemed to be about to take off only to be pulled in, sometimes even crash back to a story that is so thin, I could not believe they stretch the subject for a decent short film to a two hour yawn-a-thon.<br/><br/>For me Big Fish was the disappointment of the year because, it seemed to be all promise, but the promise never quite delivered. This sweet film, left me feeling pretty sour about film making that depends on no plot, no story, no performance but that of the pretty visuals."

","Big Fish is a tragedy. It's about how Edward Bloom is stupid enough to marry the nice, respectable bourgeois girl (Alison Lohmann) instead of the smart, zesty and wild witch-girl (Helena Bonham-Carter) that he was really destined to be with. Bloom's life then becomes a search of what might have been, and a self-search about where he went wrong. Where we might go wrong. As with all tragedies, it is a warning to us, about choosing correctly. Choosing life and vitality and genuineness and CHANGE, over the old-fashioned, respectable image of static, conservative, unchanging ""perfection"", as the boring, nauseatingly normal surrounding society sees it.<br/><br/>What is art? Art is something that overwhelms you, catches you off-balance, or, indeed, throws you off-balance. Tells you things you didn't know and are surprised to discover. Big Fish does that. The point is to demonstrate that all those wild and outrageous stories were not just fiction. On a symbol level, they were all true, but it's a truth we are not prepared for, or capable of accepting. Hence the need to present them as symbolical.<br/><br/>Remember, it's all true."
"sko_100","9","2","4","4 April 2006"," Beautiful, uplifting tale
","I must admit, being as (relatively) small minded as I am, it took me a while to finally watch this film. I mean, come on, with a title like ""Big Fish""? About a man telling lies? I think you can see where I'm coming from. I was terribly wrong.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave this film 9, as opposed to 10 stars, is because it lacks any discernible plot, something that is normally a very big thing for me. However, that's not really the point. From start to finish the film is so beautifully made, and Ewan McGregor is the brilliant as the larger-than-life everyman, the man so 'big', he always felt like a ""big fish in a small pond"". And, the ending made me cry, as Edward 'returns' to the river, with ""everyone... and I MEAN everyone"" is waiting there for him.<br/><br/>It's tempting in the first half, to see Ed Bloom as a mere liar. He tells tall tales that, as an older viewer, I'm quick to dismiss. But as the story unfolds, and Ed's wife says ""Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication."" I deliberate with Will Bloom, the disbelieving, jaded son of Edward, sick of his father's tales and the seemingly untrue element to all of them. It's not until later on, that we realise that there is an element of truth in them, be they symbolic or otherwise.<br/><br/>Although it is sad when Edward dies, as no-one really wants such a character to die, it is nevertheless an extremely moving and uplifting moment, as Will Bloom accepts Edward for who he is, even if declines to prefer his methods. He accepts Edward, and takes up the mantle as story teller, leaving his father contented at peace, telling a story of such heart-rending, spectacular theatrics that it's almost as if Edward is channeling it through him.<br/><br/>Commendations to Mr Burton again for giving us such an excellent movie. Beautiful and delightfully kooky as you'd expect, his collaboration with the cinematographers and long-term colleague Danny Elfman brings a film that's a must see for all ages. After all, everyone loves a good story!"

","Well, this film certainly took a while to hook me in, and actually my wife, pre-occupied with real life instead of reel life left the theater after about 20 minutes.<br/><br/>I had convinced her to see this with me after a friend had told me he thought this was a great romance. Ewan MacGregor does reprise his role from ""Moulin Rouge"" as a hopeless though far from helpless romantic. There's an ""aw-shucks"" aspect to his portrayal, did we ever see him smile and a cartoon beam of light twinkle off his teeth? Even if not, his romance doesn't have much bite to it.<br/><br/>I think the acting (and casting, are Southerners really that foreign to us, and to Tim Burton?) was no big shakes. Crudup gets one scene (towards the end) to really show his craft, but if you haven't seen ""Jesus' Son"" you're better served by watching that. Jessica Lange is a goddess, but here she is not much more than a Hallmark card. For her may I recommend Titus...amongst many.<br/><br/>And did someone really write here that Danny DeVito was subtle? Now, that's funny...<br/><br/>The big story here are the big stories, and Burton's always crafty realization of them. The tall tales are fun in a circus fashion. Indeed we even do get to visit a circus, and Burton remains a fan of the freak show...there's no boy here with scissors for hands, but plenty of others...the ""Siamese"" twins above all were enchanting.<br/><br/>There's just not enough other oddball twists from Burton to make this a ""great"" film for me, a doctor who has some prescience (Guillame/Benson lives!!), the deposed colossus skipping town, and so forth.<br/><br/>I did like new twists on myth as presented here. It would be interesting to see what others think of the book that this is based on. Also, the notion that the best we have to offer in our lives are our stories is a beguiling one (especially for someone working in the ranks of the Hollywood dream machine I suspect). I take issue with that message in theory, and in the realization of it here...I think that this dream has been manufactured to be consumed by so many, and thus lost its most interesting flavors.<br/><br/>So we end up with a cafeteria prepared big fish, that really is not that difficult to stomach, and is filling enough. As I think about it Burton's characters in the past were not a strong point (defined more by quixotic behavior than on dialogue, and detailed character portrayal...Batman was not the only comic book escapee among them), but I still think this film comes up a little lacking for Burton fans. <br/><br/>Lower your expectations, and give this film time to see past the ""Forrest Gump"" nature of it for the trees surrounding Specter and other delights...<br/><br/>6/10"

","-- Maybe MILD, MILD SPOILERS -- for those who want to know what to expect from the movie but don't want to be spoiled of key aspects.<br/><br/>If you knew exactly when you were going to die, would you live life differently? The answer to this question is explored here in a fantastical and uplifting tale of a man who told his life story to his son which seemed too extraordinary to be true but yet was not entirely false. It almost seems unrecognisable the fact that Tim Burton directed this movie as, visually, it's the least macabre and extravagant of his, yet the deep heartfelt storytelling he always puts in them is not only still there but takes the center stage in this one.<br/><br/>It is impossible to provide a spoiler-free review of a movie that tries to blur the line between fantasy and fiction, but here's a review that attempts to capture the essence and feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>The use of metaphors, symbolism and fairy tale morals provide a unique and stylised point of view of the life of a man who always dreamt big. While, to his son, all his stories seemed like pipe dreams with no other purpose than to amuse him as he was younger; he however doesn't get as mad as anybody would have gotten in his same situation. He approaches him in what could be considered his death bed to ask him to tell the truth.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we witness many incredible feats the father accomplished in every stage of his life, some of them good and others not so good. The story telling smartly wraps every life story with a coat of positive outlook paint at a dire or frightening situation while as the plot moves along it leaves the audience wondering if it was true and it if isn't we want to believe it is.<br/><br/>It reminds me of another drastically genre-different movie called The Pan's Labyrinth (2006), which takes place in the 1930s and in it a little girl finds a faun who tells her she is the lost princess of a fantastical kingdom and gives her three trials she must complete in order to be able to return to it. As you watch the movie progress you get the feeling that certain themes are conflicting with one another as you try to figure out if what the girl is actually witnessing is fiction or not. I won't spoil the ending but it ties up closely to what happens in this movie although it has been stated by the director (Guillermo Del Toro) the actual ending.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, regardless of whether the ending is satisfying for everyone or not, the movie is blatantly self-aware of what it is and never tries to hide its inevitable conclusion. It's ending has a sense of finality and a deep message that sticks with you and especially makes you realise the importance of life, the people you meet and the family you have. It's uplifting, optimistic, positive and encouraging; an absolute must watch to those who want to live life to the fullest...<br/><br/>P.S.: The title of this movie might be the best title any movie has ever had. Absolutely heartwarming when you understand what it means."

","A lovingly crafted tale focusing on the power of storytelling and, without a doubt, Burton's most underrated film to date. Based on the novel by Daniel Wallace and adapted for the screen by John August, Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom (his younger self played by Ewan McGregor, older by Albert Finney) a man who has a bundle of life experience under the belt and is a natural born storyteller; spreading joy to all those around him. Everybody apart from his son Will (Billy Crudup) who has had years of pent up frustration, not knowing fact from fiction in his fathers life. In Edward's final days, Will finally discovers his dad's joyful influence on people and the full story. It's a wonderful, gentle and sweet story that's very rewatchable and emotional as well as funny! The cast are all extraordinary; McGregor and Finney play Ed fantastically and it's career best performances from both actors. Ed's wife Sandra is played beautifully by Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman; there's a real romance to the story of their marriage that is actually quite profound and is a lot of the reason I like rewatching this one. The most challenging role I think is the one Of Will by Crudup who does a really great job of portraying someone going through a massive internal struggle. Great memorable cameos from Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter and Matthew McGrory and fantastic editing by Chris Lebenzon, perfectly balancing the past and present to seamlessly create a nice steady narrative flow. Thematically, it's an all encompassing piece looking at the wonderfully random nature of life. Life as told through Bloom is pretty entertaining and glass half full which is very endearing to those around him and us as the audience! Its full of romance and a fantastic account of relationships between parents and children, specifically in the difficulties there can be between fathers and sons. There's also a dance scene with Loudon Wainwright, Missi Pyle and Steve Buscemi that is hilariously done"

They exaggerate, sure, but they give the feeling of life, brought up more, enhanced, to make entertaining.<br/><br/>This whole movie bases itself around not that idea alone. It makes a lesson from it. Stating within that if you listen to these stories you'll realize the truth in them, what they meant to the subject, how they have a power that can last forever, based on that truth.<br/><br/>It says about how feelings are misplaced, Repackaged, told out of order to serve these means. What is a myth, what is the fact? What is a metaphor, are these all literal? These stories, can they help to understand in depth what mundane reality can't touch. Throughout the story of Mcgergors character, we see that yes indeed it does, and can last forever. Movies like this are teaching good morals, executing them well, and getting to that sentimental side, and reminding of the realness within, that makes a great juxtaposition and a brilliant movie."

","""Big Fish"" (2003) is a charming movie about a dying father and his confused son. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Tim Burton. If you are familiar with Burton's other movies, that explains it all.<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with Burton, however, his characteristics are a plethora of witty, weird and wacky moments. Things do not always make perfect sense, but they do not have to. The sweet, charming feeling that surrounds all those small moments is more that enough to compensate for any potential, nick-picky irregularities - if they are even there.<br/><br/>Big Fish is certainly a Burton-movie, and a great one. Expect all of the above, along with some surprisingly profound moments and dialogue that might change the way you think about things. As far as warnings goes, there are a few butts shown throughout the runtime, but nothing more than that. The ending could come off as emotionally intense, but in all, Big Fish is a pleasant ride.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a gleeful 8/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

In fact, he opens the world for you to get out of there for a dilemma and a dream come true for you and you know that you have to stay. You must stay and enjoy your world.
The great fish unveils the world of imagination and inner humanity that is not very acceptable.

Of course, this dreaming is acknowledged emotionally by his wife and bride, but since part of the focus of the story depends on the presence and attitude of his son, the movie's pretender is arranged so that he and his dreams are not recognized. But not matters.
Tim Burton, with all its existence, shows a picture of his man, who is heavily bound up with determination to dream.
The dream that ultimately brings to the film, and it means miracles.
The miracle that comes from belief and dreaming is beyond the reach of the general audience.
Something over to our recognition. tim unveiled a large fish of its own world so that we understand that he, like Ed Bloom, has an unlimited limitless dream. All his work is the result of this attitude.

Finney is the older, present day Edward Bloom and McGregor plays him as a teenager and younger man. Finney's segments are set in the present and McGregor's scenes are set as flashbacks, but they are fantasized versions of various events in his life. In the present, Finney is terminally ill and his son (Billy Crudup) is set on finding out the real versions of various stories his father had told him over the years. Crudup is frustrated with his father, as he feels that he's never been told the truth about his father's life and that the stories he tells are just too fantastic to be true.<br/><br/>His quest for the entirety of the film is to find out the truth about the real stories. Anyway, the flashback/fantasy sequences that feature McGregor are the stories that Finney is telling his son. The story goes back and forth between past and present. The title of the film comes into p lay with the repeated motif of ""big fish in a small pond."" Edward Bloom was just too big and fantastic to be living in small town Alabama.<br/><br/>McGregor's fantasy sequences are easily the best and most entertaining sequences of the film.

He sees his dream girl (Alison Lohman) at a party and spends three years trying to learn about her and find her. He is determined to make her his wife. Along the way, he joins the circus and ends up being employed by Danny DeVito. He also meets a giant and a set of conjoined twins.

I wish there were more scenes with Ewan McGregor and less scenes with stick-in-the-mud Billy Crudup. This film could have also used more Steve Buscemi--he's hilarious. Jessica Lange also lends support as the older version of Mrs. Bloom and Marion Cotillard appears as Billy Crudup's wife. Recommended."

It is an adventurous life seen through both the older Finney and his younger self, Ewan MacGregor. Tall tales, yes, but by the time this is over, you may be feeling as gullible as I did, embracing it whole-heartedly and sobbing as if it were the ending of ""Steel Magnolias"".<br/><br/>Finney, already a tall tale legend whether playing Tom Jones, Ebenezer Scrooge or Daddy Warbucks, has a wonderful heart-felt role here, much like Gloria Stuart in ""Titanic"" or Dabbs Greer in ""The Green Mile"", and he is the perfect grandfather you'd love to adopt. Jessica Lange adds class as his not so long suffering wife who has accepted his foolishness and loves him all the more for it. Tim Burton regular Helena Bonham Carter adds chills as a woman of mystery. <br/><br/>I first discovered this approximately two and a half years ago when I saw the short-lived musical on Broadway. It is a shame that it only lasted a couple of months, but at the time while moderately enchanted, I didn't catch the magic that I would later discover when listening to the original Broadway cast album. Seeing the movie finally has only touched me all the more on this story, and while the film isn't perfect, it is one I feel that could not have been totally captured with all the color and light of the movie when it was transferred to the stage. However, if it was a great usage of daffodils, the favorite flower of the leading characters major love interests, and all the magical characters of the film meticulously presented. This included a witch, a big-hearted giant and a mermaid. <br/><br/>Broadway has taken these types of stories into its hard, and while they are not the huge success of ""Wicked"", shows like this, ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Tuck Everlasting"" will most likely have cult following in years to come. the movie itself is gorgeous to look at, featuring the type of magical story that only Tim Burton can do perfectly, and with a Danny Elfman score that with ""Edward Scissorhands"" is among his best. Cinematically, it is breathtaking and is one I will definitely revisit over and over."

","We all have that friend that tells crazy stories that seem larger than life, but there is always an element of truth to their stories (Sometimes, you really can't make this stuff up). Edward Bloom is a masterful storyteller, who has led an extraordinary life. Coming from the small town of Ashton, he felt he served a bigger purpose than Ashton could give him so he set out on a great adventure, meeting a gentle giant, a werewolf ringleader, Siamese twins, and most importantly, the love of his life along the way. Edward Junior, his son, tires of his tall tales and becomes resentful towards his father, refusing to speak to him for 3 years until he gets a phone call from his mother, informing him that Edward Sr. is dying of cancer. <br/><br/>Through the stories Edward Sr. tells his on his death bed, we get a glimpse into his life through a fantasy lens, which, under the direction of Tim Burton, is beautifully done. The characters are larger than life, as they should be. And Ewan MacGregor is absolutely adorable as a young Edward Bloom. This is a story of love, a story of forgiveness and overall, a wonderful story. Nearly brought me to tears by the end. Great watch for Tim Burton and fantasy lovers alike."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","0","24 January 2016"," Light but deep.
","This movie features what I like to call ""magic within reality"", which means that the things within the story that are abnormal to us as the audience are also strange to the characters. I think this makes it one of Tim Burton's more approachable movies for people who don't appreciate the abnormality of much of his work. Of course, the actual presence of magic within the story that Edward Bloom has woven around his life is questionable. But if you listen to the podcast ""Scriptnotes"" with John August and Craig Mazin, you'll know that John August opened this screenplay with the caveat ""This is a southern story full of lies and fabrications, but truer for their inclusion"" or something like that. I think that's basically the philosophy behind Edward Bloom's stories: he sees what we're probably mundane events as mystical and fantastic because they had that kind of effect on him emotionally.<br/><br/>Although the story centers around Edward Bloom and the retrospective look at his life, it's really more about his son Will coming to a better understanding of his father and becoming a less sour person. At first he just seems like a Scrooge character that's inexplicably angry, but then it breaks away from the flashback to Edward's life and shows us that Will's aversion to his father's stories has some foundation. He has no idea who his dad really is and doesn't know what to believe about life. Edward Bloom doesn't have much development, but is rather defined by his notable personality, the adventures he has, and the people he meets. It was interesting how he based his actions around knowing that he wasn't going to die in any given situation. Josephine, Will's wife, is a somewhat notable character in learning about her father-in-law for the first time. Jenny the girl from Spectre is also fairly important with her insight and understanding of Edward. There are lots of other minor characters from Karl the giant, the Siamese twins Ping and Jing, the ringmaster Amos Calloway, Sandra Templeton, Don Price, Doctor Bennet, and Norther Winslow the bank robber. The funeral scene at the end, and by that I mean the actual funeral as opposed to the one Will describes, is a really wonderful scene that shows how much joy Edward brought throughout his life.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was quite good all around. John August did a pretty good job with the script, especially with developing a lot of characters with minimal screen time. I don't like Danny Elfman's attempts at action scores, but he did a good job on the music here. Burton's fantastical costuming and creatures is less present than in some of his other material, mostly only coming out in the circus sequences.<br/><br/>I will grant that it does feel a bit like Forrest Gump, but I think it's distinct enough that it can't be called a rip-off of Gump. Some of it is kind of weird, but there is enough normality for it to be bearable. You don't need to worry too much about paying close attention, just know that the minor characters are going to come back later on. It's a nice story that will likely leave you in a good mood, but has a decent amount of substance to it as well. Overall Rating: 8.1/10."

What is the barrier that separates truth from falsehood? Can a man, telling the truth, be lying? Can what seems a lie to be the truth? The truth can seem like a lie? Who Is Ed Bloom, what's his past?

","A son does not like his father because he always tells a story about his own life as if he read out a fairy tale.

However as he listens to the story more times, he little by little understands what his father wants to say.<br/><br/>What the film shows that; regardless of whether it is true or not, when we get on the edge of death, it is important how we can talk about our own life as a great, bright and happy one. The father's smile in the last scene probably means this.<br/><br/>After watching this movie, I cannot help but think about my own life. Though I have not lived for so long, I wonder if I have stories which I will be able to talk to others with smile and proud. Maybe now I do not.

It may begin like a movie that just contains a bunch of tall tales, but as you begin to get into the movie you realize that there is so much more to the stories then what you first began to think. As you continue to watch you feel like the son does and think the stories may be just a bunch of lies. Then before you know it you're so into the movie that you forget about real life for a moment. Big Fish keeps you in wonderment as you watch it, but the ending is just incredible.

The next moments also introduces nice variations by having not just one person telling the stories. I like how Tim Burton can get the story to be so alive with all those fantastic details. And there is a really nice positive message conveyed through the father and son interaction scenes. Ewan McGregorr did great in making the fantastic story feels alive, while Albert Finney did nice to build the older version of Ed Bloom to have a deeper character while still retaining the story teller's enthusiasm.

","What make lives happy are adventures and trifling inventions. Tim Burton directed a touching story. This film has two stories â€“ father's story and his son's one. The son does not like his father because he always tells incredible stories. He talks about his past stories, and in the stories, something unbelievable often appears like a giant, woman who has two heads, werewolf, witch and village called Specter. All of his stories are interesting, but it is little bit hard to believe them because of such characters, and his son also does not believe the stories. He wants his father to tell the true stories, but he never changes his talking style even he is dying. <br/><br/>A big fish in a small pond must go out of it, and go to a big one. The fish may drown, but a story which has tail and fins will swim. The last scene, the father dies in a ward. It is just common.

"randi2016","9","0","0","14 July 2014"," Big Fish is a Big Masterpiece
","In my opinion, this movie does not get NEARLY enough love. It deserves to be seen by everyone. Big Fish brought me to tears, much like Forrest Gump. In fact, this movie feels a lot like Forrest Gump, but it is quite different.<br/><br/>The movie follows Edward Bloom, an old man with a gift for storytelling. He tells many fantastic tales about his adventures he had in his youth; about how he wouldn't stop growing, his parachute landing in a circus in the war, and how he met the love of his life. His son, though, does not believe any of his tales, and sets out to prove them wrong. However, he does discover that his dad was telling great stories because that's what he is- a storyteller.<br/><br/>This film does a great job of creating its own identity and not being an exact copy of Forrest Gump, while keeping a similar tone. It paints a beautiful portrait of one man's life and tells us that amazing things can happen to anybody. Ewan McGregor plays young Edward, and aside from the fact that I find him smoking hot, he does an awesome job capturing the essence of this character and playing him believably. His unending love for his girl and his sheer honesty are played great. Alfred Finney, another favorite actor of mine, plays older Edward, and once again is just fabulous. The best scene comes near the end, when Edward Bloom is dying. His son drives him in a shiny car to a lakeside and carries him to the water's edge. Along the way, they are surrounded by all of the important people in Ed's life, ending with a vision of his wife in the water. I just cry like a little wussy every time. This movie is one of my favorites (I'm a sucker for those sentimental ""slice of life"" movies) On a final note, Big Fish contains one of my favorite quotes from any film ever: ""The man tells his stories so many times, that he becomes the stories. They live on after him, and in that way, he becomes immortal."" Something along those lines. :)"

","A lovely, touching film that has only gotten better over time. Big Fish has many detractors, even among people who are normally big fans of Tim Burton. I wonder if these people expect that every film he does should look the same? Because by the time Big Fish came out, he was frankly in a rut. I think it's his most unique film and certainly one of his best. The performances by the cast are all excellent, particularly the supporting players. As the present-day Edward and Sandra, Albert Finney and Jessica Lange are every bit as good as you would expect from these vets. As the younger Ed and Sandra, Ewan McGregor and Alison Lohman both hold their own, though Lohman gets little to do. McGregor's Southern accent is a little over the top but this is a story about a man who was over the top so it doesn't really hurt anything. The rest of the cast is great. The look of the film is superb. I do wish he could have made it without much CGI (the ""big fish,"" for example, looked extremely fake). But I realize that I'm fighting an uphill battle asking that of mainstream directors these days. Anyway, great film. Heartfelt and magical. A tribute to storytellers. It's also the film debut of Miley Cyrus but we'll forgive it for that."

","And the moral of Big Fish is well, what is it actually? That you should lie to your kids as often as possible because that will eventually make them like you? That you should raise your kids to be one of those morons in primary school that have got some relative doing that for every damned story there is? That you'll one day transform into the bloke you're pretending to be in all of your lies if you just tell them often enough? The answer remains unclear in this peculiar Tim Burton film – or, as specialists on Tim Burton films would say, in this Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>The audience experiences the father and son story through the eyes of the son (a character about as nuanced as the defecating elephant that also stars in the film) who visits his moribund old man after not having talked to him for three years. Upon this foundation, Burton and screenwriter John August create myriads of fairy-tale flashbacks, seemingly taking Forrest Gump as an inspiration, but never explain why all of this should be told to begin with – if not for some lads in the visual effects department amusing themselves by designing all sorts of unreal creatures and objects. The story is almost entirely void of emotions while most of the life lessons spouted by the father consist of him not being your usual fellow and that one can achieve quite a bit if mythical things happen in your life. <br/><br/>I'm not expecting every children's film to exhibit a life lesson or have a specified purpose for existing, seeing as two hours purely dedicated on entertaining can produce a wonderful time for cinema-goers. However, Tim Burton strikes me as being more driven to entertain himself than the people watching his films – something that isn't inherently counterproductive for his work, but gives it a sense of being rich on the outside and empty on the inside all too often. Big Fish thoroughly matches that description, boasting elaborate designs and colours for various locations and creatures, captured in beautiful cinematography, yet quickly loses this appeal, as there isn't any more added to it. To be fair, the romance at the centre of it is lovely to watch and the story arc in the town of Spectre a highly amusing one. But even if all little branches that come sprawling from the film's premise were that enjoyable and assembled more coherently, I'd remain underwhelmed by its premise.<br/><br/>Introducing a fully new plot point on a five minute basis, Big Fish is quite the antithesis of a dull film and shows the occasional potential of becoming a remarkable film for young and old. However, it turns out to be for neither of them: too frightening and violent for one, too absurd for the other."
"jquid23","10","0","0","27 April 2014"," Fairy tale
","First and foremost, I should admit that most of the reason I love Big Fish is that I've seen it 15 times and cried every single time. Its light and airy, creative with a great sense of humor, and yet the true story of a lost connection between a father and son is important enough to get those waterworks going every time.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie is so great is the story itself. It's a return to a storytelling that we'd forgotten about. The recreation of fairy tales that are brand new but seem familiar. Every segment of Edward Bloom's life is mostly believable and just partially fantastical. Instead of delving deep into a false world, Tim Burton adds a bit of a shine and spark to our reality so that it remains recognizable while still amazing us. It is a story told about the life of a man, the end of that life, and the eternal nature of it as it's carried on by his son.<br/><br/>There's something ancient and deeply human about that concept – one that goes back to the earliest cultures on the planet. It's also an idea that's gone out of fashion in a way, but the idea that we can achieve immortality through our children is brought into bright forefront along with the psychological weight of finding elements of your father in yourself, working through distance with a family member, and finding closure. Yes, it's the kind of movie that legitimizes Freud and makes you want to call your father afterward."

","Moving and visually amazing drama from Tim Burton. Burton is renowned for his quirky comedies but here he manages to mix that with raw emotion. A family relationship drama mixed with fairy tales (or are they?).<br/><br/>As you would expect from Tim Burton, the special effects are amazing. Throw in a good soundtrack (by Danny Elfman, of course) and you have a well-crafted, visually appealing, often light-hearted yet emotional movie.<br/><br/>Good performances by a host of stars: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Billy Cradup, Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, Robert Guillaume, Danny DeVito, Alison Lohman and Steve Buscemi. Also includes a 10-year old Miley Cyrus in her first cinema movie role (though I am not sure this is anything for the movie to be proud of...).<br/><br/>Only negative is that the ending lacks punch.

","Tim Burton directs a remake of Forrest Gump. Just... let that sink in for a little while. Done? Okay, now that you're suitably afraid, let me assure you, it's not as bad as it could have been. It's actually rather good, truth be told. <br/><br/>And yes, it's perhaps not fair to say that this is a remake of Forrest Gump as the stories are different, the characters are different and it's based on a different book. Still, it feels like a remake of Forrest Gump. Emphasis on feels. The whole 'a young man from a small town travels the world, meets important people and later in life profits from those contacts' is straight out of Forrest Gump. Heck, they're even both set in Alabama.<br/><br/>This isn't a flaw, however. There's room for more stories like these and even though Forrest Gump is an obvious inspiration, either for the movie or the novel, it doesn't lessen the value of this film as it is different enough to be called its own creation. The most important differences are the shifted focus from international politics to family values and the vastly different main characters. Forrest Gump, at its heart, was a comedic drama with heavy leaning towards political satire. The whole Vietnam War and Gump's career as a soldier. Big Fish is smaller in scale in that its protagonist doesn't change the world, not even accidentally. The story focuses more on the idea of what it would be like to be related to a person like that. To someone who knows so many important people that sometimes it feels like he doesn't have enough time for his own family. Not for lack of trying, but because he lives in a bigger world. It's an intriguing idea and the film handles it with grace.<br/><br/>The actors are also delightfully talented and the various characters are more colourful than in Forrest Gump. Burton's tastes shine through and the whole film has a nice feel of dark Gothic and urban mythology mixed with fairy tales. Colourful film all around. I also really like the central family. They all feel unique personalities and you can see the bonds between them. The relationship between the father (Albert Finney) and the mother (Jessica Lange) is especially heartwarming in a way I haven't seen in a while.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of Tim Burton, Forrest Gump, urban fairy tales or good storytelling in general, this one is definitely worth checking out."

","Big Fish. Wow. Above and beyond my expectations. I expected a cute little film about a man still living in his childhood fantasy. What I got was a film full of symbolism and metaphors that, when you dig a bit deeper, is much better than your average quirky Tim Burton movie.<br/><br/>The best thing about Big Fish is how unique it is. Visually, conceptually, and script-wise, this picture is like no other you've seen before. Lovers of clever films such as Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom will surely enjoy this film. Big Fish makes the audience have to distinguish what they think is imagination vs. reality, keeping viewers attention for the entire duration of the picture.<br/><br/>The main flaw that I saw in this movie is the overuse of voice overs. Generally, I do not appreciate when films use voice overs as simply a scapegoat for writing a scene with effective dialogue. A few times, this film fell into that trap. Because different people contribute to the unveiling of the life of Edward Bloom, there is not one consistent narrator. So, when the stories are being told, it often starts with a character's voice over, which is fine, but then they would often narrate during the middle of the anecdote when a dialogue could have gotten the message across more efficiently. Though I didn't like that, I was able to forgive it and give it a 7.<br/><br/>Lastly, I do not think this needs a PG-13 rating- younger kids could watch it and be fine. Some may get bored or not fully appreciate it, but nine or ten-year-olds may enjoy some of the fantastic stories told in this picture. I highly recommend Big Fish as a good family movie night piece (it's on Netflix)."

Only a story of the fantasy does not need to extremely advance. William says a story of Edward is lie and he wants him to tell about truth. However, I think; ""then what is lie? And truly what is it? "" For example, I tell a person to have watched a 2 meter-long snake yesterday. The person thinks it is lie, and it becomes the lie among the people at that point. In fact, the snake which I thought to be length of two meters was the snake which had only length measuring 1 meter. However, this is never a lie because I think that I when I tell him am a snake measuring two meters.<br/><br/>As for my having learned by this movie, the standard to ascertain a lie and the truth is that different by a person after all. We live by matching it with the person of the circumference."

","Tuck your cynicism. Put it all away. This is a good family film about the legend of life itself. The story of the image of the world created by a child-turned father, as seen by his son, who heard the stories. Problem is, like most of us today, the son grew up into a world different from the father's. Different values, ways, habits and stories. And like most children, the world of the parents loses credibility, meaning and value, when the child learns cynicism, separates true from false, and in general, makes his own choices in life. Choices of belief. This film is a beautiful fantasy that bridges the reality barriers between the generations and brings the son back to his father's world, and more important, the father, back to his son's. This movie makes me think of the ways I father my children and makes me want to become better in the ways I put meaning into the process. Not my beliefs. My children will choose their own. Not my way in life. They will have theirs. The immense importance that they, and the role I have in their lives, means to me. That is, in my opinion, what this movie tries to pass on to us."

","At first glance, Big Fish seems like a Tim Burton film grounded in reality; a picture of his that finally abandons his unconditional love for fantasy in favor of a more realistic, recognizable world. However, the fantasy is even greater here, and only uses its reality and recognizable qualities as a backdrop for a moving, poetic parable on life itself in one of the grandest ways.<br/><br/>Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is a middle-aged man who has long been in a strong relationship with his mother but not his father. His father has a way of attempting to generate connection and likability through stories that seem to only serve as charming, whimsical little tales to amuse a small child. When his father becomes bed-stricken, he desperately wants to know more about who he is. He is tired of having a father/son relationship solely built on what appears as a mutual understanding between two people that live in the same house.<br/><br/>Of course his father, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), gives the explanation the only way he can give it - through a larger than life story. In these flashbacks showing his young life he is played by Ewan McGregor, a perfect fit for the enigmatic Edward. These flashbacks detail persistency, young-love, passion, and several other themes and morals better than some films do on their own. Often, we'll pounce back into reality with Will taking care of his father or furthering an attempting at long overdue connection.<br/><br/>I know I""m not the only soul who can relate to Big Fish's portrayal of father/son disconnect. Even as I continue to live with my father in my teen years, I can't help but think of him as someone I know very well rather than my all-powerful father. I love him, certainly, but our drastic difference put us at what I call a quandary that is unable to remedied. The film succeeds in showing that even if there's no spark between you and a parent, you're only given one set of biological parents and you should make an attempt at the strongest connection possible.<br/><br/>Big Fish is visually marvelous and explicitly potent when it reaches the flashback sequences. Burton isn't as dark or as Gothic as he could be and simply enjoys emphasizing the unique, vibrant environments of each specific flashback. I feared early on that this film would be one I could only admire, as alienation began to sit in. And yet, Burton - a true cinematic auteur - doesn't keep viewers at arm's length with the material. He has his own tricks of pulling an audience-member into the film and it definitely shows here. I can't recall another film when I went from alienation to comfort so quickly.<br/><br/>The concept of a father attempting to provide his son with insight and significance of his existence - and his ability to connect with others on a personal level - is not different from what renowned Swedish director Ingmar Bergman captured beautifully in his film Wild Strawberries. The story concerned a daughter, now well-grown and a functioning adult, attempting to get closer to her father who has always been able to generate smiles and charm from strangers but not close family. One strength it possessed over Big Fish was its lack of ambiguity and abstraction. Ultimately, these features give this film one of its greatest strengths and, simultaneously, one of its greatest weaknesses. The abstraction makes the film not open to one interpretation, but it also somewhat prevents strong connection with characters.<br/><br/>Big Fish benefits from a strong sense of imagination and emotion, which comes through in the very wend. It's less surprising but very moving, and is captured in an unconventional way. It doesn't feel like tears are being extracted, but earned and deserved as the film doesn't play the game of emotional manipulation. Burton erects a nicely-articulated, magical wonderland with flowing music and limitless characters. Just in that respect the tears don't seem to be obligatory.<br/><br/>Starring: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, and Jessica Lange. Directed by: Tim Burton."

","Well, what do you do when you are tired and frustrated- it's midnight, dark and you are suffering from the bouts of Insomania- you watch the Big Fish by Tom Burton- well it ain't no Sherlock Holmes but Big Fish is a tale of a tale-yarner: a story teller. Well, in the back waters, a man wished to catch the biggest fish in the river- how he finally did catch it on the day his son was born and let it go after the fish had grasped his wedding ring. This story teller is a man who had sucked everyone with his story telling charms. The only guy unimpressed by his tall tales is his son- who feels that he had never been able to hear the true story of his father. He thinks his father is a megalomaniac and the world revolves around him......... So this story is basically a search- where his son finally discovers the true threads of the story- when his father is nearly dying. To his amazement, fact and fiction mingles and he could not believe his eyes when all the characters- giants, two headed Vietnam sisters, The Poet who went to the Wall Street, the Witch of his Father's stories pop out right at his funeral. Ultimately his son realizes- the wild imaginations that his father engulfed in were far vibrant and romantic than the real life monotony. He becomes a believer.<br/><br/>And the story-teller becomes the story."

","This movie asks this fundamental question in an exquisite way: What do we really know about our parents, especially about their love or our birth? <br/><br/>Any child thinks about it and maybe only the nearby death can help to actually ask it. (Personnally, our parents met at a dancing and my twin brother and me have been conceived during Christmas and New year Eve 1973).<br/><br/>Tim's answer is moving and magic, even thought the movie is uneven. It's really good up to the parents wedding because i can't understand what happens after. After having said that Sandra is his soulmate, the father builds her a house and takes the road. Not very passionate, all the more that he spends a lot of time with the always boring Bonham! Up to that, Ewan was a great young adult that discovers a mysterious America.<br/><br/>Tim manages to really bring emotions from the real world and the time stop sequence at the circus or the yellow field are great moment of filmmaking.<br/><br/>We must wait for the ending to find back this emotion with Finney mastering all his craft. For one time, Depp isn't involved (and it's good) but he could have been great playing this introvert son.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Tim should do more movies about normal families because his big sensibility and vision really enhance the emotion and makes everyday life like a fairy tale."

","Big Fish was a rocking awesome movie! What I love about Tim Burton's work is the visual element. I say to people all the time that half the time, I just throw in a Burton DVD and hit the mute button, looking at his films like art instead of movies. I have never felt that he was a particularly engaging storyteller, feeling instead that his movies all relied so heavily on the visual that it was a lot like eating too much candy...afterwards, you're still hungry and kind of queasy. This movie suffers from a bit of the same problem. The visuals are more whimsical than we're used to, more naturalistic but the overall sense of imagination that makes me gasp from Burton normally isn't present throughout. There are moments of inspiration--the popcorn, the daffodils--but overall, I get the impression that he is just trying too hard.<br/><br/>The performances are sublime, with especial kudos to Ewan MacGregor. This man is simply celestially talented. He lights up the screen like a supernova. Jessica Lange is wasted, and Alison Lohman is so eerily her spitting image that I think she must have been cloned. Albert Finney is terrific, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito seem to be having the time of their lives, and even the mostly wooden Billy Crudup acquits himself well at the end."

","This truly great tale follows the life of a young Edward Bloom (played by Ewan Mcgregor) growing up in the very small town of Spectre. His adventures are brought to us from a much older Edward(played by the excellent Albert Finney) as he regails his stories to his now grown up son Will Bloom, and his wife played by Marion Cotillard. As you can imagine from any Tim Burton film, the bulk of the story is set in an imaginary world filled with interestingly brilliant characters. But the centre of the story is Edward Blooms son trying to connect with his father, trying to determine fact between fiction. This film is definitely one of my all time favourites. It is a film that should be on everyones 'films to watch before you die' list. I feel with some Tim Burton films, he gets lost in trying to create these amazingly detailed worlds of his, but this film he really finds the perfect balance between the story and the setting. I would recommend that everyone watch this film, even if you are not a big fan of the actors in it, or the director himself. A perfect film to forget about your troubles, and get lost in Burton's vision of the world. I would also suggest that anyone who watches it, then listens to the song 'How i go' by the band yellowcard. Perfect song, for a near perfect film."

This is a beautiful and heartwarming story that showcases Burton's oddball reality alongside fine cinematography and a beautiful script that instead of focusing on the weird, focuses on beauty and love with Burton's usual flamboyantly bizarre images thrown in. The result is a masterpiece of storytelling with McGregor in his best performance yet and Buscemi in a great comic relief piece. This is certainly an example of original storytelling, but it is also an example of how filmmakers can use different narratives to tell virtually the same story but in a stunningly fresh and witty format.

","Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Directed by Tim Burton, Big fish revolves around a dying father, Edward Bloom, and son, Will Bloom, who tries to learn more about his father by putting together pieces of myths and stories he has been telling him from the day Will was born. Will Bloom has a rocky relationship with his dying father as he believes his father has been telling lies all his life. By reliving stories and myths Edward Bloom, told about his life, Will learns more about his father and discovers who he really is.<br/><br/>Big Fish is storytelling in all forms and aspects at its best: the cinematography, sound effects, special effects, the story itself, acting, and directing. Everything is beautifully put together which in the end produces one of the greatest piece of arts ever put on screen.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is spectacular. No one stands out in particular as this is an ensemble piece or work. Everyone brings their respective roles to life with perfection: including Ewan McGregor as the young ambitious Ed Bloom who is determined to do anything in life. Albert Finney as the old Ed Bloom who has a special talent of telling stories, Billy Crudup as Will Bloom who wants to get to know his father, Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman as Ed's soulmate. Other great performances include Helena Bonham Carter, Marion Cotillard, and Matthew McGrory. <br/><br/>As I said, this film is an ensemble piece of work and it wouldn't have worked if anyone in the cast doesn't deliver. Therefore, I feel like it is my responsibility to mention them all. And it doesn't end here. I believe everyone on this project deserves recognition. The writers of this film including Daniel Wallace (novel), John August (screenplay) did such a great job that I was not once bored while watching the film. And the beautiful direction of Tim Burton only made this film better. <br/><br/>Big Fish is divided into two main sections. One is the story that the dying Ed Bloom told about his life. And the other is the reality where Ed is dying, and Will wants to mend his relationship with his father. These two realities balance out so well that I was never bored with either one of them. I was always curious what's going to happen to the old and young Ed Bloom next. And seeing those two realities connect each other is just so fascinating. Kudos to the exceptional work the writers did in this film. It truly is beautiful.<br/><br/>I believe that every film has a message it is trying to send whether intentionally or not. And I'm a sucker for this kind of thing. Big Fish sends out a touching, beautiful, and meaningful message about life. That life is as boring as the people living it. If you enjoy life, you will make ordinary things extraordinary. Life is what you make of it. It will surely leave people with a smile on their face as it did on mine. You will have such a good feeling towards life in general. You will want to just get out there like Ed did and live life the way you've always wanted.<br/><br/>I had no problem with this film. Everything is perfect. The acting, writing, directing, score, special effects. It's beautiful. Everything is masterfully put together. I had a lot of fun with this film. I laughed a couple of times. And I cried a couple of times. It surely is one of the best films of the 2000's. Please check this film out if you haven't already."

","For most of my life I went to see a movie on January 1 of each year and was glad that I didn't break my tradition. I was with 3 friends and I saw the future. First time I purchased movie tickets from a machine. It worked fine and much faster than staying in the line and trying to communicate with the teller. To get our popcorn dosage though we still needed human assistance. It was particularly helpful, because when I was getting off my jacket I managed to spill half of the content of the pop- corn bag on the floor, but they refilled it for us free of charge.I got a special treat this slushy afternoon in Seattle because I love stories and got a great one. <br/><br/>As stories go this was a compelling one and well told. We are used to Tim Burton presenting Gothic themes. This movie is no exception but he matured, because the dark side is only just part of the story. Not too many movies can end with the burial of the main character and still present it as a happy ending, but he managed it. The culmination of a life where everyone is happy. But I am getting ahead of myself. <br/><br/>The Big Fish one hand is a metaphor for the protagonist's larger than life figure. It is also a symbol for the tall tales fisherman tell to make their catch seem bigger. This person was doing that. But not entirely for the usual reasons of making himself larger, but to entertain. Stories told without passions details and imaginations are just fact. That is the big lesson here. <br/><br/>I loved the way its expounding was driven by stories themselves. How time stops and fastens when you fall in love, the (not so) eternally happy village at the dangerous road, the friendly giant, escaping from China with the help of the Siamese twin singer sisters, life in the werewolf owned circus all stand on their own as imaginative, colorful attention grabbing stories. Together they form a life worthy living even if not entirely truthful. <br/><br/>This modern Baron Munchausen story was emotional. A son trying to understand his dying father whom he considers a liar. By the end we (and the son too) know that he was just making life more meaningful by enriching the sometimes gray, boring reality. Beside hearing his words we also saw the beautiful, often surreal imagery he lived in. The Alabama accent at the very beginning reminded me first too much of Forrest Gump, but I got over that pretty fast. I was immersed in the story, like everyone else. This is terrific myth-making. The only point I am hesitant about is the ending. On one hand I hate that nowadays most Hollywood movies are ending in a way that if it is successful at the box office they could make a sequel. This movie was not done like that. It had a definite closure at the end. On the other hand I would love to see more of this world. More from the hero's life. Till then every time I think back to this movie it brings a smile on my face."

","Big Fish is the story of a storyteller, Edward Bloom, who loves to exaggerate otherwise simple stories of his life. This causes his son, Will, to feel distant from his father because he thinks his father hasn't told him a single fact in his whole life. Their relationship is strained, but that doesn't stop Edward from relating his life experiences to Will's wife and others who will listen. He tells such stories as meeting a witch, befriending a giant, working at the circus, being part of a war, and meeting the love of his life. All these stories are greatly exaggerated but the fiction is sometimes more interesting then the fact. Next to Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish is probably the most emotional film done by Tim Burton and it's not like most of his other films. The real world is mostly just plain and not really exciting to look at, while Edward's stories take place in exciting and beautiful scenarios. This film is very different from Burton's usual work and is a joy to watch through and through."

","¨There are some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish, they're just touched by something extra.¨ Big Fish is a beautiful film that truly captures our hearts by its brilliant storytelling; and it couldn't have been directed by any other than the great and imaginative storyteller himself: Tim Burton. Daniel Wallace's novel, Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions, could have been a disaster in the making if not put in the right hands because the novel is all about imagination and storytelling. Many movies have destroyed stories similar to this one because the effect that imagination has when we read a book isn't translated in the same way when we see a film. Very few directors leave room for imagination in their movies, but thankfully Tim Burton is one of them. He creates a very beautiful, artistic, and imaginative scenery, and the cinematography in Big Fish is also brilliant. He can turn a simple story into an extraordinary one with his artistic sense. Big Fish is actually all about storytelling and teaching us how our lives can remain immortal through the stories we tell. People can remember us by the stories we've told and left behind in the minds of those we've touched. John August (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) did a magnificent job with the screenplay adaptation as well. The entire movie worked well as a whole thanks to the great scenery, great performances from the entire cast, and great dialogues. The movie is great from start to finish, it's truly beautiful; the scenes and characters will stick in your head even long after you've seen it.<br/><br/>Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) has just been diagnosed with cancer and as he lays in his deathbed his son, Will (Billy Crudup), begins recollecting his past and trying to separate fiction from facts. Ed has always been a storyteller, and Will used to love to hear these fantastical stories about how his father caught an uncatchable fish, married the woman of his dreams, and set out to do big things in the world, but as he grew older he became resentful towards his father who always spent a lot of time away from home and making up stories that in his opinion weren't true. Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard), wants him to make up with his dad before he passes away. Ed however claims they shouldn't worry because he's seen the way he was going to die and it wasn't like this. That was just one of his many stories and it's exactly how Will begins recreating the story of his father. When Ed was a young boy he visited an old witch (Helena Bonham Carter) who showed him the way he was going to die through her glass eye. We later see Ed as a young adult (played by Ewan McGregor) trying to make a big name for himself in the small time he grew up in. He achieves many great things, but realizes the town is just too small for him so he decides to move on to a big city for greater things. He takes a journey that leads him into various interesting characters, such as Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), the Siamese twins Ping and Jing (Ada Tai and Arlene Tai), his future wife Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange as the old Sandra), and a circus owner named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). Will tries to make sense of these stories in order to figure out what is fact and what is fiction so he can finally understand his father.<br/><br/>Several of the stories are unbelievable, but they are extremely funny and worth listening too. The performances from Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney as Ed Bloom are really heartwarming as well. Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito are hilarious in their supportive roles, and Alison Lohman is breathtaking in her role as the sweet Sandra. This was also Marion Cotillard's first American film and she has made quite a name for herself by now. Helena Bonham Carter also had a remarkable role and she is as strange as ever. Billy Crudup has the most serious role as his character is more of a fact sort of guy and is tired of listening to all the stories his father has told him for years expecting him to believe them. He is also very credible as Will Bloom. The entire cast is actually a delight on screen and Big Fish works in great part thanks to their performance. The artistic scenery also caught my attention and it played a huge part in the storytelling. No one could've done it better than Tim Burton himself. By the end of the movie I guarantee you will feel touched and moved by this great story which is also helped out by having a powerful ending. It is just one of those pictures that will be hard to get off your mind for quite some time so I really recommend this film because this is the way stories should be told.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"Eternality","8","0","0","12 May 2011"," Big Fish is not Burton's best work, but it may be his most heartwarming.
","Big Fish is a small, quiet film by Tim Burton, one of cinema's leading visual stylists. Often accused of indulging in more style than substance, Burton answers his harshest critics with a fantasy drama that is not only well-made, it is perhaps one of the most balanced films in the director's oeuvre of mostly offbeat works. Based from a fictional novel written by Daniel Wallace, Big Fish's biggest reward is only a solitary Oscar nomination for Danny Elfman's beautiful score. Should it have garnered more nominations including a hopeful shot at Best Picture? <br/><br/>Albert Finney plays old Ed Bloom, a father dying of cancer. His son, Will (Billy Crudup), realizes that he has never really known his father all these years. After all, Edward has never told his son a single true story about his life. What he enjoys most is repeating his tall stories about his incredible adventures that he lived by when he was younger. Like how he encountered a witch with a glass eye that could predict one's death. Or a gentle giant who he befriended. Or how he parachuted down during a war mission in Korea and met two beautiful Siamese twins. <br/><br/>Burton explores these adventures with Ewan McGregor playing a young Ed Bloom. At times quirky and fun, Burton brings an optimistic outlook to the film with vivid colors and an assortment of cartoonish characters. He does it with a laidback style that focuses more on the relationships amongst characters than the film's visuals. Granted, the visuals are still excellent; there is no better way to describe than calling it Burtonesque. One scene completely defines that word: Ed drives a classic red coupe in the midst of a torrential storm and suddenly winds up on a calm riverbed where a nude woman figure elegantly swims. <br/><br/>The relationship between father and son plays the pivot in which the whole film centers on. To Will, his father is a mystery. Are his stories factual or myths? By the end of the film, the enigma is gone and is replaced with a newfound revelation. Big Fish has all the ingredients to be a tearjerker. But Burton does not want to sweep us away with a weep fest; he wants us to be buoyant and hopeful of the future. Ultimately, he wants us to measure life not in terms of its absoluteness but rather through the experiences it gives us. Big Fish is not Burton's best work, but it may be his most heartwarming. <br/><br/>GRADE: B (7.5/10 or 3.5 stars)<br/><br/>www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com<br/><br/>All rights reserved."

Tim Burton has never made a bad film. some are kind of a miss, like the over-blown 'Alice in Wonderland', but never are they bad. as a matter of fact they're always kind of wonderful and magical. Burton has definitely sparked and revolutionized the conscious imagination of everyone who has seen his films.<br/><br/>this is also probably Burton's most sensitive film. it's pretty much a tear jerker, but it's not maudlin or syrupy either. just very sentimental in a rather dry, matter of fact way. it's a film that is honest about confronting death and makes no claims as to what is or isn't on the other side.<br/><br/>to say this film (or any Burton film), is highly imaginative, would be an understatement. i grew up on Disney films, but Burton's movies have still managed to take my imagination places it had never been before. i also think it's interesting how Burton always combines surreal images with ones that feel very real and ordinary.<br/><br/>it's also interesting to note several years later that this film marked the movie debut of Destiny Cyrus. and she's as cute as a button here. it's hard to believe she grew to be the jaded show business type she's become lately.<br/><br/>'Big Fish' is hilarious with it's messages. of course the obvious one being the title, a big fish is a whopper,and that of course means a lie. it also points out that in a lot of fabrications there is often a lot of truth to it and to be found."

","This movie is absolutely beautiful and full of creative ideas. The visuals are so great, that alone they make it worth it to watch the film. The fantasy parts of the movie are amazing. - I wished that the movie would have only consisted out of them. The reality part has been my big problem. It didn't fit to the fantasy part perfectly. To me it felt, like the movie was trying to ""explain fantasy"". But isn't fantasy fantasy because it can't be explained? - The cheesy ending destroyed every potential the story had left. Yes, the whole plot didn't convince me.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and the beautiful visuals still saved the movie. I just hope John August will never again write the screenplay for Tim Burton movies. I absolutely hate how he dismembered Charly and the Chocolate Factory. He did it almost as bad with the Big Fish novel."

","I didn't think I would like this, a friend of my son recommended it and I was pretty sure our tastes were totally different. I was wrong.<br/><br/>I rented this movie on a cold, snowy, winter weekend when no other major releases had come out and had seen all the new movies that looked interesting. I watched it twice before I took it back two days later and asked the clerk at the movie store if it was for sale, it was. I don't buy many DVDs but this one is a keeper, a great story, interesting characters, good plot and subplot, in other words a great movie made for movie lovers but everyone in the family will enjoy. If you have to wait for a snowy day to watch it, fine. Just make sure you watch it."

","I watched this great movie 7 years after it came out. I'm really ashamed of admitting it. But I never thought Tim Burton could create such a deep, magical, and tender film. I expected another of his fantasy oriented stories happening in a typical Tim Burton world. And that's exactly what I got. But this time, it was added a peculiar meaning of life told in such a creative way.<br/><br/>The settings are just brilliant, literally. Burton explores magical and dark places that you could only find in your dreams. All of the settings are really attractive and tell alone their own story. The Cinematography and Art Direction are spectacular. Every single place is well crafted and every detail gets a special treatment. This is pure candy for the eye. One of the best looking movies ever created.<br/><br/>The acting is great. Albert Finney's performance was heartbreaking, tender, and overall great. It made me appreciate my family members who act like him. When a movie makes you reflex about a specific situation, then it means it is special. Ewan McGregor is as a good as always. Helena Bonham Carter looks good and weird when needed but gives a very good performance. Alison Lohman is pretty and I really liked her facial expressions. Marion Cotillard can't look hotter and more beautiful. The woman steals the show every time she appears on screen. I want a wife like her. Matthew McGrory is an instant favorite. Danny DeVito has a decent cameo.<br/><br/>Many scenes will stick in my mind forever. The poetic funeral, the witch's curse, dealing with the giant, the circus, the Siamese twins, etc. <br/><br/>The ending made my cry and I was really surprised of how this magical this movie is."

","Tim Burton is a great talent. To say that ""Big Fish"" is his best work till date would be making a big statement, but that's the truth. Forget his Johnny Depp's featured fantasy stories; ""Big Fish"" is the ultimate work of Tim Burton. Starting from the story to casting to editing to score, it's all a genius at work.<br/><br/>Cast wise, PERFECT. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Billy Crudup, Marion Cotillard etc. were just perfect. Albert Finney's performance is bound to bring tears in your eyes. Ewan McGregor was the core of the film and his talent is capitalized so well by Tim Burton that one feels whether he had an insight telling him to cast McGregor instead of usual Johnny Depp in the movie.<br/><br/>The screenplay top-notch, the editing flawless, the acting first-rate, the direction at its best; ""Big Fish"" is a delight to watch. The final 20 minutes of this movie is so powerful that it will warm the heart of even the meanest Scrooge. The climax where Albert Finney is led by Billy Crudup to the river surrounded by all the movie's characters is one of the best of all time.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Big Fish"" is a memorable film. It's a treasure film to be kept in collection and memory forever.<br/><br/>My Verdict: 10/10"

","""Throughout his life Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) has always been a man of big appetites, enormous passions, and tall tales. In his later years, portrayed by five-time 'Best Actor Oscar' nominee Albert Finney, he remains a huge mystery to his son, William (Billy Crudup). Now, to get to know the real man, Will begins piecing together a true picture of his father from flashbacks of his amazing adventures in this marvel of a movie,"" according to the DVD sleeve description. As you might expect, the presence of Tim Burton and many of his regular crew mean your production values on ""Big Fish"" are going to be good.<br/><br/>Now, this is supposed to be the story of a son estranged from his father due to the latter filling his son's head with nothing but lies. The father's stories, told in flashbacks, turn out to be vivid exaggerations, like the ""fish tale"" opening. Well, the ""stories"" aren't revelatory. And, it all leads to the expected heart-tugging conclusion. More is told when Mr. Crudup tells his wife something interesting but relatively unexplored, ""When I was growing up, he was gone more than he was there."" So, our storyteller was a nice guy and a loving husband, but only spent a little time with his son - or, was it a lot of time telling tales? <br/><br/>And why? <br/><br/>The disconnections are strange.<br/><br/>We begin with a crystal ball-eyed witch showing our young lad and his friends how they are going to die. One of the other kids dies masturbating to ""Playboy"" on his toilet; either this story was a father's warning, or it proved sexual urges trump the will to live. We don't see our hero's death, but he does. As he's seen his own death, ""Ed"" is able to lead an exciting life, encountering a string of circus-like people. The key relationship, that of father and son, gets lost in the past. Only during the final act, do we get to the heart of the story - then, Crudup and Mr. Finney, updating his ""Billy Liar"" (1960) stage role, begin to sell it.<br/><br/>****** Big Fish (12/10/03) Tim Burton ~ Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange"
"vermil06","8","0","0","31 July 2010"," That's how I remembered it.
","Big Fish shows that everyone remembers the past however they want to remember. When William Bloom (Billy Crudupt) returns home to his father's death bed, he just wants to hear the true story of his father's life. The fairly tale story of young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) is retold in flashbacks by the aging Edward Bloom (Albert Finney). Though William Bloom is disappointed by the lack of reality in his father's stories, he learns to accept the fantastical stories and that this is how his father wants to be remembered. The theme of Big Fish is similar to that of Orson Wellles' Citizen Kane. Both movies are told in a series of flashbacks, however, Citizen Kane is told by many people and Big Fish by one. In the film Citizen Kane every person who is interviewed on Kane remembers him a slightly different character, implying that there is some fabrication and personal impression in each version of his life. Much like in Big Fish, Edward remembers his life a whimsical fairy tale. In both films some stories are substantiated by fact. In Citizen Kane the reporter finds some things backed up in records and in Big Fish William finds some truth in his father's stories, looking through old documents in his garage. In the film, scenes in the past are much more colorful and high key lit than scenes in the present. This may have been done to separate the two, and to show how much more exciting Edward's past was, compared to his present state. Also, he remembered his past in such an unrealistic way. The color red is also used a lot in the past. This could represent passion. Another film technique used in Big Fish in relation to the theme is a barefoot motif. One of the first instances of barefooted-ness occurs in the picturesque town of Specter. Everyone in the town was barefoot because they had all tossed their shoes across a telephone pole long ago. Edward's shoes are also tossed up there and he has to continue his journey barefoot. Barefooted-ness occurs again when Edward's wife gets into the bathtub with him, in the present. Some characters are always shoeless as well; such is the woman manifestation of the Big Fish and the smaller giant. The werewolf circus conductor is also seen scratching his head with a barefoot. The movie ends with some one removing the adult Edward's shoes and tossing them over a telephone wire. Barefootedness may represent youthfulness because most young children hate wearing shoes. It is only once people grow up that they always wear shoes when outside. This fits with the theme of remembering a fantastical and youthful past regardless of what really happened. Though Big Fish is an obvious exaggeration, the past is always some what fabricated to fill in the details we forget and subject to each individual's interpretation."

","Big Fish is an ocular tale of the embellished stories our parents tell us and that we tell others. Actor Ewan McGregor plays the part of young Edward Bloom, a teenager outgrowing his body and is small hometown. Actor Albert Finney plays the same Edward Bloom as a senior on his deathbed refusing to let go, telling the tales his son won't believe. An all-star supporting cast includes Billy Crudup, the son who won't believe, Jessica Lange, the wife who never leaves Edwards side, as well as Danny Devito, Miley Cyrus, Steve Buscemi, and more. The movie touches multiple times on the fact that like water, life is also seen in different ways at different times in peoples lives. In the summer time, the lake is a place to swim in, but in the winter it becomes the local ice skating rink. <br/><br/>Any one who sees this movie can connect at some point or another with any one of the fabulous variation of characters. Director Tim Burton mixes both theme and use of color, as he has in other films made both before and after Big Fish. Edward Scissorhands is a perspective example as he can be seen as both a monster or a kind, funny teenager without a family. Edward Bloom emulates these action, seeing the quaint town of Spector as a place full of life as a young man and as a desperate broken down town as time goes by. Burton's fills the screen with images of rivers, rain, bathtubs, and pools creating both the fluid life Edward lives. Water sends both Edward's car to the top of a tree as well as makes his son a believer in him. As Burton so fabulously does in his films, he expresses color as an extension of a character. Just as ice melts to water, the dark fades to a beautiful palette of bright life-filled color. On Edwards journey of life he experiences both the dark swamp we all and fields of flowers. Whether in a hometown football game or at the circus, Edwards bright non-stop character mimics the surrounding he is shown in. Edward is both a big fish in a little pond and a little fish in a big pond. Swimming through life and chasing snakes are the adventures he tells. Crossing the country, and the world, is the life he lives. This uplifting movie will be sure to leave a smile on its viewers face."
"ThatsMrBoydToYou","Null","0","0","28 March 2010"," Tim Burton's Best Film?
","Perhaps Tim Burton's best film, ""Big Fish,"" I believe, is his most personal. It seems to have more heart and visual originality than his other pictures, and it was the beginning of his lasting partnership with John August. ""Now wait,"" you say, ""I think his style is unique to him."" That may be the case nowadays, but go back and watch any of the German expressionistic or Universal horror films and you'll see where his inspiration originated.<br/><br/>The story of ""Big Fish"" is phenomenal and the visuals really complement it. Albert Finney, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, and Marion Cotillard are phenomenal. This is by far, Burton's best overall cast he's worked with.<br/><br/>In the hands of any other director, this film would have been good. In the hands of Burton, the film becomes great! Not everything he touches becomes gold, but in this case, it did.<br/><br/>I wish the film would have gotten more academy attention, but Burton hardly ever turns their heads for anything other than his technical achievements. I hope that one day he can get recognized by them for his talent AND visual grandeur, but I think he'll have to direct another film of this caliber to get that recognition, and a film like ""Big Fish"" doesn't seem to be in Burton's future anytime soon."

","I want to start out by saying that this is one of the best movies I've ever seen. In addition, I suspect that as I'll grow older there won't be many more so touching like this one. <br/><br/>The storyline consists in the narration of Ed Bloom's life tales and how he exaggerates the truth only to make them even more fascinating. As the story goes by we get to know the other half of the coin. Despite having lived an amazing life, Ed also neglected his wife and only son who holds a contained resentment against him.<br/><br/>In ""Big Fish"" nothing is what it seems but at the same time it really doesn't matter. The density of the characters is just wonderful and it's that kind of movies that you can watch over and over as it leads you to an incredible and personal soul-searching.<br/><br/>Tim Burton did a fine fine job with this one.<br/><br/>Unquestionable 10/10."
"John_Truby","Null","0","0","7 January 2010"," Tall tales, tall order
","The teller of tall tales takes on a tough task (besides risking too much alliteration). The tales have to be exceptionally creative, because they are supposed to surprise and delight. But their fabulist nature also makes it more difficult to affect the audience emotionally. The audience knows the stories are fake and thus have no anchor in real human need and motivation.<br/><br/>Tall tales also tend to become highly episodic. Made up of bizarre and outlandish events, they highlight a moment or a single image instead of a steadily building web of cause-and-effect.<br/><br/>Big Fish doesn't know how to solve the unique problems of the tall tale. It's a patchwork script, and its attempts at solutions just make the problems worse.<br/><br/>The writer tries to affect the audience emotionally by framing the fantasy story with a son's attempt to get close to his storytelling father. This line is psychologically real but boring in its execution. It also feels like much ado about nothing. So what if dad likes to make up stories and repeat them a few too many times.<br/><br/>What's worse, this technique of a second, realistic story line backfires. Instead of anchoring the tall tales in some recognizable human emotion, the realistic line cross cut with the fantastical line seems like two different movies stuck together, and neither is done well.<br/><br/>An even more serious flaw with this script is that the tall tales aren't that delightful. This is where the fantasy game is won or lost. In Big Fish we have a giant who doesn't do much, a big fish, and a parachute drop behind enemy lines where the hero encounters a woman with two heads.<br/><br/>There is a Utopian town, which is quite common in fantasy and can be very powerful. But this town is never explained or given any larger symbolic meaning.<br/><br/>The first lesson here is simple. If you are going to do tall tales, do them all the way. You're in the fantasy genre, and once you get the audience in its own fantastical world, you have to keep them there.<br/><br/>In the Fantasy Class, I talk about the fact that fantasy is more dependent on the premise set up than any other form. If you don't get in and out of the fantasy properly, you can't build the fantasy and you can't make the necessary emotional connection between the fantasy events and the characters' psychology in the real world.<br/><br/>The second lesson is: once your audience is in the fantasy world, you better tell the most imaginative tall tales anyone has ever seen. Great fantasy is about showing people possibilities they never even dreamed of. That's a high standard, but in this form it's the only one that really matters.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"

","What can I say? I'm a stuffy 13-year old teenager who doesn't take the time to gaze upon life knowing its surreal beauty. Even when my English teacher introduced this movie to the class for us to watch, I groaned. ""Big Fish?"", ""Gonna be a sappy old fairytale!"". And how stupid was I to even think that? Right from the very first minutes of the movie, I was compelled. My only words for Big Fish were ""Beautiful, amazing, incredible...a sheer masterpiece!"". It's weird to say because I never looked at a Tim Burton film that way. I've watched titles such as Edward Scissorhands and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it immensely but it never really affected me that much. It's the same with fantasy, watching films like Narnia, I can never compare it to the beauty of Big Fish.<br/><br/>This film looks at life in a very passionate way. With the character of Edward Bloom as he introduces the true importance of life, looking through it in a very child-like imaginative way. I am a kid myself but I have never considered to look at life that way, which really opened my eyes. What I like about this epic is there are three different stories. One of Will's life, who's trying to know more about his father, one of Old Edward, as he lies on his deathbed, and one of Young Edward, who foresees the excitement and adventure. And what's great about it is that the film makes the best out of the three plots without creating any diversions.<br/><br/>We explore Edward's adventurous past as he goes through situations and sacrifices. The film is made with such precision and care as it stores the moments and delivers its material very well.<br/><br/>We get to know the characters a little bit as well. We investigate the true analysis of Edward's past and we see the helpless Will who is also trying to investigate Edward, but there is no need of investigating... just the situation of believing. Their relationship was very heartfelt. The character of Edward Bloom is astonishing. The lack of determination he had in the movie makes him a one of a kind inspiration. + Kutos to Ewan McGregor for committing to his character. <br/><br/>Billy Crudup was also great. As for Albert Finney, he gave a flawless performance and it showed the Edward who had done the exploration and seen the life.<br/><br/>Other characters like Helen Bonham Carter and Jessica Launge were fantastic too. Kutos to Carter as she had the task to play three roles and she managed it with consistency. Plus, it was a treat having Danny DeVito in the film as well. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: From an adults perspective, Big Fish sort of brings out the child in you; it makes life look so beautiful. All I would say is that I would strongly recommend you watch it; just let loose and enjoy. <br/><br/>10/10"

","After watching this movie, I didn't even know what to do. I thought i had been baptized watching a masterpiece such as this. The characters are so amazing, the journey is treacherous but adoring, and the adventure really is as big as LIFE itself. Ewan McGregors performance astounded me, and it makes me beyond thankful that Johnny Depp wasn't cast as Edward.<br/><br/>The classic tale of a son who only knows his father through the supposedly false stories he told him. After his father gets sick, he tries to find out what he can about his father, and nothing new is revealed. In his frustration, he tries to find the answers as the film recaps all the stories that were told. The cast and characters they portrayed were so lovable, and fun to watch as they caused their shenanigans. My view on Tim Burton completely changed after this. There were dark elements, but they were faint, and everything about the story just moved me, and I don't think any other movie can or will top this one in my list. I will however admit that there were one or two disadvantages. For instance when Mr. Soggybottom accidentally shoots Ed trying to hit Amos's wolf form, it doesn't seem to bother him at all, and it isn't brought up again later in the movie, so the shot was completely unnecessary. I also don't like how Ed changed his hair style mid-movie.<br/><br/>But regardless, I strongly STRONGLY recommend any one who has not seen this to watch it, because you will most likely love it to no end."

","He is one of Hollywood's greatest visual artists, but until I saw this I wouldn't have said Tim Burton was much of a storyteller. Big Fish gives us the best of both worlds, story and visual splendour. The movie is not just one story, it gives us four or five. Although it is set up a little like Forrest Gump and occasionally bears resemblance to the Wizard of Oz, the film has a life of its own. Funny, touching, adventurous, and low on clichÃ©s, Big Fish is a tale of near perfect proportions.<br/><br/>This is the story of Edward Bloom from Ashon, Alabama. A town hero, he befriended a fifteen foot giant, worked three years at a circus, won the heart of his dream girl, became a war hero in Korea, ran a successful interstate business, and saved a town from bankruptcy. Bloom was everything that a man could ask for. Except one thing, he was not an honest father. Since growing up, his son Will has hated his father's guts, because he has told him nothing but stories, and not one truth. It has been twenty years since they last spoke. Will is living in France with his wife, but one evening he receives a call from his mother asking him to come visit. His father is dying. <br/><br/>This pretty much summarizes the intro. The rest of the movie cuts back and forth between the story of Ed Bloom's life and the present day, where Will is trying to re bond with his father in the remaining few days he has.<br/><br/>Big Fish is a carnival of color shape and size, which is what you would expect from Burton, but here it is at its best. I'm surprised it didn't receive an Oscar nominating for set design. The movie acts as an ode to storytelling and imagination. Its intentions are noble, and its morals are universal. There is something for everybody in Big Fish."

","I have loved all of Tim Burton's films (with the exception of 'Planet Of The Apes') which I didn't bother to watch) and here is another treat from the guy. 'Big Fish' is perhaps Burton's most colourful film to date. With its exquisite visuals, fascinating characters, captivating storytelling, astonishing cinematography and first rate special effects, 'Big Fish' is a heartwarming feast for the eyes. With numerous metaphors, symbolism and philosophy, Burton decorates 'Big Fish' with layers. There are plenty of references to artworks, such as the scene with the big fish in the lake refers to masterpainter Escher's 'Three Worlds'.<br/><br/>On the surface, it looks like one of Burton's 'least darkest' movies but as one peels the layers it becomes apparent that things aren't so black and white. Yet, 'Big Fish' is a movie about life and love. It tells the story of Ed Bloom who is a storyteller loved by all except his son, Will. Will struggles to accept his the fact that his father tells his fantastical life story as though it all really happened. From here on, the viewer is drawn into Ed's magical journey of life where we meet a ringmaster, a giant, a fish, two conjoined twins, a witch and many more curious characters and Will's journey into accepting and loving his father for who he is and what he's done.<br/><br/>The performances are first rate. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor are topnoth as Ed Bloom. Finney brings across wisdom and dignity while McGregor brings a youthfulness and curiosity to the character. Likewise with the wonderful Jessica Lange and luminous Alison Lohman. The resemblance between these two actresses is eery to say the least. Billy Crudup is appropriately restrained and the lovely Marion Cotillard shines. Helena Bonham Carter is marvelous. Steve Buscemi and Danny Devito are hilarious and Matthew McGrory is very good.<br/><br/>For me, Burton's movies are a magical cinematic experience. 'Big Fish' is a different kind of magic because it's not as Gothic as his other works but the quality is equally superior. It's one of a kind."

","This is my favorite film by Tim Burton. Why, you might ask? I know a lot of people who worship this man because if films like Nightmare Before Christmas (which, funnily enough, was actually directed by Henry Selick, but produced and co-written by Burton), and Edward Scissorhands, etc. Those are good films, make no mistake. But the protagonists are kinda similar and the aesthetic is virtually the same. Tim Burton movie seem to me to be driven by the aesthetics and art design rather than the characters. not so in this film. There's a warmth exuding from everything, helped along greatly by Ewan McGregor's performance. All the flourishes seem to be driven by the tale and the storyteller, rather than driving them. It also looks very different from other Burton films, with some scenes that even look completely ordinary, something I never expected from a Burton film. The writing and the cast elevated the director, rather than the other way around."

"Matt_Layden","9","0","0","20 July 2009"," One Of My Favourite Burton Films.
","I always wondered what a Tim Burton film would look like without all the Gothic undertones and scenery with that scary vibe throughout. I always thought Pee-wee's Big Adventure was one of the scariest films ever made so that fits into the category as well. Well, Big Fish I think was the first film to answer my question. Don't even try to say Mars Attacks! or Planet of the Apes.<br/><br/>Big Fish is a spectacle to see. It's beautiful and heartfelt. Granted it still does have that Burton eerie vibe, let's face it, it will always be there, but it's also one of his more mature works. Burton has a great body of work, all of his films seem to have their place in someone's heart and Big Fish feels like one of those films that is a critical success but no one ever mentions it when they think of Burton's best work. It's a shame because it truly is.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is in the lead role as a younger version of Albert Finney who is on his death bed. His son is trying to connect to him, to get to know the real father. It seems that all his father ever did was tell this stories to his kid that were always too mystical to be true. Or were they? The ending to Big Fish is great and always puts a smile on my face. It's a feel good movie that makes you smile, even when there is tragedy soon to be seen. And yes, there is a BIG FISH in the film, so the title is relevant.<br/><br/>The film has a strong supporting cast, including the ever present Helena Bonham Carter, Jessica Lang, Billy Crudup, Dann DeVito and Steve Buscemi. All play their roles well and never feel out of place in this wacky tale.<br/><br/>With all Burton films they seem to fall just short of true greatness, just shy of being called genius or a masterpiece. I don't really get it, all the ingredients are there, but the final step is never really taken. Big Fish is another film of his that falls into this category."

","The first time i saw this movie, i thought, it was just a little bit too strange, i was a lot younger then. Upon watching once again, and taking note of many symbols throughout the movie, not only am i entertained by the plot, but moved by the characters. I highly recommend this movie as a family film, it's funny and tragic and beautiful. Ewan McGregor is absolutely amazing in his role, and I'm shocked he didn't win an Oscar for it. In fact, had this movie come out in a different year i think it would have won best picture. (Taking into mind that The Return of the King came out this year and pretty much took every Oscar available.) It definitely takes a chance, going pretty far out there with some of its ideas, but few movies are good if they don't take a chance. One of the few Tim Burton films i am extremely fond of. I liked most of them, love a few, but this one rises above all he's ever made. I encourage everyone to see this movie for not only its excellent visuals, but also for it's complexity and message."

","Tim Burton is a weird phenomenon. They say you either love or hate his work, but I tend to do both. ""Ed Wood"": truly a wonderful movie, one of the best I've ever seen. ""Edward Scissorhands"": completely unwatchable pseudo-intellectual artsy drivel. I've rarely seen a director that can be so good and so bad at the same time. Either way, ""Big Fish"" is essentially just ""Forrest Gump"" with a twist, but I'll put it in with the winners. The concept of a man narrating his life through made-up stories is pretty interesting, and gives Burton the opportunity to create another fairy tale world. They're only stories anyway, he can have anything he wants happen. There are times in which you really want to believe them though, if only it wasn't for the giants and werewolves. I personally think the movie's strong point is the ending, it's a time when father and son finally understand each other. Pretty touching stuff. At no point does this movie ever become truly great (except for Steve Buscemi's performance, obviously), but it's a good watch."

","The basic premise of this film follows a young man who tries to reconcile the truth and lies of his father's life before his death.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's masterpiece draws you into a world that is simultaneously so grounded in reality and fantasy that the viewer will have trouble separating the fact from the fiction. This dichotomy characterizes essentially the whole premise of the movie, and develops many of the themes and sentiment.<br/><br/>Visually, this film is a stunner, with beautiful hues and grandiose landscapes. One scene covers the whole screen with a field of gorgeous gold daises.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the seemingly bizarre and irrelevant stories that Edward Bloom become more and more simple, beautiful, and believable as the movie unfolds. Brilliantly, his story telling comes full circle at the end of the film, and the viewer is somewhat able to reconcile Edward Bloom's imagination with the actuality of his fascinating history.<br/><br/>Not only does this film allow for deep analysis and retrospect, it possesses all of the qualities of great film. An exciting and engaging story, beautiful landscapes, fabulous settings, and most importantly, fascinating character interactions. This film is undoubtedly my favorite.<br/><br/>You will NOT regret watching this film. I can guarantee that."

","This story is very good, what else would you expect from a Burton/Elfman combo? It's a great mixture of fantasy with reality and will be a movie you want to watch over and over again! This movie is about a man, Ed Bloom, who told stories all his life OF his life. Now he's old and dying and his only son, Will (who is recently married and expecting a child of his own), has come to see him after years of not speaking. As Will grew older he began to see the ""lies"" or embellishments of his fathers stories and only wanted the straight-up truth--which is something Ed just wasn't capable of. Will since dismissed everything his father ever told him about himself and went on to live his very practical and clean-cut life. It is not until his father's funeral, when he meets all the characters from his father's life stories, that Will sees his father really was telling the truth about his life and only added a little imagination and fantasy to his stories."

","Big Fish is a movie that will pull in every member of the audience. Albert Finney, an amazing actor in himself, plays the amazing character with an imagination for the absurd, Edward Bloom. Ewan McGregor plays the young hopeful Ed Bloom, with the heart and soul of a friend worth having. The story takes place in several time frames, from Ed Blooms childhood, young adulthood to his late years with an adult son of his own. Billy Crudup plays the dying old mans son, looking for answers he visits his father for the last time. Big Fish is a drama that plays every genre to a T.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a lost man searching for his fathers history. It continues cohesively through Ed Blooms childhood, from a one-eyed witch to jumping spiders. With ""tall-tales"" of wars, Siamese twins and a traveling circus, Will Bloom learns who his father is. Throughout the movie Will and his pregnant wife rehear most of Will's childhood bedtime stories of giants and idolized southern towns.<br/><br/>Tim Burton once again mesmerizes us with a heartfelt love story with incredible imagination and flair. He takes us to a new world of fantasy and hope. Burton, usually dark and playful, takes a turn and directs a movie so full of love and compassion the only thing that tells you it was even him is the amazing score by Danny Elfman. Burton tells the story of a young man looking for a place so well you'd think it was his very own biography.<br/><br/>Set design plays a huge part in making the movie what it is. The movie takes place in several locations all with very different themes. Forgotten forests, traveling circuses, the hidden south, to a white fenced home. The set designers do an amazing job of making each location a character. Each set has its own feeling, its own personality.<br/><br/>Big Fish is an enchanting story of a young man trying to understand his father. Its believable in its total absurdity. Fact and fiction co-exist in a way that, by any other director, would have seemed awkward. Big Fish is movie for the ages. If you have a heart and half a sense, you're guaranteed to love this enjoyable fairytale. An easy 4.5 out of 5."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","23 February 2009"," A moving fantasy about fathers & sons and storytelling
","Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" concerns a man trying to uncover the truth about his dying father before it's too late. His father happens to be an incorrigible tall tale teller; as a result, the line between fact and fiction has long been blurred. The film cuts between the father's colorful reminiscences and his last days with his wife and son.<br/><br/>The cast is a good one though I think that it was a bit of an odd choice to have Alabama-born Edward Bloom portrayed by Scot Ewan McGregor & Brit Albert Finney. Nevertheless, it isn't necessarily a detraction since the character is more about theatricality than realism. Billy Crudup delivers a fine performance in a thankless role as Edward's son, the one person who isn't taken in by his charm. The film is also populated with a number of well-chosen character actors like Steve Buscemi & Robert Guillaume.<br/><br/>Burton's direction is well-handled but I found that it took him a little while to strike the right balance between real life & fantasy. However, once the balance is struck there's no looking back. The score by Danny Elfman (which landed the film its only Oscar nomination) is alright but I wouldn't rank it among his best. More memorable, in my mind, are a handful of well-chosen soundtrack choices like Elvis's ""All Shook Up"" during a wartime parachuting mission and Canned Heat's ""Let's Work Together"" during a bank robbery.<br/><br/>In the end, the thing that really hooks me is the emotional content of the film. I don't know if women would react the same way but there's just something about the way that it represents the unspoken bond between a father and son.<br/><br/>I can only imagine why this film was almost completely ignored by the AMPAS. Comparatively, it received seven BAFTA nominations (including Best Film), which is the kind of reception that I think it deserved. In any case, I certainly recommend the film though it will undoubtedly not appeal to all tastes."

This is an extremely well done movie that makes you happy while at the same time making you think about some of the big questions in life like ""what really is true love"" and ""what does a life well lived mean"" and of course the timeless questions about death.<br/><br/>People that didn't enjoy this movie disliked it for it's sentimentality.

And that is exactly what this film is offering you if you open yourself for two hours.<br/><br/>I don't think it is the Burton's most visual film neither the most bizarre.

","The film is well done and we can see here and there some images that are recalling elements of other films by Tim Burton, like an image resembling the basic image of The Nightmare Before Christmas. There are many more, well, at least a few. That's the sign of a man who wants to build a complete set of films, that is able to connect his films with some bonds and strings to make them a whole and not just isolated tit bits. But more than that the film also uses allusions to works that are not Tim Burton's. We definitely cannot miss the allusion to Twilight Zone in that village lost in the forest and we automatically think it must be a village beyond life, hence the hero must have died along the way, maybe with the jumping spiders. We will only know it is not the case at the very end of the film.<br/><br/>The first problem touched by Tim Burton is the absence of relation between a son and a father because the father always told stories and after the happy age of six or seven children know what a story is and that it is not true. But the father was always telling his own story of what had happened to him though it was wrapped up in such a bazaar of useless things, useless because unreal but essential because the father lived in them, such a bazaar of strange things that the son came to the point of being embarrassed by the stories because he could not believe in them and was ashamed by his father telling what he considered lies. They were lies for him and in fact they were stories for everyone else and the father was a story teller, a man who was able to provide others with dreams. It took the son quite a few days visiting his father after several years of complete non-communication, when the father was in the process of dying, for the son to understand that in fact the father was happy and made people around him happy, including himself and his son, by telling these ""false stories"" that were true to ,his heart, to his mind, to his being himself even if it is in a field of daffodils, thousands and thousands of daffodils, which is the purest lie you can imagine, especially on the quadrangle of a college campus.<br/><br/>The lesson for the son is that he was embarrassed because HE was seeing these stories as lies, because he considered he could not know his father, reach out to him. <br/><br/>But the lesson about the father is a lot more interesting. It is a lesson for everyone. It is what Tim Burton is doing all the time to us. The stories are absolutely true, including in the impossible elements because they reveal the man who is telling them. Tim Burton is his films and we have the right to consider that his films are transparent loincloths of various colors that reveal all that should be hidden, at least in public. The stories a man, a film maker is telling are the blood and flesh and some other fluids of the man and the film maker.<br/><br/>This is a crazy idea but a beautiful consideration. One cannot tell one's private activities in bed, in the bedroom or wherever. But One can always tell some stories about some events that happened to him that are a metaphor of his most intimate and perverse and masochistic and sadistic impulses he cannot satisfy in any way. Here the Circus master is a werewolf. How silly, but how true about a man who is an exploiter of people right down and through till he gets to their life itself and who can set up the death of a small circus person so that it becomes a reason for the circus to be famous or infamous. What about putting your head in a lion's mouth? Courage? For sure. But the master is going to save some money if the lion bites because he has insurance and the circus will be more than famous. So a werewolf or not? <br/><br/>The son will understand that so well in the last minutes of his father's life that he will tell his father what will happen after his death but just five minutes before, as a story of his escape and rejuvenation, renascence, salvation: in the story he will become the legendary big fish he has never been able to catch. A man is the stories he tells. A woman maybe too, but Tim Burton hardly deals with women, hardly knows women, hardly dares to say anything about women, or so little, so far at least. <br/><br/>That's what makes this film touching and sensitive but is that a philosophy, a catharsis, a sublimation of one's evil or is it a lie, a pure lie, an illusion thrown to the masses to be their new opium?<br/><br/>I will not choose and be sure I consider opium as a respectable means to meditate on one's alienation by hooking up on this addictive habit. It is a real choice and so many people get into alcoholism or drug addiction just not to have to choose between sublimation and meditation, catharsis and lying.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

I am a huge Tim Burton fan, I love just about every film he's ever made with the exception of 'Mars Attacks' but this was of extra high standard.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a man called Edward Bloom except at the same time it doesn't. The story revolves around the idea that Edward likes to make up stories to make his life more interesting. No-one seems to mind, his stories have a certain charm to them, no-one except his son that is who goes to visit him on his deathbed in the hope that he might learn something true about his father. Besides the human relationships side of the story is a charming fantasy side including giants, Siamese twins and a poet turned criminal.<br/><br/>It has to appeal to everyone surely? It looks amazing, the story is brilliant, its highly imaginative, features fine performances from all the actors and simultaneously brings a smile to your face and a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>It is without a doubt in my top ten favourite films and that means quite a lot coming from me, I have seen a lot of films a lot of which I like.<br/><br/>Everyone should own this.

"vip_ebriega","10","0","0","4 September 2008"," BIG FISH has a big heart.
","My Take: Wildly imaginative story-telling. And after a second look, a truly great movie. <br/><br/>When we hear the name Tim Burton, we don't usually expect merriment or the cheerfulness, at least not without a dash of melancholy or the dark and depressing. This is perhaps one of the reasons why Burton remains one of the most imaginative and bold visionary filmmakers Hollywood still gives a job to. Other than two dark and brilliant BATMAN movies to his credit, he is also responsible for dark ""fairy tales"" such as EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW, not to mention clever black comedies as BEETLEJUICE and MARS ATTACKS! But much like other artists, confine Burton to some unfamiliar terrain and you either get a good experiment or a terrible film. Burton proves he can't do sci-fi remakes in his disappointing remake of the classic PLANET OF THE APES. Now Burton breaks out on his old routine once more in BIG FISH, a comedy/drama about life with a little dash of fairy tale-esquire metaphors. Despite it's nod to fantasy (one of Burton's favorite genres) and a few talks of dark elements, BIG FISH is more about lightheartedness and sentimentality, certainly not the sort of things Burton works with. <br/><br/>But some surprise! BIG FISH, while not pure Burton, is a terrific Tim Burton film nonetheless. It's elaborate, fanciful, imaginative and oftentimes uplifting. Above all, it's an ode to the power of storytelling. It's not in league with Burton's other films, simply parting him from his craft is sets it aside, but that may also be the reason why this film is simply stirring and curious entertainment. It's so unlike Burton that it's also unlike any film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The story's about an old man named Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), already at his deathbed, and to remember him by, he tells the story of his life in a series of stretchy metaphors, much to the delight of his wife (Jessica Lange) and much to the dissatisfaction of his son (Billy Crudup). He tells, as a young man (played by Ewan McGregor), that his life was filled with adventures tied with life, love, revelations, realizations and life-changing moments. But here's the stretch: he also confronts an ugly giant who just happens to be misplaced in a small town, he also works for a carnival barker (Danny DeVito) in a carnival unlike other, he encounters mermaids & other magical entities and when they say when you find the love of your life, time stops, it's true! <br/><br/>Perhaps I one of the reasons I didn't love BIG FISH that much when I first saw it is that it was totally different from Burton's other efforts. After seeing it again, I accepted it's differences and was thoroughly satisfied by a fantastic and highly original work. It's treacly to be sure, something that Burton usually avoids in his other films (he usually lets us relate to his characters in pains, not comforts). But BIG FISH, with it's differences, is proof that Burton can go soft on us if he can. <br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","I think the best part of this movie is the story itself. It might seem unbelievable but the story is still easy to follow. It's about a man named Edward Bloom who has many great adventures in his life which becomes a story that he tells a lot to people.He has met a witch when he was a child, he has been friends with a giant, and he has done any other adventure that many other people won't even think to do. Everybody loves his story except his own son, Will, who thinks that his father's great adventure was all a lie. He has never even spoken to his father for years. Edward has been told and retold his stories since Will was still a kid for many many many times that Will can hardly remember all of it. But he still doesn't know when his father is telling the truth or telling fantasies. Edward grows older and older and older and he get sick. His wife tells Will to come home and since then things has started to get better between Edward and Will. In the end, Will has became a great storyteller of his father's adventure.<br/><br/>I think the story is fantastic although it may seem too impossible to be true. I highly recommend this movie because once you watch it you can get moral values from it. You can learn many things about life from this movie."

","Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors. I really love the way his films look, his characters, his storyline, his feeling for fantasy and of course the way he directs Johnny Depp en Helena Bonham Carter, two of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Anyway, why I really really love Big Fish is quite simple really: how Burton tells this warm-hearted story about a man who wants to know what's real of the stories his dad used to tell him. I work at a videostore and every time people ask me for a good movie, I tell them to go watch Big Fish. It's sad that when, the most of them, they see the cover of this film, they put it away and say: 'No, I don't like fantasy-films.' They think they've got a film like Harry Potter or Stardust, but you can't even compare those two with the wonderful Big Fish. Why? Because Tim Burton doesn't make purely fantasy: his films are more. Harry Potter is purely fantasy. I believe Stardust is also, but I can try believe that there's a higher message in that one. Anyway: Big Fish is serious in the fantasy. Burton doesn't handle the fantasy like fantasy, but as something that's serious and it is in Big Fish, because it has a very big role in the lives of the son and his father. These aren't just some stories told before going to sleep. It's part of two lives, and it made those two lives misunderstood by each other. That's also why I love Burton so much: he doesn't take fantasy as something light, he gives it meaning. I'm a writer (a Dutch writer, that's why my English is so bad ;)) and I find it most important to show everyone how important it is to use your imagination/fantasy. Not only because it's fun, there's more to it. Burton understands that and you can see it in his films. Especially in this one and in Edward Scissorhands.<br/><br/>Burton's main character is set to go on a wonderful journey, where he will learn the meaning of so many things. Things that go, yes they really do, beyond your everyday life, simple because you forgot about their existing. Things you don't stand still by anymore, these days. In Burton's very own unique way, he shows you the love of a father for his child, and the love of a child for his father, meanwhile showing how understanding for the father grows. It's a journey of growing up, but also one of staying a kid, and the importance of staying a kid.<br/><br/>This really is one of my favorite."
"rbsjrx","8","0","0","20 August 2008"," A(nother) review of two films
","This review is of both ""Secondhand Lions"" and ""Big Fish"". Both films share common themes, but develop them in different ways. Although both have been out long enough to be seen on TV and DVD, still this review does contain minor spoilers for both.<br/><br/>Both films deal with boys growing into manhood with male parent figures who are notable for telling tall tales. Both are feel good movies with bittersweet endings where the children have grown up and the parents die at the end. But the devil is in the details and despite such similar plot synopses, these films could hardly be more different.<br/><br/>In ""Secondhand Lions"", which I consider to be the superior film of the two, the father figures are two uncles of the protagonist with a secret related to their seemingly endless supply of money. In ""Big Fish"", the father figure is the biological father of the protagonist.<br/><br/>The essential difference in the two is honesty. In ""Big Fish"", the tall tales are just that - stories with a grain of truth (which is revealed at the end), but which the dad exaggerates into fantastic lies. The dad, a big-mouthed salesman, spouts his tales as naturally as breathing - and just about as often. In ""Secondhand Lions"", the uncles are quite taciturn and only tell their stories to the boy after being prodded, and then over a period of time. Not surprisingly, by the end of the film, you learn that the tales were essentially all true.<br/><br/>""Secondhand Lions"" has a lot of heart and is based on characters you can believe in and admire. ""Big Fish"" is nothing more than a film which preaches tolerance of lies if they make someone feel good.<br/><br/>The performances in both films are first-rate, but ""Big Fish"" is handicapped by the fact that it is ultimately a fantasy. The cast of ""Big Fish"" also lacks the depth of talent on display in ""Secondhand Lions"". While ""Big Fish"" contains some standout performances, ""Secondhand Lions"" features Robert Duvall, Michael Caine, Halley Joel Osment, and Kyra Sedgwick at the top of their games. I really liked all the principle characters in ""Secondhand Lions"", but the characters in ""Big Fish"" were either not particularly likable or were fantasy caricatures so it was hard to feel much of anything for them.<br/><br/>I own both DVDs and enjoy both films from time to time, but ""Secondhand Lions"" is a personal favorite. I watch it about three times as often as ""Big Fish""."
"Zombie-Kermit","9","0","0","13 July 2008"," Found it much deeper on my second viewing than I originally did.
","When I first saw this movie in the cinema, I was a mildly bored teenager who, though enjoyed the movie, didn't find it very memorable. Several years later, after hearing a lot of great stuff and realising it was from one of my favourite directors Tim Burton, I decided to grab it and give it another watch. I am definitely happy that I did so. I got so much more out of it when I watched it a second time. I'm not saying every teenager will be bored when they watch it, though. Probably the opposite. I'm the first to admit that my taste in movies at a young age wasn't exactly the best, but even at that stage I was able to look back and see the good in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie revolves around the stories that father, Ed Bloom (played by Albert Finney as an old man) told his son, Will Bloom as a child,(who as an adult is played by Billy Crudup) who has now grown up and looks on those stories not as nice exaggerated tales, but as lies that he was once foolish enough to believe. Throughout the movie, you are shown various stories from Ed Bloom's (played by Ewan McGregor throughout his adult years) life, where he meets lots of colourful characters and affects their lives. And you also have the side of the story Will Bloom dealing with a tattered relationship with his father.The story is nice and sweet, with lots of touching moments. I'll avoid much more about the plot, so I don't take anything away from the joy of watching it for yourself. I will just say it's a great plot, and I loved watching all these far-fetched stories come to life.<br/><br/>The characters and acting in the movie are great. The character of Ed Bloom (in the stories) was very well written, and very likable. Ewan McGregor plays him perfectly. Will Bloom, wasn't exactly the most likable character in some ways, but the aspects of his personality were important to the overall plot. He was played well by Billy Crudup. The supporting cast was really great, with very interesting characters played by actors like Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and the late Matthew McGrory. Considering the large cast of characters in the movie, they were all handled very well considering their stories were all being told in one movie. That is another positive point of the movie.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is fairly different from most of Tim Burton's movies. It lacks the Gothic theme that almost all of his films have. It was a bit of a change for him, but he handled it really well, and I look forward to seeing him take on some more movies in a similar style. This movie has become one of my favourites and is definitely in my top five Burton films. People of a really young age may not enjoy the movie much, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under the age of about ten anyway, since some of the scenes may be a little mature for them.

","This movie takes you on a wonderful, amazing journey Tim Burton style, of course. ""Big Fish"" is a movie I love watching on a lazy Sunday afternoon because it just is that kind of movie. It's probably a rent more than it is a buy but it is still worth those hours of your life. It's such a cool adventure and the places it takes you too are all so unique and interesting you want to be there. The characters are all so different from one another and they kind of make you want to meet them yourself. I also loved this movie because of the way Tim Burton used the technology in such a way that you forget he even had to use any at all, it's just that believable. You want to catch this movie if you get the chance."

","Tim Burton's Big Fish is an absolute masterpiece and one of my new all time favorite movies. I just finished watching it for the first time and I am still sitting here, feeling amazed. Tim Burton is one of my favorite, if not my favorite modern director and he shows me why with every film I see of his. This gave me the same blown away feeling as films like Edward Scissorhand, Ed Wood, Sweeney Todd, and Sleepy Hollow.<br/><br/>The story is the whole backbone to the movie so it has to be amazing and it definitely is. The visuals and effects are dazzling also. The acting is awesome from everyone. The direction is utterly brilliant as well. THis is a big winner according to me! Tim Burton fans, see this movie!!! Now!!! I'm not kidding!!!!"

","While is normally thought that fairy tales are exclusively for children, this film is a perfect example of a properly done story with magical (or surreal if you want) elements and still have a message directed towards adults.<br/><br/>This is one of Tim Burton's finest. Everything is beautiful. The script, the acting, the sets (you can see some good old Gothic Burton in the scene with Jenny's tilted house), the score (though not as memorable as Edward Scissorhands), the symbolism, everything.<br/><br/>It was wise not to show the real life of Edward Bloom, as it would have been a lot more boring, and it would also ruin the ride. We are presented with all this fantastic story, but as a responsible audience, we most figure out by ourselves who Edward Bloom really was.<br/><br/>Interestingly, I thought the scenes with the old Ed and his son, Will, were quite slow and a little boring. I think was done intentionally, as Will's skepticism seems to kill his father's joy, as well as his mother's and his wife's.<br/><br/>The ending was probably one of the best in film history. It has it all. Humor, excitement, anguish and a full circle. Even though it's presented as being fake, you still cry and believe it was all real.<br/><br/>A powerful strike against rationalists who trust only in what is tangible, and don't care anymore about the fantastic or the magical, this is an authentic fairytale for grown-ups. Although it has family friendly fun, children don't know frustration or resentment, so they don't feel as identified in the story with Will, a character we could call the antagonist.<br/><br/>Congratulations, Mr. Burton, for giving us yet another masterpiece."
"ShootingShark","7","0","0","31 March 2008"," Unique And Beautifully Interwoven Tragic Fantasy Of Father-Son Relationship
","Will Bloom is a man from Alabama whose father is dying. The father is a teller of tall tales and the son feels both overshadowed by him and unaware of who his Dad really is. When they meet for the last time, can Will finally embrace the imagination and fantasies which form such a crucial part of his father's character ?<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for movies which explore the boundaries between reality and fantasy (Drop Dead Fred, Labyrinth, Dreamchild) and this one is beautifully written and directed. It contains all the wonderful and imaginative visuals Burton is known for, but is also at heart a family drama about a son reconciling with his father. It balances and interweaves its timelines and subplots with consummate skill and the wordless funeral sequence at the end - where Will discovers his father may have exaggerated but didn't lie - is a perfect finale. The hardest thing to do with this kind of material is make it seamless; Ed's stories have so many strong individual ideas - a witch in the woods, a lonely giant, a lost town, love at first sight, a circus ringmaster who happens to be a werewolf, a bank raid, a World War II secret mission, a Siamese Twins song-and-dance act - and yet Burton spins these into the main narrative without ever losing the strength of the characters. Everybody in the movie is great, though I especially like DeVito as Amos and McGrory as the giant Karl (sadly, this amazing looking actor died in 2005). It also has a typically brilliant score by Danny Elfman which pulls all the emotion out of the screen, and terrific production design by the gifted Dennis Gassner (Miller's Crossing, Road To Perdition); at one point McGrory pushes Bonham Carter's deliciously crooked house over until it's straight. Like all of Burton's work, this movie is bursting with imagination and entertainment value, but it's also a much deeper character study than usual, and a touchingly sobering comment on how families need to work to encompass their differences. Shot all over Alabama and based on the book Big Fish: A Novel Of Mythic Proportions by Daniel Wallace, who has a cameo as the college lecturer."

","In the deathbed of his father Edward (Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor), William Bloom (Billy Crudup) still doesn't know if all of his father's fantastic stories are true and also he doesn't know who is really his father. The film show those fantastic and incredible stories that will turn Edward in an immortal man that everybody will remember through his own stories.<br/><br/>The script of this beautiful and incredible film was based upon the 1998 novel ""Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions"", written by Daniel Wallace. It was directed by one of my favourite directors ever, Tim Burton in the time when he lost his own father so this film can be his most personal work. I really love the story, about a reconciliation between father & son, both storytellers but what is the difference is that Edward tell his own life as a fantastic tale with many excellent characters. I love the fact that Edward tell his stories too many times that nobody can imagine his life in other way, a more realistic way and i think that's why Will is so confused about his father. And i love too all the stories of Edward with all of his exaggerations. There are all great but my favourite is the one when he told how he meet Sandra (Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman), is a really great love tale.And all with those great and memorable characters including a giant (Matthew McGrory), a witch (Helena Bonham Carter) and some others. But my favourite is the poet Norther Winslow who is living in a ""perfect"" town called Spectre and is writing his new poem for 12 years and this lines are all he have: ""The grass so green. Skies so blue. Spectre is really great!"", played in an excellent and funny way by the great Steve Buscemi who is one of my favourite actors.<br/><br/>What else i can say about this perfect film that is maybe my favourite of Tim Burton along with ""Ed Wood"",well just that i have my own story with this film. I remember pretty well that about 5 years ago i found Tim Burton thanks to my cousin. I spend the Christmas vacations of that year 2003 watching most of Burton stuff and he was my first favourite director that change my life in the way that after watching his films i really start to love cinema and start to investigate about directors, actors, actresses and all those things that you do when you have a really interest in something. After that i knew about this film that it was going to be released in Mexico in February of 2004. It was the very first time i enter in a cinema knowing about who direct this film and all those little details that as a cinema lover you like to know.<br/><br/>Conclusion: ""Big Fish"" is one of my personal favourite films ever and every time i remember about that day ,when i was very young, in which i watch the film i just feel really happy and with desires of watch it again. And i'm not exaggerating. 10 out of 10, the perfect film for my comment #100."

And the scene where his son makes up the ""surprise ending"" for him was perfect, really.

","I don't know what was true and what wasn't true, but it was very charming and sweet. The main part of the story was a son learning to trust and love his father--as eccentric as he seemed.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both played Edward Bloom with a great deal of charm. Ewan played young Edward Bloom, and it was almost as if he were a part of some grand fairy tale--as is tradition with Tim Burton. Albert Finney played older Edward Bloom, and he showed again his limitless power and charisma.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter was both a young woman in love, and an old witch in this film. Her role, although memorable, was confusing to me. She meets Edward as a girl, meets him again as a young woman, and then becomes the witch that he had met as a boy. I don't get it. But it doesn't matter. I don't get cartoons either, but I still enjoy them.<br/><br/>Note to Tim Burton: I could seriously have done WITHOUT Danny DeVito's naked butt.

","Who doesn't like a good story? Big Fish took the traditional grandpa story and turned it into a very colorful and entertaining picture. That is not easy to do. What looked like it was going to be a juvenile and childish movie with adult overtones actually proved to be very grown up. I was totally wrapped up in this story just like a kid hearing his favorite bedtime story.<br/><br/>If someone were to catch this movie in the middle or just see clips of the trailers, then the movie would look like an LSD trip on film. But it really was a very sensible and touching movie which needed every bit of the exaggerated and iconic symbols used. The colorful story was equally matched by the colorful scenes.

"eden13-2","7","0","0","16 December 2006"," An effective & moving adaptation of Daniel Wallace's wonderful novel.
","I've been a fan of Tim Burton since ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" in 1985, and although his choice of both narrative (""Ed Wood"" vs. ""Mars Attacks"") and presentation (""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" vs. ""Nightmare Before Xmas"" or ""Corpse Bride"") vary wildly, his courage to tackle unusual and challenging projects is a large part of his appeal. There are consistent elements to a Burton project that stamp it as uniquely his vision.namely: rich and unusual characters, a dark, dry sense of humor, and vivid and imaginative use of color, all of which work beautifully in the film.<br/><br/>Burton's sense of humor is dark, dry and very intelligent. He doesn't pander to the 'lowest denominator' when creating films - he respects his audience enough not to talk down to them. There is often a good deal of subtext to his dialogue and repeated viewings are often rewarded with humorous details that went unnoticed the first time around. He treated ""Big Fish"" with a lighter, loving hand than in certain of his other films  respecting both the importance of the ""tall tale"" and the delicate bond between father and son.<br/><br/>Burton took a few liberties in adapting Wallace's narrative (as is to be expected, due to the limitations of the different genres.) His decision for Edward to convince Carl the Giant to run off to the big city, and take him along, provided him the opportunity to introduce a whole new colorful setting to work with: the circus. This gave him a springboard for several plot points (Edward meeting his future wife, the giant and Edward both finding visually-interesting employment), and condensed many of the novel's stories into one for the sake of time constraints. It also provided Edward with a 'sidekick,' a common convention in a quest fable (or 'roadtrip movie'.) The basic theme of the movie centers around a father & son with very different personalities attempting making peace and find a connection. On one level, Will resented his father for denying him what he felt was his right to know the 'real' man behind the myths. But the reality is, the ""fables"" Edward created to describe his life were as ""real"" as the facts themselves  contained within the 'fish stories' were the truths, the lessons, Edward wanted to impart, and conveyed the overall image of his own life as he wished to be remembered.<br/><br/>One of the messages of the film is that it is impossible to truly know anyone completely. Our perceptions and assumptions (whether accurate or not) inevitably color our impression of who a person is. We can't ever know the truth of a person's life  all we have to work with are the parts they reveal to us, and the fictions we unconsciously generate to fill the gaps.<br/><br/>William always resented his father for what he considered 'avoiding reality' by 'inventing tall tales' about his own life history. But Edward has his own perspective: ""You're not necessarily supposed to believe it. You're just supposed to believe in it."" The process of the father trying to communicate to his son the importance of living ""larger than life"" and not allowing himself to be constrained by the petty restrictions of mundane life makes for a very moving, and wonderfully told, tale."

","At Edward Bloom's funeral, his wife and Amos (Danny Devito) are the only two wearing red. What could this mean? I tried to figure it out but then thought it was a coincidence. Then I noticed that the red roses are between Amos and the wife at the funeral. This brings attention and unity to their color. Also, a red emergency light flashes behind the wife when everyone is standing around talking at the end. There is no doubt that the two of them symbolizes something. My thoughts have been that Edward's wife is also a fish, because she is the naked swimming lady. But then why does she tell Edward when they're in the bathtub together that ""she'll never dry up""? Also, it could be because they're animals, just as Amos was a werewolf. But how does this tie into the overall meaning of the film? What significance does this hold? Anyone that could help, I would truly appreciate it. If you want to email me at john.ulrich@cuw.edu that would be alright, too."
"tomimt","9","0","0","14 November 2006"," Fantastic tale of a man.
","Even though director Tim Burton is best know for his action/fantasy movies with Gothic design, he does know how to do good drama as well. 'Big Fish' is very good proof on that and it hasn't even effected his style, as the story we see in the film is filled with fantastic views and even some Gothic design.<br/><br/>Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) comes home, when he hears that his father Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is sick and near death. Will hasn't spoken with his father for a while, as he's fed up with the fantastic stories he always tells of his life and Will just want's to know the real man behind all the tales. But Ed doesn't change his mind, he just colors his life story with giants and werewolves and mermaids and witches. But then Will finds out, that there is a certain amount of truth behind the words.<br/><br/>The movie divides between the present, in which we see the relationship between Will and Ed, and the past, in which we see young Ed Bloom (fantastic Ewan McGregor) in the midst of his tales. Steadily we see, how Will becomes to accept his father in the way he is, a man, who has imagined far more grander than it actually was, because he's a natural born story teller, who seeks acceptance of his fellow men by telling his amusing tales.<br/><br/>Without the touch of Burton 'Big Fish' could have been quite ordinary little drama of father and a son. Now it is a bit grander than life, a fairytale of fantasy and reality, in which all parts click together, like finely tuned clockwork."
"booyatom","8","0","0","17 October 2006"," Fact or fiction?
","Was Ed Bloom making up all the tall-tales in Big Fish? Or, could they really have been his life experiences? The ending of Tim Burton's film leaves that up to the viewers. This ""open to interpretation"" ending will reveal those who are more down to earth and those who are more liberal minded. But regardless of the extraordinary elements in Big Fish, there is plenty of entertainment for both sides. I'd like to be Ed Bloom. Whether or not he's inventing all these stories to bury some kind of childhood trauma or something like that, he still believes he's lived all that he says. I think this character is rather refreshing; of course, for some, he may be irritating, and I respect that position. Instead of just telling everyone, while recounting his childhood, that he and his friends had a lot of goofs together, they met a witch. Instead of saying that he got tired of his home town and just left, he actually rid the town of a big bad giant and had to leave with him. And instead of merely dying on a hospital bed like everyone else, he was carried through his wishful memories and left this world in the arms of his son, surrounded by people who hold him as a king. And what if he isn't lying? As a matter of fact, all the people Ed talks about actually exist. If he isn't, then Tim Burton constructed a beautiful and credible world of magic, bizarre creatures, people and towns (Specter). Believe it or not, it doesn't hinder the film. The acting is strong, especially by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. The latter makes the surreal events in the film look completely natural, and Finney plays old man Bloom to perfection, masterfully relating to us that he is totally convinced that his tall-tales are fact. Interestingly, Burton doesn't really choose a side. He gives huge hints that Bloom's are just ""enhancements"" of reality, but then again, we're talking about Tim freakin' Burton here. He never takes us once for fools. He seems to tell us that since we've been putting up with such lousy, half-baked films lately, then he's going to reward with something special, a treat. And indeed he does. Take the scene, for instance, when young Ed Bloom meets his true love. The script clearly states ""They say when you meet the love of your life, time stops. And that's true"". Burton does not allow himself to merely point this out to us and proceed. He acts it out; he actually makes time stop. Now, this isn't so-called ""ingenious"" film-making, but it is truly unexpected and quite hilarious. So, why such a high grade for Big Fish? I guess I'm a sucker for these films. It's getting harder and harder to make feel good movies, that is, without falling into the ""corny"" category. So when one comes along that is so visually agreeable, well performed and clever, I fall for it."

","In his life, Will Bloom has grown up with his father's extravagant stories with which he could never separate the parts of reality and imaginary. One more zany story featuring a big fish led him to a feud with him and a break up which lasted three years. He comes back at his bedside for his father is sorely ill. For their last intimate moments, Will wants to know better his father's real identity behind these stories with multiple colorful characters evolving in a crop of various scenery.<br/><br/>Before ""Big Fish"", Tim Burton had signed two faultless films featuring a main character called Edward: ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) and ""Ed Wood"" (1994). These offbeat characters remodeled life their own way and gave it a vision steeped in naivety and optimism. By pruning trees and hedges to amount to geometrical and human forms, the former gave a new face to the little town in which he lived, let's admit it not for very long. With an unshakable enthusiasm, Ed Wood put all his naive ideas in two-bit but charming films. Edward Bloom is the worthy heir of these two protagonists. Thanks to his art of storytelling and the power of his imagination, his wondrous stories make the audience travel and make it believe in a better future too. The film reminded me a little of ""Forrest Gump"" (1994) because these two works showcase two naive main characters who have little chance to get a fulfilled life and however they achieved this feat. The major difference lies in the fact that in ""Big Fish"" Burton never prattles stupidly. Anyway, here his own style reaches its climax. An unlikely mix of strange, eccentric and fantastic with the meetings of mundane characters and monsters. The filmmaker keeps tenderness for them either it is the big nice giant or this apparently arrogant ringmaster acted by Danny De Vito who turns into a werewolf at night. I remember having watched an interview with Tim Burton one day in which he said that monsters or monster-like characters were bad because they were often sad and lonely. Such is the case here and that's why the filmmaker keeps tenderness for them.<br/><br/>However, the Burton insiders will have surely noticed that the filmmaker virtually didn't include his usual parts of grim and grisly in this chain of tales or they are subdued at best. This helps to better propagate this sensation of innocence and optimism and also to awake in us our children spirits. Because cinema is basically this: the telling of a story and ""Big Fish"" is this and more. It or rather Edward's mind shelters a thousand tales for everyone. Then, in spite of this innocent vibe which suffuses the whole film, it also keeps a certain grave tonality. Before he started to write and shoot his film, Tim Burton lost his father and became a father! That's why, emotion can be felt in the scenes between Edward and his son. And there could also be this question: why does Edward present himself in the company of fanciful people in different landscapes? Why can't he separate the ""embellished"" from the reality? Is it because he has a very vivid imagination? Does he want to go beyond the simple representation of an exemplary life? These question will go unanswered and the frontier between the real and the imaginary is very blurred.<br/><br/>For his 2003 vintage, Tim Burton gathered a stellar cast. Apart from prime performances from Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, virtually every other minor actor has palpable presence on the screen. I would grant a mention to Steve Buscemi and I dig the scene in which he attacks the bank.<br/><br/>Tim Burton completely transcended what seemed to be on the paper a corny subject on a stylish, whimsical treatment. It's a feast for the eyes and the mind. ""Big Fish"" eclipses the uneven ""Planet of the Apes"" (2001) because we found back the real Burton. He once confessed that he had never been an expert at storytelling but when he hires Albert Finney to produce a thousand of them, he unveils some of his unsuspected gifts."

Classics like Edward Scissorhands and his two Batman films are memorable not for the stories they told so much as the flair with which they were told. With Big Fish, this is not the case. With his father Edward (Albert Finney) just away from death, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup, Almost Famous) returns home to finally set the record straight. Sick of being upstaged by the old man's tall tales, the father and son have suffered a falling out, and before it's too late, Will wants the truth. <br/><br/>Through flashbacks, we see the stories the old man's told a million times (here played by Ewan McGregor). He's a high school sports star; he rids his town of a troublesome giant; he stumbles upon the paradise town of Spectre; he works a beat-job in the circus. The main thread through all of them: love, in the form of Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her early days, and Jessica Lange in the latter ones. Each sequence more unbelievable than the last, Burton brings his visual flair to a story that would have worked without it, and there are few Burton films for which this statement hold true. The result is his most touching and effective film. <br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE: 9.2/10 = A<br/><br/>A tough call on whether or not this is Burton's best film, as his filmography is so deep. But rest assured, it's up there. The cast is rock solid across the board, but Steve Buscemi steals the film as poet-turned-bank-robber Norther Winslow.

","Storytelling is a craft that many of us do on a daily basis, whether it is when we're relaying the happenstances of our weekends or telling the time-hazed tales of our childhood. Very few, I find, actually pull off as an art form. One of the most important factors one will see in a real storyteller is their own belief in what they are relaying to the listener/reader/watcher, whether or not the tale is made up of myth or of fact.<br/><br/>This film is one of those magnificent stories told by master modern-yarn-spinner Tim Burton. It being a tale about a man who's largess, personal mythology, and popularity appears to hinge on his whopping fish-tales and fibs, Burton has chosen the loveliest of ways to relay his message to the audience - simplicity with dashes of spicy exaggeration. <br/><br/>Often, when we think of Burton's directing, we picture something stunningly stylized, and, though this film does possess touches of Burton's trademark scenes ans settings and iconic characters, none of this interferes with this moving and heartwarming film as it moves smoothly, like a good bedtime book.<br/><br/>I called my not-in-the-best-of-health father as soon as I exited the theater to tell him that I love him. If a flick can make me do this, then it has a huge place in my heart!<br/><br/>In our day and age, the power of the myth is oft forgotten and neglected. This film will hopefully re-instill in us the joy of the heart of our live's stories, and the importance of looking beyond the smoke screen to what lies beneath in others.<br/><br/>Best, T.Paul<br/><br/>ww.t-paul.com"

","I had no expectations before watching this movie, but it impressed me in every way. A really nice feel-good movie.<br/><br/>Big Fish tells the story about a son who's been told all kinds of fancy stories by his father, but as he grew older he started not believing the stories anymore. When he returns home after three years his father is dying and he realize he never knew the truth about him, just the stories. He starts a search to find out as much about his father as possible before it's too late.<br/><br/>This is a very well written story. The story it self is incredible, original and interesting and John August has made a pretty nice script from it. It has a very good drive in it and it's always moving forward. It's not about reaching the goal, but the journey to get there. It's a nice mix of the present and the father's stories, reality and fiction. The characters are interesting. Ed Bloom is a very special character witch you get to know at the same time his son get's to know him. The son is also a interesting as he is changing throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are great support for these two leads.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney does good jobs as Ed Bloom. McGregor portrays the young, a bit cartoonish, adventurer very well and Finney brings out this experienced, old, a little mysterious old storyteller very good. Billy Crudup is good as Will Bloom. He manage to portray his character a little more serious than the father and manage to follow his character as he develops. As for the rest of the cast they're good and does a great job in supporting the two leads.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good. The lightning is nice and so are the colors. The different moods and look of the stories and the present is well captured. In addition, the design of the sets and costumes are also responsible for making this a really good looking movie.<br/><br/>The effects are kind of cool. They're good, could maybe have been done a little bit better, but you accept it as there are no focus on them and the rest of the action is so surreal. They don't stand out compared to the rest of the movie and don't go against the current look. The story is strong and the story makes the effects, the effects don't make the story, they only build up around and support the story. They don't over do it, It's just as much that it's cool. All in all, good effects work.<br/><br/>This movie has changes in mood and theme as the stories are a little fairytale looking and the story got both joy and sadness. The score manage to bring out the mood and the feeling of the stories and the reality in a good way.<br/><br/>Big Fish is really one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long time. You get caught up with the story as it's touching, charming, surreal, mythical, funny and a bit sad. All mixed together to a nice juicy mix. This is a movie I recommend!"
"futures-1","Null","0","0","8 November 2005"," If you liked ""Edward Scissorhands...""
","""Big Fish"" (2003): You MIGHT have to already have some experience with Tim Burton's films - at least some of them - or you'll MIGHT end up feeling baffled and unfulfilled by this one. I'm not sure. When Burton is at his best, his films are like no one else's. In my opinion, if you like his film ""Edward Scissorhands,"" you'll like ""Big Fish"" - for it is it's closest relative. The idea of ""Big Fish"" takes on a number of meanings throughout the story, and although it feels a little heavy handed at times (perhaps as it relates to the character of the Father), it's very entertaining, has some strong emotions, lots of unique laughs, people, sets, and circumstances, and ends up making it's point - with enough room left for your personal vision to join in. God Bless the story tellers in our lives. What would we be without them? Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman, Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Billy Crudupmy god, who else do you want? (And there ARE more.)"

The storyline was well planned and left you with just enough mystery to wonder whether or not the stories really WERE true. I hope that I leave my family and friends as happy as this man did with nothing but good memories of me to share. I highly recommend watching this movie, but make sure you have enough tissue on hand.

","I really like Tim Burton movies.When I see this movie first on title I undoubtedly want to watch it because I know Burton's style.He likes fairy tales,surrealism,animation and make funny movies.Big Fish also contains some stuff like this.The topic is focused on the line between reality and imagination.Secondly comes The relationship between fathers and their sons and maybe the biggest problem between them ""Not to be tolerant to personalities"". In this movie for example; The father is very imaginative, rather frequently storyteller man but the boy is realistic and unhappy because of his father is a storyteller in his all dialogs.This is basically the topic of the movie.Also Burton is very good at taking people's attention to movie with it's ability of storytelling and make it into motion picture.<br/><br/>Secondly the visuals of the movie is very nice, there are very different and fabulous characters and places in the movie.These are adding a dream atmosphere into the movie.<br/><br/>Finally this is a great movie.Sometimes dialogs are boring and always focusing on to the main character but stories in the movie are very nice, visuals is great so this is a movie that you shouldn't be skipped."

","Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom, and his son. The son believes that his father, Edward has been telling tall tales to explain about his life. This movie shows the tall tales and what happened. The result is a fun, but strange movie experience. This movie does show signs of Tim Burton, and you all know Burton. If not, I can tell you now, Butron is one of the most creative and odd directors alive. For example, there is a giant person in one scene, and conjoined twins in the next. You may not believe it now, but this movie is pretty weird. It tells of Edward's adventures, friends, visits, romance and life. Like the Princess Bride, this movie is pretty much a story told by one persons point of view.<br/><br/>The movie is called Big Fish, but everything with the fishes is unexplained. There is a fish that looks like a naked woman, a fish attracted to gold, and the ending is a little fishy too. The movie seems to fail to explain why there are so much fish, and what they do with the storyline. However, this movie is a unique and original experience that is probably worth watching.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

It raises values, ethics of work (hard work), true commitment and love, father son relationships, wide horizons, and a whole new perspective for looking at things, and each day. The main character harnesses so much, never looking at problems like problems, with a four dimensional way of looking positively at things, all the time. Unjudgmental and fearless in the pursuit of his ambition even if it was partly meant to be mythical.<br/><br/>From his, ""What I learnt from Sunday School was that the hardest things in life often yielded the greatest rewards"" and bashing through the arachnoid jungle to find Sceptre, to his turning around and challenging fate and eschewing self-defeat by declaring: ""Sandra Templeton, I love you and I will marry you!!!""

Only, there is less fun in all of the imagination when the main character's amazing stories of his life are questioned by his realistic son. <br/><br/>The entire movie has sincerity and humor, only sometimes you're not sure if half of it is funny. Every actor gives their all, and I think that saves this movie even more. You wonder why this young man (Will Bloom) has so many problems with tall tales told by his dying father (Ed Bloom). It REALLY takes the fun out of the whole movie until the end. That may have been the plan the entire time.<br/><br/>The last few scenes are what touched me the most. It shows that story telling makes life more exciting. What Ed Bloom was telling weren't lies, they were stories. Some people are too realistic, that they forget the fun of imagination.

","'Big Fish' is a lush and beautiful fantasy from director Tim Burton, and it's one of his best films. Granted, I'm predisposed to like a Tim Burton movie (heck, I even liked 'Planet of the Apes'), but you can't deny that this is a great film.<br/><br/>Edward Bloom (Albert Finney as an old man, Ewan McGregor as a young man) is at the end of his life. His son, Will, is tired of hearing the tall tales his father has told so many times over the years, and now Will wants ""the truth"". But, as Will learns, sometimes fantasy is more interesting than reality.<br/><br/>The acting is really wonderful in this movie. Albert Finney is, of course, a blowhard, but he's so full of life you just can't help but like him. Ewan McGregor slips into a Southern accent and gives a better performance than in any of the 'Star Wars' prequels. Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange both play Sandra, Edward's loving wife who understands that, yes, he is a storyteller, but she still loves him. And how about the supporting actors? You've got Danny DeVito as a circus ringleader with a secret, Steve Buscemi as a poet who robs a bankrupt bank, and Matthew McGrory as the gentle giant Karl.<br/><br/>The movie delights in it's odd characters and situations, and Tim Burton clearly loves the fantastic. The story is unexpectedly heartwarming, and I didn't think Burton could make something this benign (not a bad quality, you understand). All of this adds up to the genuinely moving conclusion, which nearly had me in tears. 'Big Fish' is a terrific film."

","Just so all of you know, I am a huge Tim Burton fan because I have always thought that if I were to make a movie about any of the same subjects as his films, I would use the same fascinating visual style. However, I skipped ""Ed Wood"", which is considered for many his best film, because he didn't use his usual visual style. So when I saw the trailer for Burton's ""Big Fish"", I thought Burton was going to use it as an attempt to free himself from his style and try to be more ""normal"". I did not go to the theater and see it, but when it came out on DVD I saw it at a friends house only because I was bored. Then the movie began, and i realized I was very wrong to doubt.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is a simple story with great visuals, a touching message, and it shows that Burton, if given the chance, can be a great storyteller. The film stars Billy Crudup as Will Bloom a man who has never really liked his father, Edward Bloom, who is played by Albert Finney. The reason for it is that his father has been telling unbelievable stories about his own life since his son was born. Tales such as meeting a witch that if you look into her eye, you can see how you will die. Also about meeting and befriending a giant, going to war and meeting conjoined twins who help him return home, and catching a humongous fish. But the story that beats them all is the story of when he meets the love of his life and time stops. The young Edward Bloom is played by Ewan McGreggor and his wife, in her old years, is played by Jessica Lange. Finally, when his father is dying, Will returns home to spend time with his father and hopes to finally discover the truth of his life.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is Tim Burton's masterpiece. He is not known for directing dramas, but here he shows his gifts as a director. He takes a story that, while simple, could have gone over the top in sappiness and cheesiness, but his visuals and characters are convincing, the plot gets you involved, and when the incredibly sad ending comes, you feel completely moved by the film and admire the fact that Burton has proved himself not only as a brilliant visual creator, but as a serious filmmaker that could make a great drama even without his visuals. 10 stars/ 10.<br/><br/>By the way, this film made me give ""Ed Wood"" a chance, and I thought it was surprisingly good, but not as good as ""Big Fish""."

Now available in cinemas with his new adaptation of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, Burton has given us several great and odd movies; Batman / Batman Returns, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks! and Ed Wood. And BIG FISH is certainly one of his best among all these. A adventurous movie that goes beyond the peculiar limit and into a sweeping fantasy world of joy and entertainment, romance and drama. Ewan McGregor stars in the main character and he meets up with dozens of amazing things in his life.<br/><br/>BIG FISH is one of those movies that the whole family can see, and about everyone gets the same expression. It's a very odd movie, original to it's bones with musical settings etc. Leaping at small masterpiece - moods with a dying man's past, though he knows he doesn't die of what everybody else thinks and most probably will do, because he spoke to a witch when he was kid and saw his death.<br/><br/>Whole the movie is build up around amusement and fascination, the experience of an adventure out of the ordinary. Tim Burton does his part very brilliantly, working always with new kind of ways to make the screen more and more amazing and flirting with our eyes, it's either the fabulous colors or simply the storytelling, time after time it's even the fine acting and good dialogs that captures his adventure into the big arenas. Though this is not that kind of movie, it's more a coming cult classic than a coming underrated classic. And BIG FISH is a very genuine movie, it doesn't imitate or make any flaws against any other, former movie or something, it stands on it's own two feet in a adventure bigger than life itself.<br/><br/>But in the same time; I really do understand the people that doesn't find this movie charming or good, because it has it's way of telling it's story, and it's Tim Burton after all."

Burton's movie is a lot warmer, funnier, exaggerated, and poignant. I watched this movie with my father - it was a most moving experience.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's style is quite a feast for the eyes, too.

","Let me start by saying that I'm not a fan of Tim Burton movies. I skipped the chance to view this movie many times before I finally forced myself to watch it. I now agree that this is possibly one of the best movies ever made, combining excellent acting, direction, writing, and production.<br/><br/>The direction of this movie is nothing short of astounding. This is a wonderfully-crafted film that returns to the roots of film-making by using an actual story. Fancy effects are at a minimum, because this film doesn't need to hide the lack of a decent script. 'Big Fish' is a timeless tale that could have been created by old-time Hollywood, back when the story mattered.<br/><br/>Burton does a wonderful job of matching the movie's style to each specific tale, while never losing the feel of the story that binds it all together. No movie has ever captured the feel of 'Love-At-First-Sight' better than Burton stopping Time itself.<br/><br/>There are some parts that seem too corny or unbelievable, until you understand that this entire movie is about the perception of 'belief'. There are very few movies that can appeal to the adventurism of men, the romanticism of women, and the fantasies of children. 'Big Fish' is one of those rare movies.<br/><br/>One of the wonderful things about this movie is that the interaction and passion between the younger version of the Bloom couple is matched perfectly by the older version. The cast seems to leap flawlessly through time and you never fail to recognize the reckless playfulness of big-dreamer Edward or the shy maturity of Sandra.<br/><br/>The movie tells of a son (William) who visits his dying father (Edward). As the son has grown to become a reporter, a job based completely upon the importance of fact, he has lost all respect for any fantasy in life. This has led to a 3-year rift between the two men, as the father embellishes the memorous tales of his life. William has grown to distrust any portion of the tales, because he has become a man who requires absolute proof of everything.<br/><br/>Since Edward is now dying, William feels a sense of duty within himself as a reporter. He feels that he needs to write his father's obituary in his mind, to preserve a family history for his unborn child, yet he refuses to do so unless he can completely fact-check his father's memories.<br/><br/>This leads to a story of William attempting to dissect every tale his father provides, in an effort to uncover the truth. His father is uncooperative and insulted, insisting that the 'truth' has been there all along and William has simply lost the ability to recognize it.<br/><br/>The end-result is satisfying, as both men are proved correct in some manner, with William recognizing that he is more like his father than he would have ever... (Dare I say it?)... imagined.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------<br/><br/>William Bloom (Billy Crudup) - People have commented that Crudup appears boring in this movie. I personally felt that he nailed his role perfectly. The essence is that of a wide-eyed boy who has become a factual writer with a cookie-cutter life, losing his sense of imagination as he grows. After rebelling against the one thing ruining his image of being a 'normal' person (The 'imperfect' father), he stumbles into regaining the ability to be just like the old man, embracing that he truly is a part of his father. Crudup's 'boring' character seems quite intentional and deserves much more credit.<br/><br/>Adult Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) - Finney is everyone's grandfather, the cantankerous coot that is proud of his life and just doesn't care if you believe it. He's going to have fun right to his last breath and nobody is ever going to take that away from him. His best acting is when he jumps from the playful Edward and bares his teeth to William, daring him to move from his world of literalism because the truth is always right before him... A 'reporter' might not see it, but a 'human being' should. Finney's expression screams ""I am NOT a typewriter"".<br/><br/>Young Edward Bloom (Ewan MacGregor) - Somewhere along the line, MacGregor has got to drop his horrible forced acting-school accent and taper his voice into the role. He is as believably Southern as an Eskimo. Other than that, his likability-factor makes him an excellent choice for the personable young Edward. His best part comes when he explains to Jenny how much he loves Sandra. The mood of the younger couple is a perfect match to the elder version, and Burton mimics life by allowing the younger version never to appear as crabby and lethargic as an older couple.<br/><br/>Adult Sandra Bloom (Jessica Lange) - If it is possible for someone to explode off the screen in a quiet manner, this is it. Lange is a wonderful combination of tortured, romantic, shy, smart, and sly. She seems to know every secret, but is content to force William to find it on his own and regain the same respect for his father that she has.<br/><br/>Young Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman) - It took half the movie before I realized this wasn't a digital makeover of Jessica Lange, that is how uncanny the resemblance was. It completely adds to the enjoyment of the movie. Lohman did a fine job, but she lacked slightly in comparison to Lange (Which is certainly no insult to her skills).<br/><br/>Helena Carter (Jenny Hill) - Not a major role, but very interesting. Carter provides a solid performance as the biggest secret in the movie, although her make-up job is extremely mediocre. She looks too much like a young woman in a bad gray wig, but it's a minor flaw."
"KUAlum26","10","0","0","3 July 2005"," Making tall tales out of reality
","My faith in this movie was paid off threefold as I gambled on yet another Tim Burton. After being jarred(albeit effectively) by ""Sleepy Hollow"" and utterly confused and a little angry from ""Planet of the Apes"",I could've just let this one slide. But I thought I'd give this one a chance,if for nothing else,the fanciful storyline and the adept casting.<br/><br/>The story segues back and forth between young Edward Bloom(Ewan MacGreggor,cleaned up and un-Scottish here) and old Edward Bloom(Albert Finney,Academy snubbed here IMHO). Bloom is a legend to just about everybody,including himself,not least of which is because he can tell a great story. One of the very few to cut him much slack and is mostly distrustful of his persona is his son,William(Billy Crudup,understated,as usual). Bloom's wife Sandra(a non-aging Jessica Lange,saintly this time)has to straddle the line between being a loving,adoring wife and the hand of reality to her progressively fanciful and bombastic husband. Bloom tells tales about growing up in rural Alabama(wouldn't you KNOW that a film about tall-tales would be set in the South!),and his travails over a period of just over thirty some odd years. This film reminds one of ""Forrest Gump"" on at least a few levels:one,the larger-than-life recollections of a Southerner,set over the course of the middle twentieth century America and two,the protagonist's belief in true and abiding love. But while Gump sometimes threatened to sicken the audience with its heavy-handed pleasant,painfully simple truisms,""Fish"" is smarter in that it sticks with pure story-telling with the trust that the audience will ""get"" the differences between storied past and dull reality,allowing them to appreciate the wonder rather than get possibly bludgeoned by it. Rather than trying to merely stick a fictional figure in historic situations(a la ""Zelig""),the writers and Burton wisely chose to develop an almost ""Gulliver's Travels"" type of path. Last but not least,one watching this film cannot forget to complement the choice to film the past and present in different lights:the past as bright and dreamy,full of vibrant colors and music;the present as drab,earth-toned reality.(BTW,this doesn't mean I didn't like ""Forrest Gump"". I did,but I appreciate it in a different way.) <br/><br/>Some strong turns by a supporting cast featuring Steve BUscemi(always good!),Robert Guillame,Danny DeVito and Helena Bonham Carter. I cannot,for the moment,recall who played the Giant Ed Bloom befriends,but he is very effective,both as an awesome and sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Emotionally-based films of fancy can be tricky to keep both convincing AND authentic,but Tim Burton seems at home in this original and beautifully done movie."

Truth is that the stories his father tells are exaggerated but true but the son thinks their all complete blasphemy. He mostly tells of when he was young and in love with a girl he never met. He works as a circus janitor for information about the girl in which he receives from a family friend of hers. He is also the owner of the circus. All the actors and actresses do an amazing job and fit their roles perfectly. Tim Burton has now added this great film to his long list of glorious movies that he's been a part of.

Ideals were like fish stories that grew from a mustard seed and took on the Sparta of magical mystical fish tales. Great things bigger then life could be had only with a pure heart dedicated to ones damsel.<br/><br/>I didn't read the book but was amazed at the chivalry and romantic spirit of Daniel Wallaces premiere book. To imagine working for free only to paid with a tidbit of detail each 30 days about the women he had only caught a glimpse of.

","If there's one reason to see Big Fish it's because it's like nothing you've ever seen before. I love the work of Tim Burton and that's what mostly drew me to this movie. I honestly don't know where to begin with this review, there is just so much to say about the story and the dilemmas between the father(Edward) and the son(Albert). The movie mostly fixates itself around the stories Edward has told to his son. It begins where Edward tells the story of the day Albert is born, and how his Edward caught an uncatchable fish. During this it goes through a montage of years passing and eventually ends up where Edward is telling the story at his son's wedding and Albert not liking it. Believing that his father has lied to him throughout all the years Albert and Edward go their separate ways for a few years before Albert gets a call from his mom finding out that his father is on his deathbed. Albert decides he has to go see his dad before time runs out and find out the truth behind all the tall tales. The movie really is a very heart warming story and by the end I was choking up. The ending is really good, it's something you'll never see coming. I can see why it was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and got an Academy Award Nominee for Best Original Score. The acting in this movie is outrageous. They couldn't have picked a better cast. The adventure int his movie is out of this world, and I'm not exaggerating on that. The adventure is very big indeed. Out of all the movies Tim Burton has done, Big Fish shines in his collection."

Not many movies have done that to me.... only a few I cant think of, but this is also the type of movie which makes you want to be a better person and to live life to the fullest and take every day for granted.

Danny Elfman did a superb job at giving the music old Southern sound. This is a very good movie and give full encouragement to all of you to watch it.

","Before the time of television and movies, the passing of knowledge and wisdom depended on story-telling and the magic of the story-teller. And with the storyteller's twist, fact and fiction becomes a foggy mist.<br/><br/>William Blooms (Billy Crudup) is on a search for the ultimate meaning of his father's many tales. He tries to learn the truths of his father in his father's dieing days. When it came to story-telling, Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) knew it best. ""Big Fish"" begins with Edward Bloom telling tales about his past at dinner parties, around a campfire, and to anyone else that would listen. Everyone seems intrigued by his stories except his son, Will, who wishes his father would just be able to tell him the truth.<br/><br/>Through the film's constant stream of flashbacks, young Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor), goes through countless adventures, unafraid because as a boy he confronted a witch who foretold the exact moment of his death. In one, he befriends a giant and together they hit the road, but Bloom gets sidetracked in an isolated town called Spectre where the streets are paved with grass and all of the residents walk around barefoot. He leaves only to wind up in the circus, shoveling dung and performing dangerous tricks in the attempt to learn the name of the girl he loves.<br/><br/>This film, with its storytelling premise, has a small resemblance to the 1994 film ""Forrest Gump"" about a mentally challenged man who is put into a variety of situations and real-life events. And while waiting for a bus, he tells his unbelievable tales to on goers. But Big Fish has a different tone that allows for the relationship development and the deeper emotions felt between the two main characters.<br/><br/>Tim Burton engages us with his colorful backdrops and wonderful motif. And since most of the movie is in flashback, we are in a ""dreamy"" state for quite a while. The overall theme of this film is further enhanced by the usage of camera angles, lighting, and color. This greatly contributes to the sense of magic and creativity of Ed's tales and therefore, helps with the exaggerating of the stories that he tells.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" tells the tale of a son who longs to truly know his father and not just the exaggerated stories that his father tells. And as the foggy mist of fact and fiction clears to reveal nothing, should we, in the end, accept that fog to be truth?"

The son, not believing much of what his dad tells him, listens to every word that is being told. Some interesting characters are told in the father's story that is almost believable.

"Old Crow-2","10","0","0","22 June 2004"," Most directors will tell you stories straight through. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
","Think about all the directors in Hollywood. How many truly unique talents are there? Not many, I'd say. And how many directors actually have a recognizable style? Even fewer. Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, the Coen Brothers, the ZAZ team... Those are the names that come to my mind. But there's one person who rises above all the others, and that man is Tim Burton.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Tim Burton's work for a long time. I've seen all of his full-length movies expect ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" and the only one that doesn't really feel like a Burton flick is the watchable-yet-disappointing ""The Planet Of The Apes"". It was okay for a summer blockbuster, but it lacked that special Burton magic. All the other movies of his are as Burtonesque as they could possibly be. I even like ""Mars Attacks!"" a lot which is a movie Burton fans either seem to love or hate. It's hard to name my favorite of Burton's productions, they are all quite different in spite of having the magical Burton touch. In Tim's movies fantasy meets reality and the results are like fairy tales with dark undertones. ""Ed Wood"" is Tim's most realistic film to date, but it also manages to be more than just a typical biography movie. It might have been shot black-and-white, but it's definitely one of, if not the most, colorful story about a life of a person who actually existed. <br/><br/>When I first read about ""Big Fish"" I was a little skeptical because I thought it would be a typical family drama. But thank God it was Tim Burton who was directing it. All my doubts disappeared when I saw the trailer for the film. Having seen the film itself I'd say that the trailer is actually one of the best I've ever seen. <br/><br/>It's really refreshing to see a movie which is sad, funny, touching and heart-warming at the same time. I don't think the film ever turns into a tear-jerker as the ""realistic"" parts of the film are very life-like. And in the hands of a bland director the ""fantasy"" parts could've become a real mess. But with Burton at the helm, we are treated to his greatest hits. We get weird and captivating characters (witches, Siamese twins, also a werewolf...), stunning images and colors, Danny Elfman's gorgeous score, the exactly right amount of humor and those wild stories. The stories Ed Bloom tells might not be 100% true, but they sure are entertaining!<br/><br/>And the cast... Tim Burton once again got a great team to work with. The main players are Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor who are both outstanding and worth at least a few awards. Smaller roles are played by Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Helena Bonham-Carter. Their roles might be small, but they all contribute something special to the story. Many people have complained about Jessica Lange being wasted in such a small role. I don't think she was wasted at all. The most beautiful scene of the film has Sandra Bloom getting into a bathtub fully-clothed with her dying husband and only a few words are spoken during this scene. More dialog is not needed as the two highly talented actors show what they are capable of. <br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is a movie that will definitely become a Burton classic. It would have deserved bigger box office grosses, but as one reviewer put it, the movie will more likely become more popular on small screen and gain more and more popularity over the years. It's a bit sad that people spend so much money on totally forgettable ""entertainment"" and let true jewels like ""Big Fish"" pass by. On the other hand, those brainless productions will be forgotten in a blink of an eye while the gems will live on. Just like Edward Bloom's stories in the movie. <br/><br/>Full points. It's a classic."

","Seeing this film at the cinema, I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of my favorite films of 2003, it is full of quirky interesting characters who make it come alive. I loved all the characters but it was Karl, the giant who stood out for me, with his lopsided head and gentle nature. The story is that of a man who feels he hardly knows his father. His fathers tales of his life, seem so unbelievable and unreal that the son refuses to believe him and seeks to find the real man. However the evidence points to his dad telling the truth. Evedince in his shead proves that he did indeed fight in the war and was presumed dead, that he did try to sell hands with utensils on and that specter was a real place for which he had property deeds. The flashback scenes showing the circus and the fathers life were particularly enjoyable especially when time is frozen so he can get closer to the girl of his dreams. To his annoyance time then speeds up and she is gone before he can touch her. What he would have done with her if this state continued, I don't know because she would have been frozen like that for however long. Getting all the circus people to freeze must have been a challenge though because, thats how it was done. They simply froze stiffly and diddn't move whilst he walked carefully amonge them. I liked the caravan scene. You are ment to think the circus guy is in with a lady doing you know what but then he bursts out as a werewolf It makes me wonder how much of it could really happen in real life. Could someone really stumble upon an idyllic little village like spectre where they don't need shoes to get around or any of the other things? Comparisons to the book. The book was small and a Quick easy read, with not enough interesting bits whereas the film had expanded on the book and joined it smoothly together to make a wonderful film. OVERALL My favourite bit was the birth of the baby who comes ouy cleanly and shoots across the floor into the arms of a nurse. How come the umbilical cord was already detached? It reminded me of an ad on TV where a baby boy is born and he shoots through the air growing into a man as he goes. <br/><br/>Basically SEE THIS FILM!! I did."

Any fans of strong cinema or fans of good story telling will love this movie.<br/><br/>Director Tim Burton (Batman, Sleepy Hollow) is a talented, original film-maker, and was a strong choice to direct. He often makes fairy-stories, and here he has left behind much of his trademark gothic darkness, replacing it instead with light and cheer and simple imagination.<br/><br/>(Big Fish is also a return to form after Planet of the Apes - but let's not go there)<br/><br/>Billy Crudup plays Will Bloom, who returns home when his father Ed (Albert Finney) has cancer. He feels as though he doesn't know his father, who only tells tall tales  embellished stories to entertain. <br/><br/>Based on the book by Daniel Wallace, the inventive and clever plot revolves around the story of Ed Bloom's life (Ewan McGregor plays the younger Ed Bloom), and his love for his wife Sandra. It's almost like Forrest Gump, in that Ed enjoys a rich and exciting life  which may never have really happened. Midgets, cars in trees, picture-perfect towns, big fish and giants all meld together with remarkable fun.<br/><br/>Albert Finney and Jessica Lange portray their characters with realism, and sitting that style of acting against a fanciful plot works cleverly. The acting and the plot offset and compound each other, making the movie stronger.<br/><br/>This is sheer genius movie-making, and interestingly, works without violence or the need to shock or scare.

","Tim Burton has been making visually striking films for years and over the course of his career has developed a huge fan base for his eclectic film making and unique style. However following the widely criticized ""Planet of the Apes"" re-make, people have wondered whether Burton had lost his edge and given in to studio pressure. Well fans can rest easy as ""Big Fish"" is a remarkable return to form. Often criticized for concentrating on visuals rather than storytelling (although I'm sure ""Ed Wood"" demonstrates a fantastic marriage of both) ""Big Fish"" not only has a touching human story at it's core, but supplies the material for some of Burtons most beautiful visuals so far. Edward Bloom (Old: Albert Finney, Young: Ewan McGregor) has told the story of his life with a mixture of truth and ""amusing lies"". His stories entertain and endear him to everyone he meets, save for his son who has not spoken to him for years. However as he lies dying of cancer, his son returns home to try and discover the truth of his fathers life. It is through Edwards conversations with other characters that we are treated to his tall tales. The stories, ranging from Edwards short lived circus career to his adventures as a traveling salesman, treat the viewer to a group of beautifully realized characters brought to life by a fantastic ensemble cast such as Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Billy Cruddup. However for me the two best performances come from Albert Finney who has more than enough charm and charisma as the old Edward, and Jessica Lange as his wife. Their chemistry is great and you never doubt their love.However I found the whole cast to be spot on as were the visuals. While the story is told, Edwards embellishments mean Burton can still display his trademark Gothic visuals (the witch, the introduction to the giant), but now also creates sun kissed beautiful images (the town of Spectre, the car underwater). So while this film is not as dark as previous efforts, it is no less beautiful. Long time collaborator Danny Elfmans score is uplifting and one of the most distinctive of the past year and the special effects spot on serving only to compliment the story.<br/><br/>Some may find this films irregular narrative difficult or simply not appreciate the eccentricities of the film. However if you enjoyed Burtons work such as Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood, you'll find a hugely enjoyable film just as great on repeat viewings."

Planet of the Apes was a disaster, and Burtons previous films seemed but a thing of the past.<br/><br/>Then I saw this, and I adored it for so many reasons. <br/><br/>1) Albert Finney/Ewan Mcgregor - Put together fine performances that complement one another, one the idealistic young man out to face the unknown world outside the perfect small town. The other, an aged, dying man forced to come to terms with his almost non-existant relationship with his son.<br/><br/>2) Danny Elfman - Back with a vengance after the boring sounds of Spiderman and Hulk, Elfman has always found a great collaborator in Burton and here is no exception. <br/><br/>3) The ending - Up with my top ten endings of all time.

","This is a typically imaginative and charming film from maestro Tim Burton. After the disappointment of Burtons Planet Of The Apes he goes back to his quirky and unique roots. Films like Edward Scissorhands, BeetleJuice, Sleepy Hollow, which are all specialities of Burton and Big Fish has that feeling. It allows him to show of his visual flair, his humour and his charm.<br/><br/>Big Fish follows the relationship between Edward Bloom (Albert Finney), a much liked and respected man who is allows spinning exaggerated yarns about his life. His son Will is becoming disenchanted with his dying fathers refusal to tell the truth about stories of his life. Will feels he does not know who is father really is. The film basically shows much of Eds like in flashback told in the style of one of Blooms creatively licensed fairy tales. At the same time we follow the relationship in the present day between Will and his dad as Will tries to investigate who his dad really is. As the film progresses and we see more fantastical snippets of Edwards life, from his encounter with a Witch that reveals how he will die, to him wooing the love of his life Sandra, who he married and has stayed with ever since. Will gradually begins to discover that many of the strange characters and events his father encountered were in fact real, albeit exaggerated, from his friend Karl the 15ft giant to a strange town called Sceptre. By the end f course Will starts to appreciate his fathers stories all the more and feels a connection long since gone.<br/><br/>This film is filled with charm and pathos and is just a really enjoyably unique film. The fact that these flashbacks are eccentric stories allows Burton to have full visual flourish. The cast are excellent. Finney is great as Ed Bloom, he steals the show. His performance is both touching and full of boisterous charisma. Jessica Lange is also good as his adoring wife. As for the younger versions of Edward and Sandra, well they are excellently portrayed by Ewan McGregor and delightfully loveable Alison Lohman. Billy Crudup is very good to as Will. There is also great support from Danny Devito, Steve Buscemi and Helena Bonham-Carter.<br/><br/>Burtons musical collaborator the legendary Danny Elfman gives us all another virtuoso score and one that is far more understated and low-key than Elfman usually is asked to provide. Overall this is a magical film and a return to form for one of cinemas great visual directors, Tim Burton. ****"

","I always like Tim Burton's work, and this film is no exception. He has a darker vision than most directors and a strong grasp of the just-over-the edge life, plus some humor about it. Big Fish is nearly allegorical in it's structure and narrative, and for the most part I appreciate the obvious effort at FILM MAKING, but despite the strong directing and generally very good acting, this film didn't really satisfy. This is a good film, but not in the same league as Edward ScissorHands or Beetlejuice.

","Picture a man in his forties reading a book in his comfortable chair. He's laughing, screaming 'I love it!' and thinking: I will make this into a movie.<br/><br/>This is what must have happened when Tim Burton read Daniel Wallace's 'Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions'. Now, I haven't read it myself, but if it's anything like the movie (and why wouldn't it), I can see why Burton loved it so much he wanted to turn it into a movie.<br/><br/>You see, Big Fish is one big fairytale. And Burton has something going for fairytales. Look at The Nightmare Before Christmas, Sleepy Hollow or Edward Scissorhands. I wouldn't even have been surprised if Edward would have turned up in this wild fantasy story called Big Fish, where stories about midgets, giants, hidden towns, siamese twins and the inevitable big fish make up for one the most touching films ever to be put on screen.<br/><br/>Ed Bloom sr. (Albert Finney) loves telling the stories about his 'adventures' when he was young (Ewan McGreggor). And when he was young, Ed Bloom jr. (Billy Crudup) loved hearing them. But once you hear the same story hundreds and hundreds of times, you're getting bored with them. And when your dad tells them again on your wedding night, you get mad. It's what happens as these two get into a fight, not to speak again for the next three years.<br/><br/>It is at that time that Jr. is about to become a first-time dad while Sr. is on his deathbed, they meet again. And this time, Jr. wants his old man to tell the truth for once and for all, instead of these lies, how amusing they might be.<br/><br/>And they are amusing. As well as touching. Remarkable. Fantastic. Beautiful. I won't go into them too deeply, but they include giants, midget-werewolves and poets slash bankrobbers slash wall-street millionaires. And it are stories about the love for a one-eyed witch and, of course, those really big fish.<br/><br/>But in the end, it's the story of the father and son, of truth, of friendship, and in the end, of love. The way Jr. 'talks' his father into death is breath-taking, exhilarating, it's wonderful. The first movie that almost took me to tears since I saw 'Ordinary People' for the first time about a year ago.<br/><br/>I always wanted to say this: It may be just my very humble opinion, but I have no problem proclaiming 'Big Fish' to be the best movie of 2003.<br/><br/>9/10."

","Throughout his life, Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) has always been a man of big appetites, enormous passions and tall tales. In his later years,(Albert Finney) however, he remains a mystery to his son, William (Billy Crudup). Now, sitting by his father's deathbed, Will is forced to get to know the real man. By piecing together a true picture of his father from flashbacks of Edward's amazing adventures, he is finally able to understand the great man that his father was. Big Fish is a movie that is as dazzling to watch as it is moving emotionally. I love how it's slightly exaggerated in certain parts and the humour is very subtle. The cinematography is fantastic, the scene when Sandra opens her window and sees Edward standing in a field of daffodils planted there just for her is just incredible. The film has a great cast of actors. Ewan McGregor is probably the best thing in the film, not just because he's basically the life of the story, but the guy can anything, any role he takes on he shines. Albert Finney is also pretty good, I love the scene when he tells Josephine about how he and Sandra met, how he sort of flirts with her at the beginning. I must admit that I'm not the biggest Tim Burton fan, although I do watch his films, most of them anyway.  I think Big Fish is one of his best, it's got a bit of everything.

"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","15 May 2004"," uneven but ultimately moving
","`Big Fish' is the latest bit of calculated whimsy from famed director Tim Burton.  With a screenplay by John August based on the Daniel Wallace novel, Burton tells the tale of Edward Bloom, a man whose whole life has been one `big fish story' after another.  Now old and facing death, Bloom needs to come up with a rousing finale to cap off his largely fictionalized life. Bloom's son, William, a realist and pragmatist, bitterly resents the `lies' his father has been feeding him ever since he was a boy, and yearns, in these last moments together, to hear the `true' story of the old man's life. But, in his investigation into the veracity of all the tall tales he's been told, William discovers that there may be more truth to these myths and legends than he has ever allowed himself to believe.  He also realizes that, in debunking all the whoppers, he will be depriving his father of the one real trait that defines him as a person and that distinguishes him from everybody else.<br/><br/>The title of the film actually functions on two symbolic levels simultaneously.  On the one hand, it reflects the fictionalized nature of Bloom's life and the grandiose egotism of his character.  On the other, Bloom is, himself, the `big fish' in a small pond, as he leaves his mark on the world around him.  `Big Fish' is actually most effective in the scenes set in the present, as father and son come to terms with the quality that each dislikes most about the other.  William feels deceived by a father who, despite the fact that he made himself appear to be a larger-than-life heroic figure, was actually just a mediocre, often-absent dad, too busy with his secret `fantasy' life to make time for his own lonely son (the story has strong echoes of `Death of a Salesman' in its underlying vision and theme). Bloom, in a similar way, finds his son lacking in the kind of large-scale imagination that Bloom feels makes life worth living.<br/><br/>The film is considerably less successful in the `flashback' scenes tracing Bloom's life from his own birth to his son's early childhood.  The scenes are all elaborately staged in the best Tim Burton manner  filled with hauntingly mythical settings, surrealistic events and doses of Magic Realism - but the filmmakers can't overcome the unfortunate fact that these sequences are essentially as uninteresting and irritating as real `fish stories' tend to be.  Bloom's `adventures' come across as dime-novel vignettes, which is supposed to be the point, I guess, but it still means that we are squirming with impatience through large  indeed very large  stretches of the film.  Every time we come back to the present  to real, flesh-and-blood human beings  our interest picks back up.  That's why the film, in its latter stages, becomes such a moving and profound experience, as we finally get to see and know the real man who is Edward Bloom, wrinkles, warts and all.<br/><br/>Burton has assembled a wonderful cast for the occasion.  The marvelous Albert Finney plays the dying Bloom and invests the film with an emotional depth just by his mere presence in the role.  Ewan MacGregor does a fine job as the young, idealistic Bloom, while Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman enact the parts of Bloom's wife present and past (MacGregor and Lohman look as if they could truly grow up to be Finney and Lange).  Billy Crudup brings a subtle depth to the role of William and the scenes between him and Finney truly touch the heart.  Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi and Danny De Vito round out the impressive cast.<br/><br/>Maybe it says more about me than it does about the film that I ended up liking the parts that were the LEAST Burton-esque the best.  But, then again, this is from someone who thinks that the comparatively earthbound `Ed Wood' is Burton's best film."
"jasonsurety","8","0","0","12 May 2004"," Embellishment
","Big Fish is a unique and fascinating movie.  While the comparison to The Wizard of Oz may be a little high-reaching(in 1939 The Wizard of Oz was a landmark film beyond what Big Fish is today), I can see why people may make that connection.  They are both whimsical tales of adventure.  Visually, it is fictive, but not in the way the Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter movies are.  The chimera in Edward Bloom's mind is understated.  We see what we are meant to see: an embellishment of what really happened.  Yes, many of the scenes representing Bloom's stories are impossible, but they are not as incredible as other stories and fantasies.<br/><br/>
William Bloom(Billy Crudup) is a fellow who started viewing his father as an extraordinary hero, then a tall tale teller and finally as a liar.  During his wedding night, William is perturbed when his father tells a story about catching a gigantic fish with a wedding ring.  One he's heard since childhood.  William feels he is only a ""footnote"" in the story and his father is telling it merely to stroke his own ego.  After this event, William and Edward(Albert Finney) do not speak for three years.  When William's mother, Sandra(Jessica Lange), calls to tell of Edward's poor health and ensuing death, he decides to see his father and find the truth about the man he knows only through the outlandish stories he's heard.<br/><br/>
The opening scenes show that William is not only upset with his father for telling him these stories, but he's tired of hearing them told to his friends, dates and anyone else old Edward can get an ear from.  Flashbacks abound throughout.  We soon delve into the visual presentation of these stories as they are told.  As William makes it home to see his dying dad, we go back in time to see Edward as a young boy and then as a young man, played with jocund bravado by Ewan McGregor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>As we begin young Edward's adolescence, he is talented at basketball, football and baseball.  He, in his own words, is the biggest thing the town of Ashton had ever seen.  We are immediately taken into the fictional parts of the tales.  First, Ed Bloom encounters a witch, a giant: a man as big as a two story house.  An enchanted forest is next, then a werewolf and on and on we go.  The town of Spectre is seen like everything else: through the embellishing eye of Edward.  This is an important part of the film because it is a place like many may stop in their lives.  Its a town that seems like a great place to stay.  Yet something is calling Edward somewhere else.  It is looked back on with nostalgia and as a would-be wonderful final destination, but not a place to be when you are young and filled with ambition and adventure.  This resonates deeply with anyone who has ever found themselves in an unexpected town or city that seemed terrific, yet they knew they had to leave.<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the most remarkable things about the film is the resemblance between Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney as well as Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange(young and old Sandra).  This is simply perfect casting.  Many films lack this.  They use the same actor for young and old roles.  This works much better.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>Another of the endearing qualities of the film is that as William slowly realizes his father isn't the liar he thought, the flashbacks become less fairy tale and slowly seem more realistic.  This intertwines beautifully. Finally, we see the giant as just an abnormally tall man of about 7'6"".  We see that the twins from his military exploits aren't really conjoined, but simply identical twins.  So in the end, William sees his father for what he is.  He's not a liar, and he's not the hero he was to William as a child. He's a tall tale teller.  A man who romanticizes his stories and embellishes them so that they are a bit larger than life.  The question is, is there any real harm in that, or does it just make life a little sweeter?"

"sophiesxtras","Null","0","0","4 May 2004"," Film Overview and Review
","The title and posters may give the impression of Dr. Suess, but this film is Tim Burton at his best. It harks back to his classics, combining the 50s-ness of Edward Scissorhands and eerie forests of Sleepy Hollow, to provide an enchanting blend of fantasy and realism. Burton has found his ideal protagonist in Edward Bloom - a man so tangled up in tales of fact and fantastic that his son William feels he's never known his father. The film is both a celebration of Ed's life and the story of his sons discovery that his dying father is not the liar he always thought him to be. Whether young (Mcgregor) or old (Finney), Ed is loveable and inspirational, partly due to his yarn weaving, but mostly because of his carpe diem, rose-tinted spectacle attitude to life.  His entertaining and whimsical adventures include encounters with a giant, a werewolf and a witch, not to mention the films namesake, a great Big Fish - to which there are many allusions during the course of the film. However, the balance of this delightful film hangs by a thread as Will, Billy Crudup, in 4-weddings-and-a-funeral-esk style, delivers a singularly terrible line in an emotionally charged bedside scene. But Burton manages to recover most of his dignity in the final phase of the movie, by reminding us of all the characters who have made us chuckle and entertained us so thoroughly throughout the movie. By doing so, the pieces of the puzzle that is Ed's life, fall into place. It is a beautifully crafted cinematic experience and one of Burton's finest. Sophie Tan"

Even in the fictional story that fact needs to be either addressed or explained lest the viewer start to wonder what is wrong.<br/><br/>The fact that Helen Bonham Carter played two characters was explained even when it wasn't purely necessary-there is no way that a listener would confuse the little girl grown up with the witch. We do of course, because we have seen both characters, but Billy Crudup's Will Bloom wouldn't realize that there was a problem he has never seen the witch.<br/><br/>All of this is too bad, for otherwise it is good story well told and the acting is fine all around.

The performances are outstanding by the entire cast, especially Albert Finney's portrayal of the older, dying Edward Bloom. The stories within the story have a fairy tale look and feel about them that can make you feel like you're watching a film for the first time. However, be prepared for a lump in your throat and a wet cheek or two toward the end.

Especially as Ed is descending from the forest (hell) into the vibrant, bleached world of Spectre? Strangely, though, this heaven seems to act as a device of temptation for Ed.

","In an episode of ""Tiny Toon Adventures"" where the students of Acme Looniversity are showing the movies they made in film class, everyone expects Gogo Dodo's entry to be full-on wackiness - instead it's a (relatively) restrained live-action tale about two people dancing (actually a drastically edited-down version of one of the Joe McDoakes short subjects, ""So You Want To Learn To Dance""); when Babs complains, Gogo argues that he can't be expected to stay to type all the time.<br/><br/>This, I think, is what's behind general critical response in the UK to ""Big Fish"" - there's no acid here, no full-on weirdness, no dark, edgy atmosphere... it's more sentimental than most of Tim Burton's other movies, but does that make it bad? Or does that make it his most personal movie since ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and certainly a return to form after his sojourn to the ""Planet of the Apes""? I'll go for the latter; he's always shown some warmth in his best work when you think about it - it's just that this time it's for ""normal"" people. You could almost say that it's his lightest movie since ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" (another movie about an odyssey and the people the hero meets on the way).<br/><br/>The movie's part a father-son drama and part the ""Forrest Gump""-ish odyssey of a man through life, as told by the older man (Albert Finney) to those around him; everyone loves his stories except his serious-minded son (Billy Crudup), who's never really gotten over his dad's tendency to prefer a good yarn to the truth. But he's not so estranged that he doesn't come home from Paris with his wife to be by his ill father's side; for a lot of the movie John August's adaptation of Daniel Wallace's book can't quite find a satisfactory balance between the relationship between father and son and the tales the former tells about his life, which may or may not be total lies (it's not until near the end of the movie that we [sort of] find out for sure), but that's okay because Finney's story is so involving we wind up caring about him and the bond with his son anyway.<br/><br/>Burton's empathy with the strange (a giant, a circus owner with a secret, a mysterious little town) is coupled with his gift to make the bizarre seem everyday, plus Ewan McGregor's performance - his shifting accent notwithstanding - to make this journey fun and touching, even if it does seem almost as fragmented as ""Catch Me If You Can"" (though the usual Tim Burton ""Story? What story?"" approach is reined in for once). It must be said that it's not as emotional as the wonderful ""Forrest Gump"" was (hang cool, detached irony, I LOVE that movie), and Helena Bonham Carter manages to overact in one of her two roles - the one which doesn't require any dialogue, oddly enough - but like the characters in the movie, you could go on the journeys the man describes forever.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" has a fine supporting cast (Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Danny DeVito, Robert Guillaume, the marvellous Steve Buscemi, the Tai twins...), striking images, and another wonderful Danny Elfman score - Elfman's finale music combines with what comprises said finale to make it a super finish to the tale - but ultimately the story is what makes this movie. Whether or not you see the movie as one big tall tale, by the end we truly see the man as a big fish - one in a big pond; it's a movie about being an individual that doesn't go out of its way to damn everyone for not being as wonderful. It won't work for the shoegazers of the world, but that wasn't Burton's aim here."

","`They say when you meet the love of your life. Time stops. And that's true.'  Ed Bloom.<br/><br/>
What a great screenplay adaptation by John August!  I don't know who he is, but this is the beautification of a simple, yet endearing story between a dying father, Albert Finney, and his son, Billy Crudup, who is dying for the truth.  It deals with the age old  question of what reality is and makes you believe that if you tell a tall tale often enough, it will still be a tall tale, but you will be always immortalized for it.<br/><br/> This is an excellent movie for parents, especially dads, to see with their kids.   Given our society, it is especially warm and unusually rare to see the portrayal of a father in a such a loving and even innocent way.<br/><br/> I loved the role of Ed Bloom.  There is an Ed Bloom in all of us.  We all dream like Ed, and sometimes we'll even tell a tall tale or two like him, to make life more entertaining.   More important than the obvious is what the movie gracefully whispers in your ear:  Judge a person by his character more than by what he is saying.   In this case Ed Bloom's character was that of a fine man.  He may have embellished, or just plain lied on some of his `stories', but he was a father who loved and cherished his wife and saw to it that his son was always entertained.  <br/><br/>
In the beginning of the film, you the audience will scoff at the stories which Tim Burton injects to us ala Forrest Gump.   Like his son, we were all cynics.  Yet, I guarantee that you wont be able to wait to see what happens next.   His fascinating stories drew me in, and made his character all the more loveable.  After awhile, one could care less about the stories, as you do about the man who is telling them. His positive strength, the key factor here.   Even if he did not always choose the right path, his heart and conviction were always in the right place, as he always professed this to those he loved. <br/><br/>
To me, the most heartwarming subplot of all, was Ed's recounting of his quest for Sandra.  Sandra was his love-at-first-site, one that he would never give up on (hooray).  A love that would have him do whatever it took, regardless of the insurmountable odds .  Regardless of whether you believed all of the details regarding his quest for Sandra or not, there are some of us who really have a `Sandra' in their lives, and would do the same or more if the opportunity presented itself.<br/><br/>
`I just saw the woman I'm going to marry.  I know it.  But I lost her. I'm going to spend every day of the rest of my life looking for her.  That, or die alone.'  Ed Bloom<br/><br/>
After everything that Ed goes through, including coming face to face with the `all-american' jerk that was engaged to Sandra, what a great sub-ending we witness when he finally wins her heart and hand in marriage.  Score a big win for the underdog!  That is what life should be about, and the powerful message of this alone I think overshadows the son's struggle to learn the truth about his Dad.   Sandra, by the way, is played by Jessica Lange.  She does a wonderful job portraying the loving, stable force in Ed's life.  We should all be so lucky to have someone like a Sandra in our lives.  In fact, it makes you think that all of the crazy things that he did to win her over, were very well justified.  Therefore, another positive and subtle message: If you want someone or something bad enough, you will do whatever it takes.<br/><br/>
The young Ed Bloom is played Ewan McGregor.  He does a fine job, even though I kept expecting him to pull a light saber at any given momentlol    <br/><br/><br/><br/>The movie's end is predictable, but still powerful.  The audience will mature as his son does at the emotionally charged ending.  Get some hankies ready, once we finally see the passing of the torch.  This happens when his son relents, and make a big tall tale of his own to satisfy his father's final request.  <br/><br/>
In the end, the movie brilliantly establishes the fact that in life, character has nothing to do about  what kind of truth in stories that a person is telling, but what kind of truth in a person does his or her stories tell.<br/><br/>

","This movie brings a smile to your face.  Albert Finney is excellent as a tall talking old man who is trying to comes to terms with his son before he dies.  Ewan McGregor is also excellent as a young Finney who goes on extraordinary adventures.  We know where this movie is going and yet we enjoy the ride.  Will the son find evidence that some of what his father says is true?  What do you think?  I remember the late Gene Siskel used to say that fathers got a bad rap in movies.  They were cheating and nonexistant people for their sons.  Well, this movie is a coming together of fathers and sons.  With way too many cynical movies out there today, this is a welcome change.  I highly recommend this movie.  I give it an 8/10."

","I bought Big Fish sight unseen because of the trailers I saw on it and because I am a big fan of Tim Burton and Ewan McGregor.  This film was delightful and was more of a mainstream drama than anything I have seen Tim Burton direct before.  Granted, there were some mystical characters in the film, but overall it was very much a well done story about a grown man who desperately wants to find out who the man who is his father really is.  His father played by Albert Finney as an old man and Ewan McGregor as a young man tendency to stretch the truth a bit about events that occurred in his life.  The son played by Billy Crudup appears resentful and embarassed of his father because his father won't answer a question with a straight answer.  The whole film is a combination of flashback and current events documenting the life of a truly remarkable man, whether the fathers stories make him more interesting or not, the man himself is remarkable simply in his ability to spin yars like he can.  The movie has a rather undramatic ending but it does leave the viewer with closure as the son finally understands who his dad is, even if he was reluctant to believe the story at first.  Tim Burton does a very good job in guiding this film from start to finish.  It is comical at times, heartfelt at others, but at no time does the story seem so completely out in left field to be unbelievable.  I was leery of taking my children 11 & 6 to see this film as from the trailers, it appeared to be somewhat scary, however after seeing it, I feel I would be comfortable in sharing it with children."

","""Most men, they'll tell you a story straight true. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.""<br/><br/>Big Fish is a film all about such stories not the straight true ones but rather the interesting ones.  Stories as they were told by Edward Bloom to his son William, since the day Will was born.  The stories are tall tales of adventure that several fathers tell their children (as the movie opens) either around campfires, as bedtime stories, or as anecdotes at family gatherings.  Edward's stories are filled with fantasy, danger, excitement, humour, and even romance. <br/><br/>These stories, to Will's dismay, never stopped.  Edward told them well into Will's adult life, and often to Will's embarrassment, and ultimately forced the two to stop speaking with one another.<br/><br/>Now, due to Ed's failing health, Will returns home but is persistent on knowing the truth about his father.  He insists that his father put aside his tall tales and come to grips with what really happened in his life. Will wants so much to know who his father really is before he dies, that he won't even allow his father his final days as he would prefer.<br/><br/>The story switches back and forth, from real/present time, and back into Ed's stories.  Even through the fantasy and exaggerations, we learn more about Ed Bloom through his stories than we do from anything else perhaps because this is all he has left.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has put together an amazing tale in Big Fish and has displayed it in an amazing way.  We get to see first hand (so to speak) Edward's stories in all their exaggerated fantasy as only Edward Bloom could have told them.<br/><br/>At the same time, we get a very REAL story about a son and father who have drifted apart. They were ""strangers who knew each other well"" as Will puts it, and brought back together because of his father's illness.  It's not that Will doesn't love his father, but he so much wants to connect with him that he gets frustrated when all Ed wants is to live in his stories.<br/><br/>As Ed's stories are brought to life on screen, they are perfectly crafted and shot vibrantly (when vibrancy is of essence).  Of course, these images are extraordinarily bright and at times exaggerated, but justly so, as we expect that this is the way the stories were told.  Tim Burton is well known for his unique imagery, and Big Fish takes full advantage of Burton's visionary and imaginative talents.<br/><br/>The characters that are included in Ed's stories, including the younger Ed Bloom himself (played by Ewan McGregor) are also a bit exaggerated, but they need to be for the purpose of the stories.  The characters in real/present time are truly believable in their feelings toward with the bed ridden Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney).  His wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange) loves him dearly his son William (Billy Crudup) although frustrated loves his father and Will's wife, Josephine (Marion Cotillard) who doesn't know Ed, seems to enjoy his charm.  All have their individual and distinct relationship with Ed, throughout the picture.<br/><br/>Big Fish is an exceptionally moving film. It's charming and fantastic enough to share with your children, warm and romantic enough for couples of all ages, and touching and moving enough to knock down even the strongest of viewers. <br/><br/>Although the film was out last year, I didn't catch Big Fish until its recent release on DVD.  As such, it is the best film I have seen so far this year.  Big Fish is available for rent or purchase on DVD.  It holds my high recommendation and should not be missed.  <br/><br/>I'm granting it an IMDB rating... 8.5 out of 10"

","A long time Tim Burton fan, I was anxious to see this film for the story of a father who tells tales that you can't quite figure out if they are unbelievably ridiculous or true in a sense but exaggerated beyond belief. Whatever it is, it works in the way that we find out what we need to find out. Ewan Macgregor looks as though he stepped out of a 50's Crest Toothpaste commercial; Albert Finney who is always wise beyond his years. Yes there are elements of the ridiculous- Karl the giant, the Japanese twins and Calloway the circus manager (who is something else entirely by night). But it's okay-because in the end, it develops as a beautiful father/son story."

"shinymc_shine","8","0","0","22 April 2004"," Big Leap Forward For Burton.
","Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is a dramatic film set in reality with tall tales interspersed throughout the narrative. Director Burton's created a handsome, storybook fantasy that's delightfully pure of heart, thoroughly entertaining and gently humourous. This is perfect subject matter for him and recalls some of his previous movies, especially ""Edward Scissorhands"".<br/><br/> Billy Crudup's estranged from his father, Albert Finney. They haven't communicated in years, living on separate continents. When Finney falls ill, his son returns home to hopefully patch up their relationship with his main agenda being to find out the truth about his father's fantastical, earlier life. Crudup feels lied to and embarrassed by his father from childhood into adulthood. Spending time with him, searching through his personals, he begins to see his father for the man he is and learns to accept his exaggerated anecdotes.<br/><br/> Ewan McGregor plays the young Finney in the flashback sequences. He's completely believable as Finney's younger self and is optimistic, charming and larger than life, much like his adventures. The bed ridden Finney is also up to par and adds a welcome dose of prestige to the film due to his prescience. His loving wife is adeptly played by the glamourous Jessica Lange and her younger self by the talented Alison Lohman. If you thought McGregor and Finney were perfect casting, Lange and Lohman as the same character is inspired. Crudup has the more serious role rooted more in realism than the other characters. While ""Big Fish"" is primarily about Finney and his overtly embellished stories, it is Crudup's film, his search for the truth of a man he hardly knows, his own father. Crudup's realism is the grounding force, the one character we identify with. Duel player Helena Bonham Carter, the hard working Steve Buscemi and Burton regular Danny De Vito are swell in support.<br/><br/> Screenwriter John August, who wrote the original comedy Doug Liman's ""Go"", has been wasting his time of late writing or doctoring the Charlie's Angels movies. It's good to see that his sense of humour is still in check and that his talent of writing intelligent, non-linear screenplays is as sharp as ever.<br/><br/> This has elements of the kind of film that Burton does well. It certainly is an improvement over his last movie, the remake or retelling of ""Planet Of The Apes"". While the fantasy sequences are expertly handled, this is the first film Burton's done that's been established firmly in reality. He did direct the Edward D. Wood Jr. biopic ""Ed Wood"", but that film was stylised, shot in black and white with an over the top, caricature portrayal by Johnny Depp. This is Burton's most down-to-earth film and shows that he's capable of making intimate dramas other than the sci-fi/fantasy genre that's become his trademark.<br/><br/> Overall, this is a tried and true Burton fantasy mixed with a parental drama he hasn't tried before. All the performances are right proving that Burton isn't just interested in the weird and the surreal. This is a giant step forward for the director and is a defining moment in his oeuvre."

","Big Fish is a pretty incredible story that, more than anything else, makes me wonder if this is how director Tim Burton viewed the world as a child. Judging by the atmosphere of his other films, I would guess that young Burton had a more wild imagination than most. And, it made for some fine films. <br/><br/>The movie starts out with one too many flashbacks in the first few minutes as Will is going to tell you (in too many words) that his father always told him storys, and that these are the stories you will see as he told them to him. But, after those few minutes, things work out smoothly once the audience is able to get one track about what's going on.<br/><br/>
Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as a boy, enjoyed his father's (Albert Finney) remarkable tall tales about himself as a bold, adventurous young man (Ewan McGregor). But, Will, later in life, is tired of hearing the stories repeated at every occassion as his father gladly orates to eager audiences the wild stories. As Will explains, ""The thing about icebergs in that you only see 10% of them. The other 90% are under water."" He thinks that his father's stories only reveal to him, 10 percent of who his father is. And as he is visiting his father who is dying of cancer, Will pleads with him to tell him some facts as he wants to share the legacy of his father with his own child, whom his wife is expecting. But as his father insists, these tall tales are anything but fiction, and are quite revealing of the true Edward Bloom. As the story goes along, the things we think to be fact and fiction are not always so.<br/><br/>This is especially a great movie for young kids. The movie is quite cartoonish in appearance, kind of like the live-action cartoonish atmosphere that Blake Edwards was able to achieve in 'The Great Race,' which aids in carrying you away to the reality of Edward Bloom. <br/><br/>Edward Bloom (both Finney and McGregor) narrates the various comical situations he encounters in his travels as the 'Big Fish' who outgrows many environments (and thus his reason for always embarking on different, larger adventures). It is like Alice wondering through the looking glass, or Dorothy travelling to see the Wizard, as each of young Edward Bloom's always involve something incredible, and whatever seems least likely, should always be expected. Big Fish is a fantastic rendition of a modern Tall Tales.<br/><br/>
I was a little disappointed in that the movie seems to be missing that particularly magic Burton 'umpf' that was always present in his earlier films (pre-Planet of the Apes). Something so rich and so uniquely Burton, I just can't seem to figure out what's missing or why. I think part of it has to do with the intermitten reverting back to reality of old man Edward Bloom (Finney) and his interactions with his family. Perhaps it breaks up the dreamy world of the tall tales of young Edward Bloom. I'm not sure about that yet.<br/><br/>But otherwise, it is was a wonderful idea and turned out to be a quite a remarkable undertaking, with Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor, who are really the major stars of the production, giving fine performances."

","Tim Burton certainly has a unique vision.  The everyday, and potentially suburban meets with the distorted and the bizzarre to create a surreal, and powerful film.  The reunion betwween a dying man and his estranged son, as the son seeks to understand the man his father was- feasible, and ordinary, if a little sad, serves as a basis to transport the viewer into a world of fantastic fairy tales.  Witches, giants, and siamese twin lounge singers populate the incredible life of Edward Bloom, played with mastery by Albert Finney as the dying storyteller, and Ewan Mcgregor as the younger, adventuring version.  What is most captivating to the viewer, however, is so much not the incredible fantasy of the image, which, it cannot be denied is striking in its grotesque beauty, but the humanity at the centre of the tale.  For this is where Burton truely shines- love, and interaction with no element of cloying Hollywood sentimentality.  A truly wonderful film."

I was also amazed by Burtons storytelling. Some people say the movie is hard to keep track on. They have obviously not seen many Tim Burton movies. I found it quite easy to follow and maybe that was why i enjoyed it so much; Burton being able to make an easy picture while still holding on to his characteristic signature. (simplicity rules!) I know not all Burton-fans share my opinion on this, but I say this for the ones who found Edward Scissorhand a bit hard to watch. Not because of the story, but the progression of it. But back to the movie: Albert Finney does a marvellous screen performance, even better than in Millers Crossing. And it was a relief to see Ewan McGregor in shape.

"WheezyJoe","9","0","0","6 April 2004"," The Storyteller
","It's rather ironic that Tim Burton has found himself making `Big Fish.' He's famously known for utilizing attention-grabbing visuals to slide the story into a slightly offbeat fantasy world and is often criticized for being more in tune with the esthetics rather than script details. Still, he works under scrutiny from the critics in a medium that tells the tallest of tales but to an audience that is divided over the best way of telling them. Some love the storybook method of adventure and the fantastic, while others don't buy into it and prefer a movie with a heavy foot planted firmly on solid ground. Those of you in the latter will not enjoy Burton's movies but may tolerate them. This is the message in `Big Fish.' It is between Edward Bloom and his son, Will. They both have different perceptions of what is important and what is baloney.<br/><br/>The fantasy genre is slowly making a stand for itself after years of being second to others in the Hollywood vocab. In `Big Fish' they make extra evident that fantasy is far more intoxicating than reality and that you can find boundless pleasure in its escapism. Yet `Big Fish' not only tells an entertaining story but it also invokes the imagination. Tim Burton is a very good storyteller, I think, because his visual eye is perfect for the big screen. This time Burton and company manage to combine the best of all elements and make a truly amazing film. <br/><br/>This whimsical Tim Burton movie keeps a finger on the human elements, emotion and spirit. The manner in which it is told, with amazing characters found in tall tales, is inherently likeable, as a good yarn has always been over many generations. There is nothing too deep here, just a good story to be shared with the world. And that's the fundamental nature of going to the movies in the first place, to listen to an entertaining story, and this one is told with enthusiasm and heart. `Big Fish' will be as good as you want it to be. The general message is this and it's important to appreciate how the way a story is told can effect your very perception. You must first give into it, kind of like a leap of faith for some, but once you've let go of the world the story will happily reel you in hook, line and sinker.<br/><br/>4 out of 5"

","""Big Fish"" is the type of movie that made me think about the good things in life and inspires me to make the most of my life. We all know someone in our lives that would tell some big stories that would let our imaginations run wild, particularly when we were little kids. ""Big Fish"" centers on a father that does this frequently and a son that doesn't know whether to believe anything his father has told him.<br/><br/>All the stories are fun and intriguing with great directing and imagery from Tim Burton and fine acting by everyone involved in this picture. Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor (who I just realized is one of my favorite actors, possibly because of my Star Wars bias) effectively bring the adventurous storyteller, Edward Bloom, to life. Both actors were just fun to watch in this movie as was Danny DeVito, in a perfectly fitted role as a circus owner/ringmaster, and the beautiful Alison Lohman as the object of Ed Bloom's affection.<br/><br/>However, there were some moments in the movie that did test my patience a little. The movie was a little long, some of the lighting in the scenes was pretty dark, and I realized I preferred watching Ed Bloom's stories acted out rather than just hearing Ed Bloom talk about them. Whenever I have talked to someone like Ed Bloom, who goes off on stories like he did, I'd probably roll my eyes and tune them out. Maybe I won't do that anymore!!<br/><br/>All that aside, though, this is one hell of a movie! It has a lot of heart and imagination, and it actually choked me up a little.

","Until ""Big Fish,"" I had pretty much written off Tim Burton; I can only watch so many freakish displays of carnival showmanship, after all.  But this time, he got me.  He actually injected character development and a compelling family conflict into his usual grotesque tableau of weirdness.  I am officially a fan again.<br/><br/>Ebert says that this movie is basically just an excuse for special effects, but I would argue that it works beautifully on a fable-like level; true, there is a larger-than-life quality to the proceedings, but surely that's the whole point?  Yes, the MacGregor/Finney character is supposed to be somewhat ridiculous, but he also represents Burton's answer to his critics. He proves that tall tales and fanciful images have a legitimate place in storytelling, and can in fact reflect reality in unexpected ways.<br/><br/>That said, the movie did get a tad heavy-handed at the end.  I didn't need Billy Crudup (who has a pretty thankless, drippy role for most of the way) to explain the moral.  Still, I was hooked for ninety-nine percent of the way, and of course I must recommend the film simply on the grounds that it teams up Danny DeVito and ""B"" sci-fi legend Deep Roy!  Quite delightful, and another strong entry in an unusually good year for films."

I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it for anyone. But I'd recommend it to every person that has a touch of imagination and likes good movies!

I`m also happy that I can say that Helena Bonham Carter is the one of best actress nowadays, though in The Big Fish she just confirmed my earlier opinion of her good acting. The movie is technical correct, music is fine, the fabula is interesting, but something is missing. For, through all of those blooming colors, small fine details, Will Bloom`s (Billy Crudup) searching for the reality in his fathers stories, I did not find any of development, neither deeper devotion to the main issue, nor the point which could to endure such a quantity of varies scenes, placed in the different times and places, yet not to be faded away, even  quashed.

Leaving the superb and imaginative special effects aside, the story is an insight into the life of a kind and generous man who only wants to make the lives of those around him more pleasant and Tim Burton has succeeded in putting it across in a most amusing and moving way.  This is not a sickly sweet weepie - although I cried for at least the last 15 minutes of the film - and Tim Burton fans will enjoy the off kilter and slightly unnerving undercurrents that make his films a genre on their own!

","""Big Fish"" is a lot of fun to watch, but that's about it.  It involves a father, Ed Bloom (Finney) and the tall tales he tells his son Will (Crudup), which are told in flashbacks played by McGregor.  The fun in this film is watching Ed Bloom's many adventures and guessing which ones are real and which ones are fabrications.  What's true and what isn't is mostly revealed at the end.  This film should be classified as a ""warmedy.""  It's hard to say if this film is memorable, I liked it but I'm already forgetting it.

","Giants, werewolves, witches, and some rather big fish.<br/><br/>Half of this movie is about a grown man brought up by a storytelling father who seems to be obsessed with the fairy tales he creates. Now, with the father on his deathbed, his son feels as though he doesn't know him at all and so attempts to bridge the emotional gap while recalling the fairy tales that his father told. And this brings us to the other half -- the fictional fairytale stories of the young Edward Bloom, who is everything from a soldier in Vietnam to a human cannonball to a bankrobber to a wealthy landowner ... he faces all kinds of fantastic creatures and people throughout his life, and befriends all of them.<br/><br/>The Father/Son relationship is easily one of the most over-explored in Hollywood, and more often than not signals schmaltzy background music, tender moments and a lot of heartfelt talk about baseball. Bleurgh. However, ""Big Fish"" actually manages to try something different with a tired old formula and actually pull it off superbly well. This movie is actually a lot like ""Forrest Gump"", what with the accents and the comedic, fantasy retelling of a person's life -- certainly not a project you'd associate with the Master of Darkness, Tim Burton.<br/><br/>Contrary to what some might say, Tim Burton just doesn't make bad movies. He makes great ones, and decent ones -- usually one after the other in sequence. As his previous movie was the heavily-flawed and ill-conceived ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, this one was due to be a great one anyway. It doesn't necessary feel like a Tim Burton movie the whole way through... sure, you've got those weird trees, some slanted houses and plenty of surreal, Gothic darkness here and there, but much of it could just as well have been a Spielberg project, particularly in the Father/Son sequences. The main difference, though, is that Burton doesn't pile on the Schmaltz as another director would. Even the inevitable death sequence is both abrupt and tasteful, and no longer than it needs to be.<br/><br/>This is another entertaining and heartfelt film from Tim Burton, at least of the quality we expect from this great director. Everyone should see this movie."

","Tim Burton's best film, in my humble opinion, would be ""Ed Wood"". In ""Big Fish"", maybe he tried to do something more pop, less alternative. Maybe something bigger, almost epic. Maybe. It is very stupid thing to compare a movie to another, even if they are from the same maker. The comparison will be done to classified one or another, but to compare possible intentions of a movie and the other.<br/><br/>It is impossible, even for a movie expert, to see a piece of work ignoring the curriculum of the maker. It always means something, a maker have techniques, specified labor, and - even it is minimum, or mediocre - intentions. ""Ed Wood"" is deep. TIm Burton makes a excentricly romantic declaration of love to cinema, and its people involved. ""Big Fish"" is also deep, with a wider subject: humanity. You can find humanity in ""Ed"" too, as you can find love to cinema in ""Big""; not because of a scene, either two or three or hundreds. It is what you feel because of all elements that, added, give a new and unique feeling. And in all films of Tim Burton, mainly ""Ed"" - the reason of the citation, gives you his love that he got with cinema. How he does that? Well, he have always done that. He fascinate you graphically, the cast is incredibly credible as human being - at last, he puts you in the context of the story, and then love the cinema.<br/><br/>That's why ""Big Fish"" can be a drama, even if someone might think it is forced to cry, to laugh... what is the problem with that? Emotions are always forced, they move and point. Sometimes is exaggerated, others too subtle, but they have to move. Well, if you scared to be moved... you hate cinema!"

",". . . and his incredibly artistic visionary could bring such a tall tale to life so effectively.  I love this story's simplicity.  The heart of the story is merely a question  who is Edward Bloom?  Answering, however, well. . . we get far more than we could bargain for.  The answer is a fantastic ride through Bloom's imagination, a very very unique answer . . . and I can hardly think of any directors besides Burton capable of capturing on celluloid a man's imagination (much less Bloom's imagination).<br/><br/>I love the flashbacks to young Edward Bloom, played by Ewen McGregor, and the over-the-top performance of the whole cast.  Combine that with Burton's mastery of frame composition, Elfman's wonderful score, and we have a movie that's a far cry from being real.  It's silly--it's impossible--but it feels so right on the screen.  This is a tall tale, and there is absolutely no reason to try to hide it.  Cast and crew rightly embraces the material for what it is, bringing with them a certain charm that cannot be found in straight productions . . . . . . juxtaposed to a straight production aka reality, a reality that gives a different flavor in its setting and performances--a very different end of the emotional spectrum.  Through this contrast, Daniel Wallace reveals from the opening scenes why the story is told the way it is, and why Bloom tells it the way he does.  There are many aspects to narrative and storytelling  some subtle, some obvious  but all must be utilized to tell a good story in a way that's interesting.  Bloom knows this, Wallace knows this, and so does Tim Burton.<br/><br/>And I'm out of things to say about this film  what can I say, though?  It doesn't have what I would consider a plot (definitely *not* a complaint), instead it introduces characters and simply explorers them, thus proving in both novel and feature film form that it is not `what' is told, rather `how' it is told.  Wallace and Burton know how to tell it.  Because the beauty of Big Fish lay in the `how', this is a film that has to be experienced.  I could tell you about it; however, Bloom, Wallace, and Burton have proven to be a far better a story teller than I could hope to be."

","`Most men, they'll tell you a story straight true. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.'<br/><br/>Director Tim Burton's films never follow traditional guidelines. His past films include Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow, to name just a few  all of which have imaginative storylines and wonderfully strange characters, of which Big Fish is certainly no exception.<br/><br/>
Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor as the young Ed Bloom / Albert Finney as the senior Ed Bloom) is a man who has always told amazing stories to his family, friends, and anyone who would listen to them. His son Will (Billy Crudup) is frustrated by his father's stories; unable to work out what was real and what was made-up about his father's life. When he finds out his father is dying, Will returns home to try and find out the true story of his father's life. What follows is a tantalising and colourful journey along one man's life as a travelling salesman, seeking the woman that he loves and having an adventure on the way. <br/><br/>Big Fish is rated PG and while children may find this film hard to follow with regard to storyline, they will be entertained by wonderful visual imagery and colourful characters; the latter  including a Circus Manager known as Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), a famous unimaginative poet called Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), a giant called Karl (Matthew McGrory), a pair of Siamese performers known as Ping and Jing (Ada Tai & Arlene Tai) and a witch with a glass eye (Helena Bonham Carter) that bears prophetic messages, mermaids and of course: big fish.<br/><br/>It is so hard to write a review on this film  not due to lack of detail, but because I want to tell you everything (and I mean everything) about it  but if I were to do that, it would dampen your experience of the film  so without wanting to do that, I'm not actually going to tell you much more than what I have already.<br/><br/>Go see it.

","There are two types of ""big fish:"" one is the proverbial ""one that got away"" and the other is the resident of the so-called ""small pond.""  The Big Fish in BIG FISH is both. As played by the larger-than-life Albert Finney, Edward Bloom is a teller of tall tales who maintains his status in the small pond of his life by keeping all who will listen informed about all the ones that got away. Whether he is a habitual liar or merely a rascally old coot is totally up to the listener. You either laugh with him or at him.<br/><br/>To his son, Will (Billy Crudup), Ed is the liar. All the tales he tells have alienated him from his son. Ed insists that his stories are who he is, they tell all there is to know about Ed's vision of the world. But Will thinks the stories exist only to hide who Ed really is from the world.<br/><br/>
What one sees as a bridge, the other sees as a wall.<br/><br/>Part of the chip on Will's shoulder is made up of jealousy. Ed's whoppers about his encounters with giants, werewolves, mermaids and the like were first devised by the young Ed (Ewan McGregor) to amuse Will the child. Eventually they became fodder for parties and banquet toasts. Gifts for the child were freely shared with the rest of the world. Will wants a piece of his father to call his own. Ed doesn't have that much more to give.<br/><br/>BIG FISH is about walking the line between lying and embellishing. It is a thin line: a lie is an embellishment you can't accept; an embellishment is a lie you can. These are embellishments that are easy to accept thanks to Tim Burton's eye for the mystical, the bizarre and the just plain crazy. He weaves a colorful tale, and interweaves it with a touching story of a father and son reunion. It is all so beautifully done.<br/><br/>But BIG FISH is also a story about storytelling, be it the after dinner yarn or the multimillion dollar movie. From the latter stand point, it is Tim Burton's personal story -- and the story of all filmmakers. Burton seems to be saying ""This is me. This is my life. I am my movies; my movies are me. It's all true, with embellishments."""

Many of the imaginary (or not) events and places are modestly surprising, when I was expecting much more (remember Terry Gilliam's Adventures of Baron Munchausen - now THAT was wild, and in the end also the doubters were in for a surprise). Even the warm feelings, while there, and the father and son story, while there, are a bit diluted, not as efficient as they might have been in the hands of a Tim Burton at his best.<br/><br/>I guess it just goes to show that even Tim Burton cannot always get it fully right - and/or it goes to show that Tim Burton has continuously raised our expectations about his talent, which increases the risk of disappointment."

","Sometimes in your life, you remember a person for their life and sometimes you remember them for the stories about their life.  There may be a little gap between the facts of their life, and there may be a yawning chasm, so you have to look at the person and the situation, and figure out if there's a big difference, and if it matters.<br/><br/>That's what is going on in Big Fish, the latest from the creator of the first Batman movie, Edward Scissorshands, Sleepy Hollow and the Planet of the Apes (2001). <br/><br/>
Ed Bloom (Albert Finney as the mature Ed) is a tall-tale yarn spinner who has a favorite story about the big one that he caught, and then threw back.  He's gotten through life quite well with a wink and a tale and a lot of hard work, and he's loved every minute of it.  I agree with him, life's too short to not enjoy, and if it needs a bit of embellishment to get the joy out, then go with it.<br/><br/>Will (Billy Crudup) is his son, who feels that his dad is forever hiding behind the tale of the fish, and wants to get behind the story and get to know the real man who is his father.  Will's a wire service journalist in Paris, and luckily he's married to a French woman Josephine (Marion Cotillard), who loves a story and a sentimental person full of love.  On his own, Will would be too pragmatic for his own good, and would stay angry with him as he lay dying.  Josephine melts the ice of resentment between father and son, and Will gives his father the love that the man has always sought from him.<br/><br/>There is lots of sentiment played out in the story, and fantasies of allegory are all around, as the reality of the relationships is defined by the relationships in dad's world. Along with the allegory, we get sentiment.  Altogether, it's a heady story, and seems to sweep me along in waves of loving emotion.  Ed Bloom is a man who loved with all his heart, but didn't say `I love you' easily.  Instead, he made up a story that included a person in allegory, that was his way of paying homage.<br/><br/>In the end, everyone pays homage to him back, as he returns to his story, now to become the central figure for the first time.  Along the way, he reveals that his big fish story was allegory for people close to home, and that he let things happen in a very complex way, with his simple love of people.<br/><br/>

","I have to say  this movie is easily the most inspiring I have seen as an 'artist' - a writer and story teller, and it seems as if the movie while being wonderful as a simple 'movie' also sends an important message from Tim Burton to others about just how one's work really immortalises oneself.<br/><br/>
The simple premise is that one's creations be it a simple piece of fiction, a piece of art or a music will take a part of the creator, and everytime someone looks, hears or reads it, the creator lives again through the work. So years after he is gone, how he felt, his emotions his personality and his creations exist once more.<br/><br/>And even beyond that there is the simple fact that the 'father' in the movie is a teller of 'Tall Stories' about his supposed life but the question lies - which one of us ever tells the complete truth? Our memories are hardly photographic and there is little doubt that when we think back on the times, they are always a little bit more polished, often the better times are more 'rosier' - not done conciously but just how the faded memories are interpreted. So really, which is the truth.. the one you tell everyone, or the one that really happened? Does it matter? The one you tell everyone is going to last much longer than the truth ever did as part of your memories and thus the listeners, and really which would you prefer? Life in its boring harsh reality, or a 'better' version with a rose tint and a bit of warm 'humanity' and 'fantasy'?<br/><br/>This movie is based around that whole premise, and is truly heart warming, tear jerking and very funny - a true fairy tale that only Tim Burton can create. And as always, there is much to think abd talk about once its over - at the start one tires of the old man's stories and how surely they must be fabricated, but I bet that everyone wishes that he would continue telling them at the end of the movie :)<br/><br/>I think this movie got a lukewarm welcome at the theatres because it is so 'unique' - there is nothing like this movie and people are not happy to embrace such things. But a guarantee is that when you finish watching it, at the very least you will have enjoyed the ride. At the most, you will take away something much more from you and maybe like me, some inspiration to be a story teller with the heart of the protagonist in the movie!<br/><br/>Superb acting by the cast of course - Ewan McGregor has somehow perfected a smile that could melt a damn snowman, his older version played by Albert Finney manages to make you listen to his every word no matter the fact you know that he could be making it all up, and of course Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Busemi play their roles to a tee. And how can anyone ever forget Danny DeVito?!<br/><br/>The cinematography is always a trademark of Tim Burtons - beautiful landscapes and visual feasts are in store. Nope, definitely one of my favourite films because it is such a personal one for me but even without that, it is worth every minute of your time. <br/><br/>When else will you ever see a movie with the disclaimer similar to 'Most of this probably didn't happen' by the narrator and you were still mesmerised? Only once and this it it! Enjoy and thanks Tim Burton and the cast and crew. *standing ovation*"

If Spielberg directed it he wouldn't have the creepy production design that is seen in Tim Burton films, and he would probably mess it up by getting people like Leonardo DiCaprio or Tom Hanks. They are good actors but they are not as great as Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney and Helena Bonham Carter. They have a style to the way they use their talents in movies and I applaud Tim Burton for using them in his film. Spielberg would have also gotten John Williams to do the music to the movie, who is a talented composer but not as unique as the mind of Danny Elfman who is my most favorite composer.

"JamesHitchcock","9","0","0","27 February 2004"," A Modern Munchausen
","Tim Burton is generally at his best directing quirky, offbeat films such as `Edward Scissorhands' or `Ed Wood', and less entertaining when he moves into the mainstream. His two `Batman' movies, although better than their successors and containing some original touches, were just another manifestation of Hollywood's long love affair (dating back to the original `Superman' in the late seventies, and still continuing) with the comic-book superhero, while his recent `Planet of the Apes' was an example of a redundant remake of an original that never needed to be remade.<br/><br/>
`Big Fish', however, is a film of the type at which Burton excels. The central character, Edward Bloom, is a Baron Munchausen type character, much given to telling entertaining tall stories about his past. (It is interesting that several of Burton's films have a central character named Edward). These stories, however, are not always appreciated by his family, especially by his son William. The film opens with a quarrel between the two men at William's wedding when Edward tells a story about how he once caught an enormous fish which had earlier swallowed his wedding ring. After this, the two do not speak to one another for three years and William only returns home when he hears that his father is seriously ill.<br/><br/>William is a rather prosaic, priggish young man. If Edward is a Munchausen figure, William is the spiritual descendant of Dickens's Thomas Gradgrind, a man for whom everything other than hard fact is either nonsense or a lie. He complains that Edward's fictions have always prevented from getting to know his `real' father and wants to be told the pure, unembellished truth about his father's life. Even in the final days of his life, however, Edward persists in telling his old stories, and William tries to make sense of these in an attempt to get at the facts. (It is perhaps ironic that William lives and works in Paris- in American films generally the city of romance and dreams- and even has a view of the Eiffel Tower from his office window).<br/><br/>
The film proceeds to tell Edward's life-story as narrated by himself, intercut with scenes set in the present day. The earlier scenes relate a series of bizarre adventures reminiscent of `Alice in Wonderland.' Edward meets a witch whose glass eye can foretell the future, befriends a twelve-foot giant, stumbles across an unreal, eerily perfect village where there are no roads and everyone goes barefoot, works in a circus to win the love of his life, serves in the Korean War when he has an adventure involving a pair of female conjoined twins, and takes part, together with a poet, in an unsuccessful bank robbery. This part of the film is shot in a surreal, dreamlike style with some striking visual images- most notably the shots of the village of Spectre and the scene where Edward woos his future wife standing in a whole field of daffodils (which he has been told are her favourite flower).<br/><br/>All of the parts are well played, but the best acting performances are from the two actors who play Edward. Albert Finney plays the ageing Edward as an entertaining old rogue, and Ewan McGregor plays him as he was in his younger days, or rather as he would have liked to have been in his younger days- smarter, better-looking and more successful than he doubtless was in reality, and possibly younger too. It is notable that Ewan McGregor appears to be around the same age as Alison Lohman who plays Edward's wife Sandra as a young woman, whereas Jessica Lange, who plays the older Sandra, is markedly younger than Finney's character. In some films I would have put this discrepancy down simply to lazy casting, but here I suspect it is a deliberate way of increasing the film's surreal atmosphere.<br/><br/>
As the film progresses, there are indications that there may be a core of truth in some of Edward's stories- William discovers that his father did indeed serve in Korea and that Spectre is a real place- but we never find out exactly how much is true and how much is invention.  Nor are we meant to. The central theme of the film is the importance of the imagination. The truth about a man cannot be discovered from bare facts of his life alone without taking into account his imaginative inner world. The `real self', if it lies anywhere, lies in this inner world and in the private mythology which we construct for ourselves. The film comes to an emotionally satisfying conclusion as the world of real life and the world of Edward's imagination fuse together, Edward's life comes to a triumphant end and William comes to accept his father for what he is. I would rate this as the best movie yet that I have seen from Tim Burton. 9/10."

","This movie is a good time for all.  I was surprised at how captivating it was, and how enjoyable.  Great casting - good acting - great storytelling.  They don't make many movies like this these days.  The interweaving of fact and fiction and the resolution of fact with fiction were skillfully rendered.  And the purpose of fiction vs. fact was made clear with brevity and grace.  The overall storybook feel of the filming was interesting and unusual and the special effects were effective without being overly grand.  The sense of personal peace and acceptance that comes from this film is a welcome change from the plethora of aggressive (and often violent) movies.  When we sat down in the theater, we were seated in front of four young men (late teens, early 20's) and I thought to myself that they were not going to be satisfied by this movie.  Throughout the film, it was apparent that they were liking it very much and when it was over, they began a lively discussion of their enjoyment of the movie.  Gave me hope for our society!"

","(My glowingness might seem suspicious, so: I swear I don't work for anyone involved with this movie or anything like that.)<br/><br/>Excellent.<br/><br/>Okay, let me start off by pointing out the fact that, from the summary given by IMDB as well as others, this movie might sound like a weepy chick-flick (no offense to ""chicks"") type thing that's all sunshine and kittens and airheadedness. It's not. This movie should appeal to just about everyone who likes movies, and I do not say this lightly. I saw this movie in a theater with people of all ages (as well as a bunch of younger soldiers, normally die-hard action/comedy types), and from the chatter in the lobby after the movie, it was one of the most well-received of any movie I have ever seen in that theater.<br/><br/>Even if you generally dislike Tim Burton (my opinion of him *was* pretty neutral, slightly on the negative side), you'll probably find this an improvement on a lot of his previous stuff, which was all either kinda thin, or way too dense, plot-wise and in almost every other aspect, in my opinion. He should keep doing this sort of thing. He fits here.<br/><br/>It seemed to me that it was near impossible to find a good summary of the plot of Big Fish, and it struck me while I was watching it that this is because it's such a hard movie to summarize. You can't write a ""form-letter"" kind of summary for it because it's got a formula all its own.<br/><br/>Here's a summary of the movie as I see it.<br/><br/>All his life, Ed Bloom has liked to tell tall tales about amazing things he's supposedly seen and done. His son, William Bloom, was edified by this when he was young, but now he's about 30 and after all these years his father's habit of constantly trying to be the center of attention and telling these same stories to anyone who'll listen over and over again wears on his nerves. He feels that he doesn't really know his father because he knows next to nothing about his father's life. All he's ever heard about his father's experiences up until he was born are the tall tales his father is so fond of telling (Most of the movie consists of vignettes of these stories, featuring Ewan McGregor as a younger Ed Bloom). And now his father is dying, and he's afraid he'll never know the truth. He pleads with his father to tell him of what ""really happened"", but his father refuses to water down his life and spoon-feed it to William, as he basically puts it. As his father grows more and more sickly and weak, William goes digging around trying to piece together an account of his father's real life, he begins to realize that maybe, just maybe, the stories he'd been told since childhood weren't simply larger-than-life myths. Perhaps, he realizes, his father truly is a larger-than-life man. (This idea is subtly given to us in of the flashback vignettes wherein 10-year-old Ed begins to grow very tall. I won't spoil the rest of it, see it yourself, you'll enjoy it.).<br/><br/>There's no way that my summary does it justice, but I hope it's enough to get you to want to see this. This movie deserved a lot more praise (and revenue) than it got while in theaters. We want to encourage more movies like this. It's truly incredible, but you really shouldn't take my word for it; it defies description. Go see or get it on DVD as soon as possible. My new favorite movie. I only wish it was longer. It was worth my $1.75, and had any of the creative department been present I imagine I might have tipped them."

","After ""Planet of the apes"" Tim Burton comes back with a good story, tailored for his creativity and skills. ""Planet"" was a very conventional film, something each experienced director could have done -in fact it was a commissioned film, Tim Burton accepted to do it because he needed money...!<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is a return to form. Burton transforms Daniel Wallace's novel in a very personal movie -which reminds us to ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"". This film is a declared fairy tale -that's its beauty! People need fairy tales and stories to live with.<br/><br/>Actors are all good. It's interesting to get two different generations of British actors -Finney and McGregor. They act the same role in different moments of life, they really are complementary and at the same time both bring their own charm. Danny De Vito is familiar to Burton's world, he works very well as usual. Also the presence of Helena Bonham Carter (excellent British actress and Burton's girlfriend) and Jessica Lange are welcomed.<br/><br/>Fanciful sets, strange people and a story which never bores.

","We all know Tim Burton's work. He is possibly one of the few contemporary directors to whom you can attribute a definite style. The wildly immaginative approach to most Burton films would appear to be a perfect match for a film which takes place largely in a fairy tale world.<br/><br/>Burton does not disappoint, delivering a tale which catches you by the imagination and dangles the unbelievable in front of your eyes in such a warm and gentle manner that you have no choice but to be entertained.<br/><br/>The film itself explores the dynamics of storytelling, demonstrating the simple fact that the subject matter doesn't matter a single bit, it's the way that a story is told that determines a classic from the Kurt Russell film, Soldier. (A nice idea for a story but very badly handled.)<br/><br/>This is possibly where I can draw the only fault of the film. The non-linear editing of the beginning of the film may seem like a clever idea in other films but here it seems a bit confused and slightly muddled. Once the film gets into full flow, jumping from present day to the 'reality-enhanced' world of Edward Bloom's past, it is highly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Albert Finney is good as the older Bloom but Ewan McGregor completely outshines him and i'm delighted to report that his Alabama accent is spot on throughout the movie and in no way as irritating as I had assumed it would be.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is fantastic as well with Danny De Vito and Steve Buscemi really standing out.<br/><br/>Big Fish is a film that is well worth the admission fee and will leave you with a great sense of satisfaction. The imaginative plot and creative characters bring you right into Burton's fictional world and you will leave much happier.<br/><br/>Big Fish reels in a whopping 8/10"
"alexbowyer","Null","0","0","9 February 2004"," Complete non-event. Bring a pillow.
","(INCLUDES SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I've just seen this film and it is the most disappointing film I have seen for many years. I haven't read the book and apart from one trailer I had heard nothing about the film so had no particular expectations. However when the film started up with Ewan McGregor putting on an American accent, I had a bad feeling about the film that never really went away.<br/><br/>The film alternates between the present day where Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) is trying to get to know the truth about his dying father Edward (Albert Finney). Edward has told elaborate tales all his life and Will feels he doesn't really know his father as he cannot seperate the truth from fiction. So Will sets about trying to find the truth about his father, and meanwhile we see Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom, reenacting the tales that the old man tells, basically exaggerated versions of his life story. So the framework is set that this is going to be a film about reality, we know that what we see may sometimes be real and sometimes just stories.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is that it didn't really know what it was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>To me, it never really investigated this idea about story versus reality enough to make it interesting. The Ewan McGregor bits came across just as stories and we never really know, or perhaps care, how much of those stories is real (although there are some pretty hefty clues at the end)<br/><br/>Some of the stories are exaggerated to be almost ridiculous... A sheep-eating giant, a car stuck atop a tree, a witch with a magic eye, a giant fish that appears as a beautiful woman... But the point of this is lost.. the embellishments are never quite funny enough to make you laugh, as a comedy this film doesn't work because it's not quite funny, and when it does strange & impossible things there never seems to be a reason for it.<br/><br/>On a character level, it doesn't work because we never truly get to care about any of the characters.. The young Edward (McGregor) seems different in each story and because these are just stories, we never feel like we're really getting to know him. The old Edward (Finney) is quite one-dimensional, we never really get inside his head as to why he does tell these stories or live his life that way. Most of the other characters are just extras, there to push the story along, the only interesting character who does any development is Will, the son who learns to appreciate his father's way of thinking, finally telling him a story instead of just being logical - thus letting his father die a happy man.<br/><br/>I should say that I would not fault the acting, the three main actors are all very good, especially Albert Finney, and there are some great supporting performances, particularly from Helena Bonham Carter. I just think that no amount of good acting could have made us care about these characters based on the poor script & story presented to us.<br/><br/>On a drama/plot level this film doesn't work because we already know that everything we see has already happened - so we know ""it'll all be alright"". Even the fact that Edward is dying is introduced very early on so there is no suspense or surprise there. I can only think of two points in the whole thing where the story was actually interesting and drew you in at all - firstly the young Edward's return to & rebuilding of the town of Spectre, and secondly the part where Will tells his father the story of how he will die.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was completely tedious - I didn't get drawn in, I didn't care what happened next (besides which the stories were fairly disjointed anyway). I seriously considered leaving the film at more than a couple of points. The film just completely failed to connect with me.<br/><br/>As a romance it didn't work, there were two main relationships - Sandra and Edward, and Will and his young French wife. Will's relationship was never explored in any depth, his wife's character was quite flat (although Marion Cotillard did an admirable job on very sparse material) The Ewan McGregor/Alison Lohman relationship has a great deal of potential, Alison Lohman is quite dazzling as the young Sandra, but the beginning of their relationship is never properly explored. It ends up looking like the young Edward just had a crush on her and she accepted him because he was better than her previous high-school thug boyfriend. As an old couple there is clearly a real spark between them (Albert Finney and Jessica Lange, Lange is particularly good at showing her character's devotion to her husband) but we never really get to appreciate how this came about.. it ends up slipping in to the stereotypical ""white picket fence""/""living the american dream"" type cheesiness.<br/><br/>There was supposedly a lot of ""magic"" about the film, with some scenes more fitting in fairy tales (witches, giants etc) and some special film treating techniques to give some scenes an unreal quality. But even as a ""magical adventure"" type of film this was left wanting. As the mystical bits are few and far between, with no clear reason for them to happen and no connections between them.<br/><br/>At times I felt like maybe they were trying to have some deeper message behind the film, maybe something like ""you have to have fantasies in your life and have fun, don't just be logical"" or ""you can do whatever you want with your life, life is what you make it"" but these sorts of ideas were only vaguely explored, and are fairly un-original - there were no interesting ideas or theories put across, nothing to really make you think or get stuck into. It didn't even fully commit to the standard american dream type hollywood ending, which it hinted at at times at least that would have been consistent.<br/><br/>All in all the film left me feeling numb and completely devoid of emotion. It didn't make me laugh, it didn't make me cry, it didn't make me think, it didn't make me smile, above all it didn't make me care about anything that happened. The film had no clear goals and as a result, succeeded in achieving absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>It's straight into my ""worst films of all time"" list, along with Damage, Guest House Paradiso, Timecode, Full Frontal and Pret-a-Porter. Even ""The Postman"" was better than this, sure it was full of pro-American mumbo-jumbo but at least it had a story that kept you interested!"
"FilmOtaku","9","0","0","11 February 2004"," Maybe not his ""masterpiece"" but a film with real heart
","There has been so much hype regarding Big Fish:  `It's Tim Burton's masterpiece', `Tim Burton finally grew up', etc.  Apparently I'm unclear on the concept of `growing up' since this film is a fairy tale from start to finish, even the scenes set in `reality'.  Not only that, it is difficult for me to put a finger on what is the `best' Tim Burton film.  If I had to make a movie reference to illustrate the difficulty of executing this task, I would have to call it my `Sophie's Choice'.  So while I cannot call it `his masterpiece' in the context that it transcends his earlier work, I can definitively assert that it is indeed A masterpiece.<br/><br/>Big Fish is the story of a man coming to terms with the impending death of his father, and his desperate attempt to find out who his father really is  a task he has been trying to complete for most of his adult life, as his father has told him nothing but tall tales about his life since he can remember.  It is a touching and exhilarating story  masterfully told through the eyes and ears of our actors.  We are not told these stories in a simple narrative, we hear it for the first (or, sometimes depending on which family member is in the room, not the first) time, and experience it along with that character.  <br/><br/>The acting in Big Fish is remarkable.  Most of the characters, with the exception of the other members of Finney's family are eccentric and exciting.  Circus folk, giants, Siamese twins and residents of a fairy tale town are all enacted delightfully.  Lange, as Finney's wife exudes a calm, sweet and quiet Southern charm, despite the fact that we know she is actually emotionally wracked.  And Billy Crudup, who plays Finney's son, is both passionate and angry  an adult, yet possibly hoping that the stories he has heard ad nauseum that he is hopelessly irritated by are actually true.  The character we see the most in the film is Ewan McGregor, who portrays the patriarch as a young man.  He did an absolutely amazing job of it  his energy, innocence and passion are all apparent with something as simple as a gesture or facial expression.<br/><br/>Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>While the story was good and the acting was as wonderful, what really made this movie an instant personal classic was Burton's imagery.  The rich circus scenes, the little town in the middle of the treacherous forest that slightly harkened back to his Edward Scissorhands set  these were scenes that were expertly set and blocked.  Then add in Burton's flair  the bright colors, the improbable beauty of Carnies, and a field of golden flowers. These are visual moments that are virtually unforgettable.  Even the now famous image of time stopping for a moment when one discovers their true love, where he has to wade through suspended popcorn to see that person  Burton has taken the feeling that some of us have and visualized it for us, creating an incredibly touching moment.  <br/><br/>I challenge anyone to not even get a sniffle at the end of this film. Sometimes a filmmaker will tug at your tear ducts for the sake of drama and emotion, (Read: Titanic) which usually irritates me because it is usually superfluous in my opinion.  I genuinely bawled and felt my heart ache at the end of this movie, and was really wanting an emotional release of some kind, barring full-out blubbering in a packed theater, and not once did I remotely feel manipulated.  If people think that Big Fish is Tim Burton `all grown up', that's fine  then I just really hope that he continues his growth and continues this trend.  I like his fun movies, and I like his intense movies, but this was a masterful blend of both.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","Tim Burton, one of hollywood's most unique voices, tried to hook a big one.<br/><br/> ""Big Fish"" is distinctly a Burton film, filled with memorable misfit characters and fairy tale imagery. But the overall tone of the film, from the cinematography to the score, displays a different sort of Burton. One that is reaching a little further for the masses,and the oscar voters.<br/><br/> The film is tremendous. It touches us with lessons about relationships, persistance, and optimism. Burton always has a passion about misfits, and they figure largely into the story here. However, the film ever so slightly tips towards the mainstream, unlike many of his other films (Ed Wood, Mars Attacks).<br/><br/> It seems to me he was shooting for an oscar. it's a story voters love, and the Elfman score was more classic movie-esque than before. Oscars loss is our gain. He has crafted yet another fable,this one the most touching, and enjoyably, more family-oriented than his previous efforts. The story keeps you watching and guessing, and the ending tugs at your heartstrings, yet in a totally unhollywood way.This may have kept oscar voters away, and even american audiences,but he has left us with a film that will endure. One for the ages. Don't let missing the big catch of a hollywood award get you down Mr. Burton. You've left us a film that will reel in generations to come."

","First up, I'll admit to being a huge Tim Burton fan - I even liked Planet of the Apes - so I had high expectations of this film. Some of the reviews I'd read in the UK press worried me a little, but seeing the film made me remember that critics know nothing - or at least they do when it comes to films I'm going to enjoy.<br/><br/>Without going into the plot (there are 250 or so before me who've done that) this is a visually understated but still typical Burton film. It's done with more subtlety than we may expect, but there is still a lot to see and enjoy while the story unfolds. And Ewan MacGregor has a thoroughly great tiem, and brings real energy and fun to his role, which it needs as the centrepiece of some very tall tales indeed."

Many people find this film very confusing and weird, but if you look and follow the film slowly in your mind, you can see how every piece of fiction from his father holds some significance, which eventually leads to a stunning climax.

It could be that my current situation involving a grandfather who is nearing the end of his life resembles this movie enough to tug painfully at the heartstrings. But, I think it's more than that.

Of course, the sheer poetry of ""Edward Scissorhands"" or the mythical flare of ""Batman"" are not overwhelming like before, but what we have here is a work of maturity, and the result is a work that, for the first time, creates the dream world and also the point of view that questions it.

"movieguy1021","8","0","0","7 February 2004"," Big Fish: 8/10
","Weird in movies is good. There's different types of weird, but it mainly boils down to two types: Tim Burton weird and David Lynch weird. Both are pretty similar, actually, except that Burton has a reason for his weirdness, while Lynch just throws it out there. I enjoy Lynch's more, but Burton's is nice to look at, and instead of creating a puzzle that seems impossible to solve, Burton creates new worlds, stuff that can never happen but is just close enough to seem believable. In his new Big Fish, Burton likes to get as weird as he can get, but has to stay within the boundaries of mainstream movies (I'll get to that).<br/><br/>Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is notorious for telling tall tales, which delight most people, but always seemed to annoy his son Will (Billy Crudup). He's upset because he doesn't really know much about his father. When he learns that his father is dying, he travels back to his home in Alabama, while the audience sees some of Edward's tall tales, with Ewan McGregor as the younger Ed. There, he encounters giants, werewolves, a town that seems to be taken out of something from the Twilight Zone, and a witch with a glass eye.<br/><br/>Burton certainly is imaginative. He has some great ideas for weirdness, which are all executed extremely well. Everything comes off well, and Burton leaves us in some weird place, and we seem to just accept it. The movie thrives on leaving the audience wondering what was about what they just saw. Unlike Lynch, Burton doesn't require us to make connections; he explains it all. But that's where the one major flaw comes in. All of the weirdness is so well done that when the necessary plot developments in today's time come along, it takes away from the flow of the story, and it leaves the audience's attention waning. The story of Edward Bloom dying is not very exciting, the story of Edward Bloom's supposed past is exciting.<br/><br/>Big Fish has a very intricate story. There's a slew of characters who seem to come in randomly, and who look/sound like others, and live in the same place as others. Instead of, just say, taking away development from someone who doesn't really matter, like Will's wife, they take away some connecting points that could help the story make sense. On the other hand, the movie did have some very funny moments, with odd dialogue thrown in to make it funnier. Danny DeVito, as a circus ringmaster with a very odd situation, comes off great, as does Steve Buscemi, who's a ""famous poet"" who was part of the odd town of Spectre and goes into an unusual profession now.<br/><br/>Everyone's been raving about how much Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney look alike, which was very fortuitous. I didn't really think they looked that similar, but that doesn't take away from the superior acting job by Albert Finney. He not only got into his role, but seemed like he had a fun time doing it. However, he's the only one who really stands out; everyone else just ""acts"", nothing more, nothing less. The score, by longtime Burton partner Danny Elfman, is barely noticeable. If there was any music in it at all, I didn't notice it.<br/><br/>I would like to see Big Fish again for one thing. Burton seems to be a director who has fun with his movies. He references a lot of his other movies in his movies. I caught a reference to Edward Scissorhands, but all others eluded me. Overall, Big Fish is a fun movie with some very weird qualities, but some qualities that aren't particularly great.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for a fight scene, some images of nudity and a suggestive reference."

","Here in the UK, we have always had a lot of time for one of the all time classic American family movies, ""It's A Wonderful Life"".<br/><br/>I may be entertained by the ultra-violence and snappy, profane dialogue of Tarantino, Kubrick, and Scorsese. But every time you ring a bell, an angel gets it's wings. And I blub like a tiny child...<br/><br/>Well, Mr Capra now has a contender in the timeless feel good movie stakes. And his name is Burton.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW - READ ON WITH CAUTION:<br/><br/>Let's make something clear from the start. This film is not overly sentimental. Consider how long Spielberg was attached to this project, and think what he'd have done differently. He'd have had you cry on cue, for one thing, as John Williams strings soared. Burton didn't.<br/><br/>There's a sly line of dialogue, delivered by the family doctor when old Edwards's condition has worsened. I'm not quoting verbatim here, but it's along the lines of ""I hate when people talk to people who can't hear them.""<br/><br/>This is the classic ""character on a deathbed"" style, with the younger, supporting actor saying all the things he meant to say. It's a cliche, it's manipulative, and it's avoided here. The scene which replaces it is just awesome, turning Billy Crudup into a teller of the sort of tall tales he thought he despised.<br/><br/>Burton being Burton, however, it's not all down to John August's script. There are some astonishingly funny scenes here too. It takes just three seconds, a jock, a toilet and a copy of Playboy to deliver perhaps the best sight gag of the year. In a PG-rated movie!<br/><br/>Onto the basics. The cast are all great, but I must mention the radiant Marion Cotillard as Josephine, Will's wife. I've only ever seen her handle the fast talking, snappy French comedy dialogue of the ""Taxi"" films. But here she gives a beautifully understated performance, proving she can do drama just as well.<br/><br/>I'm surprised that Americans are quite so pleased with Ewan McGregor's accent - which to my ear slipped back to his native Crieff on a number of occasions. Still - with his winning smile and boyish looks - he's cast perfectly here.<br/><br/>Albert Finney, though, is the best casting you can imagine. And Spielberg wanted Nicholson! Finney is charming without being slimy, not something Jack can manage.<br/><br/>The photography is as great as you've heard - all the more so because it's so subtle. A lot of that is probably down to the quality of the light in Alabama (this film was mostly shot on location), which gives a magical realism that fits the story perfectly.<br/><br/>In summary, a moving movie that I hope will survive the test of time."

I havn't seen my dad in over 5 years and the moment the credits started rolling I wanted to pick up a phone and go find him. Tim Burton has taken a story full of life and imagination and portrayed it in a way only he can do, with humour, affection, surreality and pathos.

","This is one of those rare films that lets you be a kid again.  I found myself drawn to the screen for the entire duration of the movie, and that is something that is rare. BIG FISH is brilliantly adapted from the Christopher Wallace novel. Though it is quite different that its book form, the screen version has added a more intense and relationship between father and son, and Albert Finney played the role as good as anyone could.  Finney's accent and soft rounded words added a lot to the entirety of the movie- Comparable to the narration of Morgan Freeman in THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.<br/><br/>Burton's tell tale style shows up here once again, similar to that of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, with perfectly groomed yards and mysteriously enchanting locations.  The film seemed to flow effortlessly, and the timing was a spot on match. I think Burton has hit a new level as a filmmaker and a storyteller, and I look forward to his next project."

","BIG SPOILERS from the start<br/><br/>When telling the story of ""Big Fish"", it's hard to differentiate between what is considered real and what is considered fake. The one thing which can be certain is that Tim Burton has once again created a masterpiece. Often Burton is raved about, but in my opinion, he has always been best at those sorts of films which are the holiday extravanza sort of film. As a Director I think his best films of the past were ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", and as a Producer I always loved his films ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James And The Giant Peach"". With the exception of ""Beetlejuice"" those films all have something in common, as well as being witty and slightly twisted, they moved the soul and touched the audience. ""Big Fish"" follows this tradition perfectly.<br/><br/>In this movie we are introduced to Mr Edward Bloom. From a young age Edward had a remarkable life, or did he? This as we discover, is the problem. Edward is old and not well. As he lies dying on his death bed, his son William (played well by Billy Crudup, a man I admit to not recognising on the screen before) visits him and demands to know the true Edward. The problem, if you could dare to call it that, is that Edward's entire life is one of tall tales. Whilst Albert Finney as the old Edward recites the tales with his usual majestic naration, we are shown Ewan McGregor as Finney's younger self experiencing these beautiful moments. McGregor is again superb and if it wasn't for his performances in the more recent of the two Star Wars trilogies, he'd probably be up there as one of the greats of recent cinema history (but then, I think we can allow someone at least one or two returns to their childhood in their projects huh?).<br/><br/>Anyway, as the film progresses, we learn more and more about Edward, learning some truths and some lies along the way. All of this resulting in a tear bringing ending which moves us in a way all too rare in recent film experiences.<br/><br/>The one flaw with ""Big Fish"", and I'm not sure whether it can be counted as a flaw or not, is that it's very difficult to do a review of. I saw this film a couple of days ago now (normally I confess to writing a review as soon as possible after seeing the film) and even now I find it hard to differentiate between what was good and what was bad. The one thing I can say is that the first time we are introduced to the town of Spectre, it is a pretty drawn out tedious affair and I'm glad when Bloom leaves. This scene is necessary however, irrelevant of whether it is entertaining or not. Other than this though, ""Big Fish"" is practically impossible to criticise. The acting is first class, not just by Finney and McGregor, but also by the amazing supporting cast of Danny Devito, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham-Carter and especially Steve Buschemi. The soundtrack is breathtaking as well, visual effects the usual Burton perfection, and the ending as I've already said is so beautiful and moving, that ultimately any of these problems I might have said, are quickly forgotten as you try to hold back the tears.<br/><br/>In a few years time, once the fuss regarding this film has settled down, I look forward to taking a glance at the imdb Top 250 Films of All Time and seeing this film safely in there. This film is a rare breed and unlike other recent masterpieces (i.e. ""Lost In Translation""), it's one everyone will love."

Even if you are questioning whether or not to see this; this movie packs an emotional powerhouse that makes you think about your own life and how your grandfather or father may have ""fabricated"" stories of yesteryear.  There are a few very beautifully choreographed shots in this film.  One that stands out in my mind is a scene in the Circus when the Ed Bloom comments on meeting the woman that he will marry.  As the younger Ed Bloom progresses through the crowd, all action slows down to a complete stop with the line... ""and there I saw the woman that I would marry.""  The scene just took me back to when I first met my own wife, and how in a moment in time your whole life can be changed.  I have to give kudos to Burton and company for a visually stunning image, one of many that make Big Fish a feel good movie.  This movie gets 4.75 out of 5 stars!!

","I was rather skeptical about this film at first; I wasn't sure to expect from the movie after having seen some interesting previews.  I was also slightly skeptical about Ewan McGregor's ability to pull-off a Southern accent, seeing how he is Scottish. Despite the fantastical, and ambigious trailer, I found the magical realism to be believable and consuming.  I was rather drawn to the stories, and found myself willing to believe them.  It was a nice departure from the typical darkness of Burton's films.  ""Big Fish"" was much more optimistic feeling, and was at times heart-warming.  I was impressed at Ewan McGregor's performance, although there were time when his Scotish accent was quite apparent; it did not however detract from the film.  I was also impressed with the rest of the great cast.  Each actor performed in the most dynamic and compelling manner, acuratly portraying the fantastical characters of McGregor/Finny's imagination.  I was very happy to see Billy Crudup in another film.  I was amazed by his performance, and at his ability to portray a character so entirely different from his previous roles, especially his role as Russel Hammond in ""Almost Famous.""  Overall, I found ""Big Fish"" to be a charming, and entertainingly bizzar film.  ""Big Fish"" also made me have a greater appreciation for my grandfather who is known for telling tales himself. I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates vivid imagination, and beautifully woven stories."

","Tim Burton had originally garnered my respect as a storytelling director with Edward Scissorhands (the most comparable of his movies so far to this one), and re-established it with Ed Wood, and when I saw the trailer for Big Fish, I had a feeling this would become one of my favorite movies. This unique story of exaggerated features took some time at the beginning to discover where Burton was headed with it, but as the story progressed I became totally involved and stayed so until the stirring ending. The audience with me in the theater responded with claps of applause. The strong cast worked together seamlessly -- Ewan McGregor, never afraid to take on varying and unique roles (Trainspotting, Eye of the Beholder, Moulin Rouge!) excels as he often does (I could see him becoming a recurring favorite actor of Burton's along with Depp).  Billy Crudup takes on his role with the emotional honesty he showed in Almost Famous. The chemistry between Albert Finney and Crudup convincingly relates a broken relationship between father and son.  The story is tastefully outlandish, and a striking statement on the differences between fact and truth.  10 out of 10.<br/><br/>""You tell lies to get to the truth."" - Tim O'Brien"

I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, so I was a little weary, but I thought it was an actually beautiful film. What is important about this film is that it an asthetic film, and just plain visually pleasing.  I mean how awesome did it look when Ewan McGregor is standing in the middle of a field of daffodils, and how beautiful the town of Spectre was (the first time we see it), the colors were amazing.   I also think that the stories that we see are the listeners interpretation of the events.  (Of course the giant can't be like 20 feet tall, but when you hear a guy talking about giants that's what most listeners will imagine.)  I have to admit the main reason why I did see the movie was because Ewan McGregor was starring in it (I wouldn't mind more scenes with him), but I was not dissapointed with the stellar acting of Albert Finney etc...  What is most important to know is that this is not a ""normal"" movie, so don't go to the theatres expecting to see a ""normal"" movie.

"Chris_Docker","7","0","0","2 February 2004"," Quirky and lovable - Burton just about carries it off this time
","One of the quirkiest and lost lovable of films, Big Fish is about a grandfather who has perfected the art of telling bedtime stories. His stories are all made up, all feature fictionalised episodes from his own past life, and polished to a degree that make them in demand to children and adults alike (except to his own grown-up children, who have heard them once too often). The second most difficult thing about grandfather Ed Bloom is that he is constantly telling these stories. The most difficult thing is that, when it comes to his own life, he tells nothing else.<br/><br/>Most of the film is devoted to putting these stories into pictures, just as he tells them. Fantastical, endlessly inventive and incredibly entertaining, they would be enough for a film itself if only aimed at children; but what makes Big Fish a joy for adults as well as kids is that Ed Bloom's life becomes more than that, it becomes an illustration of the fantastic within all of us and how valuable that it. He is a self-mythologizing man, a living example of the magic that can put a sparkle of wonder in a child's eye, and remind us that imagination is a wonderful thing, not just for storytelling, but to realise the greatness within each of us. It is also one of whimsical and visionary director Tim Burton's most rounded and mature films to date, and makes good use of a star studded cast that includes Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi. A film to leave you smiling all the way home."

He's still a silver-tongued storyteller.  But, the silver is rapidly tarnishing due to his terminal illness.  Equally convincing is Billy Crudup as his estranged son, Will.  In the process of reconciling with Ed, before it's too late, he finds out the two of them have more similarities than differences.

Most of the movie was great, and bringing you through a heart grabbing adventure, just watching all of the adventures, there very ineresting. The ending scene was great, but just the scene, the feeling wasn't that good, throughout the movie it gave you a tremendous feeling. The ending wasn't sad to me, yet just wasn't good. I can't think of a better ending because throughout the rest of the movie they close everything. He shouldn't of died though, it ended just you not wanting it to end. Which meant to me the rest of the movie was spectacular. I give this movie 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. The ending is a lot to a movie, 3 1/2 stars is great yet the ending can bring it down that half.

"w00f","9","0","0","31 January 2004"," The Stuff from Which Legends are Made (contains spoilers!)
","The theme of this film is fairly simple; every life's a story, in a sense, and some lives are larger than life, so there's an accretion of things that, while not exactly factual, serve to accent the bigness and wonder of life. Great things become greater with their retelling, whether the person in question is a national hero or a local celebrity. The principle is the key to a certain kind of immortality, and it's a theme of our existence that anyone can see, from the Pharaohs to Abraham Lincoln to Ozzy Osbourne. Small legends get bigger over time, and they continue to grow even when the subject of the legend has long since disappeared from the view of mortal eyes.<br/><br/>The movie was slow in a spot or two, but overall it held together beautifully, with the ending tying everything up very neatly and demonstrating that, despite the cynicism that mythologization engenders in some people, reality is often just below the surface of the myth. A great life, a life of adventures and risk-taking, doesn't need that much embellishment; the flourishes only serve as a preservative. A life needn't be an action-adventure to have been remarkable, nor must it be lived by someone known to the whole of humanity. Any life can be a great one, worthy of becoming the stuff of legends.<br/><br/>If Big Fish is guilty of any shortcoming, it did get a bit overly sentimental at times. Keeping in mind, though, that the whole of the life of the main character is always viewed through somewhat rose-colored glasses (another theme of the movie - eternal optimism), that's very much appropriate in the context of the whole film. A great life ends with a great death because a great story needs a great ending, but even in this, the legend created by William's character for Edward as he lays on his death bed isn't that far from the truth. When the real funeral is held, everyone from Edward's life really is there to see him off, and they're almost as flamboyant and unusual as they were in the stories. Instead of going back into the water and turning into the fish - which was already a legend when Edward was a boy - he goes back into the Earth as those who knew him recount the stories of his life. He hasn't literally become the Big Fish of every fisherman's tall tale, but he's become the same ""stuff of legend"" of which the river of human memory is composed. Just like the mythical fish, Edward goes on. The big fish's belly was full of eggs; Edward's was full of stories. The eggs insure the continuation, the immortality, of the fish. Edward's stories insure his own. He was the Big Fish all along. With these kinds of themes present, a bit of indulgence in sentimentality is understandable. We're all sentimental about great lives to one degree or another, and the stories of our lives are our own immortality. When Edward, as he lies on his death bed, passes the story-teller mantle to his son, he's given him the most valuable thing he has; not just the stories, but the ability to permit himself to tell them. That's the surprise ending foretold in the witch's glass eye. The mythic world and the mundane world are going to come together in this single, paramount moment. It's why Edward goes back to Spectre; he was there too early the first time to turn it from a mundane little town into the perfect place of myth. The town is ""Spectre"" because its potential doesn't lie in it's real existence, but in the stuff of Edward's myths.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was extremely moved by the film. I even shed a few tears, something that I'm not exactly prone to doing, and for good reason. I can't stand sappy tripe for it's own sake, so the sentimentality of most films that go for the tear-jerker is entirely lost on me. This was different. For me, the response was completely involuntary. Sometimes, a thing is too beautiful to resist it.<br/><br/>I know there are a lot of people who don't like this film. I think, at the very least, it's the best thing Tim Burton has done in a very long time. After a few failures (Planet of the Apes and Sleepy Hollow, for instance), it's nice to see a good storyteller come back strongly. I'm not sure who I'd recommend this to. It's certainly not a film for nihilists or for those who think of physical life as all there is (not that it's got strong religious themes; the afterlife in Big Fish is metaphorical, not spiritual). Perhaps it's best for those who enjoy mythology and find the ""little tradition"" of history fascinating. It's a nice, strong, well-acted look at where the myths come from that we, know it or not, live with every day.<br/><br/>An excellent film, and I think one that will be looked upon in the future as being of the calibre of movies like The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka."
"smartstrigz","10","0","0","30 January 2004"," Stays with you even after you leave the theater
","There are many movies that you watch, enjoy, and then think about for only a short time after leaving the theater.  Big Fish is not one of those.  This movie stays with you for a long, long time after viewing; and the more you think about it the more you like it.<br/><br/>The basis of the film is that Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) has been told tall tales all his life by his father, Ed Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor), that he eventually believes to be fictitious.  The result is that the two men do not speak to each other for over three years until Ed is diagnosed with cancer and is on his deathbed.  Will Bloom feels that he doesn't know his true father, and he begins to search for his father's true self.  As he does so, he realizes that not every story his father has told him is untrue, and the result is that he comes to understand his father more than he dreamed possible.<br/><br/>I can't find any criticism in any main aspects of this film: the plot and characters were well developed, the acting was superb, the sets and costumes were visually breathtaking, the score was subtle yet strong, and the sound/lighting/cinematography/you-name-it was all good as well. <br/><br/>
Perhaps what I liked best though was the way that the overall story line was developed.  This truly was not like most movies you see these days.  The story develops gradually, and the viewer really doesn't have any idea what any of what they are seeing means or why it has significance until the end (and I will say absolutely nothing about the ending since it is, in my opinion, one of Hollywood's finest endings).  The last ten or so minutes wrap up the film so nicely that everything makes sense, but the viewer is left to interpret so much on their own... which is a good thing.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about everything since I left the theater, and my friends who have seen it and I all have a good time comparing our own perspectives.  <br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film already, go see it.  It's definitely worth it. You'll come out of the theater having a better understanding of your parents and you'll see a little more fantasy in everyday reality."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","0","30 January 2004"," Story of the story of the year!!
","Did I ever tell you about the time I went out and watched the Best Picture of 2003? Tim Burton, obviously very aware of the old saying, `The older I get, the faster I was,' has fashioned a masterpiece about his own craft, piecing together an intricate story of stories and oddly managing to remain true to his distinctive style while at the same time creating a film different from anything he's ever done before. The extension of the title is only learned through internal dialogue in the film itself (something about a big fish in a small pond), and it has a variety of meanings throughout the story (depending on to whom it is referring at any given time).<br/><br/>
As I watch the primaries for the presidential election coming up in 2004, it's strange how much the race of the Democrats seems to reflect Big Fish on its road to the Oscars. All I'll say is that Howard Dean was in a comfortable front-running position until Iowa, where he was rendered a disappointing third place. Big Fish, similarly (at least in my own opinion), sort of plays the part of John Kerry  somewhere in the distance until he became noticed, and was suddenly catapulted to first place. Howard Dean for me was The Return of the King, the final Lord of the Rings installment that I was sure would win the Best Picture Oscar until I saw Big Fish. Now, however, Big Fish is not even on the list of nominees, which gives me the urge to roll up my sleeves and scream. The really sad part is knowing that Big Fish can't win, so it'll be interesting to me to see how Big Fish (Kerry) does in November. Surely he has a better chance of winning than his cinematic counterpart does.<br/><br/>Anyway<br/><br/>Every once in a while I see a movie and I read through some other reviews, on the IMDb and otherwise, and it is absolutely amazing to me how many people are able to completely miss the boat on so many truly great films. Roger Ebert completely missed the point of this film even more than he missed the point of Memento, which is incredible to me. One of the most disturbing things that I read was by one reviewer on the IMDb who mentioned that it was stupid to have had Jessica Lange and Albert Finney play a married couple. This reviewer was particularly bothered by the fully clothed bathtub scene in which Lange crawls into the tub with her husband and cuddles up to him. <br/><br/>I find it really sad that today's audiences are put off of a movie as great as Big Fish for something as trivial and stupid as that. Are people really that shallow these days? It's the same as a complaint about Kim Basinger playing Eminem's mother in 8 Mile. People said she was just too beautiful to play someone so poor and trashy, to which Roger Ebert cleverly responded that, given how many ugly people are filthy rich today, there can really be no complaint about beautiful people with no money. <br/><br/>Big Fish is a perfect example of the old adage, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, although I think it would be more appropriate to say that the whole is completely different from the sum of its parts. Take any individual scene at random, almost any SHOT at random, and it is clearly the work of Tim Burton, yet the film as a whole is completely different from anything he's ever done before. Movies require a certain suspension of disbelief, regardless of their director, story, genre, etc., but in Big Fish that suspension is displaced by the identity of the storyteller. Most of the film is told through the stories of the aging Edward Bloom, whose stories we learn very early on are heavily exaggerated if not totally fictional. Tim Burton uses that almost as an excuse to craft this adventurous tale involving giants and midgets and jumping spiders and leaning houses and gigantic fishes and wedding rings and Siamese twins that look more like a two-headed woman and a magical town called Spectre that might be (is) Heaven where the streets are paved with luscious grass and everyone walks around barefoot and loves it all so much that no one ever leaves.<br/><br/>
It doesn't matter whether or not you believe that a young Ed Bloom really parachuted accidentally onto a stage being watched by hundreds of armed Vietnamese soldiers and then escaped because his endless charm overcame the two-headed performer and got her/them to help him. It doesn't matter if you believe that young Ed Bloom worked for years without pay at a freaky circus in order to learn the identity of a woman he saw only a single time across a crowded circus ring and then went on to marry her. It doesn't matter if you believe in werewolves, in magic, in fish that eat wedding rings, and it certainly doesn't matter if you believe that someone who looks like Jessica Lange could ever love and be happily married to a man who looks like Albert Finney. Big Fish is the character study of Edward Bloom and his son, Will, who didn't speak for years after Will's wedding when he heard his father's story about the day he was born for the last time that he could stand.<br/><br/>
(spoilers) Think about the character change in this movie. Will has been bored to tears by that story for his entire life, growing increasingly disgusted at how little his own part is in the story of the day he was born, and it is not until he is in his 30s that he learns the value of the storytelling of his father. The most moving scene is not the scene where Will tells his dying father the story of how he `goes,' it's the final scene of Edward's funeral. There's no dialogue, but we see who has shown up. The giant from Edward's stories in there, as is Amos Calloway, the eccentric circus ringleader. The two-headed woman from Vietnam is there, except we learn here that in real life she is two women, identical but certainly separate. Citizens from the town of Spectre are there, as is Jenny, Edward's almost love affair and supposedly the wicked witch that terrified Ed as a child (I'm still working on the chronology of that one). <br/><br/>What we learn in the funeral scene, even though we can't hear anyone talking, is that Ed's stories were not all fictional. They were certainly exaggerated, which is revealed all along the way and not the least example of which is the fact that the two-headed woman is two completely separate twins. Edward Bloom is a man who aggrandized the past through his remarkable storytelling skills, and Tim Burton delivered this to us with his remarkable filmmaking skills. <br/><br/>Writers will tell you that they write about what they know about, and Tim Burton has made a movie about what he knows about  telling stories. Burton realizes the importance of the role of storytelling in our lives, and has made a film about that importance and the effect it can have on us. Stories told verbally perpetuate lives, cultures, families, and loves. Edward Bloom was a master storyteller, and you can see his influence on the vast number of people that he knew and were fortunate enough to know him in the closing shot of the film. We see of the people that we met throughout the film, older but clearly happier as they stand around, telling each other stories in memory of their friend. <br/><br/>I say bravo, Mr Burton. Bravo."

","As you no doubt would guess from my summary, I am not a Tim Burton fan. To tell the truth, the only reason I went in to see this movie was because I had a free pass that was about to expire and then this one used a great song (Peter Gabriel's ""Solisbury Hill"") in its commercials (I agree, that is the absolute dumbest reason to see a movie that there is; but it's the truth!), so I went to watch it.  I cringe whenever I hear that Tim Burton is working on a film--especially since he managed to take a masterwork of American literature in Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" and turn it into an atrocious assault on the filmgoing public named ""Sleepy Hollow"" that hardly even resembled the work on which it was based.  I hate everything of his I have seen except ""Batman,"" which I like just for pure fun.  However, I have always enjoyed his use of color and lighting and so I have been hoping for a long time that he would work from a great script once so that perhaps he would make a good film.<br/><br/>He finally has done both with ""Big Fish.""  This film is an exercise in mythmaking--something that filmmakers should be interested in doing and yet somehow are not.  While it isn't the grand, ancient, epic mythmaking that Tolkien did with his ""Lord of the Rings"" novels and then Peter Jackson later did with the film adaptations, it is the same basic concept--creating a piece of folklore.  It's obvious in its themes and story, yes, but that's part of the point:  folklore and myths are always obvious.  The characters are flat, but they really don't matter as much as they do in more modern forms of storytelling.  (As Mozart says in ""Amadeus,"" mythical characters are ""so elevated they sound as if they [crap] marble,"" and most people ""would rather listen to your hairdresser than Hercules."")  So, the obviousness and character flatness is intentional and is part of creating the world in which this film resides, which is not strictly the real one.<br/><br/>There isn't much to the characters, which then of course renders the actors incapable of putting in impressive performances.  As I've said, it's not about characters.  This is not an actor's movie (hence it will be ignored by the Oscars--if you read this after them, you'll be able to see if I'm any good at prognisticating such things), but I do want to point out the thoroughly enjoyable performance of Ewan McGregor  He seemed to be thoroughly enjoying himself the entire time and played up the cheese in the story to the hilt in a wonderfully entertaining way.<br/><br/>Burton creates a beautiful, colorful, obviously not-quite-real world for this film that works perfectly for the storyline and keeps the film in this other world in which it does exist.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fun movie.  You can start attaching significance to it if you want and searching it for symbols and mythical archetypes, but I personally just enjoyed it.  It's nice-looking, light-hearted, and funny. From what I have seen (which is most of the Oscar contenders), this is the second-best movie of 2003, a worthy film, and the picture that proves Tim Burton CAN make a good movie if he's got subject matter with which to work."

","The story deals with a father-son relationship.  In the son's early years -- say at bedtime -- the son was enthralled by his father's stories about his previous adventures. <br/><br/>But as he hears these same stories repeated (eventually _ad nauseum_), he views them as ""shtick"" -- his father's routine to be performed at any social gathering that permits it -- and he becomes resentful of his father's reliance on them.  His being forced into the posture of a passive, appreciative audience prevents him from ever really knowing his father or having an adult-adult relationship with him. The stories form an impenetrable facade and shield. In reaction, the son becomes estranged from his father until his mother calls him and says his father is dying.  The son returns home with his new wife, hoping to re-establish an honest, intimate relationship with his father before his father dies.  His wife is pregnant and he urgently wants to accomplish this -- to form a satisfying relationship -- before he himself becomes a father.<br/><br/>The movie very satisfactorily develops that. <br/><br/>What happens next is that son gradually finds some pieces of evidence that his father may have had some adventures that formed building blocks for his father's schtick. <br/><br/>Burton and his movie dramatize the father's fanciful stories and that forms the backbone and length (205 minutes!) of the film.<br/><br/>Somehow, by finding that the stories were not _entirely_ fanciful, that there may have been some reality building blocks in them, the son reconciles himself to his father and accepts him for what he is. And at the end, at the funeral, we see a visual evidence that his father's fanciful tales had some basis in reality.  <br/><br/>What's given us are marvelous, fanciful representations of the tall tales. And the son's brief searches for realities behind the stories also are given fanciful, fairy tale twists.  What we are not given (at least not given to me) is a satisfying sense of what helps the son suddenly give up his desire for intimacy with his father and click into accepting his father's stories and his father.  <br/><br/>IF we view the whole thing as it probably should be -- as a fairy tale composed of a collection of fairy tales -- then it makes a moderately entertaining evening.

","I loved this movie. Everything about this movie was awesome. It had a little bit of the different Tim Burton moods in it. Some parts were colorful, similar to Pee Wee's Big adventure and Mars Attacks. Some of the scenes were very dark similar to Sleepy Hollow and Batman. I believe Burton is the greatest director of our time. Some may argue the point that Speilberg is the best, but I beg to differ. After Stanley Kubrick passed away I think Tim Burton took the throne as the best director, but i believe that I am the only one who would think so. Hopefully people will begin to realize his brilliance when Charlie and the chocolate factory comes out. Anyways, Ewan Mcgregor was great in the movie and I really liked Albert Finney as well. Hard to believe he was Daddy Warbucks in Annie. Mcgregor's role was just magnificant. He made the story very believable. I hope to see more of him.

After this film, however, there were several other viewers remaining in the theatre who were visibly touched by the story. Some were crying in a way that seemed as though it was more than empathy for the characters, but that this film somehow touched elements in their own lives. I know it did for me.<br/><br/>Therefore, go watch this movie with in open heart and mind. Don't expect the traditional (and expected) rising action, catharsis and denoument. This film is bigger than that, and will offer you something more."

","I had big expectations for this movie...i really did.  Admittedly, i am not a strict ""Burton-ian"" but i have long admired Burton's style and figured that this movie was either going to severely disappoint or greatly impress..and fortunately the latter occurred.  The movie is a bit choppy, and at times can seem a bit superficial but simply put, it is a truly moving piece of a son who cannot accept his father until it is nearly too late. I recommend this to everyone; even if it's not as dark as Burton's other works, it still has extremely worthwhile performances and messages."

","Scot Ewen McGregor and Brit Albert Finney star as Edward Bloom, a ""big fish"" in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama. Edward's tall tales impress and entertain everyone except his son Will. Will is most bothered that, at the age of 30 and about to have his first child, he still knows little of who his father really is. So when Will gets a call from his mother (Jessica Lange, looking great at 55) saying his father is dying of cancer, Will used the opportunity to get to know the truth about the man.<br/><br/>Told completely in flashback from several characters, Will learns of his father's successes and failures. From his childhood, when he and four friends visited the local witch (Helena Bonham Carter), who could predict when and how he would die; to his adolesence, when he starred on the high school baseball, football, and basketball teams, and then befriended a wandering giant; to his adulthood, when he roamed around Alabama, finding the perfect town of Spectre, joining the Calloway (Danny Devito) Circus, seeing the love of his life (""White Oleander""'s Alison Lohman), and spending the next three years pursuing her.<br/><br/>Worth mentioning is the supporting cast, a fabulous array of famous actors and unknowns who contributed to ""Big Fish."" The visual effects were done perfectly, just enough to enhance the story without taking control of the movie.<br/><br/>Much like ""Forrest Gump"" with Burton's trademark quirkiness, ""Big Fish"" is a trip through time as seen through one man's life.<br/><br/>Rating note: There is some brief nudity, without which ""Big Fish"" probably could have gotten away with a PG.

","""Big Fish"" is an exciting film for me as a fan of Tim Burton, because it truly showcases everything that makes him a good storyteller--a grim reality sugarcoated by fairytale fantasy, vivid and quirky characters, a great deal of soul and heart, and top notch acting by people not afraid to act. It is my hope that audiences will see in this film everything they loved in Burton's earlier ventures.<br/><br/>I cannot praise the cast and their performances enough. Characters who were supposed to be believable were, and characters who were obviously larger than life were just that.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD, TURN BACK IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW***<br/><br/>I will be frank, however, that I did not care for the ending. I was so incredibly built up for the end to reveal that all of these stories were real, that Will had wrongly accused his father all these years, that the final ending was such a tremendous let down that I even suggested others not see it right after. I suppose what started my build up was the line, ""I don't want to ruin the surprise ending"" in reference to how he was going to die. My idea for a surprise ending is that it all was true, instead we're left with an old liar who had to make up a more exciting life for himself than what he had just to get by. This is to me the downfall of the film; its message. The message is that a sweet lie is better than a dull truth. As a person who abhors dishonesty I am having a hard time sinking my teeth into this fish.<br/><br/>So in summary, up until the last ten minutes of the movie, Big Fish is a masterpiece. And if you don't mind that ending, then great. In the end, every critic must dtand aside and remind his reader that what makes a movie truly good or bad is not that they liked it, but that the audience did. So go on out, and decide for yourself."

","OK, so I've been reading people's thoughts on the movie, the metaphors and<br/><br/>explanations and all. In fact many people on this site have conflicting perspectives on what the movie is truly about and what in the movie is real in what is fantasy. It occurs to me that Big Fish, which is about a son attempting to uncover who his father truly is and which of his grand stories are true and not true, left the same effect on its viewers. Here we are trying to distinguish between reality and fantasy, just like Edward. In the end Edward realizes that it doesn't matter what is true or false and comes to accept his father for who he is, and himself carries on his fathers legacy by repeating these amazing stories to his own children. Once again here the viewers of Big Fish are reitterating the stories from the movie. But what the point here is, is that it doesnt matter what was reality and make believe in the movie, just accept and enjoy it with all the great ties and metaphorical connections. Don't overanalyze it to the point where it all meaning is lost."

Even the attention to visuals, from set decoration, to special effects were off the mark for what we have come to expect from Burton. When one is fishing in such over fished waters, it is necessary to offer novelty, not for its own sake, but to advance the story. About 15 minutes into the film, I suddenly found myself thinking OF ""It's A Wondeful Life"". And on that most obvious level of being a ""big fish in a small pond"", I really liked the Baileys much more than the Blooms.

Now he has amazed us all by showing us how great of a director that he truly is in his Masterpiece, ""Big Fish"".<br/><br/>   Based a the novel written by Daniel Wallace, ""Big Fish"" is a great story about a man ,Ed Bloom, who tells many people stories of his ""fairy tallish"" life, and how he and his son , William become estranged due to the son growing weary of his father's ""tall tales"".

"jessfink","Null","0","0","26 January 2004"," Most of you guys are right on the money
","What a weird movie experience this was.  Not weird in a typically Tim Burton way, but weird regardless of who the director was.  You have to look at this film two ways--as a movie, and then as a Tim Burton movie.  It isn't exactly successful as the first, and it is radically different from previous efforts as the second.  I can't exactly recommend it, but it was certainly interesting to see, and I look forward to some enjoyable heated discussions with people over the years about it.<br/><br/>The main problem is the pacing.  It dragged terribly through the entire second act and most of the third.  I mean, it lumbered, and I am not one who needs a lot of action or even dialogue to be riveted by a movie.  He tried hard to weave a convincing narrative, but gets mired down in ideas that aren't fully developed and ultimately, the movie collapses on itself.<br/><br/>It also turned itself upside down trying to make a point that ultimately isn't made very convincingly, largely due to skeletal dialogue Billy Crudup's character has to mouth rather lamely.  He wants to know the real guy his dad is...dad never told him the truth...he never talked with his dad...did it never occur to him to talk to his mother?  Visit all the people his father told him about a thousand times?  He finally goes to see one person when his dad is on his deathbed and I really saw no point to the entire encounter. Given that dad is a guy who never shut up and obviously worshipped his family, I found it hard to believe the whole ""I-resent-you-Dad"" shtick.  <br/><br/>What I love about Tim Burton's work is the visual element.  I say to people all the time that half the time, I just throw in a Burton DVD and hit the mute button, looking at his films like art instead of movies.  I have never felt that he was a particularly engaging storyteller, feeling instead that his movies all relied so heavily on the visual that it was a lot like eating too much candy...afterwards, you're still hungry and kind of queasy.  This movie suffers from a bit of the same problem.  The visuals are more whimsical than we're used to, more naturalistic but the overall sense of imagination that makes me gasp from Burton normally isn't present throughout.  There are moments of inspiration--the popcorn, the daffodils--but overall, I get the impression that he is just trying too hard. <br/><br/>The performances are sublime, with especial kudos to Ewan MacGregor.  This man is simply celestially talented.  He lights up the screen like a supernova.  Jessica Lange is wasted, and Alison Lohman is so eerily her spitting image that I think she must have been cloned.  Albert Finney is terrific, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito seem to be having the time of their lives, and even the mostly wooden Billy Crudup acquits himself well at the end."
"xavrush89","9","0","0","26 January 2004"," Oversentimentality is the only flaw, albeit a minor one.
","I say this as a warning to anyone who tends to avoid films that blatantly and shamelessly pull at one's heartstrings.  But this film does it in such a creative way, and only in parts, that it would be a shame to miss out on seeing such a whimsical romp.  Actually there is one other flaw:  You don't put Jessica Lange in a movie and then underuse her!  Shame on you, Tim Burton!  (If in all her scenes, Lange leaves you wanting more, you MUST check out the HBO bittersweet drama, NORMAL.)<br/><br/>That being said, allow me to rave about Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor. They are just as successful at playing the same character at different ages as Judi Dench and Kate Winslet in the wonderful IRIS.  Finney has lost none of the charm that made him an international star FORTY years earlier in TOM JONES, and McGregor, well, he's the ONLY major actor of my generation whose presence alone is reason enough for me to see a film, and I mean ONLY.  He does not disappoint.  Billy Crudup tones down his normally sexy persona and plays a stuffed shirt adequately.  Marion Cotillard as his wife is lovely, could've used a little more of her.  And Helena Bonham Carter?  Don't get me started on how great she is in her supporting performance, hopefully this film will get her noticed and back into the leading roles she deserves to play.  Matthew McGory and the up-and-coming comic actor Missi Pyle round out an incredible ensemble cast.  <br/><br/>Burton takes all of the actors' strengths and puts them in visually splendid settings, creating a fantasy world that works perfectly for the narrative he sets up.  This is one of those films like E.T. that you just have to go with, and the journey the audience makes with Crudup's character is definitely worth taking.  I was worried this was going to be Schmaltz City, but with Burton at the helm it steers clear of that 85% of the time.  If you don't mind that other 15% this film is for you, and it's a great film for families as well."

","In many ways, this doesn't even feel like a Tim Burton film.  Largely shorn of the dark tones and sinister shadows of Edward Scissorhands, Batman or Sleepy Hollow, it's more like Burton via Cameron Crowe, a comparison further held up by the presence of Billy Crudup.  With Ewan McGregor present, however, together with themes of love-against-the-odds and magical realism, the comparison is more with Moulin Rouge!  Add all of this together and you've got an enchanting tale.  But it's not flawless - for starters, it's really quite slow.  (*There follows some plot details, no spoilers*) While, in the present day, we follow Crudup's attempts to get closer to his dying father (Albert Finney), the film simultaneously shows us McGregor as a young Finney, in flashbacks that are almost certainly apocryphal.  He becomes a ""big fish"" in his home town, then strikes off on his own, coming to a village called Spectre.  It's at this point that the movie becomes a little plodding, but it picks up a bit once he spies the love of his life...  In essence, it's a slightly uneven film with wonderful moments - the popcorn, the daffodils, Danny DeVito.  And it's a rollercoaster ride through Tim Burton's imagination with giants, witches, mythological beasts, circuses, romance, sky-writing and fish.  The cast is outstanding, although the most memorable turns come from supporting players such as Steve Buscemi, in great form.  One stand-out aspect is the way it actually gets *better* towards the end.  Films never do that, and certainly not fantasy-tinged films like this! So it gains an extra point for a truly wonderful ending."

"WWFStern","Null","0","0","24 January 2004"," Big Fish is half excellent, half good
","WARNING: Newspaper-style movie review, including plot discussion.<br/><br/>Tim Burton is an acquired taste. His flights of fancy and flourishes of eccentric style make him one of the most divisive directors in cinema today. Big Fish, the director's latest, is actually half Burtonian and half family drama. When the images and occurrences are larger than life, the film zips along with plenty of eye candy to sweeten one's taste buds. When the film lurches into the dramatic, the pace flags despite solid acting and a story that's a step or two away from touching. On the whole, because it is so uneven, the two-hour film feels overlong in spite of all the pieces being in place for greatness. <br/><br/>Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a man who loves to tell tall tales about his life experiences. His energetic delivery and unmitigated exuberance leave his audiences, disbelieving though they may be, uniformly rapt. That is, except for his son William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a straight-laced reporter who feels that he has lived his entire life without ever knowing the truth of his father. Upon hearing about Edward's impending death, after three years of silence between the two, William travels to his father's bedside with his pregnant wife in tow. There, in Edward's final days, William tries to finally break through the fairy tale facade he's always lived with to understand the stranger he calls dad. <br/><br/>Though Edward is weak, he can't resist spinning stories to his son's French bride. The film traces Edward's life as a young man this way, featuring Ewan McGregor as the young wanderer. This is probably McGregor's best performance to date, because even though Moulin Rouge is a superior film, this role is more focused on acting and a pure emotional connection with the audience. McGregor succeeds on both counts, creating an extremely likeable and always fascinating character to observe. It is a testament to the quality of his performance that he is never overshadowed by the oddball characters he comes across. <br/><br/>And speaking of oddball characters, Burton really shows his stuff when young Edward is traversing Alabama. The impressive array of people he meets includes a giant named Karl, a one-eyed witch (Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter), Japanese Siamese twins, a swarthy old-time carny (Danny DeVito with a wavering Southern accent) and the bare-footed residents of the idyllic town Spectre. This portion of the film includes a haunted forest, a prophetic glass eye and more fantastical fun. Undoubtedly the strongest portion of the film, these flashbacks are both beautiful and energizing. <br/><br/>Tim Burton, who reportedly had a rocky relationship with his father, found his a very personal project and cannot be blamed for turning on the sentimental waterworks near the end of the film. However, after having so much fun with Ewan McGregor, the viewer doesn't want to shed a tear with a dying old man and his stuffy son. Our reluctance to accept the film's tonal shift probably explains why Big Fish isn't as moving as the recent Monster and House of Sand and Fog are. The film is pulling in two different directions at once, and invariably, the weaker side ends up being dragged in the dust. <br/><br/>Big Fish is certainly worth seeing, and if the personal connection is there for you, it may work as well as it obviously hopes to. For me, the happy-go-lucky filmgoer, I would have traded the hour or so of Finney/Crudup for a half-hour more of Ewan. After all, if you aren't going to a Burton film for magic, why bother going at all? <br/><br/>Final Grade: B+"

","Just watched 'Big Fish'. Admittedly I am a complete Burton fanboy, so it's with great delight that I report 'Big Fish' is a stunning return to form after the disaster that was the 'Planet of the Apes' remake. Some people have been questioning Burton's skill since Apes, with reports of remakes abounding - the much-hyped Johnny-Depp-starring redo of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', and also his ability to appeal to the mainstream and keep the studio's happy. I think 'Big Fish' will silence his critics once and for all. <br/><br/>In my opinion 'Big Fish' is easily his best work. Both mature and delightfully childlike I think he's been watching a lot of Jean-Pierre Jeunet films. It has the same hyper-realism and surrealism as Jeunet's work, but retains everything that makes Burton's films so unique - his own brand of off-kilter story-telling, slightly off-centre humour and childlike wonder. <br/><br/>'Big Fish' is also Burton's most commercial piece of work, and I suspect it's going to be a massive hit with everybody - critics and audiences, young and old, film buff and film newbies. You can't help but get pulled along by the youthful exuberance of the whole film - it's like 'Amelie' on acid. One critic dubbed the film the new 'Wizard of Oz', and I'd say that's pretty much spot on - both films are a delight to watch, are visually inventive, and bursting with happiness. <br/><br/>Story wise it's pure Burton. Tall tales, bizarre misfit characters, but heart-warming and uniquely beautiful. There are no real ""stars"" in the film, as it seems to go beyond any one actor or actress... so real commendations to all involved as it takes some doing to make you believe that your not watching ""stars"" Jessica Lange, Ewan McGregor, and Helena Bonham Carter. The rest of the cast is equally sparkling, cameo's by a whole host of players at the top of their game. Albert Finney get's the real kudos - he plays the old dying 'Big Fish', Ed Bloom, perectly... with the perfect balance of emotion, charm and wit. I have little doubt that he'll walk away with a paperweight or two this awards season. <br/><br/>I think 'Big Fish' is a timeless masterpiece. A film that parents will show their children, and children will show their children. It's pure cinema magic, and I don't often say that... you really do get a real sense of magic and wonder while watching it, the ""time stops"" sequence is as perfect a piece of cinema as I've ever seen. So a welcome return to the boy-wonder Burton after a brief spell in the wilderness. So now I'm going to be waiting on the remake of 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' with baited breath... it'll either be simply amazing or astounding awful, Burton never does things by halves."

","BIG FISH (SPOILERS!!!!)<br/><br/>	As a Burton-fan, Big Fish initially is not what you'd expect. Tim Burton is known for directing films about lone and weird individuals placed in supernatural or Gothic stories. With Big Fish Burton leaves a few of his usual trademarks behind, but essentially returns to what he's good at, and delivers far from a disappointment. The narrative is basically a fantasy, based on one Ed Bloom, who has lived a life, only known to others by the miraculous stories he tells. Burton successfully tells Ed's tale by smoothly interchanging present day and the fantastic stories, using visual motifs such as hands and shadows. Two significant examples deal directly with Will Bloom. On the Airplane, Will sees a young boy casting hand shadows onto the trey table, which transitions to the hand shadows cast on the bedroom wall. The other time Will Bloom remembers the story by looking upon Ed's robotic hand. Burton further emphasizes his use of hands during the touching encounter of Ed and his water girl. He sits in his car, underwater, and touches the inside of the window, while the water girl smoothly caresses the outside, lining their hands up exactly. Several times throughout the film, direct cuts to extreme close-ups of hands appear, signifying the intimacy of the story. The editing in the film is strongly based visual links, which is necessary, since the story switches time's fairly frequently, and does not utilize blurring, simple wipes or dissolves to signify a change of time. However, all the time switching and location changes do not rush movie forward or slow the story down. The pace is smooth throughout the entire film, and never feels rushed or too slow. Big Fish has the top quality editing of Burton-veteran Chris Lebenzon, who has worked on every  Tim Burton film since Batman Returns, but has worked several times with another Burton-veteran-editor Billy Weber. Aside from Burton, he frequently worked for Jerry Bruckheimer's team on movies like Top Gun, Crimson Tide, Enemy of the State, and Pearl Harbor. His most creative work so far was made for Tim Burton, and Big Fish is definitely his best.<br/><br/>	Tim Burton's directing style, based on his past movies, is known for its portrayal of freaks and the way they live in our world. Burton tends to depict his freaks as either 'normal' people that cant fit into society due to their freakish personality, or as likable physical freaks that try to live their life as good as they can. Big Fish definitely has both, but leans more towards the latter. A major part of the narrative takes place in a Circus, which takes pride in showing freaks on stage, but none are ever frightening or seem of negative appeal. A big Burtonesque feature in any of his movies is his merging of humans and animals. Batman has several hybrid characters like Catwoman and the Penguin; Mars Attacks features a dog's body merged with a woman's head; and Planet of the Apes had the obvious merger of man and monkey. Though Big Fish's hybrids are more literal and implied rather than physical, he still has a woman swimming underwater like a fish.<br/><br/>	Ed Bloom's connection to fish was apparent from the first sequence, until his death. Bloom's initial link of course was the gigantic fish he caught in the beginning. but he also swims like a fish in his pool,  compares himself to a gold fish during his instant growth, and is told by Danny DeVito's character Amos Calloway, that he may have been a  Big Fish back in hick-town. Ed even says himself, while laying in his bed, drinking a cup of water, that he was thirsty all his life, hinting at his fish-like nature. Furthermore, Ed lays in a filled up bathtub due to his fear of drying out. However the fish motif does not only apply to Ed Bloom, but also hints at his wife Sandra, who turns out was Bloom's mysterious water girl. Young Jenny tells Bloom that some see the water girl as a big fish, and he himself states at his son's reception, that sometimes the only way to get a perfect catch, is by offering it a wedding ring. But the most subtle hint, and yet most important, was towards Bloom's son Will, who in a way is represented by the fish Ed catches in the beginning, since Ed caught it on Will's birthday. However, Ed's words were `There are some fish that can't be caught,' which subtly foreshadowed Ed and Will's troubling relationship, as Will was unable to accept his father's fictitious life and had a hard time understanding why Ed was the way he was. The ending shot of Big Fish shows a fish jumping into the air, and being free and himself for the first time. Though it may seem that Ed is supposed to be the fish, it seems more plausible that it represents Will. For the first time in Will's life, he can accept who his father was and be happy about it. For the first time Will is free.<br/><br/>	This is by far Burton's most intelligent movie. It tells the story of one person's inability to accept something that might not seem true. Burton however leaves the ending conclusion open enough for each audience member to make-up their own minds. The ending is very thoughtful and beautiful. Though opinions may vary, one of the main conclusions that can be drawn is `Accept and love everyone. especially the ones that are so different that you don't understand them.' Big Fish is truly a great film.<br/><br/>One of Tim Burton's best."

","Big Fish is a rare film that surprised me, in all actuality. I was expecting typical Burton moviemaking, and saw what I consider to be an exceptionally moving film. (As an aside, I will never understand why the Hollywood Foreign Press nominated it as a comedy, but I digress).<br/><br/>I admit that I was bored a bit throughout the movie, and slightly annoyed when people laughed at comical events that were more moving that comical. However, as the movie concluded, I looked around and noticed not a single dry eye in the movie theater. I'm a 23 year old male and I've cried while seeing two movies in my life (Life is Beautiful and Big Fish). Take that for what it is.<br/><br/>My main concern with the movie is the southern accents and picturesque story of Alabama. As a northern transplant going to school in GA, I will admit that the southern accents were not spot-on. However, if I had never lived in the South, I never would have noticed this and would have viewed the movie a bit differently. I think that northerners have a ""story"" version of the South that is much different than the lived experienced of the South. I prefer the ""story"" version and that is what you get from start to finish in this excellent movie.<br/><br/>I urge people to see the movie if you have an enormously strong connection with your father or you are slightly emotionally disconnected from your father. This movie will move you in a way that I was not expecting, even after reading numerous reviews of the movie.<br/><br/>9.6/10 = A"

I ended up blubbing my eyes out at the end and was sincerely affected, not because it's schmaltzy, trite or over-emotional, but rather because it spoke to real emotions and trials in everyday life. How many of us have had to deal with uncooperative people? Scraping along to make a living? Dealing with horrible bosses? Unrequited love? The death of a parent who we inherently love but don't ""get""? It's a beautiful tale and one that should be seen again and again to get the full measure of it's beauty. Kudos to Tim Burton."

","The title of this movie has a big significance over the whole story. With many of the other movies directed by Tim Burton, they all somewhat have a dark touch to them. The film starts really dark and progresses too many ""happy"" parts in the story but still retaining its darkness. The interaction between every character comes back in the end, even if you don't think it will. There are also many twists that will make you think. A few things still seem unclear, but I am sure there is a logical explanation for all of these occurrences. Big Fish makes use of many of your emotions. From the emotion of happiness in parts when you think a good thing will happen, or near the end when you're really mixed on Sad and Happy at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie is a must see. If you liked Nightmare before Christmas or along the lines of Edward Scissor Hands, you will defiantly like this movie. Its different, but not that weird.

That said, I believe there was some bad acting (with the exception of Ewan McGregor, who played a wonderful part) and some awkward dialogue, but while this took away from the story somewhat, Big Fish was still a great viewing experience. <br/><br/>The point of this story, without giving away anything, is that life is ultimately as beautiful and grand as we choose to make it, that we make our own immortality, if not through our actions then our words.

","`Big Fish,' stars Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, and Billy Crudup with Danny Devito in a smaller role. In this crazy movie about Will Bloom, Crudup, who tries to learn more about his dying father Edward Bloom, Finney. The story is told through tall tales of him as a boy to a man, played by McGregor, filled with witches, giants, and towns where no one wears shoes. Through all of this, Crudup begins to understand about who his father really is and accept what kind of person he is. The way the film was presented was magical, and the imagination took over as he wove wilder and wilder tales. The potency of what he was communicating to the audience was huge. He was really stressing the fact that it was good to stand out and make a difference. In one part of the film, young Edward Bloom explains that he is like a goldfish in that they grow if they have a bigger space, so therefore he would go out into the world and grow also. McGregor as him as a younger man is a joy to watch onscreen as he has such a positive outlook on life. He already knows how he is going to die so he is fearless and takes the path less traveled by. Whenever he gets scared he realizes that he will be fine because this is not the way he saw himself go.<br/><br/>     Crudup as Will Bloom is really quite a foil to him as he is very logical and he feels like he has been lied to all his life. He doesn't understand why his father can not just tell him what actually happened, instead of telling elaborate stories that he has heard a thousand times and doesn't believe. He could have come off as stiff or boring but instead he just tries to grasp what really happened because it is hard for him to understand his father as he does not function on the same level. Finney as Edward Bloom as him today is a kid at heart who really enjoys life to the fullest and has a unique outlook on life. He is a story teller and loves to tell stories about his life that are only part truths but he revels in the telling and really needs listeners to hear his great epic tales. Critics are calling `Big Fish' one of the best films of the year, and with four Golden Globe nominations it is sure to be an Oscar contender as well. Tim Burton, the acclaimed director of `Edward Sissorhands,' directs `Big Fish.' <br/><br/>i wrote this article for my high school news paper so i thought i might as well post it here too!"

Obviously word is spreading about this movie fast, and from 10 to 75+ all generations were represented in full force.

The acting is great over-all, but is not perfect.personally I like a `real' movie. Tim has always been good at leaving movies a bit raw, and I respect him for that. Some of the scenes look like they might have needed another cut at it here and there, and both of these problems add up to about 2 minutes of the entire film. People that exploit those on here are full of themselves, and I'm sure they can honestly admit to never having any kind of imagination or happiness in their entire lives. I'd suggest before you try to critique a movie, you have a real life before trying to live in the fantasy that is film.<br/><br/>`Big Fish' certainly has creativity, originality, and in some case a lot of foresight. It did absolutely touch the heart of every person within sighing distance that I could tell, and I'm sure the entire audience as well. This movie was magical wondrous ride that I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to direct, because no one could have done the job like Tim Burton. He's had hit and misses in his career, but this one takes the cake.<br/><br/>There are always flaws in every movie, so I refuse to give a 10/10 to anything, but this is about as close as it gets. 9/10<br/><br/>Grab your wife, Grab your kids, Grab your parents, and if their alive, grab your parents' parents, and go see this movie!

","I don't know if I agree with people who say this is Tim Burton's finest, but `Big Fish' is certainly a wonderful, enjoyable movie.  It's not perfect but it is bold, creative, funny, and incredibly touching.  I found myself crying through much of the movie, which focuses on Edward Bloom (Albert Finney, who brings humor and touching gravity to his role), a dying man who loves to tell stories, and his relationship with his son (Billy Crudup).  Because `Big Fish' mostly details Edward Bloom's life, the movie has brilliant style, although some parts were a little too stretched out for my taste. <br/><br/>	 `Big Fish' deals with flashbacks that look at Edward's life through his stories.  Ewan McGregor is wonderful as the young Edward Bloom.  McGregor has a great gift for facial expressions, so he is a delight to watch onscreen.  Most of his adventures are particularly wonderful, especially the one about how he meets his wife, gets to know her, serves in a war, and returns to her.  I was crying my eyes out throughout the entire sequencebecause the story is so shockingly inventive and so heartwrenching. It kills me just to think of it.  Their love for each other withstands time (something beautiful it itself); there is one scene with the old Edward and his wife (Jessica Lange) in a bathtub that is absolutely gorgeous in its simplicity. 	 And, like some of Tim Burton's other movies (like `Edward Scissorhands'), the heart of the story is `love,' love between a man and wife, love between a father and his son.  I love how Burton has interpreted it in `Big Fish' and showed it to us through Edward's crazy stories.  8/10"

","Big Fish (2003/Tim Burton) *** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>The great director Sydney Pollack once said that musicals aren't made that much anymore due to the fact that today's society has lost a lot of it's innocence. I feel the same way about films of the fantasy genre. They represent that childhood nostalgia type of magic that isn't found in today's films. Probably the last well made fantasy I saw was ""Pleasantville"". That was until yesterday, when I went to see ""Big Fish"". <br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is about a southern man named Ed Bloom (played greatly by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney). Ed spends all of his adult life telling tall tales to his son, and just about anyone who will listen. But eventually his son gets older and stops listening (and is played by Billy Crudup). Once he finds out his father is dying, his son Will intends to seek the truth of his father's life. After hearing many stories, he soon realizes that maybe the 'big fish' stories were the most important thing about his father.<br/><br/>
Never before have I seen such a film that is so bizarre, odd, random...yet so colorful, likeable, enjoyable, and rewarding. It is a nice feeling to go to a movie and be taken away by such magical scenery and extraordinary characters. Tim Burton does a great job at bringing this magic to the screen. The performances also stand out. Ewan McGregor turns in a tour de force performance, so great that you automatically like him, and root for him the whole way. The rest of the cast do a great job, including: Albert Finney; Jessica Lange; Helen Bonham Carter; and Steve Buscemi. The score, cinematography, writing also contribute in making this film one of the most magical experiences you will ever have at the movies. <br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is being compared to ""The Wizard of Oz"" lately, and it is almost an updated version of it, that still has charm and innocence, yet a solid story with a sense of humor. One of the best films of 2003, and a definte must see!<br/><br/>-30-"

","It's the life of a salesman wrapped in a fairy tale that absolutely delights.  The premise:  If you knew how you were going to die  . . . what you'd be doing, where you'd be, who you'd be with at the moment of passing  how would you live?  Would you shun that situation like the plague; be the bravest guy in town in all other things?   Big Fish earned an 8 / 10 from me for taking me down that road.<br/><br/>This salesman (Finney) is a salesman / storyteller distanced from his son ostensibly for telling tall tales and stepping on the kid's moments growing up.  So what did that salesman see in that witch's eye when he was a kid anyway?<br/><br/>Listen, who hasn't dressed the facts to dress an otherwise boring story? This is a film about perspective  perspective in life.  If 3 people are in a 7-11 hold-up, the police will hear multiple versions of `what happened' sure as shootin'.  Your eyes - my eyes (your mind vs. mine) see events uniquely based on the sum of our personal experiences.  Positive, negative, surrealistic spins come into play.  The raconteur's art is his voice, passion; the details told vs. intrigue born by those withheld  it all counts.  Stories retold consistently become myth; myth : legend.  If you believe the legend, you're psychotic or blessed, depending on your audience's perspective.  Big Fish teaches you how to do it right.<br/><br/>On that `10"" scale, more than one `5' and `6' moments come along.  A stingier editor would have decorated the floor with many more frames.  But those cuts would have been a mistake.  Its ending works (ranking a `20' on that 10 scale) because the story meanders.  Big fish had me hook, line and sinker."

","Big Fish (2003)<br/><br/>This film focuses on Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), a young man with a pregnant wife, a mother (Jessica Lange), and a father (Albert Finney). A father who told Will many stories and tall tales as he grew up. At one point, Will stopped believing his dad's stories. Then, at Will's wedding, his father tells his most infamous tall tale- the story of how he caught an uncatchable fish the day Will was born. Sick of hearing his father's stories, they do not speak for over three years, until they are reunited when his father is diagnosed with cancer. And throughout all of his father's stories- ones involving a town named Spectre where no one wears shoes, to a sideshow circus owned by Amos Callaway (Danny Devito), where his father supposedly worked for three years in order to find the woman he was destined to marry, all the way to a lonely giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory) -, Will begins to find some truth in his father, something he has never seen before.<br/><br/>I simply enjoyed this movie, with it's ability to dazzle you with fairy tale-like settings in his father's stories, and to it's ability to strike you with sad moments. Tim Burton created a masterpiece of cinema. I love the set decoration in the towns in his father's stories, especially Spectre, and all of the set decoration on the old trail in the woods. The movie had a wonderful ending, but I don't want to spoil this film for you- it's too much of a gem. 9/10."
"2blackcats","Null","0","0","18 January 2004"," Truth in Fiction
","A culmination of sorts for director Tim Burton's career-long obsession with refashioning the fairy tale for modern, movie-going audiences, Big Fish is a delight. And like the quintessential tall tale of the big fish that got away, the real life of main character Edward Bloom is ultimately less important than the stories he tells. <br/><br/>Part fact, part fiction - perhaps not always truthful, but ultimately full of truth - Bloom's stories loosely tie Big Fish together. The basics - growing up, getting married, having a baby - are made magical and arguably, more meaningful here as Bloom (Albert Finney at his most likable) tells them. But his son, Will (Billy Crudup) feels distanced, cheated even, by his ailing Father's unwillingness to give the family the facts, and not the fantasy, of his life. And where there's fantasy, there's Burton at his best: a witch, a giant, a werewolf and even a Siamese chanteuse. All are misunderstood creatures who want nothing more than a sympathetic ear, and a life that matters. In this respect, the odd assortment of characters that populate Big Fish are no different, yet perhaps more fully formed, than Burton's Edward Scissorhands or even Ed Wood. <br/><br/>But the real magic of Big Fish is, oddly enough, the goofy enthusiasm of Ewan McGregor as the young Edward Bloom. Embarking on each successive adventure with pie-eyed optimism and a sense of wonder beyond all sense and reason, McGregor adds much needed humor and a jolt of vigor to a picture that could have easily tipped the scales too heavily in the direction of absurdity or treacle. In that same vein, watch for Steve Buscemi as poet/thief/tycoon Norther Winslow - hilarious, and a nice balance to a film that is otherwise Burton's heaviest and most profound.<br/><br/>
If Big Fish can be faulted (and it can), it is for the heavy-handedness of many of its themes. Still, Burton's tale of fathers and sons and the stories each tell to make sense of their lives is an ambitious work. It's Burton's best, and quite an achievement."
"NoArrow","Null","0","0","18 January 2004"," A beautiful ensemble of acting, writing and direction...
","...""Big Fish"" is cult director Tim Burton's latest film.  Unlike most of his other work (except for maybe ""Edward Scissorhands"") this film has a more happy and fun tone to it.  The plot focuses on two stories: in the first (and frame story) William Bloom (Billy Crudup) visits his mother Sandra (Jessica Lange) and estranged father Ed (Albert Finney).  Will hasn't seen his dad in years, so he wants to get to know him before the man passes away. Ed agrees, but his stories don't always seem as true or realistic as possible.<br/><br/>In his stories he is portrayed by Ewan McGregor, and we watch him travel the world and meet many interesting people.  He meets a lonely giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), works for a greedy circus ringmaster (Danny DeVito) and runs into a beautiful town called Spectre with inhabitants like would-be-poet Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi in a delightful role).  As he hears these stories over and over again, Will begins to get suspicious that his father has a double life.  I wont spoil anything else for you!<br/><br/>The acting, writing and direction is all wonderful.  The best performance of the movie (by far) comes from Albert Finney's Old Ed Bloom.  The man is jolly and sad, dying and yet he has a childish giddiness to him.  The role was perfect for Finney, and he was perfect for the role.  McGregor also does quite well (especially with his accent), and, of course, the supporting cast shines - most notably Lange in a tender, beautiful role.<br/><br/>The scriptwriting is creative and clever, a definite nom for Best Adapted Screenplay (and hopefully a win).  Tim Burton gives us a new view of himself, not only is he a brilliant horror director but he can also make a touching drama.<br/><br/>So if you're itching to see the Oscar contenders of 2003, see ""Big Fish"" first, 8.5/10."

","If there had to be a feel good movie of the year, Big Fish would be that movie.  This emotional rollercoaster of a film is a delightful fantasy about the adventures of a man(Ewan McGregor/Albert Finney), as told through the bed time stories he would tell his son (Bill Crudup).  As the son grows up his belief in his father's tales fades.  His father remains steadfast to his stories as truth and a rift is formed between the two.  This rift is only reborn when they meet again as the father is dying of cancer.  As both the story and the father's tales progress, his son discovers just how true his father's stories actually were.  All the performances in this film are very good and Burton hits a homerun with the cinematography and music use as well.  It truly is a touching story and is good for any sort of movie fan. i personally think it is just slightly better than Cold Mountain, but not as impressive as ROTK.  Big Fish is a fantastic film and one of the year's best."

","Tonight I went to Tim Burton's latest film, Big Fish. I highly recommend seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The film is masterful storytelling - masterful in the way the Bible is, or the ancient historian Herodotus. Most people today would never accept Herodotus as a historian, but those are the people I would especially like to have sitting in front of Big Fish. Story is not something less than the facts, it is something more.<br/><br/>I began counting the number of homilies that could be drawn from the movie - and I stopped counting at 15. This is a movie with some wisdom in it.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant... with the exception of one brief moment by Billy Crudup in the first ten minutes, and this was completely excusable because of the brilliance of the rest of the film. And probably the weak moment was due to a momentary slip in the editing room.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie was stunning, as one might expect from a Burton film. I was particularly interested in the way the movie depicted the human body, and the couple of ""nude scenes"" that will inevitably make some Christians uncomfortable. I count this movie among the few I have ever seen that included nudity in a non-violating way for both the actors & audience. Later this month, I will begin presenting a 15-week series on John Paul II's TOB (Theology of the Body) at Family Theater in Hollywood, and I will definitely be citing this film as an example of several TOB themes.<br/><br/>I left the theater wondering why I plan to become a screenwriter, when I know that - even if something I write makes it to the screen someday - nothing I create will reach the level of artistry I witnessed in this film. I guess I will just stick to the maxim (from Chesterton? or Eliot?) that if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.<br/><br/>At any rate, this movie has my highest recommendation."

","Maybe it was because I had just returned from a visit with my own father, or perhaps because of my own life experiences, but at the end of the film I wept, like I never have during a film before. When I arrived at the theater I was tired and under the influence of allergy medication. Consequently, I caught myself dozing off a little at the beginning of the film. Soon, however, I found myself completely wrapped up in the film. It was obvious from the beginning of the film, that somehow the father's tall tales would somehow be related to his real life, but it was such a delight to see fact and fancy dance about each other, to ultimately produce an TRUTH which can not be described by facts or fabrications alone.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, I not only surprised myself with my own tears (I am not one who is often brought to tears), but also became painfully aware that I was unsure as to whether the tears were for my father, my grandfather or myself. I have no idea how others will respond to this film, nor can I predict what my response will be on a second viewing, but I do know that the film was beautifully crafted. The acting was not only perfectly suited to the script, but it was most definitely an ensemble cast, with no actor trying to outshine another, or dragging the production down with inferior skills. By far, this is my favorite Burton film, and my favorite film for 2003."

","SPOILERS HEREIN Other reviewers have summarized the film quite nicely so I'll just skip the plot and say what did and did not work for me. The movie was decent. There were parts where it lagged and sagged a little, but in general the story kept moving right along from past to present and back again, through the ""big fish"" scenarios and events, and towards the denouement.  The ""big fish"" flashbacks ranged from mildly interesting to pretty interesting, but never much more than that.  In hindsight, the film spent too little time in the least interesting flashbacks (Young Edward Bloom encounters the twins during a war, Young Edward Bloom Falls for his wife, in the Town of Spectre) and too little time in the more interesting flashbacks (the witch's house, trying to catch the ""big fish""). Where this film really failed for me is that even though it is brightly colored and vividly filmed, ultimately, the product was very austere and, there's no other way to describe it but DRY. The film, including the fantasy flashbacks had a sort of hyper-reality to it that made me feel as if I was going to develop a headache.  (Think: the movie Matchstick Men, but in that case the austereness helped the plot, not worked against it.) I wanted to like it more than I did because I think Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, et al. are absolutely great actors.  To summarize, the plot, acting, and scenes made the movie interesting, I definitely would not call it a bad film, but the film was stylized in such a way as to produce a startling lack of emotionality.  Although it is commonplace now to accuse a director such as Steven Spielberg--in constrast--of producing the ""event film"" or injecting too much emotion, I couldn't help but wonder how this film might have been under Spielberg's helm."

","**Warning! Mild Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>As one might expect from Tim Burton, ""Big Fish""is an unconventional story, but one that provides a refreshing alternative to the epics that currently populate a good portion of cinemas. <br/><br/>Big Fish tells a father-son story. Set in past and present South, Ed and Will Bloom (Albert Finney and Billy Crudup), are somewhat estranged because Ed constantly speaks in grandiose tales, the veracity of which is highly dubious. Will has always been frustrated by the apparently duplicitous life of his father and had thus cut off communication with him. Toward the end of the father's life, the two reunite, and Ed's legends are examined from multiple perspectives. <br/><br/>Most everything about this film was well done, and it all starts with director Tim Burton. While this is not his best film (I'd go with Batman), it is certainly his most human and personal. In an often tender tale, he continues his brilliantly imaginative work by crafting a fantastical world filled with such characters as witches, giants, and circuses (circi?) that is somehow still grounded in reality. But Burton eschews his usual dark style (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow) in favor of a more gentle manner that still allows the technical aspects and actors to do the work. And a wise decision that is. The production design of Dennis Gassner (Road to Perdition) is exceptional, presenting a fanciful yet still reality-based look to match Burton's creativity. Musically, Danny Elfman once again collaborates with Burton on this film, mixing his typical quirky score with a handful of Southern-flavored classics like the Allman Brothers' ""Ramblin' Man"" and Elvis' ""All Shook Up."" The many different tones of this film could easily have been sloppy or inconsistent, but the technical prowess effectively provides the film with a thorough cohesiveness. <br/><br/>On the acting front, Albert Finney has been nominated for Golden Globe, and while he is quite good, I aver that Billy Crudup is at the heart of ""Big Fish."" Best known as a rock star in ""Almost Famous,"" Crudup shines here as the son searching for truth. He brings a sincere earnestness to the role, with gestures and looks that embody the yearning for honesty for which everyone longs. Just the way his eyes bounce, always looking for truth, is enough to drive this story forward. <br/><br/>Additionally, a cast of actors' actors that includes Ewan McGregor, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, and Helena Bonham Carter is of equally high quality, combining to form one of the best ensembles of the year. Most impressive is the continuity, both visual and otherwise, displayed between multiple actors playing the same character at different ages. Finney and McGregor as Ed Bloom, along with the always good Lange and Lohman as his wife Sandra, all match proper appearances and idiosyncrasies for some of most seamless age transitions I've seen in recent years. In most movies, you must suspend belief to buy the fact that one actor grew into another; but in ""Big Fish,"" you will honestly think Burton discovered a time warp.<br/><br/>
The downside to this film is the contrived feelings that are occasionally manifested by the efforts to make the fish analogies work. Everything, including the title of course, comes back to fish. Whether it be the father's favorite story or the odd physical transformations that are woven into the narrative fabric, these metaphors are just a little too cute, detracting a tad from the human heart of the movie. <br/><br/>But that heart is remarkable, revolving around powerful human themes of love and family, and the communication within those bonds. Will desperately wants to truly know his father, and in that process learns a good deal about himself. That's what life is all about, and that's what ""Big Fish"" expresses so very well. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Every year there are just two or three films that get me excited about what can be done with the medium. With its unique story and highly imaginative design, Big Fish achieves that distinction.  It's a treat of a film for movie lovers.  A high 8/10."

","I know what I was supposed to be feeling as I watched ""Big Fish,"" as Tim Burton banged me over the head with his theme on the importance of the storyteller enlivening our drab existence, but he was so insistent and rigid in this that I thought the whimsy and charm were drained out. <br/><br/>
Maybe because I was more won over more by Billy Crudup as the cynical son living in the real world than Albert Finney as the tale-spinner who straddles reality and fantasy with Jessica Lange as his still-blonde devoted Stepford wife. <br/><br/> I'm a big fan of magic realism, from Bedford Falls to even ""Neverending Story,""  but the fantasy elements here were too brittle, starting with Ewen MacGregor, who shows none of Finney's ""Tom Jones"" flare when enacting his younger self, and the preternaturally too bright smiles that everyone stiffly wears in the stories to match the too bright M & M artificial colors cinematogragraphy by Philippe Rousselot under too much make-up, including on Alison Lohman, though she eerily mimics Lange's body language as her younger self. <br/><br/>Part of the fantasy includes the very fake Alabama accents, which are Network Standard Southern, even though they filmed near Mobile.<br/><br/>
I wasn't sure if it was an intentionally transitional point in the movie as the fantasy elements start to intersect with the real world that we jarringly hear for the first time period-appropriate songs with ""5 O'clock World"" and the Allman Brothers' ""Travelin' Man.""  The closing song by Eddy Vedder and Pearl Jam was lovely."

Philippe Rousselot plays with a variety of bright colors, like a joyful memory where you remember everything brighter than it actually was.  Yes, there are dark moments in the movie, but those too seem less like a nightmare and more like a daydream.  Danny Elfman's score also fits the movie and its subject matter very well.<br/><br/>Second of all is the acting, which keeps the movie a good distance from its potential.  It's not that one character's acting is horrible, but certain scenes seem to take the actors to a ground on which they are not as easily able to stand.  <br/><br/>Third, the idea of the movie of alone makes it worth watching.

They started 2003 off not so promisingly with Darkness Falls and Tears of the Sun while limping through the summer with sub par hits like Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle and Bad Boys II. Is it that they have no more ambition left in them to put forth the effort? Was it the tremendous embarrassment of Gigli that is the true cause for their lack of marketing strength? If so then that is too bad. No, not because of real Oscar hope for Mona Lisa Smile (Julia Roberts doesn't need another Oscar statue) or Something's Gotta Give is gone but the fact that the studio may have had a real chance with Tim Burton's big screen adaptation of a not so well known tale, Big Fish. It may seem ordinary on the surface, the usual father/son emotionally driven story, but it is the whimsy and the magic that sets this one apart from the rest. Burton, who has had a real success for quite some time, is drawing doubt if he can bring a heart-felt tale to the screen with his track-record of weird projects but the way Columbia is looking for Oscar night at this point, it could hurt to find out.<br/><br/>Big Fish is based on the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and it discusses a son's journey to discover who he father really was after years of hearing nothing but tall-tales. Edward Bloom was too big for the small town he grew up in. That was due to his high ambition, or so that is the way he tells it. William Bloom never really knew his father. Edward was either off on business trips or telling the same elaborate fantasies that his son had heard his entire life, more then once or twice. After a couple years of broken communication between them, William returns home after his mother informs him that his father is slowing dying and may pass away soon. The son returns home for one last chance to discover the man his father really was. Going through all the magical and extraordinary adventures once again, William discovers that the truth of his father was there all along, he just needed to know where to look. The story for Big Fish takes several different and elaborate stories, some that work and some that don't, and brings them together in an enjoyable heart warming feature. At times, Fish's plot seems too high for its own good and the huge elaboration of simple stories seem way over done for many to take seriously within the context of what the filmmakers are trying to get across. This leads for some scenes within the film to not come off as effectively as others. Luckily this doesn't happen too often with the course of the film.<br/><br/>The cast consists of only two main leads (three if you count two people for the same role in different time periods) but the supporting roles provided by various talented actors and actresses are nearly as entertaining. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney share the role of Edward Bloom in various part of his life, the latter actor portraying the character as a dying old man. Finney's performance is nothing short of spectacular as Edward Bloom deteriorates as the feature moves on and as he struggles to get his son to understand the meaning behind his tall-tales. The last scene involving Finney will have anyone reaching for a tissue. That is a guarantee. McGregor provides that personal charm and spunk that makes the fantasies involving the younger Edward all the more memorable and captivating. Billy Crudup, who portrays William Bloom, seems okay but there is nothing in his performance that really stands out or equals that of Finney's performance along side him. Danny DeVito gives a delightful performance as Amos, the circus ring-leader who eventually hires Bloom to work on his show. Despite this charming performance, be warned! Unless you want horrible images of Mr. DeVito's rear end embedded in your mind, best to keep your eyes shut during a certain portion of the film. Nothing extraordinarily long but long enough. And Steve Buscemi's performance as a less then talented inspiring poet is one of the bigger highlights based on background characters.<br/><br/>Overall, Big Fish manages to swim above its own high-watered ambition despite a flop or two too close to shore. Going into this film, one has to understand this: almost everything in the individual tales is a metaphor for something else. The conjoined Japanese twins, for example, aren't actually conjoined in real life but they are so connected to each other, despite their own personal differences, that it seems that way. Many of exaggerations within the film are marvelously well played out but there are moments where you'll be questioning what the filmmakers are trying to do. The most prominent moment(s) involves the naked woman in the river that the young Edward Bloom sees outside his car that has been submerged by a great rainstorm. Of all the other fantasy sequences, this is the one that made the least amount of sense and probably wasn't necessary. Even with a pretty well balanced two hour time length, Big Fish fluxes between consistency and incoherence with some tales struggling to keep the pace more then others. Outside of those issues, Fish is a wonderful surprise from the man who has brought us dark classics such as Batman and Beetlejuice. It manages to be funny and heartwarming without losing its message in its own sea of ambition.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** out of 5 (Grade: B+)"

","Big Fish was just one of the most unbelievable films of the year.  I absolutely love Return of the King, I am a LOTR nut, but I have to admit, Big Fish was just as good.  It was just a purely amazing experience, touching every part of a person.

The whole cast is amazing, and Burton for once matches his style with substance, a whole world of substance.  Not to say the visuals weren't pleasing, it was classic Burton, however it is my favorite Burton flick of all time because it amazed my eyes with the visual brilliance, while still touching my heart with the simple story of a man, his son, and his life.

","Surprisingly, Tim Burton's new film is quite lifeless outside of its breathtaking visuals.  There are moments when the movie is sugar sweet in its attempt to<br/><br/>depict the fantastic world of Edward Bloom, but the eye candy doesn't seem to have a lot of emotional depth (although it strains as hard as it can).  The toggling of the narrative between Bloom's older self (Finney), who is disconnected from his grown son (Crudup), and his adventurous younger self (McGregor) is<br/><br/>uneven and tries so hard to form an emotional experience, but ultimately is so thin that there is no great payoff.  It is odd that Burton does not succeed where his film ""Edward Scissorhands"" did.  They similarly rely on elements of fantasy and reality cross-pollinating.<br/><br/>The biggest fault lies in the miscasting of McGregor, who labors with his<br/><br/>Southern accent and never seems at home in any part of the film.  McGregor,<br/><br/>who has had some brilliant performances in his past, most recently in ""Young<br/><br/>Adam,"" is unable to be effective in his role.  Miscasting plagues several other areas of the film, Helena Bonham Carter being the most glaring.  Yet, there are some very nice moments by Allison Lohman, Billy Crudup, and the actress that<br/><br/>plays Crudup's wife.  Finney has been better in a myriad of films, ""The Browning Version"" being one of his overlooked gems, and Jessica Lange has no<br/><br/>character to sink her teeth into and is quite wasted in this film.<br/><br/>Of course the film is littered with outrageous characters: Danny Devito's<br/><br/>carnivale ringmaster, Carl the friendly giant, and Steve Buscemi's poet laureate (sp?) to name a few.  And while there are warm moments for each of these<br/><br/>characters to show their eccentricities, they don't add up to a very involving movie.  Given all the praise this movie is getting, it seems odd that it seems hollow.  Instead of ingesting this confection, it is well advised to watch<br/><br/>Zemeckis's ""Forrest Gump,"" Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands,"" or even Burton's<br/><br/>""Pee Wee's Big Adventure.""<br/><br/>Although I will note that several people I have talked to vehemently disagree with my reaction.  It seems to be one of those movies that affects people or<br/><br/>leaves them unsatisfied... or even dissatisfied.  I fall into the latter camp and warn others that the gooey praise heaped on this film is unjustified.  I have a feeling that Burton has followed the pattern of many 70's directors who had a decade or so worth of great product in them but faded into mediocrity (Coppola, Cimino, Raefelson, Friedkin, Lumet, De Palma, etc.)."

","'Big Fish' is an intriguing and beautiful fantasy from the imagination of Tim Burton. The  entire cast is brilliant, Ewan McGregor, Billy Crudup, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and all  the rest too. The movie is charming and lovely, spectacular but not overdone. It was  surprisingly wholesome.<br/><br/> This type of movie has the same southern charm as 'Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya  Sisterhood'. It's a fairytale of the same breed as 'The Princess Bride' though it's more  whimsical, less sarcastic. They let the magic flow, and don't squelch it by explaining it  away. Although, the editing is tight, you don't feel confused at the end. Some of the  special effects are so convincing, I thought they were real, even after a minute or two.  Parts of it remind me of Alice In Wonderland, other parts are more like a classic hero  movie from the 1940's.<br/><br/> There's love, fantastic creatures, slapstick, haunted woods, and paradises. The movie is  about overcoming obstacles more than anything. It's mantra could be FDR's famous line  ""We have nothing to fear but fear itself."" It's probably the best movie I've seen this year,  and that's saying a lot."
"joker-4","8","0","0","8 January 2004"," A more mature Burton film.
","What can easily be described as a more mature Burton film, BIG FISH is certainly a return to classic Tim Burton elements, elements that were sorely missed in the beleaguered PLANET OF THE APES. Burton is able to wind between the whimsical and the serious and the laughable and the endearing without getting too campy, too heavy or especially too sappy, which this film could have easily become. Burton plays with the camera, the settings, even the actors, mixing up the environments, emotions and motions, but never gets too risky allowing subtle movements to occupy just as much screen time. However, perhaps some of Burton's more extravagant (darker?) motifs would have made the more playful scenes of the movie even more magical.<br/><br/>Some of the tall tales told throughout the film were definitely reminiscent of Gilliam's ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN, although Gilliam allowed the absurd to rule<br/><br/>throughout in that one. Burton could have gotten away with allowing a little more madcap absurdity to creep in a permeate tiny areas, after all Burton and the fantastical are quite the compatriots and as tight as - dare it be said - Batman and Robin. <br/><br/>If anything, BIG FISH proved that Burton could direct stars, stars who could act, mind you, that were as big as the movie itself. Finney and McGregor prove to be just as magical as the story itself. A twinkle of their eye, a big smile, and the audience is ready to believe anything, especially the tales of one big fish from a small pond."

","Don't be fooled.  Big Fish is not the classic want-to-be ""surreal"" tale with random psychodelic elements.  Big Fish is not a movie that ""tries to hard"" to be different or surreal.  Big Fish is *real*.  It embodies much more than what it may seem at first glance.<br/><br/>After a somewhat decline during his last movies (since his masterpieces ""Edward..."" and ""Ed Wood""), Tim Burton finally decided to explore two more realistic subjects: first; a father-son relationship and second; the story of ones life.  Big Fish is left to the viewer to be understood, analyzed, and interpreted.  Like any other film, the final interpretation lays on the viewer.  However many directors are often biased and leave little room for personal interpratation making their own.  Burton, on the contrary, leaves a universe for multiple interpretations.  One can wonder how he managed with such a solid plot. Nonetheless, he succeeded.<br/><br/>The beauty of the profound subject, the imaging, the style, and the meaning and purpose of Big Fish, makes it a film to be remembered by many generations to follow.  Tim Burton has delivered a masterpiece like never before: a landmark in US filmaking.<br/><br/>10/10 - Big ups for Big Fish"
"Ronin47","7","0","0","8 January 2004"," Somewhat disappointing but still very good (***)
","Tim Burton's thankful return to making films in his own style after the dull, ordinary ""Planet Of The Apes"" remake in 2001, ""Big Fish"" isn't quite the fantasy masterpiece I wanted it to be, but is quite good anyway.<br/><br/>
Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is what you would call a storyteller. All his life he has dazzled everyone around him with tall tales about his own life at the drop of a hat, and they are always the right story for the situation. According to him, he has worked in a circus, traveled with a giant, braved a haunted forest, met a witch with a mystical glass eye, found an Eden-like town in the middle of a forest where everyone is always happy, and much, much more. Now, though, he is old, with cancer, and about to die.<br/><br/>
His son, William (Billy Crudup), was once just as dazzled as everyone else at his stories, but over time grew tired of his father constantly hogging the spotlight with his silly stories and hasn't spoken to him in years. He leaves with his wife from his home in Paris to return home and try to reconcile with his father. <br/><br/>The elder Bloom has always maintained that every word of his tall tales are absolutely true, that he really did do all those things, but William finally wants to hear the truth about his life. Edward, though, is still resolute that all those stories are true, and as we see those stories for ourselves (with a fresh-faced Ewan MacGregor as the young Edward), we begin to wonder (hope, actually) that some of it might be true. <br/><br/>If ever there was a story that was perfect for Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"") to tell, this story, about the power of imagination, is it. However, something about it just didn't come together for me. Some of the stories just didn't engage me very much and at times the Burton-esque oddness seems a little forced.<br/><br/>
But there are tons of good qualities, not the least of which are good performances by Finney, MacGregor, Crudup, Jessica Lange (as the elder Bloom's wife and William's mother), and Steve Buscemi (as a traveling poet). And I freely admit to crying my eyes out in the last 15 minutes, when the entire film comes together beautifully. Suddenly, right then, I felt the Tim Burton whose style I fell in love with in ""Edward Scissorhands"" back when I was 12, and that, more than anything, made it worth seeing."

Not while watching this movie though. The movie is narrated in small chunks; showing the main character reliving the many stories of his father. Each subplot is enjoyable on its own, while only very slowly moving the main story arc forward. The different settings and the impressive visuals (no fancy ""special effects"") merge into a wonderful world of fantasy, and the ending is both unexpected and consequent.

People wearing pinstripes (which were seen occasionally), dark camera angles and frames...all of that which you should expect when you walk into a movie with the name ""Tim Burton"" plastered on the poster. Watching the movie, I got none of that. It didn't have the distinct markings of a Tim Burton movie, and I  could have plastered any director's name on it.

"jdesando","Null","0","0","7 January 2004"," You may be ready to understand your parents better than you thought possible.
","A fable about a fabulist told by a fabled director.  Tim Burton's `Big Fish' is an imaginative rendering of children's universal longing to know their parents fully before the final separation.   Equally as important to anyone who tells stories, like creative parents, writers, and directors, is the film's depiction of the complex relationship between the storyteller and the audience. Burton carries both themes in his characteristically flamboyant (`Edward Scissorhands,' `Batman') style that includes fairytales and outright magic realism. `The Wizard of Oz,' `Fisher King,' and `Princess Bride' come immediately to mind of other American films that have succeeded in a genre perfected by Latin artists.<br/><br/>Storyteller Edward (Albert Finney) is on his deathbed.  His son, Will (Billy Crudup), who long ago discarded his dad's fabulous stories and his dad, now tries to understand who his dad is underneath those lies by questioning dad and searching family history for clues.  The magical scenes of dad's meeting a giant and tree monsters in a forest, and conjoined singers at a Red Army talent show, experiencing an unreal but perfect town called Specter, and getting involved with a bizarre circus are successfully rendered by a director whose dark but lyrical side is well documented (`Nightmare Before Christmas, ` `Sleepy Hollow'). The question about the truth of the stories becomes academic because son must meet dad on his fabulous terms or forever hold his peace.<br/><br/>As Ewan McGregor (the young Edward) did in `Moulin Rouge,' he can walk between innocence and experience as well as any actor today.  Albert Finney's Southern accent from his British mouth is flawless, just like his uncompromising take on a father whose tall tales demand respect for the wisdom they offer and the truth that may lurk underneath them. On the level that requires a dÃ©tente between father and son, Burton marvelously takes no sides: When father asks son who he wants him to be, the melancholic truths that father may have hidden behind his stories all his life are balanced by the need for a son to accept a father on his terms, not the son's.<br/><br/>Burton is far less clear on the matter of the storyteller's relationship to the audience.  It seems that if the listener suspends disbelief, the story will enrich the present and future with meanings heretofore hidden by the dull demands of the quotidian. A story about an elusive `big fish' becomes more than a child's fish tale; it reveals truths about ambition and cunning and generosity, with a subtle comment on the sanctity of marriage (a marriage ring is prominent, not far from the figurative subtext of  `Lord of the Rings').<br/><br/>Even Burton's choice of actors underscores the conjunction of real and unreal: the actors in the different eras of the family's life look remarkably like their young or old characters, an uncanny touch to test our skepticism about all the tales. What's real and what is not matters little when you confront a parent you have never understood or a story you are struggling to tell.  Homer's Odysseus travels to the world of giants and sea creatures as well in what turns out to be a journey into understanding himself as adventurer, storyteller, and husband.  Burton is brilliant, maybe not Homer, but for the 21st century, he is the pre-eminently fabulous storyteller.  The film's weakness of never letting us know why dad tells these endless stories can be borne only if you enjoy the tale and the journey; you may then be ready to understand your parents better than you thought possible.<br/><br/>As Will puts it,  ""In telling the story of my father's life, it's impossible to separate fact from fiction, the man from the myth."" We all could say the same."

","I haven't read Daniel Wallace's novel yet, but the film reminded me of a fairy tale -- albeit much abbreviated -- version of Thomas Wolfe's ""Look Homeward Angel"" in that you're not moved so much by huge plot points or revelations, but by the beauty of the somewhat ordinary yet strangely huge stories Finney's character spun.  I suppose I was also moved by the father-son relationship since I've been estranged from my own father for some time.  On top of that I saw this a few days before Xmas, which is a very emotional time of year for me (not a fan of the holidays with all its commercialism and my emotions seem more intense then for some reason).<br/><br/>On its own, the film is technically well made and wonderfully easy to watch -- there are the surrealistic touches you expect from a Tim Burton movie, but they're not over-the-top or accentuated like in his past movies, and I think that's why some rank BIG FISH lower in comparison to his other films. Fair enough.<br/><br/>But in comparison to all the other films I've seen this year (I go to the movies at least two times a month), this was the one rare time in 2003 where I felt like I was ""IN"" the movie, not staring at my watch -- and the ending just blew me away -- it's very simple yet captivating.

Also, I thought the special effect of the ""Siamese"" Chinese twins was poorly done and looked fake, not to mention in poor taste, considering the sexual nature of the song they were singing.  Back to the confusion thing, I'm thinking it was Vietnam, because if it was Korea, what happened to him in the 15 or 20 years between the two wars?  Continuity-wise, this is a big problem for the movie.<br/><br/>Another problem is that it was adapted from a book.  Burton probably wanted more of the fantasy than reality, so cut out some of the reality stuff that would have made the real (i.e. not tall tale) scenes work better.  Someday I'll have to read the book to see if it works better than the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I think this movie comes down to what you value more: the truth or pleasant stories.  I value the truth more, so I was disappointed in this movie.  I think people who are heavily religious will love this movie (since what is religion but tall tales that people choose to believe are literally true?), and also die-hard Burton fans.  I am a fan of Tim Burton, but I guess not a die-hard one.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, the character I liked the most was Billy Crudup's pregnant wife.  She was sweet and charmed by his stories, even though she didn't believe they were true.  I wish I could have been charmed by this movie, but it didn't quite cut it for me.  About a 6 or 7 of 10."

","I was gladdened to read the many positive reviews of this movie on imdb. Based on the reviews, I was expecting a disappointing Tim Burton effort which gets bogged down in the Billy Crudup/Albert Finney sequences.<br/><br/>But this was one of my favorite films of the year.  It's absolutely magical and very, very touching.  I have a feeling that it will be reevaluated at a later date--possibly as soon as the video release--as an underappreciated masterpiece.<br/><br/>Albert Finney deserves an Academy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actor. He is so devilish and charming, and very funny.   I'd also got the impression from reviews that Jessica Lange is underutilized by Burton but, in fact, she has a large, featured role in which she doesn't put a foot wrong.  If anything, she's underutilized by filmmakers in general in that she doesn't appear in many movies these days, sad to say. She's a wonderful actress and the relationship between her and Albert Finney's character is very moving.<br/><br/>I loved this film and highly recommend it.  Sometimes I wonder i the so-called ""serious"" reviewers don't just base their reviews on other writers' opinions.  They got it very wrong this time."

","""Big Fish"" seems to be a departure from Tim Burton's usual fantasy fare.  Of course, there are fantasy elements especially in the flashback sequences that illustrate the tall tales told by Ed Bloom (Albert Finney playing the old Ed and Ewan McGregor portraying the young Ed Bloom), but the story deals more with how one views life and not telling bold face lies to bolster one's image.  The latter is the thinking of Ed's estranged son (Billy Crudup) who returns after 3 years to reconcile with his ailing father and find out who the real Ed Bloom is but finds himself hearing more ""exaggerated"" tales. The film is sad but at the same time life affirming.  The son finds it difficult to understand his Dad's view of life until speaking with some of those whose lives had been touched by the man.     The fantasy sequences are well done and the acting is superb.  Ewan McGregor plays a likeable younger version of Ed Bloom and Alison Lohman is easily believable as a youthful version of a still youthful Jessica Lange as Ed's wife.  The movie plays out as a fairy tale but also deals with the strained father/son relationship and the realization that one's perspective on life can make it interesting rather than mundane. Nice departure for Tim Burton and fine performances by the whole cast."

Will can't stand his father's stories, I mean, they are just fairytales, none of the stories that his dad has been telling him his whole life really happened, right? Will and his father stop communicating for a few years but when Edward starts growing older and weaker and closer to his dying day, Will and his pregnant wife Josephine(Marion Cotillard) come to visit and the story of Edward Bloom is told. The story is mostly narrated by Will without knowing if his father's stories are true or if they are all just a big lie and part of the story is narrated by Edward himself. The tale starts of with a young Edward Bloom(Ewan McGregor) and his many adventures starting from when he was a little boy and meeting the old witch(Helena Bonham Carter) that lives by the swamp with the glass eye, to meeting Karl the Giant(Matthew McGrory) and leaving town with him, to joining the circus and finally finding the love of his life, his wife Sandra(Alison Lohman). While Edward's life might often sound unbelievable, Will believes there might be some truth to it and he is bound to really find out the story of his father's life and love him for what he was and always will be: A big adventurous fish with an imagination bigger then life itself.

"MovieManMenzel","8","0","0","27 December 2003"," A visual stunning, well directed, and well made film by no one other than the man himself Tim Burton
","Big Fish was a movie that I was looking forward too all year. I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. His work is always brilliant and completely original. I own all of his movies and three of his movies; the Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, and Sleepy Hollow are my all time favorite movies. So when Big Fish finally arrived in Voorhees, NJ yesterday I made it my top priority to rush out and see it at the earliest convenience. So today I headed all the way to Voorhees to see Big Fish.<br/><br/>Big Fish is the tenth feature film Tim Burton directed. It is without a doubt an original film with a lot of imagination. The film is about a man named Edward Bloom played by both Ewan McGregor & Albert Finney. Ewan McGregor played Edward Bloom when he was young and Albert Finney played Edward as an Adult. Edward Bloom was always a man who told stories about his life, which were all, mixed with Tall Tales. He never wanted to tell a boring story so he told the truth within the fiction. The movie tells the story of Edward Bloom and you the viewer have to decide which part of the story is real and which is imaginary. Big Fish is a very interesting experience and has a lot of elements I noticed from previous Tim Burton films. <br/><br/>The film's acting was of coarse top notch like all of Burton's previous films. The acting is never poor. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both do a great job as Edward Bloom by living out this extraordinary life they were given. The supporting cast including Steve Buscemi as Norther Winslow, Billy Crudup as Edward's Son William, Jessica Lange as the older wife of Edward Bloom, the beautiful Alison Lohman as the younger wife of Edward Bloom, and Helena Bonham Carter as Jenny the witch all did a great job although most of the people mentioned were not in the film for more than 15 to 25 minutes.<br/><br/>
As Tim Burton, well his imagination soared throughout this film. The film was very creative and I enjoyed seeing all these unique characters. But I think this is also where the fault lies. There are to many characters. I couldn't keep up with them all, because were so many. It was an over abundance of characters. The camera angles in this film as always were superb and the creative sets were outstanding. I really liked how this Edward Bloom's mind was so filled of this imaginary world.  Another disappointment I had with the film was this, it was very upbeat and not dark like all of Burton's previous films. I am used to the darker Burton and like him a bit more. I do understand why he did make a more upbeat film because he wanted to gain more audiences because the darker films are aimed towards a smaller-target audience. <br/><br/>The writer John August did a great job on this script especially since this man was the one who wrote the horrible Charlie's Angels 1 & 2 and Titan A.E. You see what a good script can do with the help of a great director. It can make a film that will be nominated for Golden Globe Awards and Academy Awards. Keep writing John August and leave those bad films behind you because you have a creative mind and you sure proved that with Big Fish.<br/><br/>So In Conclusion, I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. I worship the man. I own all his films and collect his merchandise. I can only wish one day I can make a film 1/10 as great as this man if I ever fulfill my dream as becoming a director. Now its time for the questions: Did I like Big Fish? Absolutely! Was I disappointed a bit with the film? Yes I thought many of his previous films including Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas were a lot better and displayed more of Tim Burton's unique mind. I will be seeing Big Fish again because I think it will be better with repeated viewings since at first I had such high hopes for it and now its out of my system. Although I don't think this film is Tim Burton's best film to date, it is still an excellent film, which should target many more people than the usual Burton followers like me. Keep up the great movies Mr. Burton you will one day be one of the biggest & best directors of all time. You are already the best director to me. My final rating for Big Fish is an 8.5/10."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Macabre director-extraordinare Tim Burton delivers his most mainstream, warm-hearted film to date.  Based on the Daniel Wallace novel, ""Big Fish"" is a wonderful double-edged story of the tall tales told by Albert Finney/Ewan McGregor and his relationship with his son played by Billy Crudup (""Almost Famous"").  The film features a tremendous cast including Jessica Lange/Alison Lohman as the wife of Finney/McGregor, Burton's real life wife, Helena Bonham Carter (also in a dual role), Danny DeVito, (an overacting) Steve Buscemi and Loudon Wainwright III (of ""Dead Skunk"" fame).  I do not wish to give anything away but the story is a mixture of ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Forrest Gump"" and ""The Princess Bride"".  Burton's remarkable direction, mostly top notch acting, and an extremely entertaining story make this a ""must see"" for film goers ages 13 and up.  Younger kids would probably have a difficult time keeping up with the pace of the story.  I keep patiently waiting for Billy Crudup to become the star he should be.  Why must we be inundated with Ben Affleck films when Crudup is much more talented?  Also, Alison Lohman continues to put together an impressive resume, building upon her success in ""Matchstick Men"" and ""White Oleander"".  It is a pleasure to watch her development as an actress."

","Big Fish really has been one of the best movies I have seen this year.  The story is simple, so anyone who cannot put a cap on the constant search to watch something absolutely original should probably avoid Big Fish.  <br/><br/>However while the story is simple the way it is told is original in its own right.  Fairytale like touches through out a variety of embellished life stories bring an enchanting feeling to the entire movie.  Admittedly slower paced, I do not feel that Big Fish is so void of substance that its unbearable, but rather the pacing allows us as an audience to become completely engaged with the movie. I did not notice any poor performances from the fantastic cast.  Reviews in which people have picked out time line flaws and swaying accents only prove that they walked into this movie to find flaws and not to enjoy themselves.  <br/><br/>Big Fish is a love story in part but mostly a life story at heart.  If you cannot appreciate what simple story elements Tim Burton has successfully brought to life, then you quite simply have not lived life enough to find beauty in Big Fish."

Ewan McGregor is awesome as the younger Bloom. The scene in the hospital room is a marvel.

","Lets clear one thing up before I start. I am a big fan of The lord of the Rings movies, the books, etc. I saw the first two multiple times and plan to see the third many more times to come(I saw it opening night). Return of the King was a masterful work of art but I cant help thinking I would have enjoyed it more it I had not seen Big Fish the night before.<br/><br/>
The story begins with Edward Bloom(played masterfully by both Albert Finny and Ewan McGregor) telling a story at his son Will's wedding, of how he caught the biggest fish going the day of Will's birth. Edward loves to tell stories of his life, all seem to be too amazing to be true. Everyone seems to enjoy them, except his son . Both have not spoken three years since his wedding night so when Will finds out his father is dying, he sets out to learn the truth about his father. The film is told in series of flashbacks as we learn of young Edwards extraordinary achievements, as well as his failures. He meets all kinds of colorful people, from a friendly giant to a witch with a special power to the love of his life. <br/><br/>The film has spectacular acting all around. Both Finny and McGregor give the performances of a lifetime. Both Oscar worthy. The supporting cast including but not exclusive to Danny Devito, Alison Lohman, Jessica Lange and Billy Crudup all do their best to show off, and do a good job of it. Two scenes that particularly stood out were the bathtub scene and the one where we find out just what Edward saw the day he met the witch. <br/><br/>This is without a doubt, Tim Burtons best film to date. The film can make you laugh and make you cry in a heartbeat. The chemestry between the characters feels so real, you would swear it was not a movie.<br/><br/>
I usually must wait a few months or a year and view a movie multiple times to really say that a movie is one of my absolute favorate films. With Big Fish, I have never in my life, as a child or as an adult been so blown away by a film before. As I said, I am a HUGE 'Rings fan and the feeling I got seeing all three of them combined, could not compare to the awe I felt seeing Big Fish. It is simply the best movie I have seen this year(close by The Magdalene Sisters, Lost in Translation, Kill Bill, Mystic River, Return of the King and Matchstick Men, okay so I see lots of movies) and in a years time, I may say its the best movie I have ever seen. Well maybe not THE best but a favorate. <br/><br/>10/10- Go see this film as many times as you possibly can."

","BusterLA speaks for me. I like happy films & happy endings but they have to be grounded in characters you care about, and none of the characters in this movie are interesting, attractive or even make sense. The ensemble actors cope very well with their caricatures, lending weight to what otherwise would be a flimsy movie. Still, you need a writer and an actor and a cameraman, and the writer is missing. (Spoiler) Like the son, we are led from an initial suspension of disbelief to skepticism based on impossible and unlikely aspects of the father's stories. While the<br/><br/>impossibilities are never removed, some of the unlikely aspects are later presented as true. So what? These never speak to the issue of the father's character, and so the son's (and our solicited) conversion to trust and love of the father is unpersuasive. No crisis, no resolution, no catharsis."

Or is reality the memories that the history lives in? Ultimately, what is real?<br/><br/>This film was incredibly touching, because anyone can relate to Will Bloom's resentment towards his father, involving unfulfilled expectations and disappointment. But the power in the message of this film is that by forgiving, we empower ourselves to heal emotional wounds and get past our own pain and hurt, as well the power of forgiveness bringing a gift of healing to those we have carried the grudge against.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has ""grown up"" with this film. He does not resort to sappy sentiment nor over the top emotion, but instead provides a tangible undercurrent of longing, love and desire to feel closest to the people that have influenced us the most.<br/><br/>Ed Bloom is not a likable character, in fact he comes off as arrogant and aloof. And yet he is likeable, because there are good qualities in him that his wife and his daughter-in-law are able to find by looking past his faults. It made me think about all the times we get so caught up into looking for the faults in others, rather than looking for the good. Through his stories, Edward is revealed to have ambition, loyalty, conviction, and dedication to the people that make up his life.<br/><br/>Helena Bonham Carter is brilliant as Jenny. She's done so much with a character that is barely drawn. And Alison Lohman continues to prove that she is the next big star coming up, and her likeness to a young Jessica Lange is uncanny.<br/><br/>Go see this film, but go with an open mind. Ask yourself when images do not make sense, what are they symbols for? What else could they mean?<br/><br/>By letting go and using your imagination, this movie is powerful and poignant.

"gcrokus","7","0","0","14 January 2004"," Exaggerated, But How Could It Not Be?
","In the movie ""Big Fish"" we are asked to follow the life of a weaver of tall tales as described by same.  What might we expect? Raised by a man larger than life (Albert Finney as the father), Billy Cruddup (as the son)has tired of his father's larger-than-life image, an image cultivated through a lifetime of storytelling.  So many lies and half-truths and distortions that the son cannot perceive where the truth begins and the disinformation ends.  And so the two are at odds even though the father is probably on his death bed. Director Tim Burton's fantastically exaggerated view of the father's early life is probably about right.  To put it another way, how would a liar describe his own life?  Well, certainly not any matter-of-fact recounting would be expected. There are enough diversions strewn in the film's path it elevate it to higher than average level.  There are delightful moments punctuated by highjinks that almost elicit a groan of disbelief.  Some effects look very good, the actual visual sensations illustrate very high production values - and we would expect that from Burton - yet there enough mild surprises to entertain.  And enough about the relationship(s) explored to stir the cerebral in us. But what of the father?  What is he really all about, what really happened and why should we care?  And do we resolve this father/son dispute? Imagine a lens that magnifies a person-sized object about 1.2 times.  That is what a character like that portrayed by Albert Finney appears like to a boy.

","I have seen several Tim Burton films (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare before Christmas). I must admit that my opinion of him was primarily shaped by the look and feel of Batman, which I found far too dark and, above all, cluttered. I was thus delighted by Big Fish, which I found light, airy and sunny by comparison.<br/><br/>The two people I saw the film with were less than enthused. Both felt that running time was too long at almost two and a half hours. One thought the film's flights of fancy were a little too fanciful for his tastes. But I felt the length (and pace) were exactly right for the story Big Fish has to tell, and ditto for its fancifulness. If you're going to tell a tale, as Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor) does, you might as well make it as tall as Paul Bunyan and as big as Babe the blue ox. If Edward Bloom's tales were shorter and more down to earth, they would be nothing more than a traveling salesman's jokes -- and his character would correspondingly be reduced in size and stature to that of a mere mortal, not a man among men.<br/><br/>The casting of the film is phenomenal -- by this, I mean the physical resemblance between the actors and actresses who play Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor) and his wife Sandra Templeton (Jessica Lange/Alison Loman). Finney is endlessly fascinating as the raconteur and should be remembered at Oscar time. MacGregor is charming as always as the younger Bloom. Jessica Lange says remarkably little, but conveys in nonverbal ways Sandra's loving indulgence of her husband's big fish stories.<br/><br/>I defy anyone to see this film and leave the theatre dry-eyed. The final sequences certainly left me with a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat. And that is because the film made me care about its hero as a real human being, however unreal his version of himself may be. More than that -- the film taught me a valuable lesson for my own life, one I was much in need of being taught again: that we must accept people on their own terms, for who they are and aspire to be -- not who we would like them to be. And how often can you say of a Hollywood film that it has had an impact on your life?"

","I have always been a fan of Tim Burton's films.  From ""Batman"" to ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"" to ""Sleepy Hollow"", his films have been some of the most whimsical and stylish I've seen created.  And ""Big Fish"" retains those elements.  But this film has so much more of a ""grown up"" feel to it, yet it retains those child-like moments of wonder Burton is known for.<br/><br/>At it's heart, ""Big Fish"" is a love story.  It's the story of a man trying to reconcile with and get to know his father.  But it's also a story of a man's single love and devotion to his wife.  But it's also a love of life. A love of stories.  And the belief that nothing is impossible to attain if it's really wanted strongly enough.<br/><br/>Edward Bloom (played by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney - both excellent) tells the tale of his life's story, a tale that walks the fine line between truth and fiction.  Every obstacle and challenge is met with McGregor's grin and the belief that any obstacle can be overcome, often with humorous or surprising results.  This is a very light-hearted film, taking even its most serious moments with a grain of charm, sentiment or playfulness.  It gets emotional, but never delves into sap.  And you can't help but cheer for this likable character who ends up touching so many lives.  The world he grew up in may or may not be real, but the devotion and love for his wife and son are truth.<br/><br/>While different in overall tone from his other films, Burton still adds his own trademark touches.  Cast usuals like Danny Devito and Helena Bonham Carter add to the diverse cast in this film, and Danny Elfman provides another excellent score.  The acting from all the cast members were really well-done, whether they were cameos, or full roles.  Burton has always chosen an eclectic cast for his films, and this film is no different. Everyone, even at the most basic level, shines.<br/><br/>There are so many words to describe this film: Funny, touching, eccentric, uplifting, sad, artistic, inspiring.... but this is the type of film that can be walked away from with a sense of satisfaction.  Burton attempted something very different for him, and yet managed to retain all of the elements that make his films so appealing.  I think this film will force critics to view his films in a new light, as he has once again proven to be a more than capable director.  It's a remarkable work of art, utterly charming, and very highly recommended.<br/><br/>One of the best pictures of 2003."

","One word: ""cute"". The movie is cute, the characters are cute, the moral is cute... damn, mr. burton, you went soft!<br/><br/>Visually the movie is strong, and i think it was well done all around, but as the third act started i was wondering where all this was going. While it did start to loss me, the ending grabbed me and got me back. It wrapped it all up very nicely and drove the message home in a pretty powerful way.<br/><br/>With that said, and while there were several enjoyable ""burton"" moments, i just felt like i was watching a ""nice, cute"" kids movie. Why did they bother with the pg-13 rating? Cut 3 swear words out and about 5 seconds of film, and this thing is PG and more directed at its target audience. I really am a fan of Mr. Burton's work, but i think ""beetle juice"" was edgier. And i read that someone thought the movie was violent? Did i miss something?<br/><br/>Its nice, its sweet, its sentimental and gets a few laughs; but i have to say that i expected more. My vote: less cute, more burton."

","Fact and fiction are beautifully blurred as a son tries to reconcile the past of his dying father. Growing up with his father, Edward Bloom's elaborate story telling, his son, Will, is tired of the fantasy and yearning for the truth. One by one, the so-called tall tales of Edward's life come to life in a dazzling and often strange portrait created by the amazingly imaginative director, Tim Burton. Will tries to uncover the facts behind the myths, and in the process discovers that perhaps the similarities between the facts and myths are what is important, not necessarily the differences.<br/><br/>
While aesthetically pleasing and emotionally touching (as well as surprisingly funny), Burton does not compromise originality or honesty. I applaud Burton for his invigorating insight into the human spirit and for his stimulating, novel depiction of age-old subject matter. From ""Fish's"" specific ideas of the power of legend and immortality to its broader ideas of human relationships and understanding, it is a masterful accomplishment with alluring mystique!<br/><br/>And with awe-striking cinematography, flawless effects, an absolutely spectacular cast (which I'm sorry to say, I have not stressed enough), and one of my favorite composers (Danny Elfman - who has teamed up with Burton before) -- this ""Fish"" was certainly not destined to sink.<br/><br/>
There are a few qualms. Although I adored Elfman's score, I thought the music could have backed off a little, and perhaps some of the events (script wise) could have actually been done with a tad bit more originality and congruency.<br/><br/>Though seemingly unusual, even the unaware audience members will find themselves relating to ""Big Fish.""<br/><br/>Do not dwell upon how reality is different than fiction; on the contrary celebrate how fiction is a reflection of reality. I don't think anybody could have said it better than Picasso: ""Everything you can imagine is real."""

","If you have a father that is the spitting image of Albert Finney, your father is ailing and your father is often bedridden drymouthed, with ashy skin and the skin pulled down to the pillow, you won't leave dry eyed.  My father is ailing and has the same facial sag and hair as Albert Finney.  I was teary eyed at Finney's first introduction.<br/><br/>This is a fun serious Tim Burton film.   It's different for him, and in some ways is uneven in it's presentation.  I sometimes felt he was singing the delta blues when he usually sings pop music, if you get my mixed media metaphor.  Some of the riffs might feel a little plastic, but overall it's a satisfying film.  There are varying degrees of acting talent, but nothing I didn't forgive by the end.  Ironically for a Tim Burton film, I felt some of his more surreal story scenes weren't as strong as the more real parts. The circus scene when he meets his wife is a gorgeous work.  It all works in the end though, and does so quite well.<br/><br/>The archstone of talent in this movie is Albert Finney.  Without him, everything else would be just Tim Burton design and a somewhat clunky film. I'm no Finney afficionado, so I can't compare this performance with others, but he really got me.  I couldn't look at the screen sometimes when he was bedridden, it was just a little too personal.  I don't like to even think about it.  As the senior Ed Bloom, or should I say the real Ed Bloom, he draws all the other characters, even his younger self, together.  I know that is an obvious statement, but it is an important feat in a movie that tries to reconcile fragments with the whole.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an objective view on Big Fish, I can't give it. It's a personal film, and I've only seen it once.  I'm never a good judge of movies after only one viewing.  But I am going to have to wait until DVD so I can get all verklempt in the privacy of my own home. I do recommend seeing it.  A legit tear jerker that had people sniffling all around me."

"rosscinema","7","0","0","12 January 2004"," Even with the sentimentality this film works
","This film is about a man dying but its not what I would call a sad picture, but one that celebrates life's adventures and unique characters. Albert Finney plays Ed Bloom who is bed ridden and only has days left but this still doesn't stop him from telling his infamous stories about his exploits as a younger man. Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) loves to hear them but their son Will (Billy Crudup) is sick of them and thinks that his father uses these stories to hide his real life. As Will stays with his family he starts to discover clues that tie in to some of the tales he has heard. The stories are about Ed (Ewan McGregor) leaving his small town of Ashton to do good for others and along the way he meets a giant and convinces him to go on to bigger things. Ed takes a detour and runs into a small town called Spectre which appears to be like heaven with all the residents being very friendly and pretty young barefoot ladies prancing about and they want him to stay but he says no. Then he takes the giant to a circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito) and while there he sees the love of his life Sandra (Alison Lohman). He works for Amos to find out more about her and eventually finds out what college she attends and goes to see her.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>They both profess they're love for each other but its cut short when Ed receives his draft notice and while in the war he parachutes right into a Red Chinese stage show where he meets Siamese twins that share two legs.<br/><br/>
Will had never gotten along very well with his father but the more he listens to him during his last few days the more he understands how important these stories are. Will also figures out that there is a lot of truth behind many of them and this seems to bring them closer as the end nears.<br/><br/>This film is directed by the incredibly imaginative Tim Burton who has made an impact by telling his own versions of wild stories and his special talent as a director is evident in the flashback scenes with McGregor. This may sound cliche but this is a very magical film filled with an abundant of rich and weird characters and this is the type of storytelling that Burton excels in. He has always brought his viewers to places that we have never seen before and unique characters that we have never met. Some parts of this film reminded me of ""Edward Scissorhands"" but it also reminded me of another film that Burton had nothing to do with, ""The Princess Bride"". The casting is interesting as McGregor looks very much like Finney during the early 60's although Lohman doesn't have much resemblance to Lange. This film does get a tad overly sentimental but this is not a sad film and it does a good job of showing how special Ed's life was. Its not exactly thought provoking stuff but I allowed myself to go with it and I enjoyed myself for the whole ride. Burton usually doesn't allow his scripts to get this soft but its a film full of indelible images and characters that are not easily forgotten."

","I just saw ""Big Fish"" at an early screening last night, and I must say I walked away amazed.<br/><br/>To be honest, I am a big fan of Ewan McGregor's work; I think he is an excellent actor, and I mainly went to see his performance.  I saw by looking around at all the Edward Scissorhands t-shirts and Jack the Pumpkin King ski caps that I was surrounded by mainly Burton fans.  No matter; I knew I was going to enjoy this film from what I had heard about it, even if it wasn't completely up to par.<br/><br/>However, the film turned out to be fantastic in all ways; you'd really have to press me to find a single flaw.  The characters were rich, and perfectly cast (I don't even really like Alison Lohman, but she was THE young Jessica Lange).  I really liked how consistent each character was, as far as McGregor being dead-on as a young Albert Finney, and Finney hitting the mark as an old McGregor.<br/><br/>The film was crazily well-written; it was comedic, dramatic, far-fetched, light-hearted, and touching all at once.  But what is amazing is that this was all accomplished without being too cheesy, too sickly-sweet, and too unbelievable. What's more, the way the story was told was very interesting; there was seemless transitioning from the past to present, with parts being told from different points of view.  Also, each principle character had about the same screen time, which I really liked.  The script, direction, and acting were so fresh that I never had a dull moment--the film was always interesting, never boring or lackluster.  I didn't look at my watch once.<br/><br/>Tim Burton really surprised me with this one. Of course, I have thoroughly enjoyed a few of his films from the past, but I wasn't sure what to expect from this one.  It is by far the most mature film of his to date.  I appreciated that it wasn't too ""Burton-ny""--but that's not to say that you cannot see him in this work.  It is a true Burton film, down to the last detail, but it's not so out-there that only real Burton fans can enjoy it or understand it.  His directing is superb and focused, and I cannot imagine another at the helm of ""Big Fish"".<br/><br/>I can guarantee you will not be disappointed in the acting. Finney is more than convincing as the stubborn, old, and colorful story-teller; Crudup IS the skeptical, annoyed son who really doesn't ""get"" his dad, and who has accepted the fate of never really knowing Edward Bloom; Lohman is the fresh-faced, youthful beauty--the only one who will ever really give Bloom the chance he deserves, no strings attached; Lange gracefully plays the aged wife, the one and only who understands Bloom, who lets him get away with his stories--he is not only devoted to her, but she to him, and you can tell how lucky she feels to have such a loyal companion who loves her unconditionally.  But it is McGregor who really shines; he carries the movie and is flawless as the lovestruck, ambitious, curious, scheming underdog. His expressions convey every emotion perfectly, and his is a very honest performance, not matter how far-fetched the story.  But every performance, from the children to Helena Bonham Carter, is so truthful, and this is what really makes the story work.<br/><br/>I think the ending was one of the best and least contrived ones I've ever seen in a movie.  So, if you're curious, I urge you to see the movie.  I really think it's for everyone, young and old, men, women, and children. If you're not curious, you SHOULD be.  You really WILL laugh and cry, but mostly you'll be laughing.  And I promise the tears are from sheer joy, not sadness.  It would be a shame to miss out on this one just because you're not sure of it.  Just so you know, my dad's a manly man who hates crappy movies, and I sure as hell am going to take him to this."

The story is crap. It's not AS bad as some of the most recent failures from Tim Burton such as Planet of the Apes and Sleepy Hollow, but that doesn't make it worth watching. It's just boring.<br/><br/>The beef of this film is in the retelling of tall tales, none of which got more than a chuckle and a shrug from myself and the two friends I saw the movie with. It just doesn't grasp what it's reaching for. The magic is not there. It's also draaaaaaaaaaaawn out, and aimless.<br/><br/>The main character, Edward Bloom, is an ordinary guy who tells hugely exaggerated stories of adventures that may or may not have happened to him. And the main point is that everyone, except his son, loves Edward Bloom and wants to be around him. The problem with this is that the character is NOT loveable or even likeable. I found him mostly annoying, in fact.<br/><br/>I love some of Tim Burton's earlier movies like Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Beetlejuice. I don't know what happened to him. Why can't he make good movies anymore? I hope he doesn't ruin his upcoming project, the remake of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."

","'Tim Burton is back,' I thought, already when I saw the Big Fish trailer. He's returned from the smelly and louse-ridden Planet Of The Apes. Sell out your talent in such a manner - the shame! Again, I glimpsed hope of soaking up the imagery only his brain could present on a good day and inhaled deeply as I sat down to witness...  a minor masterpiece.<br/><br/>William Bloom (Crudup) goes off to visit his terminally ill father, Edward (Finney), hoping to get to know him before it's too late. The father's colorful, unlikely stories about his youth collides with the son's views on 'real life,' and the film weaves these contrasts together and blurs boundaries between the two until the greater picture is revealed: There are more important things in life than truth.<br/><br/>Never before have I seen Tim Burton's imagination this well integrated in a story. Every piece of fairy tale has a ring of true drama and recognizable elements from life, and hits you straight in the heart. Big Fish is a grand film about fathers and sons, about generations and legacies, about growing up as a human being and about good stories.

","Wow.  A whole lot of fun on so many levels.<br/><br/>At its core, Big Fish is a series of tales told by Edward Bloom (Finney) that are throwbacks to a time when the ability to tell a tall tale carried some weight.  (Pecos Bill, Paul Bunyan, Uncle Remus, etc.)  The plot is exceedingly thin serving as a string to hang the tales on and nothing more. (Why the hell can't William Bloom/Crudup, get over it?!  Oh yeah, we need a payoff in the end.)  Still, this is a comedy/fantasy so don't look for Macbeth.  Besides, the actors in these tales don't need a greater purpose other than to astound and amuse.  And they do.  Terrific performances by all the principals but special credit to McGregor and Finney for diving into to the part of Edward Bloom and making him a real person.<br/><br/>I can't think of a better director to handle this material.  This is the gentle Tim Burton of Edward Scissorshands and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure in control here.  The dark Tim Burton of Planet of the Apes and Batman are nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>For movie lovers, Burton throws several references to other films for your delight.  Tip: The banjo player IS the same fellow who made the music famous 20 years ago.  Trust me, you will get this when you see it.<br/><br/>In this season of major releases with casts of (CGI) thousands, it is fun to see a film that uses the location as a character and special effects that don't rely on computers to make them magical."

Big Fish is so blatantly hyperbolic in its optimism, it has a sinister undercurrent, even as it sparkles before eyes fatigued by bloated studio monstrosities and too much arthouse pretension.<br/><br/>One esteemed writer for a powerful daily is unhappy that Albert Finney's/Ewan McGregor's compulsive storyteller may not really be such a nice man. Hello! Obviously, we're not sure about him, even as we're falling in love with the guy. The character is a descendant of Mark Twain's go-getting charmer in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court; he's too ruthlessly determined to be entirely trustworthy. And yet, like America itself, he knocks your socks off with his driving energy and star-spangled grin.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that Big Fish is beautifully designed and shot, and Burton, generous in a way that he's never been before, regales viewers with images they've never quite seen.

","There is something exhilarating about riding two trains and running 27 blocks down the street to see a movie.  Living 8 or so miles outside New York City has its perks for one of my new jobs.  Going to press screenings of yet to released blockbusters.  It's just to bad I'm at the mercy of the New Jersey Transit rail system.  With delayed trains and lots of snow covering the ground of course I had 10 minutes to get from Madison Square Garden to Union Square.  No small feat if you ask me.<br/><br/>But as I settled down in my chair at the Regal Union Square, and as I sipped on the sweet nectar of the drink called COKE, a film unfolded.  A film so good, it made my mad dash to the theater worth every minute and as I reminisce about the filmed triumph that is BIG FISH, I feel a sense of awe and wonder.  Tim Burton has created a film better than EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and a film that is worthy of Oscar.<br/><br/>William Bloom (Billy Crudup, Waking The Dead) is mad at his father Edward Bloom (Albert Finney,Erin Brockovich).  You see his dad loves to tell stories about his youth.  Except none of them seem true.  Stories of Giants named Karl (Matthew McGrory, Bubble Boy), Circus Freaks, wandering poets, Siamese Twins from Red China, bank robberies, a witch, and a really big fish.  William longs to meet the real man behind all the stories.  But when Edward is stricken with cancer, William comes face to face with the man, both the real one and the legend.<br/><br/>BIG FISH is the kind of movie where a new surprise is hiding around every corner.  From babies being spit across the hospital floor to a classic car being submerged underwater.  The frame is jammed with visions both colorful and humorous.  I especially liked the witch whose one eye could tell you how you would die.  What an eerie and yet oddly beautiful old woman she was.<br/><br/>
I also loved the tender moment that Edward and his wife Sandy (Jessica Lange, Titus) had in the bathtub.  It's a scene full of both raw emotion and sweet reflection.  Here's a woman who's watching the man she loves die right in front of her face.  Every moment counts, and every word and breath sacred.<br/><br/>Ewan MacGregor (Star Wars: Attack of the Cloans) does a fine job as young Edward the adventurous youth of all his older counterpoint fantastical stories.  His performance strikes the right cords at the right moments, allowing the audience to take hold of a man who may be the fabrication or the true version of a man who's telling the story.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's directing is top notch.  He's proven that he's a master of the visual image, and BIG FISH is the perfect film to allow people to sit up and take notice.  He strikes the right cord between humor and tears, joyous circus's and scary forests.  His deft eye even takes us behind enemy lines. In a scene that is both inspired and quirky all at the same time.<br/><br/>BIG FISH is also a film about heritage.  What's more important in the scheme of things, how we lived or how people remember us? It's a little of both, and this film puts us right in the middle of it all.  Watching a life unfold around us.<br/><br/>BIG FISH is the reason I love going to the movies.  Sure sometimes you have to dig through the trash to find a gem and this is a gem of a motion picture.  If you see one film at all this year BIG FISH is worth a trip, even a whirlwind 27-block sprint to your local theater."

There are lots of flashbacks that not only drive the viewers to the clues to the young Bloom's colorful life. The story's full of colorful characters that are a joy to watch. And don't dare tell me that the Bloom character couldn't be anyone living within our community. Believe me, they exist. those dear souls that are only too happy to tell their tales, over and over again because some one listening had, at one time or another, seemingly had with wide-eyed interest.<br/><br/>This film, directed by Tim Burton, and with its story adapted from Daniel Wallace's novel of the same, is AWESOME. The storytelling process is phenomenal, with every character marching in and out of scenes worthy of a study. Although the ideas stay close to the book, some of the feelings and traits of the film's characters are personal touches of the Director and the Producer, as the Q&A with Richard Zanuck discloses. The father-son relationship is soulfully developed in the story. The audience is lead on a journey, discovery, capturing who really is Edward Bloom and what had happened to the period of his absence from his family.  While the camera shots focus solidly on Ewan McGregor's and Albert Finney's Ed, they never rob me of my interest in the rest of the supporting cast and their characters. Every one and everything fits like well-fitted jigsaw puzzles needed to a fabulous and colorful masterpiece of quilt.  The cinematic effects are astoundingly beautiful. and I do mean aesthetically stunning! I was sucked into all kinds of emotions as I watched the characters interact, and actually, at oft times, feeling my eyebrows rising unexpectedly.<br/><br/>

It is sentimental, and it got me. I had non-stop tears streaming down my face for the last 20 minutes. A 15 hanky picture.<br/><br/>Danny DeVito blew my mind. This is his greatest role - but it's difficult to single out any one performance because every frame of this masterpiece is balls-out brilliant and the cast are incredible. Especially Helena Bonham Carter of course, and she parlays her multiple roles with inspired grace.<br/><br/>I am not sure how this film's gonna play in Peori. Expect the critics and pundits and awards-mongers to be in love, but will the great gross middle American proletariat get it? Tough call. The numbers will tell.<br/><br/>But it's amazing. One of the first movies in a long time I've wanted to double back to and see again."

","I was able to see a screening of the movie last night courtesy of a marketing firm out in Denver area. Other than the fact that it was the new Tim Burton movie, I didn't know much about this movie going into it. I remember seeing a spread for it in Vanity Fair a while back, but didn't connect the two. The spread I saw focused on a circus cast. This was NOT the entirety of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is about a man who, as a boy growing up, was told what seemed like tall tales of his father's life. He is haunted by the story of his father catching a fish on the day he was born, and it seems to overshadow every important event of this man's life. When the father becomes sick, William Bloom, played by Billy Crudup of 'Almost Famous' fame, heads home.<br/><br/>It is then when William Bloom tries to pry more into his father's life and find out how to separate fact from fiction. The stories that the Edward Bloom, younger version played by Ewan McGregor, tells are definitely a hard thing to believe, but the vision and artwork of this movie and the production crew make the scenes and ""stories"" absolutely beautiful. As you travel along with the younger Edward Bloom you begin to realize that he is indeed ""A big fish in a small pond."" Throughout the stories, and the uncovering of ""the truth"" William learns more about his father, and yet at the same time learns nothing new.<br/><br/>Overall, I LOVED this movie. I strongly suggest that you go see it. Billy Crudup played William excellently, and Ewan as the young Edward Bloom was captivating. Albert Finney, of Erin Brocovich and Traffic fame, plays the older version of Edward Bloom and you can't help but wish you had a grandpa like him. Some of the smaller roles were actually the biggest names in the movie. Steve Buscemi (known for his wacky character in Armageddon) was a small-town poet who goes missing, Danny Devito is the circus ringmaster, Jessica Lange plays Mrs. Bloom, and Helena Boham Carter plays a young girl who happens to be in the path of young Edward Bloom, and the lovable ""Giant"" is exactly that... you somehow imagine to see a bit of every friend you ever had in this giant, and possibly even a bit of yourself. The saddest note about it? Marion Cotillard, who plays William's wife, gets no credit for her role on imdb.com and yet she is just as important as the elder Mrs. Bloom.<br/><br/>The movie gets two enthusiastic thumbs up from me, and I would definitely love to own this movie. In my humble opinion, it is the BEST work from Tim Burton that I've seen, and definitely ranks with the best of the best from this year."
"kpbtm","9","0","0","28 November 2003"," Burton back to his best.
","Astonishingly original.<br/><br/>Messr's Wallace and August have provided Burton with a script full of warmth and just quirky enough for Burton to cut loose on. Assured direction, aided by fantastic production design from Dennis Gassner and some beautiful cinematography bring out the best of this story and its characters. At some points some characters are deliberately fantastical, the gloss serving to draw smiles ever more willingly from the enraptured audience.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the film is without its mischief. To my mind, one of Burtons's greatest and most defining traits is his ability to quite sharply and deliberately sidestep the proscribed path and follow it at a tangent. He was denied this opportunity by the conformist powers that be for Planet of the Apes, and the film suffered for it. This film contains some of the most delightful examples of said mischief yet, in particular the achingly funny resolution to Ewan Macgregor's confrontation with two martial arts masters in a tent. Tops the Raiders of the Lost Ark ""shoot the swordsman"" scene for sheer sight gag delight, and is especially biting in this age of wire-fu and CG super-brawls.<br/><br/>So people will insist on throwing hyperbole and comparisons upon this film. The hyperbole will largely be down to the relative lack of pre-release exposure for the film, and the comparisons to other films of fantasy and life stories can largely be ignored. This film is as original as any major studio release since Adaptation, and people's wish to pidgeonhole it or stand it up against films which are a mile away tonally, in content or execution might eventually be its downfall, which is a crushing shame, as it deserves so much more than that.<br/><br/>Burton's assurance on this film has resulted in his best of recent times, evoking memories of The Nightmare before Christmas and Edward Scissorhands, but ultimately Big Fish is far warmer than these, or indeed anything he has ever approached before. Let us hope that with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory he will continue to pick up where he left off in the early nineties."

Further into the movie a shot will bring back memories when you witness a ""landscaping company"" a block of small houses and green grass being cut, all framed to the center. The movie had a lot of Tim Burton flavor to say the least.<br/><br/>The cast was spectacular, Ewen McGreggor did a surprisingly great job though he certainly wasn't type-casted for the part.

","The name of the movie should have been Big Fish Stories, because it is about the fantastic and unbelievable stories of the life of Edward Bloom (Albert Finney).  Edward has been a storyteller his whole life, and he has told and retold these colorful stories to his son, Will (Billy Crudup) with embellishments.  The son doesn't know who his father really is, and he hasn't spoken to his father for years.  His mother (Jessica Lange) calls him in Paris that his father is dying.  Will, with his new wife, flies home to his father's deathbed to make things right.  Edward does the one thing he loves, and tells his tall-tales about a big cat-fish, a giant, a witch, conjoined-twins, the circus, how he met his wife, and the birth of Will. Will doesn't know when his father was telling the truth or crossing into fantasy, and in the end, Will becomes the storyteller.   The whole movie is Edward's stories, begun in truth and blended with fiction and fantasy, better, to Edward, than the ordinary lives we actually live.  Albert Finney was great as a storyteller, and if you look at this movie as a fairy tale, then it was heartwarming and enjoyable.  It wouldn't hurt if they cut 30 minutes.

I think I can pick out two movies from Burton's bag of tricks that surprised me, that I really like: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Edward Scissorhands. So, being a fair-weather fan of this cinematic veteran, I did my best to put on a happy face and give this movie a chance. I was, deep down, not expecting much. And that's exactly what I got. Not bad, but not good either. It was somewhere in the middle, but I'm rating it toward the lower end of the scale. Ewan, my sweet Ewan, what the heck was with that accent? I've seen some darn good souther accents in my short days as a critical movie viewer, and honey, you didn't cut the mustard. I don't mind Albert Finney, he does a pretty good job as a dying old guy with just a touch of senility. The costumes have their shining moments, and they storyline rises and falls throughout. All around, I didn't like this movie. But, if I was forced into a corner and told to watch this movie, I'd do it."

","There is a certain type of good musicians who want to compose, yet are able only of bunch of good overtures never a self-contained solid piece. The movie feels like being itself a product of this kind of creative mind. Moreover the idea is presented as stories of one character who is the crazy storyteller himself. It is a mixture of picturesque stories that built an ego of an old chap who happened to have an eager audience in his own family. This is how the film gains sentiment and integrity. I can't believe that this sentimental crap got 8 points. The start is very puzzling. First 15 minutes I had a tough time to orientate myself ..it looked just like a big challenge or a big hype....the latter it was. Credit goes to the form."

","Young man, estranged from his storytelling father for years, returns home to his father's death-bed and learns more tall tales, more legends, and how sometimes true stories are saved from the mundane by a dash of colorful whimsy. Director Tim Burton obviously felt a kinship to this journey, and to the relationship between father and son, but he can't seem to work up much energy or enthusiasm in the present day sequences (this despite the fact Albert Finney seems to be having a ball). The fantastic flashbacks, with Ewan McGregor as the young Finney, are fabulous however, and these episodes are the best things in ""Big Fish"". The film is handsomely-made, well-conceived, but you have to get through many lulls to find the good stuff, as if it were a crime to have one completely good movie. The production is very bright and beguiling, although comparisons to ""The Wizard of Oz"" (by one professional critic) seem somewhat premature. ** from ****"

What could have been interesting, the relationship between the son and the father seems realy false and dull.

"Leofwine_draca","4","2","5","29 October 2016"," Burton does Forrest Gump - with middling results
","BIG FISH is Tim Burton's attempt to do a whimsical flight-of-fancy movie based around an old guy on his death bed telling tall tales to his son. It's as simplistic as that, and it feels a bit like one of the Pee Wee films although without the irritating main character. Basically the viewer gets a ride through Burton's imagination with all of the kookiness and weird characters we've come to expect from the director.<br/><br/>This feels a little like a Coen brothers movie in places although without the wit. It's not a very good film, purely because I didn't like the main characters. The smug Ewan McGregor has long been a bane in my life and he doesn't change my opinion of him here; plus that Southern accent sounds fake even to this British viewer. Albert Finney is little better in a role that pretty much any old actor could have played. The only one I liked was Billy Crudup, who I have never seen playing a nice, ordinary chap before.<br/><br/>The nature of the tall tales and adventures is rather ordinary and the various romantic sub-plots are entirely boring. Once again we get Helena Bonham Carter turning up underneath various prosthetic work and various cameos from the likes of Danny DeVito and good old Steve Buscemi. Some of the interludes are surprisingly racist in their depiction of Asian cultures and others seem to take pride in circus culture and the exploitation of animals that goes with it. Needless to say I found none of the whimsical humour funny at all. Burton's on definite autopilot with this one."

But this one, whilst most certainly not impressing me at all, is neither bad enough for me to slate it, nor good enough for me to sing it's praises.<br/><br/>Quite simply, I'm not sure what Burton was trying to do here. I understand all the metaphors and allegories that are present, but the ultimate goal of the film eludes me. Was it to make me think about how I relate to my father? Was it trying to tell me that not all stories are made up, or true? Was it simply trying to point out the difficulties of having a larger than life personality in a boring, mundane world? Is it all of the above? And, at the end, do we actually care?<br/><br/>A film has to be entertaining on some level in order to keep the audience's attention. BF does this, but only just. At no point do you feel any great empathy for the character of the Father, as told in his stories. In fact, there's nothing about the film as a whole which really grasps your attention and demands that you continue watching.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest failing, as with many other films, is the hype that surrounds them. BF has been hyped up as a wonderful movie that will astonish and delight. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver on that promise. In the end, it's just the story of a man coming to terms with his father's death and helping through that time and coming to understand himself better in the process.

","Poor Billy Crudup.  This graciously natural actor is stuck in a miserable role in Big Fish, playing William Bloom, the stick-in-the-mud son of a very ordinary man named Edward Bloom, who has enchantedly imagined his entire life as a gloriously giddy myth.  But William, who grew up to be a newspaper reporter (he specializes in facts!), can't accept his dad for who he is. And so while Edward spins wonderful gold out of the straw of his life, William the wimp rejects him totally until Edward begins to die, when William comes home to America from Europe, with his French wife.  What for? To grill Edward for the ""truth"".  What a jerk!<br/><br/>Nobody who goes to see Big Fish is going to like William. So it's unfortunate the whole movie is set up with William as the hero - he's the one who's going to grow and change, he's the one we are going to wait for the whole film until he catches up with what we already know from scene one: he's got a wonderful dad. No matter how talented of an actor Billy Crudup is, every time he's on screen in Big Fish you just want him to shut up and get lost.  William is a loser.<br/><br/>His father Edward is a champion yarn spinner.  But the character we actually love most in Big Fish is Edward's wife Sandy, because Sandy loves Edward for who he is and can follow with her heart what her eye cannot see.  Now that's extraordinary vision!  Unfortunately for Big Fish, Sandy doesn't get as much screen or story time as putzy William, and the movie suffers, because the two best scenes - involving the young Sandy (Alison Lohman) crumpled on the front lawn of her home when she thinks Edward's been killed in the Korean War, and the older Sandy (Jessica Lange) climbing fully clothed into a bathtub with Edward - are all we have to hang our hearts on in this movie.<br/><br/>There's several surface treats, fueled by Tim Burton's fanciful eye and Phillipe Rousselot's quirky and handsome photography, but they don't have a strong rallying point - which should have been the love bond between Edward and Sandy.  But Big Fish ultimately misses the boat as well as the golden ring it symbolically tries to swallow in the first scene."

Firstly, the story is interesting and at the same time moving. Then, the special effects are stunning, considering the period in which the film was created. Moreover, the score, created by a usual suspect when talking about a Tim Burton's film, Danny Elfman, totally deserved the nominations it received. <br/><br/>As far as the interpretations of the actors are concerned, they are all flawless. Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter as well as Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi and Danny DeVito are not only big names but also great in their own way. They achieve to make the character they play appealing to the audience. Speaking the truth, if I had the chance I wouldn't replace any of them as the roles were tailor made. By this I don't mean that this film gives them the opportunity to unfold every aspect of their talent but that they meet perfectly the expectations created by their role. <br/><br/>This film is a proof to the theory that great films don't always receive Oscars, Golden Globes or other important awards, despite the fact that they deserve them. I sincerely cannot justify why this film is so underrated. <br/><br/>For all the reasons above, I strongly recommend watching Big Fish. You won't regret it!"

","I just saw this the whole way through for the first time on DVD. I laughed. I cried. I was enthralled. The actors are all perfectly cast, and are completely committed to this story, which points out that while the tall tales we tell may not be the whole truth, they are also the spice of life, and sustain us in good times and bad. We actually need them to survive. Much like we need movies. Albert Finney is possibly the most under-rated actor ever; as the dying Edward Bloom, he is a wonderful raconteur but also tender and loving. Billy Crudup does a sterling job as his bitter, very skeptical son, who is tired of his father never letting facts get in the way of a good story. As Edward's wife, Jessica Lange is luminous. She has long accepted his eccentric ways, and loves him for it. The scene of she and Edward in the bathtub is incredibly moving. As the young Edward, Scottish actor Ewan McGregor brings a nutty energy to his role. In the flashback scenes that the older Edward narrates about him, McGregor undergoes all sorts of wondrous adventures - from befriending a giant living in a cave, to fending off jumping spiders and a werewolf, to visiting a phantom village where no one ever leaves, to parachuting out of a plane in wartime and meeting beautiful Siamese twin women.The supporting actors are exceptional. Danny De Vito obviously relishes playing a brash circus ringmaster who Edward eventually befriends. Helena Bonham Carter plays an eccentric older woman who may, or may not, have had an affair with the younger Edward. Steve Buscemi, as usual, is entertaining and endearing as both a hopeless poet in the phantom village, and later an inept bank robber who once again crosses paths with Edward. French actor Marion Cotillard, playing the older Edward's daughter-in-law, is a key element in the story - as a newcomer to the family, she wants to understand and get to know Edward, so she asks him to tell her more about his life. Best of all, the film is made with great love by director Tim Burton. The fish metaphor might be a little overdone, but I think ultimately the film works beautifully, whether it's as a comment on humanity, a fairytale, an escape, or a fun lark. Whatever you want to make of it."

","Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"" is not only his best movie since ""Ed Wood"" but it is also his most interesting movie that he directed since ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990) and the most weird, and it is unlike any Tim Burton movie that I have ever seen. The movie starts in the present day at a wedding anniversary for Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) but there is a secret that Will is hiding that isn't revealed until later in the movie which is that he is dying but the disease that he is fighting I will not reveal in this review for those that have not seen this movie. The movie also talks about reconciliation throughout the movie but it starts with Ed's son Will (Billy Crudup) who is annoyed at his dad reciting the same poem for his entire life but it gets better between the two of them in Will's final hours. Also during this time Will's wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) is having a baby. During the course of the movie there is a lot of flashbacks but in the past Will is played by Ewan McGregor and it goes through Will's childhood and his time in high-school sports and his time meeting and helping a big giant who his fellow townsmen want to be killed. Also during the past he meets and falls in love with at first sight his eventual wife Sandra (Alison Lohman) but he is ironically rejected at first and then gets approved. Also in the past after Will gets married we go through his times in the Air Force during the Korean war, which all of this is Will's stories of his life that he never told anyone else which to me is very heartbreaking and touching. Burton also directed the first Warner Bros. Batman movie in 1989 which was a very good movie and it's sequel ""Batman Returns"" (1992) which was a terrible movie. Anyway when Will was young he also visited this small town where he met this little girl who messed with his shoes and a crazed writer named Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi), and then that little girl is all grown up and middle aged and as a grown up she is played by Helena Bonham Carter who happens to be Burton's wife. I will not spoil anything beyond that because it is for you to find out for yourself and believe me if you like Tim Burton's movies you will most likely enjoy it."

","I like whimsical stories, and when a film manages to deliver the goods, so much the better. Ed Bloom's (Albert Finney) tall tales have never been accepted by his son Will (Billy Crudup), and consequently the two have grown farther and farther apart. But the impending death of the elderly man will create a remarkable reconciliation that allows the son to realize that things aren't always as they seem, and that sometimes, the most fantastical stories might actually be true. I have to admit, I don't always get what director Burton is trying to convey in his movies, but this is a bittersweet tale that comes full circle in reconciling a son with a father who was rarely around while he was growing up. An all too familiar occurrence I might suspect, and the kind that often goes unresolved. ""Big Fish"" is particularly poignant for small pond citizens like myself, where one's opinion of a father may be enhanced to larger than life by those he's impacted and influenced over the course of a lifetime."

As the film begins and progresses, it seems as if it is a ridiculous exaggeration of a man's life, and even though the series of flashbacks are interesting and pithy it seems as if the point of the movie is to put together a chain of fables and embellishments.

While the film is literally about larger than life stories that are perceived by characters in the narrative as wildly embellished tall tales, the tone is one of utmost sincerity and unblinking frankness, leaving out the winks, nudges and sly jabs that usually come with Burton's aesthetic. It's straight up drama, coming from a place of true humanity, that just happens to take place in a story where we get to see these tales of fantasy and unbelievable occurrences. It's this merging of the serious with a dose of utter magical flair that makes it so special, and a beacon of memorable, down to earth style in Burton's otherwise spooky lineup of stories. Billy Crudup, an extremely underestimated actor, plays rational, logical Will Bloom, who is visiting his ailing father Edward (Albert Finney) in the countryside. He grew up hearing wild stories from his father about daring, impossible exploits that he went through in his youth, stories that couldn't fathomably be true. Or could they? Will resents his father for his blatant eccentricities and Crudup expertly displays the subtle rift this has formed between the two of them, creating wounds that only open again with this visit. He brings along his wife (a dazzling Marion Cotillard). As Edward continues to regale them with stories that Will has heard a thousand times (and Cotillard for the first time, humouring him with her warmhearted patience), the film transports us back in time and brings these stories to wild, colour filled life, with a youthful and vibrant Ewan Mcgregor playing the young version of Edward. We learn of his encounter with a mysterious witch, an eerie town in the forest inhabited by a future bank robber (Steve Buscemi), a giant, his time in the war and subsequent escape, and in the film's most touching vignette, a stint working for a local circus, run by a flamboyant ringleader (Danny Devito, the crass little teddy bear) with a scary secret. There he meets his gorgeous future wife, played by Alison Lohman, a positive vision of beauty. Jessica Lange plays her in the present time, infusing quiet warmth and aching love with simple gestures. These tales from the past all have a brilliantly bright, storybook wonder to them, reigned in towards introspect by the characters in the present who they are being told to, and ruminated on by. Whether they are true or not (although there is a concrete answer, surprisingly) doesn't really figure in our enjoyment of the film, or its validity as a moving piece of work, but they instead serve as an illustration of Edward's enormous imagination, only equaled by the size of his heart, and love for his wife and son. The ending sequence is one you'll be fighting back tears during, and is one of the most genuine, earnest moments in a career that for Burton tends to dwell in the realms of detached, emotionally gray territory, but here he orchestrates the most moving, heartfelt work I've ever seen him do. From beginning to end, this tall tale makes your imagination leap with the notion of fantasy and larger than life endeavours, but always beckons you back to relatable, human roots with the back and forth synergy of an orchestral symphony. A classic."

","Big Fish tells the tale of Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) as he tries to learn the true story about his dying father's life. The stories that Will knows about Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) are fact and fiction blended and Will spends his time for most of the film trying to separate the two. The audience views the journey of Young Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor) through flashbacks as Will recaps the tales his father has told over the years. <br/><br/>Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) and Cinematographer Philippe Rousselot (A River Runs Through It, Remember the Titans) create a tall tale world that combines both fact and fiction, the story of Edward Bloom. It could have been very easy for the effects to feel awkward, but they truly compliment the stunning story.<br/><br/>The cast in the film is immense in talent. Supporting Crudup, McGregor, and Finney are: Jessica Lange, Helena Bonham Carter, Allison Lohman, Robert Guillame, Matthew McGrory, Marion Cotillard, Steve Buscemi, and Danny DeVito. Each bring their own brilliance to the story and together they make the film shine bright. <br/><br/>Will Bloom has to come to terms with his father, Edward, and he has to decide how he wants to view the legacy of the man. The climax of the story places the film in the category of the last word uttered, immortal. Do not miss this beautiful film."
"lizakaym","9","1","2","7 November 2012"," love it!
","Tim Burton creates a phenomenal movie with believable acting, imaginative cinematography and costumes, and a touching and irreplaceable narrative. The movie is about William Bloom, a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward. William only knew tall tales about his father's life. Edward told William elaborate stories about growing up, making his way in life, and meeting his mother. During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine stay with him as the old man recollects intricate memories of his youth. The unique plot creates a journey that is unexpected, enchanting, outrageous, and genuinely moving. There is no other way to describe it, but as unique. The mythical or possibly true stories of Edward's eventful life captivate me and include me on a journey in an effort to separate fact from fiction. Each story is fascinating and original. William most accurately describes his father's tales; ""And as strange as his stories got the endings were always the most surprising of all."" Big Fish is unlike other dramatic comedies. It is not hilarious moments leading up to a big dramatic climax like most dramatic comedies, but the movie as a whole is filled with comedy and drama. This movie is unique and interesting. I love this movie and you will too if you like unique stories."

","Big Fish is a fantasy adventure film based on the novel of the same title by Daniel Wallace. The film was directed by Tim Burton and stars Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, and Marion Cotillard. Other roles are performed by Helena Bonham Carter, Matthew McGrory, and Danny DeVito among others. Finney plays Edward Bloom, a former traveling salesman from the Southern United States with a gift for storytelling, now confined to his deathbed. Bloom's estranged son, a journalist played by Crudup, attempts to mend their relationship as his dying father relates tall tales of his eventful life as a young adult, played by Ewan McGregor.The film's theme of reconciliation between a dying father and his son had special significance for Burton, as his father had died in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct.<br/><br/>William Bloom is a young man who never really knew his dying father, Edward outside of the tall tales he told about growing up, making his way, and meeting his mother. During Edward's last days, William and his wife Josephine hold bedside vigil as the old man recollects elaborate memories of his youth. Still doubting the the legends and folklore, William makes a journey to meet a mysterious woman from whom Edward had bought property.<br/><br/>After a string of mediocre movies, director Tim Burton regains his footing as he shifts from macabre fairy tales to Southern tall tales.This is a compelling look at the relationships between fathers and sons, and the child coming to terms with the parent's mortality.Reliant more on powerful familial emotions than wacky splendor, this film treads as close to our real world - a melancholy dissection of paternal distance and never truly knowing how many lives those we love can truly affect. The result is sweet but thanks to the director's dark and clever sensibility and never saccharine."

","What a magical movie this is. ""Big Fish"" challenges our faith and imagination with tales that sound too marvelous to be true, too extraordinary to be believable. But the strongest emotions are found between the broken relationship of a dying father and his doubtful son. After years of no communication, they are reunited when human age reaches its fragile state. The son sits on a chair as he observes his weak father, who lies in what could be his deathbed.<br/><br/>Old Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a devoted storyteller who believes that true stories could use a little fiction for entertainment purposes. On the day his only son, Will, was born, he was out of town selling home appliances. Not a very exciting story for such a very momentous event. When Will is set to be married, his father shares with everyone the false account of how he caught a really big fish with his wedding ring the same day Will was born. This draws smiles from his listeners, but not from Will, who has heard the same lie repeatedly throughout his life. He walks away. And he doesn't return until old Edward becomes confined to his bedroom.<br/><br/>Other than the tale about the big fish, Edward has shared more of his past experiences with Will, which he starts to recall in great detail. A series of flashbacks begin, and we are introduced to the mysterious memories of Edward, which gives an opportunity for director Tim Burton to indulge in his obsession for all things weird. Edward narrates as nostalgia kicks in, but it's Tim Burton who supplies the imagination.<br/><br/>Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/big-fish/"
"JoshSharpe","10","1","2","4 September 2012"," Very inspiring and original
","Has someone ever told you a story that was so awe-inspiring and so fantastic that you wondered if it could possibly be true? This is how William Bloom feels about his father, Edward Bloom. So much so that he doesn't even talk to him anymore. Edward Bloom is a storytelling, eager to tell everyone about his life adventures. Will knows they can't be true and so as his father grows close to death, he decides to set things straight. This film, based on Daniel Wallace's book, is one of my favorites because it clearly portrays a life well lived. Edward Bloom is one of the most inspiring characters I have ever seen on screen because he puts so much into life; and gets so much out of it. Tim Burton's usual films are quite dark in tone, but with this, he takes a break from that style, while still managing to put his unmistakable creativeness and true sense of wonder into it. I also highly recommend Daniel Wallace's book which is just as good, if not better, than the movie."
"funkyfry","10","1","2","11 June 2007"," Exquisite; Burton's best film
","""Big Fish"" is one of the most thrilling, amusing and emotionally compelling films I've seen this past decade. It's also, in my opinion, accomplished director Tim Burton's best film so far. The film struggles to illuminate one of the most significant questions of philosophy: ""What is the measure of a man?"" In doing so it never becomes pedantic, an impressive feat considering the titular ""Big Fish in a small pond""  Ed Bloom (played alternately at different life stages by Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney)  is as self-absorbed as they come. At times his over-sized ego is the source of his charm  as when he convinces friendly Giant Karl (Matthew McGrory) to leave his small Alabama town by offering to leave with him: ""you think this town is too small for you? Well it's too small for me too!"". At other times it becomes oppressive, a source of deep division between the father and his son Will (Billy Crudup)  as when he spends much of his son's wedding telling tales of his OWN adventures or when he angrily tells his son that it's his own fault if he can't understand his father. Part of the film's genius is in the fact that it's able to draw us into Ed Bloom's tall tales and fill us with wonder and joy at the man's sheer joy-of-living, while at the same time gradually bringing our sympathies more in line with son Will's. And all of this before it takes both the audience AND Will through a series of experiences that synthesize the two. After all is said and done, after all, sometimes the greatest truth lies in fiction.<br/><br/>For the most part, each actor in this film provides a memorable characterization. With its narrative constantly in flux between mythical past and dreary present (Ed Bloom is in the process of dying while son Will tries to discover the truth about his father's life), casting of the lead roles could easily have killed the film, but happily there is sufficient synergy between the 2 story structures to make us believe these are the same people and at the same time make the distinction between ""real"" and ""fantasy"" more than simply a matter of nifty special effects. For example, the resemblance between Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) and her younger self (Alison Lohman) is so great that when I first saw the film I thought it was the same actress using makeup effects. But the directing and acting are of such discriminating skill that we can easily see the difference between the ""girl of his dreams"" and the woman who made the hard choices necessary to actually live with this man. Lange absolutely nails the profound mixture of sadness from losing a loved one while at the same time giving thanks for all the joy that their life together has brought them. As with all things in this film, the difference between the dream girl and the ""real"" woman ultimately don't matter at all.<br/><br/>I can't let these comments go without at least briefly mentioning some other exceptional aspects of the production. Danny Elfman's music usually rises (i.e. ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"") or sinks (i.e. ""Planet of the Apes"") to the level of Burton's work, and happily this film is no exception. Philippe Rousselot has provided us with haunting images that will never fade from memory, and is equally adept at Ed's fantastic and colorful mythology and his drab later life. Danny Devito is perfect as a shady showman with a dark secret, and Deep Roy is memorable as well as his best friend. Finney and McGregor are both an absolute joy to watch  no more to say about that, just watch them. On first viewing I thought Crudup was relatively weak, but the more I see it the more fitting his performance seems. Yes, he does seem to underplay most of his scenes and lacks a certain presence on screen. But it's perfect  if he were being portrayed by an actor like Hugh Jackman or Tom Cruise it would make it hard to see the profoundly different personalities of the extravagant father and his down-to-earth son.<br/><br/>Well, that's it  I'd be lying if I said that everything in the movie makes perfect sense to me, but it just feels right. It works. Like Ed Bloom's stories, it has justified its own existence (and how many big budget films even come close?) simply by telling its story."

","My current personal favorite movie of all time. You either get Tim Burton or you don't. If you ""get"" him, then this is a must see. If you don't ""get"" him, watch it anyway, you might enjoy. Not as dark as most of his flicks and great performances by just about everybody involved. Very funny and very moving at the same time. Ewan McGregor was especially good. After seeing him previously in only his Star War flicks and several other films, I was not particularly impressed with his acting. This film gave him a chance to show his true ability. Would like to see him team with Burton again. Steve Buscemi's performance was also impressive, as usual."

As the boy gets older, the stories start to seem too extraordinary, and he begins to think that maybe he really doesn't know about his father's life as it truly happened. He thinks he is nothing like his father, and begins to become irritated at the tall tales. After not talking to his father for a few years, the son hears of his father's bad health and goes to visit in hopes of hearing his father's true life story. What he finds out is even more amazing. <br/><br/>This movie is truly worth watching, but you must sit through the whole thing. I tried to get my mother and friend to watch it, but they couldn't sit still long enough, so they never got the whole story. I finally got my Dad to watch it with me. He sat through the whole thing, and by the end, he was kinda getting into it. He ended up telling me that it was a really great movie. In the beginning, it seems like just another father/son tale, but it is really much more.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy the film as much as I did. <br/><br/>-Miranda"
"sneezewhiz","10","1","2","28 December 2005"," There are stories and there are lies and they are different
","Big Fish is about a man who tells stories. He does not utter untruths with the deliberate intent to deceive, he merely embellishes what is already there to make it more interesting. His son (and some reviewers) does not understand this. The story about Edward Bloom is told by himself, in the form of his stories rather than as a straightforward narrative of his life. There have been lots of traveling salesmen who have mad a middling success of their lives. The world is full of their grandchildren who do not even know their full names, much less anything interesting. My grandfather was on the first trip an electric car took the length of the state of Connecticut when he was 20. Not much there. My grandfather was a charter member of the American Automobile Association, known as the AAA. Back in the early days AAA members would survey routes and contribute their notes to the AAA travel books. And thus a story begins. Beats hell out of that other one-sentence narrative, and it is not a lie, it has decorative flourishes. And that's what Edward Bloom was about and that is what his son learns about his father who was loved by many more people than he suspected."
"rebeljenn","8","1","2","28 December 2005"," Simply a good, big tale
","'Big Fish' is a magical, big tale about an ordinary guy who becomes unordinary and lives a big tale. It captures a southern US father and his relationship with his son, who fails to believe his big tales until a moving experience brings them closer together and closer to 'reality'. It is ultimately the tale of a father/son relationship as much as it is a tale about the unusual and adventurous life that his father leads and the unusual characters he befriends along the way to a successful and magical life.<br/><br/>The film is full of symobolism, but it is often a little too simplistic, and I felt that the plot could have developed more in some areas. This could have been a much longer film, and I think that it needed to be longer in order to tell some of the story, but it does fairly well as it stands. I felt that some of the scenes were rushed and that some of the detail and additional scenes could have made this a much better film.<br/><br/>I don't think this film is for everyone, but if you're after a good story about characters and want to watch something original, then I suggest spending an evening with this film."

The acting was very good as was the writing, etc. It is the kind of movie that makes you want to go read the book. For me that is the best kind because usually movies are not as good as the books they were based on. The ones that are exceptions to this rule are often superb movies. This could be one of those. The soundtrack with this movie was also exceptional. I also expect to buy that asap. I have watched the movie twice as of this writing and expect to get a copy of the DVD as well.

","I think that the male ego prevents much emotion being shown on a regular basis. Certainly, I find that that is the case myself. However, there have been a few occasions where I have found the smallest traces of water forming in my eyes whilst watching a film. Yes, I guess they would just about constitute tears! Anyway, there are quite a few comedies that have generated tears of laughter, quite a few films that have had me crying through boredom. But I don't think that any film has generated proper heart felt emotion and made me blub as much as Big Fish.<br/><br/>The story centres on the relationship between a dying father and his son. The father is a story teller, and his whole life as told to his son has been greatly exaggerated, and turned into a fairytale. Realising that his father is dying, the son wishes to try and understand who he really is, and to discover the truth amongst the fiction.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, I realise that this makes the film sound very dull, but it most certainly is not - it is both tear jerkingly sad, yet uplifting. Tim Burton again using his genius imagination to make this film, and its larger than life characters and fairy tales, really come to life. Albeit, an exaggerated lie of a life.<br/><br/>I won't pretend that this film would be to everyones taste, but I do think that it deals with both life and death in a very uplifting way, and as such everybody should give it a few hours of their time."

I don't cry over films, but this one made me have to sink down my seat and swallow my tears. Apart from touching, another strong point is how the visuals are much like those of a fairy tale. Edward Bloom's world looks surreal but warmly believable. You'd want to believe his world. You'd wish your world is like that. You'd fall in love with Edward Bloom.<br/><br/>His relationship with his wife is very romantic as well. It's far from the usual shallow Hollywood-romance-type of love. Their love is very dreamy and daring, but is that not how love is? Their romance might be one of the greatest on-screen romances of all time, although it's not the main plot of the story.<br/><br/>And, this film makes the audience contemplate of whether or not they have lived their lives to the fullest, like Bloom has."

","I thoroughly enjoyed 'Big Fish' but find it a difficult movie to rate. Ewan McGregor as the younger Edward Bloom, and Albert Finney as Edward in his twilight years, are both marvelous. The visuals are superb, and many times I found myself thinking of 'Moulin Rouge' in style, where McGregor played an idealistic songwriter.  The core of this story is Bloom's life of seemingly tall tales, and his son's (Billy Crudup) inability to feel close to his father because he could never get past those tall tales to discover his 'real' father that he was looking for. However, when the movie ends, much like 'Secondhand Lions', we wonder how tall the tales really were!<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow -- please quit reading now. The father/son difficulties arise from their opposite personalities. Edward was always the upbeat kid, the one who wasn't afraid of anything, who was the natural athlete, running the winning touchdown, hitting the winning basketball goal at the buzzer, going to the witch's house to see her glass eye, escorting the giant out of town. His son grew up conservative, had a secure job in Paris, married to a pretty French lady, hadn't spoken to his father for over three years, until he gets the call, travels home to see his dying father. Visiting his father, most of his focus was to get his dad to tell him who he really was, to quit telling all the tall tales. But his father insisted, ""This is who I really am."" At the funeral, all sorts of strange characters show up, the giant, the twins, the circus performers. While his tales may have been exaggerated a bit, they all were real. And his son finally realizes who his father really was. The title comes from one of the tales, where Bloom used his gold wedding band to catch this big fish in the lake. In the end, son told his dad a fable of how dad would die, son would carry him to the water, and as he sank, turned into the big fish then swam away, immortal. As were his stories."

"sachsad","6","1","2","31 December 2003"," GREAT but not up to par with other Burton films in my opinion...
","In Big Fish, Tim Burton deals with actors more than he has in any other movie.  There is more dialogue between actors, and there is also a voiceover, placing more emphasis on human beings than Tim Burton's imaginative creations that we've seen in his other films. That being said, Burton fans will not be hugely disappointed.  Burton's imagination does indeed color this movie to make it even better than Daniel August's novel.  He makes a giant look like the size he is in the story (unlike Lord of the Rings' failure to make the hobbits look small enough at times) and employs stunning cinematography (that's more the director of photography but obviously Burton was working closely with him).  The freaky living beings and odd situations common to this film as well, giants and circuses and siamese twins and a land like eden with delicious apple pie. Where in other Burton films the dialogue seems unresolved and out of nowhere at times, this time when that happens it makes sense because the movie is just myths and the story of people trying to make sense of the myths. Danny Elfman wrote another wonderful score, the movie has a great feel, and impeccable acting (Ewan Macgregor, Helena Bonhman Carter, Jessica Lange, Steve Buscemi, and Albert Finney all did wonderful jobs) Unlike other Burton movies, this one is not gothic or pulp at all.  It's brighter, but it maintains the signature Burton darkness, and it's a good family movie.  Like some Burton movies, it's also a bit moralistic, which is not always my personal preference. But I definitely recommend this one to everyone.  Check it out."

","Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is a robust looking old man who loves to tell stories, in fact he has been telling tall tales all his life to his children, inflating events in his own life to mythic proportions. When Bloom's journalist son Will (Billy Crudup) returns to his parent's house on hearing that his father is dying of cancer, he is determined to separate fact from fiction and get to know the father who was never around when he was growing up. Based on a semi-autobiographical novel by Daniel Wallace and adapted for the screen by John August Big Fish, the latest by Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood), is a beautifully looking film that has its engines going full blast but never seems to achieve liftoff. I am drawn to films that have a surreal vision of an alternate reality, but Big Fish force-feeds it to us rather than subtly evoking a sense of magic.<br/><br/>
The film is told in flashback as Will and his pregnant French wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard) recall the stories his father had told him all his life. We first see young Edward (Ewan McGregor) as a sports hero and science fair winner in Ashton, Alabama then, after leaving Ashton with a gentle giant named Karl, encountering the inhabitants of a wondrous town called Spectre where everyone walks around barefoot and is full of joy. Although vowing to return one day to Spectre, Edward moves on and agrees to work for a circus manager (Danny de Vito) in return for information about Sandra (Alison Lohman), a girl he has fallen in love with. Eventually he finds her at Auburn University and, in one of the best scenes in the film, courts her with 10,000 daffodils to prove his love. <br/><br/>After Edward is drafted to fight in the Korean War, he rescues conjoined twin entertainers, Ping and Jing and brings them home to work in the circus. At this point, it just continues from one off-the-wall sequence to another until its grand Fellini-esque final sequence. Unfortunately, despite some high expectations, I was unmoved by the ending. I did not find anything lovable about Bloom and feel that the theme of father-son reconciliation was handled much more convincingly in The Barbarian Invasions by Denis Arcand. While Big Fish has some fine performances and outstanding special effects, it did not instill in me any true sense of wonder or authentic emotion. Sadly, Big Fish is dead in the water."

After such visually stunning films as Bettlejuice, Sleepy Hollow and Pee-wee's Big Adventure, one can be sure that the price of admission will bring awkward camera angels, strangely colored film sets and, usually, a cast of characters as weird as anything this side of Twin Peaks. Enter Big Fish, Burton's 2003 theatrical entry that that comes with a tag line `An adventure as big as life itself'.   Screened for the first time ever in Toronto, Canada, the audience clapped ecstatically when we were told of the film we were about to view, but the elation paled in comparison to the response of those in attendance at the conclusion of the film.  To put in simply, this is the best film Tim Burton has ever put on screen.  In fact, I'll be anxiously waiting in the next couple of months to see if Burton will get his just reward and be garnished with Oscar nominations for Best Director and even Best Film.<br/><br/>The story surrounds the final days of Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor as both the old and young Bloom respectively), and the strained relationship he has with his son, William, played with remarkable ease by Billy Crudup.  William had not spoken to his father for three years, the result of growing animosity at the tales his father used to pass as truth to family and friends.  But soon, his father's cancer brings William to his bedside and the stories of Edward's youth are told one more time.<br/><br/> There are stories about a giant that terrorized a town and then is lead to the circus.  A story about two twins who help Edward escape China during World War II.  A story about a witch with a glass eye that can tell a man's fate and a story about falling in love and doing anything to find the woman of your dreams. There are countless more stories, but you can catch them in the trailers, so I won't waste your time here.  Besides, the more you look into the film the better off you are.  It's a beautiful ensemble piece that tugs at your heart strings (sorry for being sappy) while telling a remarkable story about the life of a man who believes he is too big for his small town and sets out on an adventure of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The movie reminded me of Forrest Gump set in a fantasy world of endless possibilities and wonderment.  Even the music style was similar to Gump's in that as the decades changed through the stories, so did the soundtrack.  We would hear Elvis during wartime, and the Allman Brothers in the 70's.<br/><br/>Burton regular Danny Elfman is back scoring the film, but shows a restraint never heard before in this director's filmography.  All work magically enhancing the visual style of production designer Dennis Gassner (Road to Perdition, Miller's Crossing).<br/><br/>It's been a while since Burton brought to the screen a story of such love and affection and to do so, he surrounded himself with old friends.  Danny DeVito (Batman Returns) plays Amos a half man half wolf circus ringleader and Helena Bonham Carter (Planet of the Apes) plays Jenny is woman from a paradise city who longs to love Edward.  Look closely and you will also enjoy Jessica Lange, Steve Buscemi and Robert Guillaume.  But through all its star power, it is a quirky giant named Karl, played by Matthew McGrory, that steals every scene he is in.  Not since the towering impression that Andre the Giant had in The Princess Bride, has there been such a loveable, awkward character.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the film can be seen miles before it arrives, but it is no less powerful.  William is at his father's bedside when he passes away, but not before he himself finally comes to believe and finish the fantasy with a story of his own making.  The scene where Edward is brought to the riverside to the cheers of all the mystical characters we are introduced to along his travels, put a lump into many of the audiences' throats and even I pretended to wipe a yawn tear from my cheek.  Maybe it just caught us by surprise since we are not used to seeing a Burton film have such warmth and heart, but nonetheless, Burton moved us like an earthquake of devastating proportions.<br/><br/>For you true Burtonians, don't worry.  For all the mush there is also more humor than his last ten films combined.  In fact, I noticed about an hour in that my cheeks were hurting from the constant perma-smile brought through the many fun characters and situations throughout Edward's life story.<br/><br/>I don't know what kind of an audience Big Fish might reel in.  Those who like love stories, might be turned off by the wacky visual styles, and those that love Burton's way of turning the ordinary into the extraordinary, might be reserved due to its overwhelming tug at the heartstrings.  However, don't be fooled by the trailers, and don't be turned off by a director trying to forget his last film.  Big Fish is a marvel and out of the 200 plus films I have had the pleasure of viewing this year, ranks above the rest."

","I had high hopes for the film as I imagine most people doing seeing as its been getting good reviews.<br/><br/>If anyone could give me back the two hours I just wasted I'd be most appreciative. The stories told were uninteresting and pointless, the characters were paper thin and I was not given the chance, nor wanted in the end, to get to know them and actually care what happened to them.<br/><br/>The acting was good, the cinematography was good but sadly thats where the good bits end. I'll be the first to admit I'm not a massive fan of Burton but even then god knows how he got away with this. It was just totally uninspiring, uninteresting, unengaging and down right boring. The story was predictable and simple with nothing to entice the watcher into he world he was trying to create with each story piece.<br/><br/>Personally I'd recommend watching something with a lot more thought to it, if you like the fantasy type genre then Princess Mononoki is a prime example of great story telling and well executed drive.<br/><br/>Big Fish - 3, and if the actors were bad, then it'd have been a 1. Seriously."

Beautifully made, well-acted but just plain boring.<br/><br/>I like the idea of the tale-telling father and the son who just doesn't<br/><br/>get what his father is all about. Unfortunately, the stories the father<br/><br/>tells all seem to be pale imitations of fairy-tales, all show and no<br/><br/>substance. True fairy-tales have a darkness at their heart, fables<br/><br/>have a moral. The stories shown here just seem to exist simply to<br/><br/>provide the opportunity for nice visuals.<br/><br/>As a time-filler for the under-tens this is fine but as a great<br/><br/>movie...? <br/><br/>Like I said, it must be me!"
"BabersMagelica","3","2","8","5 January 2004"," I'm a big fish
","I'm a big Tim Burton fan, but Big Fish was a huge disappointment. All of the actors did an amazing job, but the story was lacking in so many ways: there wasn't enough Tim Burton imagery, some of the timelines didn't make sense, the development of the father/son relationship was lacking, and I wasn't convinced that I should care about any of the characters. Bottom line on Big Fish: yes, it's pretty because it's a Tim Burton film, but viewers are the big fish for being lured into such disappointing  movie."
"adamscastlevania2","6","1","3","5 October 2014"," Something got lost along the way
","(59%) An over ambitious adaptation that only partly fits Tim Burton's creative eye. The cast is strong, but nobody it seems is given any chance to make any real impact as characters are dropped only to be brought back again as and when needed in a wild attempt to link everything, and everyone, together in one neat package. With that said this is still a quality piece with good direction and production values, some nice touches every so often, and quite a lot of charm, but the attempts of poignancy feel forced as it's so hard to connect with everything this wants to fit in. Overall it is worth a look as certain people will like this more than others, but it's really not my one of my favourite Burton movies."
"jhsbook","6","1","3","1 January 2007"," Moving life-story for everyone, albeit socially defected
","Big Fish is a very moving story suitable for families. It is not really just about one father and one family, but about most of everyone with a big heart and desire to go beyond the usual... Escapist in nature yet extremely enchanting as yet another typical ""American Dream"", the myth and adventure as told by the father very precisely describes one's often untold mixed feelings about life and death, about sudden adolescent growth and the sweet sorrows of love...<br/><br/>What weakens the film most is the over-simplification and Cold-War depiction of a demonetized war-time ""exotic China"" in which the hero suddenly becomes unnecessarily aggressive. At the same time, while the daffodil-filled scene of love and romance is detailed and touching, the over-quick solution of another layer of the story, i.e., the witch/girl/other-woman image, proves to be too shallow in terms of social awareness. There were many allusions to American history particularly in the story of bank robbery and the changing role of poet which, if more adequately explored, could have made the film a much greater one, elevating itself towards many deeper-thinking American social-critic dramatists and European philosophical buldungsroman."

"ArArArchStanton","7","1","3","28 March 2006"," Good Yes,,,,, Interesting? Well that may be debatable
","This movie really reminds me of edwards sissorhands,,, hummm i wonder why. It's very good in a legitimate way, but the worlds that Burton bring you too are always far enough off the edge of reality that they're hard for me personally to connect to.<br/><br/>As with Edward Sissorhands, the movie is very meloncholly, as it takes you completely through the journey of one mans life. Do yourself a favor and watch ""The Last Emperor"" and you'll see what I mean. There is a very depressing feeling about watching a story that begins with a man being born and ends with him dying, all the while you see all of the significant things that he did with his life. At the end, you don't say ""Wow that was good"", you say, ""Well, I guess that's the end"" The film is excellent though and should be watched by all. It is a very human story, and probably is the best I've ever seen and presenting a human story while mixing in fantastical elements. This is down as the fantastical elements are revealed in flashbacks which are forewarned as being overly dramatic.<br/><br/>Great Great,,, watch it,,,,, you'll probably give it more than a 7!!!!"
"yankeefan21","10","1","3","29 December 2005"," Imaginative and Fresh
","I have to preface this entire post by saying that I am NOT a big fan of Tim Burton. I don't think he ever does ANYTHING new.<br/><br/>For goodness sakes, the man has had Danny Elfman compose the scores for ALL of his movies, and recycles half of his cast from movie to movie! With the aforementioned disclosure off of my chest, I have to say that this was an unexpectedly fantastic movie! The concept was fresh, the storytelling was genius, and this vehicle lends itself perfectly to Burton's style.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to anyone with an adult (read MATURE) mindset."
"MLDinTN","5","1","3","8 December 2004"," not as good as I thought it would be
","I thought this film would have more laughs and be more entertaining. It is about a guy, who goes home to see his estranged father who is gravely ill. He resents the fact that his dad liked to tell him tall tales as a child. Now that's a real reason not to talk to your father for years. So the movie relives of his dad when his dad was young. It shows how he left town with a giant, joined the circus, and how he got his wife to marry him. And how he went to war and bought a town. The part with the giant was probably the best because it was the most laughable. You could see how the son wouldn't believe that. But most of the stories told were so-so and nothing great.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: The general idea behind the movie was good, but the stories shown in the film weren't all that great. If they were going to have a movie about tall tales, then make some of them really out there. That would have been more entertaining. So, I don't recommend this one for anyone who is looking for a fun film to watch."
"chetley","5","1","3","15 June 2004"," Schmaltz sells
","Schmaltz - it's a Yiddish word for gushy sentiment, for the use of cloying and manipulative emotionalism.    I thought that this movie was a perfect representation of Hollywood Schmaltz.<br/><br/>A lot of people love this movie.   There's an understandable yearning for stories, for fantasy.   But I thought that these stories, these fantasies, were trite and predictable.   (Especially the ending.)   It was also a little disturbing to me the way that the film whitewashes (literally) the history of Alabama, making it seem like some paradise of ideal race relations.    Notice how the ""fantasy"" scenes set in the protagonist's past are completely free of any tinge of racism, and that aside from a single Black boy, there are no African-Americans to be seen at all.   And ""Big Fish"" was filmed in and around Montgomery Alabama, where ML King preached and Rosa Parks boycotted.   It's so much easier to construct false images of the past than to remember what it is was really like.<br/><br/>When the past is too uncomfortable to remember, it is often distorted and made to be the subject of fantasy.    But just because amnesia is popular doesn't mean that is healthy."
"thedeconstructionist","6","1","3","18 May 2004"," Enjoyable but phony diversion
","Spoilers. Big Fish is a disjointed but watchable attempt at creating a heartwarming story, except for the fact that it seems as genuine as Taco Bell. It tells the story of the boring Ed Bloom Jr., who hasn't spoken to his father in three years. He's about to have a kid and his dad is fighting cancer, and just for once he would like to know his ""real"" father. It's pretty typical and there are no surprises concerning this part of the movie. From what I can tell, Ed Bloom Jr. has no reason to mope about just because his father told some tall tales. The problem with this movie is that it's basically a set-up to flashbacks that will set-up the character of Ed Bloom Sr., so that when he dies in a typical fashion at a hospital bed while coughing and doing the usual old man routine, a couple of tears will be shed by the audience. The father never tells his son the truth and the son is too selfish and judgmental to accept that maybe his father is not a liar. The flashback scenes are okay but aside from the war flashback few are emotionally engaging and do little to enhance the story. Ewan McGregor was cast for his appearance and little else it seems. His accent is pretty bad and although he can be quite likable he rings undeniably phony as a Southerner. In the end, however, the story is utterly predictable. The whiny kid who hates his father is moved when he does die and at the funeral all of his dad's old pals show up. There's something false about that kind of sentiment, and that kind of fraud runs through the whole movie. It's too much; too big, too loud (too many boisterous pop songs), not personal enough, and the script merely goes through the motions. None if it seems sincere, like any of its creators had a real story to tell. It seems like a neat idea that Burton and August thought up to sell tickets to people too eager to cry and be ""tugged at the heartstrings"". If you have to watch it, it's not so bad, and if your curiosity is getting at you, it's worth a rental. But be prepared to slog through too many predictable clichés.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.0"
"fedor8","Null","2","11","24 August 2009"," If this ""magical"" love story was inspired by Helena Bonham Carter, then no wonder it failed. The kind of woman only an Emo would stick into his movie...
","First of all, I'd like to thank famous Hollywood Emo Tim Burton for making his latest wife a little more acceptable to watch with all that witch make-up: a definite improvement over her real face. Helena Bonham Carter (what a snotty, preppy name) has also looked far better than herself in that awful 2001 monkey movie playing an ape-esse, and so it is again. Perhaps Tim should have her play a chair next time? Or a pair of socks locked up in a drawer? <br/><br/>On the other hand, I'd like to advise Burton to see an eye doctor because if he's going to continue marrying such women, then he ought not complain when one day he does get glasses and realizes in shock that all his kids look like something leftover from a flood. Will you stop casting your talentless wives already?? What is it with these weakling male directors who are p-wipped into submission by their career-greedy wives with little or no talent? <br/><br/>Which brings me to my next complaint about this sappy ""Baron Forrest Munchausen Gump"" wonder-less concoction: the casting. Why would you cast not one, not two, but THREE British actors to play U.S. Southerners? Why? And I mean WHY. Are all American actors really that bad? On the other hand, when Timmy makes a movie set in England he gets a bunch of Americans to play Brits. What the hell for? The very likable Ewan McGregor had already proved ten years ago that he can't do any American accent, much less a Southern one, in ""Night Watch""; he sounds hopelessly unconvincing in both movies. Tim's wife, Helena Bonham Carter-Burton The Third, can't keep it going either without the occasional screw-up, like the way she pronounced ""impossible"". Finney, on the other hand, gets it right - but then again he is quite a different class of actor than McGregor or the mousy Carter. Casting Jessica Lange was a mistake, too: if you have an old woman in the script then get a woman that LOOKS old, not a surgically-altered former 70s King Kong bimbo (there... the monkeys again) who can barely manage a smile what with all that overly tightened skin. (And then those old actresses complain about not getting any roles!). Watching Finney mess about with Lange in the bathtub wasn't so much a sentimental moment as it was vomit-inducing.<br/><br/>The most obvious problem with this movie is... well... the movie itself. Not nearly as syrupy as the pedophilic ""Finding Neverland"", and yet it's another ""grand"" Hollywood schmaltz-tale, complete with fortune-cookie wisdom, a hollow sentimental soundtrack, clichés galore, and the obligatory death of a main character. Boo-hoo-hoo. Spielberg would have been proud. Not quite as bad as ""The Colour Purple"" or any other filmic travesty, to be sure, but still quite a large bundle of stereotypical baloney. The first 20 minutes I had to watch in two separate sittings - that's how dull the intro was.<br/><br/>Some stories are okay, some are simply hopeless. When Ewan decides to work 3 years for De Vito to find that damn blonde, I had to wonder... He could have probably found her in half that time, if he had simply LOOKED for her. ""I Love Sandra"". Give me a barf bag. Ewan's character makes such an idealistic ass of himself that I sort of ended up enjoying his getting beaten up by the blonde's fiancé. She then predictably dumps her bully fiancé - which as we know is realistic because all women HATE tough men - and the two of them fall lovingly into the grass that has a heart-shaped indenture in it... So sweet. So absolutely flowery. Such visual prose. I'm touched. I think I'm going to pretend I'm a bored middle-aged housewife and weep into my smelly hankie for a bit...<br/><br/>If you carefully look at Helena Bonham Carter-Burton III (I know: a tough proposition) as the witch, she does resemble Johnny Depp. Johnny Depp is hands-down Tim's favourite actor. Tim fell in love with Helena. Draw your own conclusion.<br/><br/>BF has some good photography, though not nearly as spectacular as Timmy's best movies, but the emotional side of the story is so utterly cheesy, so predictable, that it can elicit wonder and tears only in indiscriminating, easy-to-impress viewers. Apparently, most of ye people out there belong to that category.<br/><br/>Ever notice how similar Helena (without make-up) and Billy Armstrong from Green Day look?"
"tishco","2","1","4","5 January 2018"," Boring.....
","Beautifully made, fantastic cast but typical Tim Burton. I suppose you are either into him or not.
I watched it for the cast and kept losing interest.
It jumps around too much and I don't understand the PG rating in Australia with the violence, scary themes including the naked butt of Danny De Vito.
I can't recommend it unless you like this sort of thing.
Of course Helena Bonham Carter (Tim's wife) makes appearances as well.
Over the top and way too long."
"rouzanna","3","1","4","8 May 2009"," It just didn't work
","After I managed to sit through the movie, the first thought that came to my mind was that this is exactly the sort of a movie that will be commended by the critics. Well, I wasn't wrong.<br/><br/>This, however, doesn't help the fact that I personally found the ""Big Fish"" to be a complete, utter and utmost waste of time, and was relieved to see quite a few negative reviews here. Otherwise, I would have thought it's just me. I had to watch the movie to the end, simply because my mother wanted us to - surprisingly, she quite liked it! I see now that watching it to the end was for the better, as the final scenes being somewhat relieving is about the only reason why anyone would bother to give the ""Fish"" anything higher than a one.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple one.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** There is a son (Will), who tries to find out more about what kind of a person his father (Ed) really was/is while the latter is on his deathbed. Almost everything Will knows about Ed comes from the stories his father was telling him over and over again, since he was a little boy, and Will doubted any of these stories were true. So, Will just recites those to us, in the meantime questioning his father about the real story of his life. When, after another stroke, Ed becomes unable to respond to those inquiries, Will feels it would also be reasonable to approach other people asking questions about his father. Doing so, he finds out not all stories are lies, and finally gets to respect and love his father. Moreover, he suddenly inherits his father's knack for rambling and gives Ed a comfortable death by telling a story of an end that Ed always wished for. So, when Ed turns into the Big Fish and gets a new beginning, we are supposed to cry (and so, I suspect, the most sentimental members of audience actually did).<br/><br/>*** SPOILER END*** Now, I'm not generally considered an insensible person, but the way the movie deals with the things that concern all humans seems just ridiculous. If the ""Big Fish"" were just a fairytale for teenagers I would not have any problems. But the movie is for grown ups, and all the fanciful fragments claiming to be perceived as tenderly romantic look contrived, unnatural and, above all, immature. To mention just one, the part where Ed serves Calloway for who knows how long, sweating his guts out for no pay, but only to learn ONE thing (mind you, not knowing if the thing would be true) about the girl he fell in love, per month of service. I couldn't help comparing the situation with Jacob serving Laban for years, but hello - the guy at least knew he would marry the girl. Not to mention, we all know how the things turned out.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is anything but convincing as young Ed. As the movie progresses one gets to realize that wide open bright blue eyes cannot compensate for every weakness this piece has to offer. Ewan McGregor is not alone here - acting is not among the strengths of the ""Big Fish"" (if you can find those at all, for that matter). Even Jessica Lange looks static and kind of numb as Ed's wife. Steve Buscemi could have improved the overall sad impression had he had a bigger role. But thank God he was there - the other reason why I gave it three stars. Let me go no further and stop right here. If you've read this review to the end, then please spend your time doing or watching something else - even smaller fish will be better."
"wolfbeast","3","1","5","29 July 2009"," Quite unimpressive
","I honestly expected more from a relatively recent Tim Burton movie than this one turned out to be. Overall quite unimpressive. Ranging from the poor cast choice for the main actors, to overall weakness of the script and story, the only thing that doesn't make it entirely awful is the fact that some effort was put into creating the scenes for the different parts of the story, but it barely pulls this movie off the mark for me. All in all, the ""revisiting"" by the son of the stories told over and over by his dad his entire life makes for a predictable, closed story with a weak execution; I'm sure it may have some significance for some people, but it absolutely lacked any sort of atmosphere, magic or feeling, except for a few scenes that actually looked halfway decent.<br/><br/>Overall, an unimpressive rendering of an unconvincing story, with decent acting but a poor choice of cast, some obligatory eye candy, but not convincing, compelling or mood-setting enough to make a difference. A disappointment. Definitely not worth more than a 3/10, almost a 2/10."
"thegreatevan","10","1","5","22 April 2006"," Loved it
","Big Fish is definitively one of the top ten movies of all times. It's a sort of wonderland film. The movie has a very complex sequence of events, which require more than one viewing for full understanding. In fact, the first time i saw it, i didn't enjoy it much. But then i gave it a second chance, and the pleasure of watching it increased exponentially. The more I watch it, the more I discover hidden aspects and new ways to interpret this masterful creation. The scenario is extraordinary, mixing long pipe lines and a almost omnipresent fairytale atmosphere. If you didn't like the movie the first time you saw it, don't be by any means discouraged. This movie requires patience and an active role from the viewer. Finally, Big Fish deserves special praise for all the dream-like sequences of the main character and the music fits in perfectly well."
"jboothmillard","4","1","5","24 June 2005"," Big Fish
","I re-watched Planet of the Apes (2001), and it turned out to be better than the first time I watched it, I did exactly the same with this film, directed by Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street). Basically Edward 'Ed' Bloom (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Albert Finney) is a storyteller who is dying, and his son who he fell out with years ago, Will (Billy Crudup) has no idea who the real man is. In a series of flashbacks, the story of young Ed (Ewan McGregor) is told. In the stories: he saw how he would die in an old creepy woman's (witch's) eye, met and befriended Karl the Giant (7'6 tall Matthew McGrory), saw a fish that looks like a naked chick, found an unknown and hidden town called Spectre, found the Giant somewhere to work as an act at the circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), fell in love with Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman), met Siamese twins Ping (Ada Tai) and Jing (Arlene Tai), helped Spectre's Norther Winslow (Steve Buscemi) rob a bank (helping him, somehow, to get rich), and much more. As Ed gets closer to death though, and Will goes to one or two of the places and people in these stories, including a near-affair with Spectre's Jenny (Burton's partner, Helena Bonham Carter, playing younger and older, oh, and that creepy witch). In the end, after Ed had a stroke and is close to death, Will is the one that has to tell the final story of how he dies, everyone is there, and he is placed in the water, and swims away as the big fish he is. Of course, that is when he dies in bed, and at the funeral is where you see everybody, older. Also starring Jessica Lange as Older Sandra Bloom, Robert Guillaume as (older) Dr. Bennett, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Missi Pyle as Mildred and Deep Roy as Mr. Soggybottom. In some ways the story is similar to Forrest Gump, obviously ignore the fantasy, but Ed Bloom is from Alabama, he is in many places throughout his life, he met a Jenny, and he's just a naive and slow witted. This film has enough clever effects and charm to keep you interested, it may be pretty cheesy and overloaded with sentimentality, but it's a good once in a while film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for Danny Elfman, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film, and the David Lean Award for Direction for Tim Burton (mainly a tribute to his past work also), and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for ""Man of the Hour"". Okay!"
"SuperCritic","4","1","5","12 January 2004"," Drags on, no surprises
","After the first 20 minutes of the movie you can pretty much tell how the rest of the movie is going to go.  The giant was the worst special effects I have ever seen, especially the scene when he first meets Ewen MacGregor's character.  The perspective was all wrong.  First you see the cave entrance, and it looks just a bit taller than Ewen, so at that point you expect the giant to be crouching or crawling when he walks out of the cave.  Instead, he's standing straight up, implying he's the same height as Ewen.  But then in the following scenes he's much taller.  It was very poorly done, and that set the tone for the rest of the movie.  Ewan was wrongly cast for the part I think, as he was for Moulin Rouge as well.  His smile is just too corny and his teeth aren't straight."
"jgervas","4","1","5","23 February 2004"," Forrest Gump + O Brother, where art thou
","Sorry folks ! Tim Burton is clueless since ""Ed Wood"" and gone is the creative magic touch of ""Edward Scissor Hands"", replaced for cheap melodrama. This movie is plain boring with its overblown sentimentalism and takes too much from the universe of ""O Brother where art thou"",(magical realism and typical USA southern  characters) and from ""Forrest Gump"" (the main character bends the world reality, creating your own). I was a great admirer  of Tim Burton past works and make this comments was truly very painful to me. FG"
"Sees All","3","1","5","18 December 2003"," Soporific - not worth the price of admission
","I found this movie boring.  There is no suspense, no real plot.  There are a series of loosely connected episodes that don't really add up to much.  It is mildly humorous in places and syrupy music plays when anyone cries. It's well acted, but who cares?  There are also some puzzling anachronisms, like Buddy Holly and Elvis music during the KOREAN War.  There are also some really awful southern accents.  Why do Yankees even bother?  They don't get it.  The humor is sophomoric and often tasteless (an Elephant taking a dump).  It was like bad TV.  To make the experience even more galling, Loewe's has raised its admission price to $10.25.  This movie is definitely NOT worth it.  If you are curious about it, wait and rent the video."
"brunodutch","4","1","6","13 April 2009"," Tripe
","A bunch of talented people get together and make a putrid film and they title it Big Fish. Everything about the script is ghastly and it is put on the screen with great skill and professionalism. Full of thudding metaphors and, heaven help us, symbols, that might seem profound to high-schoolers but are simply cloying if one is over the age of consent. Very poor casting of Finney (who looks pretty well-fed for a man dying of cancer) and McGregor who tries way too hard to be charming. To say nothing of the extreme inauthenticity of both as southerners. Over-designed and under-written it ends with an image straight out of Kinkade. Emblematic of the film's aesthetic is the transformation of Jenny's house from a ruin into something out of a Pottery Barn catalog. The movie mistakes prettiness for something more. And its 'exploration' of the relationship of an estranged father and son is simply laughable. Kitsch masquerading as art. Ugh."

","Painfully sentimental, this vapid tripe pays homage to Fellini via circus freaks and surreal worlds.

","12 January 2004. A touching ""Forest Gump"" on LSD/acid trip. This movie has all those surrealistic elements as well as the emotional buttons that make for a sentimental and fantastic voyage of discovery. The Forest Gump voice-over and the tall tales as if taken from a twilight zone episode series takes the audience on a flashback and present, father/son adventure of almost magical but bumpy story (it's almost as if there were several directors changing the style and appearance of the movie).<br/><br/>The fascinating ending destination, the tie-ins, turn arounds are cute and heart-felt, but it seems that the whole story was destined to conclude this way (but the last tale told is from the heart and burns into memory an important relational message). The movie never quite reaches the pinnacle of surrealistic, Twilight Zone, Rod Serling brilliance, never quite completely satisfies with its erratic editing and slightly off-beat cinematography.<br/><br/>However, this movie does deserve an honorary mention for its almost Independent film imagery and its innovative and creative weaving tapestry with a few missed strands and threads of the needle."

","I remember back when this movie first came out and I mostly forgot about it after awhile. I love this movie because it reminded me so much of ""Forrest Gump"". Both are movies that feature a guy telling his life story, about how he fell in love and got the girl he wanted, how he fought in a war, and the strange ways he affected other people's lives. Like ""Forrest Gump"", the audiences like it more than the critics. I thought the title would be a metaphor for something. Instead, there really is a big fish featured in this movie!<br/><br/>I didn't even recognize Ewan McGregor. He really is quite prolific. We get to see small bits from a lot of talented actors like Danny DeVito and Steve Buscemi. Why is Steve Buscemi in everything I've been watching lately? The setup is that a dying man is telling his son the story of his life. His son tries to figure out how much of his story is true.<br/><br/>What's interesting is that most of the people he talks about meeting do in fact appear in the movie at the end. We do, however, still get no confirmation of the supernatural stuff he mentioned, like trees coming to life. I watched this because it's the favorite movie of Nostalgia Critic cast member, Tamara Chambers! This is probably my favorite Tim Burton movie.

"Horror-yo","9","0","1","4 June 2016"," Poetic, helluva lot of fun, and whole
","Another brilliant Tim Burton. The story taken from a novel, and it feels like it as we're plunged through a series of wild adventures, each one pleasantly whole and meaningful and always entertaining; and while all the action is supplied during the tale-telling, another story is being told in the actual original time and setting. Like the current and anecdotal timeframes are feeding off each other to build up the momentum for a grand ending. The film is dense with a lot of elements and pans out smoothly. Not once does it feel like there's too much or that it has too many participants. The moral is very original and not apprehended, it offers quite a lot to be discussed - the ending very touching as it is the culmination of the crescendo built progressively and patiently through the entire 2hrs+. The acting is consistently very good, and Billy Crudup does a very good job playing the jaded yet still attentive son. Overall the crux of the story, a man bored with reality constantly looking to thrill it up, is one that is very weighty with realism and implications, and this is a superbly executed version of that concept. Great cinematography, great fun; just one of these films that is quite perfect at what it sets out to do. Excellent."

","Big Fish (2003): Dir: Tim Burton / Cast: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Alison Lohman, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange: Magical film about tall tales on the brink of truth. It regards a son's desire to know who his father is but is always met with bizarre stories claimed as fact. Billy Crudup is now married and receives a message that his father is dying of cancer. He is familiar with the story regarding his father catching an unusually large catfish using his wedding ring as bait on the day his son was born. Plot is divided into a series of adventures told by Albert Finney that involve giants, deformed Japanese twins, a small hidden town, and the woman he reeled in with a field of daffodils and married. Another visual feast by Tim Burton whose resume includes such imaginative joys as Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. Great performance by Finney as storyteller, and Ewan McGregor as his younger self envisioned within the adventure. Alison Lohan plays the woman he's destined to marry. Crudup is placed among viewers wondering what is true but the ending gives an interesting answer. Jessica Lange plays Finney's wife who must deal with the stories and delusions. In the tradition of bedtime stories, this film captures the imagination unlike any other Burton spectacle. Theme juggles fact and fiction and reality and fantasy within a film with a big heart and bigger ideas. Score: 9 / 10"

In this period however, I missed this film. I only watched it a couple months ago. And that is something I deeply regret.<br/><br/>From the moment the film started I just couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. The plot intrigued and the acting blew my mind. I loved Ewan McGregor in the film and he is now one of my favourite actors. The dialogue was funny at times and it was smart and witty. The visual effects were amazing and the film looked so beautiful. I love the plot, it is different and interesting. I preferred the past scenes more and would have liked to see more of it. The characters were great and amusing. My favourite would be Steve Buscemi's. The ending was great and I loved seeing the fact from fiction.

Then he and his wife go to the hospital where his father is staying. Will is going to find the fact related to Edward's talks, and realizes something new. I don't tell the ending, but probably, it was my first time to see this kind of movie. I don't know how to explain, but it might be fantasy and something. It is interesting to watch, because two types of stories such as real one and imaginary one are in it. What I was surprised is the title ""Big fish"". Of course, there are some scenes related to fish. But it has different meaning, which is big talk. When I know the exaggeration talk is as same meaning as fish talk, I thought how things are going well.

"jessaharper22","5","0","2","3 February 2015"," This film is pretty alright.
","Although this film had an interesting and creative plot line, I felt that some aspects f the film weren't that enjoyable. First off, Tim Burton usually puts out pretty off the charts creative/weird films, and I just didn't get that pizazz feeling that usually comes along with his work, from this particular movie. One really big reason that I didn't enjoy Big Fish as much as I thought I was going to, is the fact that in some parts it really dragged on quite a bit. Especially when he first comes to the town of Spectre. It was interesting for a little while but I felt like they spent to much time focusing on his time there. Another prevalent problem I had with Big Fish, was that it was just kind of confusing. If you think about the film in a whole, then it really isn't confusing. But when you get into the more detailed aspects of it, it is actually really confusing. Like what was the deal with the town of Spectre? How was the young girl from Spectre the witch from Ed's childhood? I, personally, was left with a copious amount of questions. One aspect of the film that I actually enjoyed, were the stories/flashbacks as a whole. Even though some parts dragged on, the stories were very interesting, I thought. And I liked how everything he was talking about in the stories, were all somehow connected. (Like how the circus connected to him meeting his wife, etc.) I thought it was better than if they had just depicted random memories/stories, which they easily could have done. So, all in all I thought that it was a relatively decent movie. It wasn't perfect, and some of the details were a little iffy for me, but I think that it was a great film as a whole."

It has great characters and a nice message about storytelling. Also the score by Danny Elfman is always a plus. Also the story has some very comedic moments but also touching and emotional moments as well. The story is probably the best aspect of the movie.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. There were a few characters in the movie that felt like they were just there to make a certain plot point of the movie happen and nothing else. Also at times the different stories seemed a little out of place at times and didn't fit with the tone of the movie. I also didn't understand why the movie was called ""Big Fish"" when the fish didn't seem to have much relevance in the story. There were also certain scenes and plot points that were either unnecessary or they just kinda forgot about in the movie. But all together, there is more good then bad in this movie.

Although the background is father's lethal illness, there are lot of nice and funny moments, and the mood of the ending becomes different than the circumstances otherwise expect. <br/><br/>And the cast, quite a dream-team: Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Marion Cotillard, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny DeVito, Steve Buscemi...

It depicts a story that reconnects a parting relationships, and experiences that inspire. The tone is light and easily manages to pull the audience in, without the usual cheesy elements. The film starts and ends with a big fish, and in between are uncountable stories that are intriguingly touching and inspirational.<br/><br/>There are no easy words to describe such a vivid experience that can only be experienced first-hand through directly viewing the bittersweet journey of a man's life and the underlying reflections."

","I don't think I ever had a movie I really wanted to see and than desperately hoped for the end to come soon like with ""Big Fish"". Not only did I get very bored halfway through but also very frustrated. It does have very nice ideas and I really liked the example of a father telling people stories. It is something I love to do. The problem however is that the father puts himself as the big hero making him sound cocky and arrogant. I think good storytellers should be modest. That is of course only my opinion. The second big problem were the stories itself. They were nice enough to sparkle an interest but they were leading nowhere which was the frustrating part. Most characters in the stories are not really worked out well in depth, meaning I didn't't really care for them. By the end I didn't really care if the father told the truth or not. I was hoping for some movie with a nice fantasy theme but I got some artsy bundle of clichés. I like Tim Buton's movies but not this one."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","0","2","17 April 2010"," Sweet, imaginative and moving
","I will admit I like Tim Burton, and have enjoyed a vast majority of his films, Edward Scissorhands, Beetle Juice, Batman and Ed Wood. Big Fish is I think one of Burton's better movies in my personal opinion, maybe not his very best, but it is a very sweet, imaginative and moving film. Here Burton delves into familiar territory, a strange place between reality and fantasy, dream and nightmare. The story is really sweet, and while slow at times, does have a poignant ending. The visuals as pretty much always in a Tim Burton film are gorgeous, not Gothic here like in Sleepy Hollow and Edward Scissorhands but evergreen and picturesque. The scenery was beautiful and so was the cinematography, and Danny Elfman's score is stunning. His score for Edward Scissorhands blew me away, but the lyrical, sensitive and hypnotic themes used here make it a score that is truly special. The screenplay is well crafted, and has a bittersweet feel to it. Sentimental yes, but also bittersweet. The acting is remarkably good, with Ewan McGregor making for a handsome yet somewhat charming young Edward Bloom, and the wonderful Albert Finney a revelation as his older self. Billy Crudup is excellent as the son who is intent on exposing his father, and sets out to learn the truth, and Danny DeVito is great as the shape-changing circus ringmaster. Jessica Lange is beautiful and alluring as Sandra and Helena Bonham Carter is almost unrecognisable as the Witch. Then there is Alison Lohman, Marion Cottilard, Robert Guillaume and Matthew McGory(as Karl the Giant) and they are very good as well. Overall, I loved this film, it is moving and very imaginative. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox"

","Actually I saw the movie in like 10 parts taking breaks over a month or so. Well I can't refrain from saying that the movie has a brilliant and fictional plot, quiet a work of imagination but was not able to hold me in a place for more time. The movie is about a father and a son where the father Ed bloom (Evan Mcgregor/Albert Finney) is in a critical condition on the verge of dying. Ed has cancer and is dying of it while his son hasn't spoken to him in years because he thinks of him as a total liar who never really cared for his family. But as Ed again unfolds the story of his life Will (son) tries to learn more about his father through the stories and myths which he used to tell about himself, he never actually believed it to be true but at the end discovers that not most of it was a lie.<br/><br/>The movie contains a lot of characters and number of fragments of story put together by a man called Ed bloom (Evan Mcgregor/Albert Finney) who used to narrate it. He used to narrate it by such a heart that eventually he believed it as his own, in reality the whole story which he used tell was not a fact but a little fabricated. His only son Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) never could trust his stories and always stood apart from him, father and son had a mutual distress throughout the movie. There are a sequence of stories narrated by Ed bloom that how he leaves his small village and goes out to explore the world.<br/><br/>Well the movie is kind of fine, perfect level of drama a little bit of action and comedy thus the makers tried to make it perfect for viewing so I rate it a 6 out of 10. Worth a watch once cause the plot is different script is needs a little bit of work though. I think Evan McGregor was quiet excellent in the movie. So Big Fish is a fairy tale of life"
"kenjha","8","0","1","3 April 2009"," A Good Catch
","A dying man reflects on his life and all the great adventures he has experienced - or is he telling tall tales? Although somewhat disjointed and not completely satisfying, this unique film is quite charming. Finney is the old man and McGregor plays him in his younger days as a dashing hero. Both turn in capable performances, helped by a good supporting cast that includes a host of familiar faces, including Crudup as Finney's son, Lange as his wife, and DeVito as a circus performer. It's funny to see Devito tower over the even more diminutive Deep Roy. This is perhaps Burton's best film, as he perfectly captures the whimsy and playfulness of the story."

","Big Fish certainly remains as one of the greatest adventure movies ever told. Tim Burton again directs a inferring classic as we separate fact from fiction, father from son, mystery to myth - Big Fish hails us on an adventure as big as life itself. It's a real feel good movie in some cases, but you also witness a very powerful, emotional and grueling tough side. Big Fish redefines the genre ""Adventure"" which in some cases was nearly dead a couple of years back. It sort of reminds me of Forrest Gump, they're certain similarities found in this movie, so Forrest Gump fans, give it a watch! There is excellent acting, good use of effects and a overall classic movie for the whole family to enjoy."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","7","0","2","8 September 2008"," Could have done more
","Tim Burton is such a predictable director of films that even when, on the surface, he seems to be stretching himself, he's actually merely distorting art towards his own relentlessly immature aesthetic. In a sense he's the dark filmic counterpoint to Steven Spielberg's gauzey light pabulum. Neither has a fundamental grasp of what it is to be human, nor the essence of a good tale. Quirkiness does not equal interesting. If you doubt that you must find Tourette's sufferers fascinating rather than annoying.<br/><br/>Big Fish is TB's attempt to do 'adult' drama, yet it so desperately tries to rip off the best in other films- even less successful ones like Forrest Gump, a tale similarly set in Alabama. Along with that film's everyman-ness Big Fish tries to channel the warmth of My Dog Skip, the father-son dynamic of October Sky, & the rites of passage feel of Stand By Me. While it does not succeed as well as the aforementioned trio this is a good movie. Yet, dammit, with another director this could have been a great movie, certainly a lot better than Burton's previous bests- the flawed but interesting Ed Wood and Planet Of The Apes. Instead, it's maybe just a little better. It's like when you see the goddess of your dreams but she turns out to be an Anti-Semite, smoker, or lesbian.<br/><br/>Let me remove myself from despair & give you the capsule tale: an old talespinner- Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying and his son, Will (Billy Crudup), wants to know the reality behind the stories that so charm everyone else- including Ed's wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) and Will's wife Josephine (Marion Cotillard). The last few days of Ed's life give way to flashbacks and fantasies. The young Ed (Ewan McGregor) has all sorts of adventures: he meets a giant named Karl (Matthew McGrory), discovers a Utopian town called Spectre, befriends a witch, catches an elusive legendary big fish, and joins a circus run by a werewolf named Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito). He joins the circus to get information on the girl of his dreams- the young Sandra (Alison Lohman) who's engaged to his childhood nemesis. Later, he becomes a military spy and rescues a pair of gorgeous Chinese Siamese twins named Ping and Jing from the Red Army. Still, this is overall a good film- there is a wonderful sequence where young Ed 1st sees Sandra and time stops. He walks through hoops and juggler's balls fall to the ground as he walks by. This is a great sequence because it does simulate that feeling, but we've seen the time-stop before. What makes the scene a winner is that, to compensate for that momentary sensation, time has to speed up. Doing so causes Ed his opportunity to meet and woo Sandra for a few years.<br/><br/>This is truly unique, but- alack- the only instance of using fantasy to serve a narrative purpose, and not just be 'ooh-ah' fantastical! That TB only does this once in the film confirms it was a happy accident, not an understood exercise of filmic control. Still, the acting of Finney and McGregor is superb, as are the other supporting performances."

","Every once in a good while, the impact of a particular entertainment format is wholly contingent upon the emotional tapestry the viewer/listener brings to it.<br/><br/>This is a classic example.<br/><br/>In one of the most un-Burtoneque projects to come from Tim Burton, ""Big Fish"" is a mesmerizing fairy tale wonderfully reminiscent of the underrated ""Edward Scissorhands"" more than a decade ago. Depending upon where you are emotionally, this can be not only a satisfying viewing experience but an equally thought-provoking one that, chances are, will leave an indelible impression.<br/><br/>This time around Tim Burton abandons his usually dark fare for the southern tall tale. He brilliantly brings to realization this regional cultural phenomenon with aplomb and moreover, with no condescension whatsoever for a very important art form. As a southerner, I was quite pleased with the respect granted to an age-old southern tradition that shows us the consequences of not being able to see the forest for the trees.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the story follows a son's last attempts to discover who his father really is as the son insists that during his upbringing, his father has hidden his true self behind his tall tales. The son and the father have their final confrontation on the father's deathbed and it is here the son finally realizes the time he has wasted because of his ""inability to see for looking."" Albert Finney is simply captivating. I have never seen him in a southern role and he was just wonderful as were the supporting cast. While the brooding son, Billy Crudup, was most effective, this was indeed Finney's moment and proved to be a fitting vehicle for his remarkable talents. Ewan McGregor personifies charm as the young Edward Bloom.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful dissertation on the intricate, intimate, and often complex father-son relationship. It is also a wonderful movie for families to share together.<br/><br/>Visually, Burton put his stamp on it as he helped to realize Edward Bloom's (Finney) tall tales as the special effects were dazzling and wonderful in helping the audience to see very well the kind of man Edward Bloom was. While the end of the movie was somewhat melancholy, it was right on target and did not descend into maudlin sentimentality - it proved to be the natural order of events.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this as you will enjoy viewing this one over and over again. I have never been more pleased with a DVD purchase than I have with this one and suspect already as I write this review that it is steadily becoming one of my all time favorites, not only for its entertainment value but more so because of the valuable insight it provided into my own situation."

The main plot is a series of flashbacks told by an old dying man, Ed Bloom, telling his son fantasy stories of his life that couldn't possibly have happened. His son, Will finds his dad to be crazy, but he tries to come to terms with him. The flashback story is very odd, including a poet turned bank robber, a giant, a town where nobody ever leaves, a witch that can tell you your death and even a circus master werewolf.<br/><br/>This entire movie you know how it will end, and it does end how you think it will. The end is sad and touching, just like the entire movie. Without a doubt this movie is Burton's lightest project and I suggest you carry a box of tissues with you when you watch it.<br/><br/>my rating: 4 1/2 out of 5 stars.

"stoned_bunnies","7","0","1","10 June 2006"," Beautiful but too corny at times.
","""Big Fish"", as most people know, is a Tim Burton film. Tim Burton proved himself a great director with movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the recent ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". So when I sat down to watch ""Big Fish"", I expected magical and enchanting characters to float out of my screen and set my imagination off to a different planet. But it seriously disappointed me and here's why.<br/><br/>The movie is about William Bloom (Billy Crudup), a married man with a baby on the way, who finds out that his father, Edward (Albert Finney), is dying. He returns home to see him as he feels very distant from his father and wants to reconnect with him before he dies. The reason he is so distant from his father is because his dad is always telling exaggerated stories of his magical past and William doesn't appreciate the fact that his dad can't be normal and serious like everyone else. (I know, what an idiot.) Most of the movie shows us Edward Bloom's wonderful tales, with Ewan McGregor acting as young Edward (with a Southern accent!). So the story is basically about William Bloom trying to decode his father's complicated past. What he's really trying to do though, subconsciously, is to prove his father wrong about his ""made-up"" past, so that he can rightfully accuse his father of being a liar since everything he ever said was just triggered by his wild imagination.<br/><br/>So that's my first negative point. I hated the concept of getting all teary-eyed over a guy who can't connect with his dad. Alright, so it's nice to have an old man tell stories of his past but why add on tasteless, corny sequences of sons and fathers fighting and not talking for three years and then meeting in a hospital as the father is dying and etc., etc.!? WHY RUIN SUCH A (potentially) WONDERFUL MOVIE? The magical characters of Edward Bloom's stories were all amazing, though. Danny Devito played an eccentric circus owner while they got a real-life giant man to play the Giant in the movie. Also, Danny Elfman was great with the music as usual and Burton did an *ASTOUNDING* job with the visual effects. The only thing that TOTALLY ruined the movie for me was the corny Hollywood plot. But two thumbs up, to quote my fellow reviewers Siskel & Ebert, for everything else, especially the casting."

","I don't think I've ever watched a film that celebrates life that much. The tiny things of everyday life become truly heroic. It's reality within reality. I don't know which should be contained in inverted commas. It's Edward's reality that makes *reality* shine. That film surely made time stop for me!<br/><br/>Cast and filming were unpredictably well matched, like the people who are involved in our lives at certain times, all seem to somehow fit. Ordinary people who bring extraordinary dynamics, changing our life to the better.<br/><br/>The film is packed with metaphors and gives lots of food for thought. It's filled with optimism and subtly though consistently, presents the brighter side of life."

","Moving, funny, easy, wonderful movie from Tim Burton's genius. A fantastic tale where the real protagonists are the power of narration, of fantasy and of imagination. Relationship between father and son, difficult and lacking in comprehension one to each other in the beginning, explodes in the end of the movie in one the most moving and touching scene in cinematography. A real statement of love for life, that actually permeates the whole movie. An excellent cast and a great photography (in some scene reminds me of Edward Scissorhands bright colours) makes this movie one of my favourite of all time and for sure the best in Burton's production."

It really captures both Daniel Wallaces and Tim Burton's wonderful imagination is this outstanding tale. If you have never have the pleasure of seeing this film, do so. I loved this movie, and have yet to find one that has been better. And i don't expect Tim Burton to do anymore wonderful than he has done with this film, which is one of the best movies i think, EVER MADE.

","Movies come. Movies go. They entertain. They make 1.7 million in the box office. They go to video. And eventually, if they're good, they make it onto TBS 3 or 4 times a week. And I'm OK with all that. But once in a while you see a movie that changes your perspective on life. You laugh at scenes without knowing why. You relate to the actors. You love the characters. You cry at the end because you see your goals and your potential life and then you see your funeral.<br/><br/>Apart from being a hands-down stunning work of filmography (Burton fails not), Big Fish provides a well-drawn sweep of entertainment that is a breath of fresh air. There is nothing predictable about it. It keeps you on your toes and smiling. From shoes hanging on a wire in Spectre to Al Finney's mailman joke (Oh I was dying!), Big Fish takes you on a soul-searcher of an adventure. Along the way, you get some great life advice, like concerning Ed Bloom's fidelity to his wife, as per Jenny. This movie is what I see as the pinnacle of modern art. It is also one of the few books-turned-film where the artistic and life value of the movie supersedes that of the book. I could go on for a really long time (ask my friends) about the splendor of a film that is Big Fish, but just go find out for yourself. Watch. Enjoy. Repeat."
"leviot","9","0","3","18 April 2006"," Brilliant movie, if you're deep enough to 'get it'
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS AFTER THE FIRST TWO PARAGRAPHS<br/><br/>This is an absolutely brilliant thought-provoking movie. It's unique and original and very thoughtful. It's about how people view their lives and the accomplishments they made therein. The basic storyline is about a father who keeps on telling tall tales about his past, which frustrates his son, who wants to hear the truth about his father.<br/><br/>This is really one of those movies you're either gonna love or you're gonna hate. People walk out of this one either thinking ""Wow! that was brilliant, I gotta watch it again"" or going ""What the @#$%! was that all about!"".<br/><br/>It's got a similar theme as 'Secondhand Lions', about a man nearing death trying to make sense of his life. The only way he finds comfort in his past is to fabricate all these tall tales that make it sound like he had this heroic and glorious past, while in reality he led a pretty average life. But to the father it doesn't matter whether the stories are false or slightly exaggerated, because often in life it's not really about what is true or not, it's more what we feel or believe in any particular situation. So even if he hadn't done all those heroic things, he feels that he would've done them given the chance, or thats what he really wanted to do.<br/><br/>The son, however, doesn't understand that. He wants to communicate with his real father, not with some seemingly illusionary superhero. Yet what he fails to understand is that that superhero character is his dad, because that's the way he chose to live and view his own life. Only towards the end does the son begin to understand and accept that, after the doctor at the hospital so poignantly remarks ""I don't know about you, but I kinda liked your father's version of the story better"".<br/><br/>Aside from all that the movie's got some great lines, and the fantasy-land world created in the movie is a great mix of the real and the surreal. I didn't like the real slow pace of the film, but hey, I guess that's to be expected from a movie of this caliber."
"Spuzzlightyear","9","0","1","15 April 2006"," Love Thy Father
","The importance of story-telling is explored in 'Big Fish', a movie you have to keep an open mind for, to truly appreciate it's richness. When Will Bloom comes to see his dying father, he tries to get answers, and not just these hackneyed stories that his father loves to tell. The problem is of course, that Will refuses to keep an open mind to interpret these stories, as Edward's wife knows all to well, and Will's wife quickly learns as well. This is quite a tricky story to pull off, but the word 'tricky' must make lightbulbs pop in Tim Burton's head, because I have to hand it to the guy how clever this movie is. Burton cleverly shifts from present day Edward Bloom (played by Albert Finney) to the past Bloom (played with a great full-on accent by Ewan Mcgregor). During the movie, we meet a whole PILE of characters from Edward's life, all of which are highly interesting. The most interesting to me were Steve Buscemi's (no surprise there) Norther Winslow, and the Siamese Asian singing combo (!!) played by Arlene and Ada Tai. You may other favorites. There are also different stories, some of which you'll like (I liked the first visit to Spectre and the encounter with the witch (played by Helena Bonham-Carter) and some you won't (Mine? The second visit to Spectre and his visit to a girl in the town (again played by Helena Bonham-Carter). This is what I love about movies about this, there's all sorts of stories that you can attach to, and you can discuss of what you like and don't like."

","(This review may contain spoilers, i do not intend to ruin anything, but for your own sake watch the film first before reading this comment)<br/><br/>Big Fish is just one of those films which can be a dilemma to a critic, as there is so much to talk about and so little to criticize.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's film is an adaptation of a novel of the same name, and the same basic story. As a fan of the book i was a little worried about the concept of a silver screen version...i was very wrong.<br/><br/>The book was labeled as something which would never make its way into cinema simply because it wasn't written to suit a director. Whoever said this must have forgotten Tim Burton. He turned all of those mini-stories and mini-characters into something which watches like poetry (if you take my meaning).<br/><br/>Because that's what the Big Fish tale essentially is: poetry. I mean the story itself is about stories; a father's stories to his son. Tim Burton captured the deep love shared and closer-to-surface tension between father and son brilliantly, never falling once in his streamlined interpretation of the delicate relationship between grown father and growing son.<br/><br/>Not to mention, Danny Elfman's orchestrating is brilliant. He got himself an academy award nomination for his brilliance in Big Fish, and he well deserved it. The pieces that he has created for this film are just beautiful. They fully capture the emotion and sheer...poetry portrayed in the film. Danny Elfman is never always one for subtlety, however in this piece of work he has mastered the art with splendor. The soundtrack is just beautifully poetic, matching perfectly with the delight Tim Burton has created.<br/><br/>Also, Tim Burton has managed to create such a...fantastical world, and yet we take it seriously. Moving trees, werewolves, witches, giants, mermaids, larger-than-life characters...all of these are present in the film, and yet none of them seem ridiculous once shown through Burton's magical style.<br/><br/>Big Fish is a film of magic and splendor; of love and temporary loss; of the past and the present; of father and son.<br/><br/>Big Fish is poetry. However it is seen and heard, not read.<br/><br/>-Davismo"

","This is a movie that will truly make you believe in fairy tales. When I think about movies that really truly affected me in some way, Big Fish is definitely one of those movies. I believe it to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. This movie had high morals and a deep story line with dramatic and sometimes unbelievably fantastic turns. The movie tells the tale of a father and son, who is about to become a father himself, the mythology surrounding the father's life, and the reconciliation between fact and fiction. It's not what you would expect from Tim Burton on the surface, but true to form with 'Edward Sissorhands,' Burton's cinematic flair perfectly captures the human condition of life, death, the unimaginable, and the unbelievable in a beautiful piece of art. The scenery in the movie was museum worthy. One sad fact that I believe is that this movie didn't get the publicity it deserved. Not too many people have ever seen this movie, or even heard about it, and that's a shame. I would highly advise if you ever walk by this film in a movie store to turn around and pick it up and watch it.....<br/><br/>You'll love it.."

","I had the advantage of having read the novel before the movie. The book works a little better. Others have talked about the specifics of the movie. I want to talk about the premise of the lie. My father was a liar (often in the most positive sense of the word). My sister and I grew up with so much misinformation, that we have spent the last 30 years after his death trying to rake through the BS. We often heard tales like the ones in the book (not quite as dramatic but creative nevertheless). It was mostly things he had done. That he had accomplished. Why we were so darned poor after all this always confused me. If someone had met all those people and had all those experiences, why hadn't he parlayed them into something incredible. Once we got through it, we realized he wasn't a liar. He was an entertainer. And what he did was to pump life into a world that often doesn't have life. And while we would groan at him and tell him to stop, we would listen as if everything he said was gospel. The Albert Finney character was the same way. To be metaphorically taken away by his fantasies was the greatest gift he could give. The only gift he had. And every one was a harmless, benevolent yarn that would live on after him. There are still times when one of my father's stories pops into my head and I have to regroup and rethink before I realized what a fabrication it was."

","I saw many people talking about this movie and maybe all have been said about it. Tim Burton is one the most beloved directors and yet one of the most despited directors by Academy Awards, and either you like him or not everybody has to agree with me.I'm one of the many fans of Burton and I might be suspicious to talk about this or the others his movies. I guess that whatever he does in the future it can't getter better than this. I firmly believe that this is his best movie, and you can call me fool but I think this movie is underrated.<br/><br/>About the performance of the actors I think they achieved the most difficult thing than an actor can do, touch someone heart. But this doesn't come only from the actors, and shame on me if I say the opposite.<br/><br/>The power of the movie is the powerful harmony between the director, actors, visual effects department, and so on. The true is that most people remembers this movie because Tim Burton directed or Ewan McGregor(don't forget Albert Finney,Helena Bonhan Carter,Alison Lohman,Jessica Lange and Billy Crudup) starred in it but much of the ""heroes"" of this movies are annonymous but praised be their work.<br/><br/>To conclude my own review, this movie for me is one of the best movies ever.

But I walked out of that theatre so completely appolled and disappointed. So many things were different in a bad way. For instance, Jenny Hill did not live in the strange town Edward passed through, and was never a little girl in the story, not once. He didn't leave her home without having an affair with her in the story. The whole story about his time in the war is different. They left out the greatest parts in the story, and instead of making the beautiful proof that his father's tall tales were real at the end, it was a dream in the movie.

","I've never seen a Tim Burton movie that I didn't like (I wasn't too fond of ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", but Burton only produced that). ""Big Fish"" continues this trend. When elderly Alabama resident Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, his estranged son Will (Billy Crudup) has to return home. Ed has spent much of his life telling fanciful tales of his exploits, none of which Will has ever believed. But when Will investigates, he begins to speculate that these stories may have been true after all.<br/><br/>Regardless of whether or not one can believe all these things that Ed is telling people, we grow to respect how the situation is helping the father and son reconnect, and also how Ed and his wife Sandra (Jessica Lange) are trying to rekindle their sexuality. Ewan McGregor is particularly impressive as Ed's younger self, and Danny DeVito is pretty funny as a circus ringmaster with a dark secret. A great movie."

","Fairy Tales come in all shapes and sizes; we had films from Disney about relationships (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Cinderella); Steven Spielberg and his Sci-Fi movies about average people seeing the impossible (Jurassic Park, E.T., and CEO3K); now in Tim Burton's film ""Big Fish,"" the imagination has gone beyond our wildest dreams, where one person stories has made a difference to others.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is a story about a father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup) in which the son doesn't want to have a relation with his father after many of the bologna stories he has heard from time to time about the big fish, a giant, and meeting the love of his life (Jessica Lange).<br/><br/>The character Ed Bloom (Finney) is dying of cancer and his wife has called her only son with his wife to fly from Paris to visit his dying father. As it turns out, the son's wife is going to have a baby, and during the visit, they all want to hear the stories that Bloom has said before.<br/><br/>In the pastime, Ewan McGregor plays the young Ed Bloom for which he was the town's hero; he was a jock, a nerd, an inventor or a renaissance man as you might recall him. Until one day, a giant has stock upon the small town that Ed had lived and it is up to him to defeat the giant where he finds out that the creature himself is harmless. In the story, the older Ed tells stories about a young predicator; a group of townspeople that never changed, how he met his sweetheart by working in a circus, entering the Korean War and getting into business to support his wife and child.<br/><br/>Like Harvey Pekar from ""American Splendor,"" I can also relate to Ed Bloom from ""Big Fish"" where the character Ed was a dreamer and a storyteller who wasn't afraid to share it with the rest of the people around him. I was a storyteller in high school where I would tell stories to all the students about what happened during the early days at the school I attended to the people and the events that changed our lives; I was also a dreamer, but unfortunately, my dreams of getting the girl, getting a standing ovation at graduation or having people thanking me for all I did, didn't come true. I just pray that my final story involves my older brother carrying me, like Ed's son did for Ed, and everybody I knew would just be waving and cheering me on as I go on to turn into a fish myself.<br/><br/>This is by far the most personal and best Tim Burton movie I've ever seen."

Ewan McGregor does a fantastic job in his role as the father in his younger years. If you're a father or a son, you'll get this movie; but really it's a movie for anyone.

"YerYer","9","0","1","23 April 2005"," Why can't we just live in the fabulous fiction
","The movie is just so lovely that I kept a smile on my face when watching it. The father had build up a fantastic world filled with witch, giant, big fish, circus They are interesting and attractive stories but he told these to everyone including himself all the time, and finally became a legend himself. <br/><br/>It is natural that the father told his son about his ""experiences"" in the first place, and he kept doing this year after year. It would bring him great pride if he brought his son into his world, but it seemed not. His son, soon found out that all the stories had been told thousands of times, were actually non-existence. This happened when the little boy grew up, old enough to identify illusion from reality. At the son's wedding, he found his father stood in front of all the guests, again telling his story (the one with the big fish). Feeling so embarrassed and angry, he ran out and shouted to his father, blamed him for had never let him know the true version of his life, for ignoring him years after years even kept talking about himself at his singleton's wedding... After that, he hadnever talked to his father for three years.<br/><br/>Stop from here, I'd like to digress a little bit for another similar plot I remember from Peter Pan. When Peter told Wendy something about fairies, he said: ""When the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies. ...children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, 'I don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead."" There must be many fairies fell and dead in the dad's stories when the son grew up.<br/><br/>It is not that I was unwilling to grow up, and it is not that I pay specific sympathy to the father. Actually, I totally understand the mood that the son wanted to know about his father. I'm just wondering why people always want to dig up the truth, put the more wonderful and interesting way to explain it aside. Even though most of the time they do know the truth is unimportant and plain, or worse, fellness. As well as the doctor said at the end of the movie: ""I like your father's version more."" Maybe that's why people like the father. He kinda has an ability to tell things in a different way, a more acceptable way, eliminate all the banalities.<br/><br/>The most impressive story the father talked about ever is the one with The Beast. At the beginning of the movie, we are told that there some fish that cannot be caught. It's not that they are faster or stronger than other fish; they are just touched by something extra. This just seemed ridiculous when first heard, but alone with the movie moved, it gradually turned out that the big fish was actually stand for the father himself. A man, who was unwilling to tie himself down. But after fell in love at first sight with his wife, he convinced that she was the one he would spend the rest of his life with. Finally he took the wedding wing with no hesitate. And after that, no mater where he reached to, no mater who he met, he never stopped. <br/><br/>Here're some sentences the father concluded after telling each story:<br/><br/>Death is the worst thing that ever happened to me.<br/><br/>Kept in a small pool, the goldfish will remain small.

","Most people think that the acting is a little more important than directing. Well, I love Tim Burton because every time I see one of his movies, he proves other people wrong. Just like Big Fish. Every actor and actress in the movie are wondrous stars. Still, as you will -or did- notice, the acting is not the ""point"" in the movie. The story is so breath taking, so extraordinary, so dreamy that you cannot understand the fact that this unreal tale cannot be true at all.<br/><br/>Even though you can't see the colors Burton has always shown us in his movies, Big Fish's color correction is so precise for its genre, that it lures the audience right into its beauty of shiny, not-so-Burton color. And the editing was well placed during those leaps through past- and right into the dream world of Ed Bloom.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has shown us his mastership at every aspect of making a movie again. His thoughts, ideas and his weird -and full of surprises- dream world continues to create as we watch them amazed by his skill of expressing them. I can see no flaw in this movie, as I never did in any one created by his mind. Long live Tim Burton!!!"

","Yet another fairytale from one of my personal favorite directors. Tim Burton's typical atmosphere and characters make this movie an unique one.<br/><br/>Still I can't help it to be somewhat disappointed. The movie was not quite what I had expected and hoped for. Judging from the trailer I seriously thought this could be my favorite movie of all time, it had all the right ingredients to become so. Maybe I expected a bit too much of an ""Forrest Gump"" in fantasy land.<br/><br/>But really, ""Big Fish"" still is a treat of a movie. The visual look of it is typically Tim Burton style and I absolutely love it. There also was some wonderful humor present which make this movie mainly fun and entertaining to watch even though there also is enough room for some drama.<br/><br/>Thing I really missed in this movie was the presence of Johnny Depp. Burton + Depp is always fireworks and I really think that it could have lifted the movie even more, not that Ewan McGregor is a bad actor of course. Oh well, at least we still get to see Danny DeVito's naked behind instead...Albert Finney really was excellent in this and Billy Crudup also was surprising good.<br/><br/>The characters are probably what makes this movie work. The fairytale like characters and storyline's are truly stimulating for the fantasy.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised with the high rating it receives here, not that it doesn't deserve so but because I felt that not everybody would be able to connect and relate with the weird and unusual visual style and story of the movie. Guess I was wrong and I'm glad so! Apparently ""Big Fish"" is perfectly watchable for a wide range of people<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I won't even attempt to describe the plot of this wonderfully imaginative film. Many here have already done a splendid job of that. Suffice it to say that this story about a man's failing relationship with his father and trying to make the last opportunity before he dies to set things right is a magical adventure and a sweet ride. I even love little touches like seeing familiar set pieces from other Tim Burton films (the town from Edward Scissorhands and the egg cracker, for starters.) Granted. Burton can be a tad weird as a person, but no one can deny (although some people with no sense of whimsy or imagination have tried) that he is a genius of a storyteller, and here he does it better than he ever has before. This is Burton's ""Citizen Kane."" All the elements come together like a river flowing into the ocean of one's imagination. This big fish must be caught and let go for the next lucky viewer. And if you see it and don't like it, I would see a doctor about a personality transplant. Metaphors can be incredible things when employed just right. Tim Burton comes up the right bait and reels us all in, and we're glad to be caught off guard by his fantastic film-making prowess. See it and make it your new favorite film of all time."

","Leave it to Tim Burton to combine an interesting story with a vivid imagination, a heart as big as the sky, and a satisfyingly emotional ending, for his faithful audience.<br/><br/>I have to mention first that when I wrote a 'user comment' for ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning"" that I noted that when Ewan McGregor aged, he's resemble Albert Finney, and here they are playing the younger and older version of the same character. I'm not expecting a parade down Fifth Avenue, I just think it was a good call on my part.<br/><br/>The story is too fantastic and too great to go into now. But very few movies (I can think of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""The Princess Bride"") as three movies which rely on storytelling to tell the story. You don't believe it all but Finney/McGregor do, and who feels like second guessing them? Tim Burton is the ideal director for the material. Its extremely moving and all the actors do wonderful work.

","In a literal culture, metaphor withers. Once in a while it bubbles up to the surface and gives us hope that something can exist free from the stifling demands of logic-bound slave of the tangible and known. A fabulous example of this occurring is Tim Burton's BIG FISH, a simple tale of one man learning that his father's being prone to exaggeration was a way the man honored ordinary greatness. The stark contrast between the hopeful fantasy life of the father and the dull real world of the son are a perfect illustration of the world where people accept the mundane without challenging it, while dismissing the ordinary as boring without ever appreciating it. The film inspires one to follow their own path with an optimism that appears earnest and simple, but is actually profound in its bottomless well of imagination."

Score one for recommendations. Yes, some of the images are bizarre and look goofy taken out of context (as in a trailer). But on DVD, within one week I had watched the film, again with the director's commentary, again with intermittent trivia, and any other way possible. Probably one of my top 15 films of all time. Many scenes and dialog resonated like a handbell choir. Come to think of it, Tim Burton's films are always at least good, and I've liked them before (including Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands). As I get older it seems like I'm more and more jaded and am moved by less and less. But, I connected the dots in this film/story, and wept at the end (while more overtly sentimental movies leave me cold)."
"mr_rupert_G","8","0","1","19 December 2004"," ""Most men, they'll tell you a story straight true. It won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.""
","""Big Fish"" is a hard nut to crack. The genre is a mixture of family drama, comedy and adventure/fairy tale. The story begins during the wedding of Will Bloom, the son of Edward Bloom. Edward Bloom lives to tell stories, wherever he goes, whoever he talks to, he tells a story from his life. Everyone who knows Edward well has heard all his stories at least twice, and when he during Will's wedding reception tells his perhaps greatest story for the millionth time, the story of how he caught the biggest fish in the river, Will has had enough. He says to his father, ""Dad, you're like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny combined... you're just as charming, and just as fake. You tell lies, dad."" Edward leaves the wedding, and the relationship between father and son is severely damaged. A few years pass, without Will and Edward speaking to each other. When Will learns that his father is very sick, he decides to go home to see him for the last time. His goal with this journey is to understand who his father really is.<br/><br/>The last paragraph summarizes the first fifteen minutes of the film. Then the viewer is taken along on a magical journey, as the dying Edward Bloom tells his story. We meet a lot of strange characters and fairy tale creatures, witches, giants, werewolves, and Siamese twins, we visit mysterious and dreamlike places and we get to see the fantastic life of Edward Bloom. As the story is told, Will tries to separate fact from fiction, even though this is very difficult. The story of ""Big Fish"" can resemble the great Norwegian play ""Peer Gynt"" written by Henrik Ibsen. They are both about a man who bends the truth; because stories told straight true can be very boring. The plot is perhaps simple, but very catching and very touching. Since we go through the complete life of a character it never gets tedious. The plot has romance, funny moments and few a crying moments. I shall not revile what happens to Edward Bloom, I can just guarantee it is worth watching. <br/><br/>The character Edward Bloom is one of the greatest movie characters I have ever seen. Even though he never tells the truth, I could not stop cheering him, mainly because he is a good and very charming person. To characterize Edward Bloom, I would like to quote him from the film: ""There comes a point when any reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he made a mistake. The truth is... I was never a reasonable man."" The old Edward Bloom is brought to life by film hero Albert Finney (Murder on the Orient Express), while Ewan ""Trainspotting"" McGregor portrays him in the flashbacks. They are both great, even though Scotsman McGregor sometimes has trouble with Edward's thick Texas dialect. Finney on the other hand, being as experienced as he is, pulls off the dialect without a problem. <br/><br/>Billy Crudup (Almost Famous) stars as Will Bloom, Alison Lohman (Matchstick Men) and Jessica Lange (Tootsie) are the young and old Sandra Tempelton Bloom and Danny DeVito (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest), Helena Bonham Carter (Fight Club) and Steve Buscemi (Fargo) play different characters Edward meets on his journey. They are all very good, but Finney is without a doubt the most impressive of the lot. The scenes with Billy Crudup and Albert Finney are very touching, and young Crudup proves that he is a fine actor. <br/><br/>The actors are really great, but this is Tim Burton's film and masterpiece. The highly creative director of ""Edward Scissorhands"" has been given a script, which only his imagination could bring to life. Previously Burton has mostly made pure adventures, Big Fish has a little more depth, and he proves that he is marvelous director. One can say that the film has two separate stories, Edward's life and the story of the relationship between the dying father and his son. The story of Edward's life is told as flashbacks narrated by either Finney or McGregor, and with this part of the story, Burton shows that he is very imaginative. The camera work is beautiful, and the art director and his/her team have done a fantastic job bringing the fairy tale to the screen. The second story is the father-son-relationship, and even though this is Burton's first shot at the more sentimental scenes, he almost managed to make me cry, which is very unusual for me. A lot of people claim that ""Edward Scissorshands"" is beautifully romantic. That is correct, but compared to some scenes in ""Big Fish"", ""Edward Scissorshands"" is nothing more than a classic fairy tale.<br/><br/>I believe I know what Burton wants to say in the film; some people are story tellers. They don't wish to lie; they just tell what they imagined happened. No story is completely true; everyone has his/her unique view of the world. This we see very clear, once Will begins to understand who his father is, and what his father really experienced. On the other hand, ""Big Fish"" is also Burton's tribute to the classic fairy tales. Edward meets a witch, a giant, a werewolf, he walks through a wicked forest, and he spends parts of his life searching for the big fish in river. Even though Burton has modernized everything, the classic elements of storytelling are very important parts of the film, and it works.<br/><br/>""Big Fish"" is now one of my favorite films. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney have together with Tim Burton created one of cinemas' finest characters. Watch ""Big Fish"", listen to Edward Bloom's many stories, and get one of the best film experiences of your life. See ""an adventure as big as life itself."""
"mullermike","9","0","1","12 December 2004"," Surreal movie but very touching
","I watched this movie with a good friend recently, and I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of it. I've been a big fan of Tim Burton's eccentric films (Ed Wood, Mars Attacks), as well as his atmospheric ones (Sleepy Hollow). This one had the feel and look of a movie that was made 30 years ago, though the whole movie had a surreal and dreamy feel to it. The storyline is simple, with a young man (Billy Crudup) trying to get to know his father (Albert Finney), a man with some wild stories, as he lies on his death bed. Of course, that wouldn't do the movie justice, as the quality of film-making is very Burtonesque, so it's hard to pigeonhole. <br/><br/>The main thing I want to say about this film is that Ewen McCregor is one heck of an actor. He plays the young Ed Bloom, a gifted, smart, fearless, man with a heart of gold, flawlessly. The adventures of this young man are so poignant and well articulated, I can't Burton didn't get more acclaim for this flick. Albert Finney is remarkable in this role and I'm really surprised he didn't noticed for his work. I'd probably give this film a 9 out of 10, as it did leave me a little bit confused at times. However, I was speechless for about the last 30 minutes, as the movie really comes to a head and grips you. I would recommend this movie to people that like touching movies with an extrinsic feel to them."

Sure, not all of the stories were complete lies, and I realize that, but I feel the movie was asking me for more than I could give it to succeed. <br/><br/>The appearance of the film and characters within it are truly great to watch, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's witch character. The environments and landscapes are filmed with precision and masterful technique. The overall cast is great, although MacGregor has trouble with his Southern accent.

","This Movie is by all definitions a work of surrealism. I love the giant fish ,I love the giant man,the Daffodills and the circus.<br/><br/>The culture and accents of the deep south are charming and spirited,I usually love an honest and brave protagonist that takes on an adventure and takes us all with him. There is not one actor's performance in this film that doe'st fit into the overall feel.This is the kind of movie that one would understandably want to watch once a year for the rest of your life. I do consider it to be surrealism however, I don't mean Salvidor Dali's surrealism , it is very beautiful and magical in it's own right . Burton uses quite a few animal symbolisms ,such as when Danny Divito's character turns into a black wolf and then we hear through the commentary;""I figured that evil is put forth by loneliness and all it really needs is social kindness to be remedied""-I can't quote it exactly-however, we are enlightened when the black wolf becomes playful. I love the creation of the little town called Spectre.And the silly dead pianism of the character by Steve Buscemi as the Poet/bank robber .<br/><br/>The key grip in this film was probably very hard to do and it was done very well-such as the fact that Helena Bonham Carter's character is not only the witch but the little girl Jenny from Spectre all grown up,It is comprehensible ,and covers the span of the protagonist's life time.<br/><br/>Anyone who has the taste for this kind of fairy tale meets mythology will be moved by it's ending,I certainly was,it made me think about my relationship with my own father and his mortality and even my own mortality.Ewan McGreggor is absolutely perfect as the young Edward Bloom,a die hard southern romantic. As for Tim Burton,I'm not sure if he actually wrote this,but it is truly a masterpiece.It's nice to see Burton not wasting his talent on remaking Plant of the Apes etc...(he should stick always to bringing us something new.)<br/><br/>I just wanted to mention one more thing,this is the last movie that Spaulding Gray ever saw in his life.He brought his kids to go see it and said goodbye to them before drowning himself in the East river last winter.I mention this because,If you see this film and YOU GET IT,you will understand that Spauding Gray actually gave his children a great gift to remember him by."

","Will Bloom (Billy Crudup) always wished for his father Edward Bloom (in younger days Ewan McGregor and in older Albert Finney) to tell the truth. While Will grew up, he was always embarrassed of his father's imaginative stories he would use to entertain Will's friends, even though his father would claim they were true. That was why Will decided not to speak to his father for many years. The movie goes through Edward Bloom's life in flashbacks from the view of his death through a witch's glass eye when he was ten to his last days on Earth. As Will is about to have a child of his own, his father is put on his death bed. Will pleads with his father to tell one tiny truth, but it only makes Will angrier when his father argues with him. On the day of his father's funeral, he looks around and starts to notice all of the characters in his father's story. <br/><br/>Tim Burton's movie Big Fish is the best example of using your imagination. It is actually a book by Daniel Wallace, also entitled with the same name as the movie. As I watched the film, it seemed as though Edward was just trying to make his life more interesting than what it really was. His stories were in fact true, except he had exaggerated the small details to make a bigger and better story. Tim Burton did a great job on casting Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange (as Will's mom and Edward's wife) and everyone else that even appeared in the movie for a short time. I couldn't imagine anyone else to play the character roles as good as they did. They were perfect for each part. Big Fish never had a slow part in it. It just played out connecting every piece of Edward's life together. The storyline is far-fetched with a fifteen foot tall giant who ate sheep and cows, a town no one knew about, and with singing Vietnamese Siamese twins. Just off-the-wall settings and characters like those make the movie. I was infatuated with Big Fish and appalled when it ended."

I really had no intention to rent especially that movie. It just came to me, and in the end it didn't went out as a bad choice.<br/><br/>The story starts a little bit boring, but after 10 minutes i just kept on viewing it. The first blue underwater screens seemed a bit mystical but provided a deep doing. The jumps between being a young man, a man having no perspective and a man with a women and a son are really interesting. They try to show the viewer from how many different perspectives a human can look at events and how these perspectives change during the process of getting older.<br/><br/>Atfer some time the viewer feels like the son of Edward, seeing no reason in his acting and his story telling. All the time i thought it's a drama in the end and an adventure movie in the former time. I was completely wrong. When the son of Edward is experiencing the truth in his fathers<br/><br/>story's, i did as well. I just went to a new perspective on them. I saw a reason, a reason for all what he told his son.<br/><br/>The time line with the death of Edward in the hospital was chosen _perfect_. His son just starts telling a story to his father. A story in which actors he didn't believe. A story unbelievable for him, just telling it to his father cause he wants to hear a story bout his end. On the funeral several people his father described met up. We can't see any action in his face.

It feels as though Burton compromised his vision to accomplish something that was forced upon him by the studio. That's right. Forced. Nothing flowed in this movie, everything felt awkward and unnatural. The movie's only saving grace was the acting of Helena Bonham Carter and Albert Finney.

","Some people are big fish in a small pond, their own world of family and friends. Some people tell 'big fish' stories, the 'one that got away' and all that. Both kinds of people are Edward Bloom, the central character in the movie I saw last night, named, you guessed it, Big Fish. Previously, I was hesitant to see it. I knew the basic premise of the story and I thought it might be a bit overly sentimental even if the director was Tim Burton.<br/><br/>I'd heard it was good. Then I read a review by a good friend of mine, someone who's opinion I value even if I don't always agree with it. He gave the movie top marks and though didn't give much of the plot away, reminded me that Tim Burton has never made a conventionally sentimental movie in his life, to my knowledge. I had an email from a woman I have known since school and we made plans to see it since she hadn't seen it yet either. When we left the theatre last night, we were both very moved by the words spoken by the narrator at the ending but she did comment that she wasn't sure if she loved the movie, or hated it. I said, wait awhile, I think it needs to sink in.<br/><br/>I was right.<br/><br/>The movie is about Edward Bloom, now dying of cancer, and the efforts of his son who is trying to reconcile the man he doesn't seem to know very well with the man he wants his father to be. Edward Bloom tells stories. He tells exaggerated stories and spins fantastical, hardly believable tales about things that happened to him in his life. His son, William, is about to become a father himself and has been estranged from his dad for several years, embarrassed and frustrated by his father's stories, or, 'lies' as he sees them. His father was away a lot while his son was growing up which further aggravated the resentment William has always felt.<br/><br/>The stories are told in flashback, with Ewan MacGregor playing the younger Edward Bloom, played in the present by the wonderful Albert Finney. Jessica Lange plays the love of Edward's life, Sandra and Marion Cotillard plays Josephine, William's wife who provides a buffer between them, guiding William to his discoveries of his father's life and personality. All the actors they cast to play various younger versions of the adult characters look eerily like their grownup parts, I found, which made for great continuity.<br/><br/>It ended much as I expected but I won't spoil it, a fine mix of fantasy and truth. The flashbacks, the tall tales and characters that inhabit them, are wonderfully quirky. The scene that had me dangerously close to being unable to stop giggling involved two Chinese soldiers and a pair of night goggles. The love between Edward and Sandra was touching, evident even as Edward's life was ending. I imagine that William's childhood was further affected by the devotion between his parents that might have shut him out a bit.<br/><br/>The ending had us both in tears and if you have a father or relative that loves to tell stories, stories which become family legend, you will understand. The movie is classic Tim Burton who saves it from being overly sentimental with his off center sense of humour and classic Tim touches of the macabre at times. Is it weird? Sometimes, but you will enjoy it. Just sit back and let it carry you away and enjoy the ride."

","Tim Burton weaves a present story with a narrated past story, which interweaves truth and fiction. The past thread is involving and entertaining. At least four narrators will have told it by the end. Burton usually succeeds with fantastical stories. His presentation often aggrandized by salient photography; so, here, the high-key lighting is nostalgia of old movies. Ewan McGregor masters the lead--threading the nostalgia, offbeat humor and aging, as he must relate somewhat to the Ed Bloom in the present thread. Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Danny DeVito and Alison Lohman help. Alberty Finney and Billy Crudup don't, though. Yet, Burton is who completely fails to make the present story interesting in any way. Even the low-key lighting is boring. It's like a TV-movie sort of reality. The inevitable reconciliation wasn't worth my time, only the past narrative was."

His son (Billy Crudup) believes very little, but just maybe there's more truth in these stores that he or we originally thought - and, in any event, sometimes the embellished truth is what what makes life more colourful and fun. Tim Burton (""Edward Scissorhands"" & ""Batman"") is the perfect director for such an entertaining, even enchanting, world of the strange and the surreal, but I'm never comfortable with British actors as familiar as McGregor, Finney and Helena Bonham Carter adopting American accents and the conclusion is oddly down-beat."
"divaclv","Null","0","1","1 August 2004"," A good yarn
","There are only a few directors who could make a movie like ""Big Fish"" and make it work.  Fortunately, Tim Burton is one of them.  With his penchant for the beautifully grotesque and the grotesquely beautiful, Burton is able to fill the screen with captivating images, while at the same time understanding that there must be something solid beneath all the style.<br/><br/>The film's central character is Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor as the young incarnation, Albert Finney as the elder).  An expert storyteller, Edward is forever spinning tall tales with himself and his associates as the central characters.  Many people, like his wife Sandra (Alison Lohman-young, Jessica Lange-old), indulge his eccentricity, but it rubs his son Will (Billy Crudup) the wrong way.  He's heard all these stories a hundred times; why can't his dad tell it like it is for once?  After years of estrangement, Edward's illness provokes Will to come home and make one last bid to understand a man who's deliberately woven a series of exaggerations, dreams, and half-truths around his life.<br/><br/>The movie is best when we enter the world of Edward's stories, a place of magical realism where the rules of reality are are bent, but not beyond all recognition.  Colors are brighter, time literally slows to a halt and speeds up alarmingly, and giants, witches, Siamese twins, and other strange sights cross the screen.  At the center of all this, McGregor is an ideal protagonist--a cross between the way Edward was and the way he'd always wanted to be.  Burton handles all of this with skill and sensitivity.  He understands, as Will does not, that the stories present a more complete picture of Edward than mere facts ever could.  They reveal his memories, perceptions, dreams, and outlook on life.  When Edward courts Sandra by filling fields with flowers and writing her name across the sky, we know that we're not seeing what happened, but what would have happened if the prosaic rules of reality had allowed Edward to express the full extent of his feelings.<br/><br/>So charming is Edward's altered truth that it's a bit jarring when we come back to the real world, where the movie slows (mostly as it's driven by Crudup in the role of the requisite wet blanket).  But the ending is excellent, weaving together fantasy and reality in a way that's touching and satisfying."

","After this movie Tim Burton is definitely in my top 5 list. I liked many of his other movies, but this one is, in my opinion, his best. Big Fish caught my full attention for it's entire duration and left me with a feeling I had just watched something special when it ended. Everything about it was great.<br/><br/>Great direction and editing. Beautiful images, some very powerful and emotional scenes and fantastic use of flashbacks. Great acting. Every actor in the film delivers a solid and balanced performance. Great story. A beautiful and entertaining story and a very good script to support it. Great effects. Very well done special effects that fitted perfectly with the story. <br/><br/>This movie is interesting, thought provoking, funny and touching at the same time. Not many movies can claim that.

"pixelmixer","Null","0","1","24 July 2004"," Different, but in a good way.
","Someone told me that this film was different. They were right too. It's hard to categorise this movie and that's something I actually despise. It's a comedy (occasionally) and a love story (also occasionally). It's a Tim Burton movie, and maybe that's enough information. That means that you don't know what to expect.<br/><br/>I hate categorising films. They should be recognised on their individual merits, not filed in a box so you know what to anticipate. What should happen is that someone should seat you in a cinema, or stick a DVD in your player and tell you nothing else and allow you to watch it in its entirety.<br/><br/>I almost tried to ignore the rear of the case and pretend there was no synopsis. The friend that told me it was different knew what he was talking about. There's an all-star cast and the ""unknowns"" are equally as impressive as those whom you expect to shine.<br/><br/>I'm not about to announce the storyline here. Again, it's one of those movies that you need to sit and watch from beginning to end - release yourself for two hours and let yourself immerse into the story. The comedy sprinkled throughout is enought to keep you entertained - add the original story and you have yourself a gem of a movie and it's the sort of film that you'll enjoy showing friends for the first time and see their reaction, even on the same scale as Fight Club or Sixth Sense, both for the same reasons. This film has no twist, but it's interesting to see someone's reactions to different areas of this film.<br/><br/>Tim Burton never ceases to satisfy. Listening to his commentary, he took this movie very seriously and had some great motives for making it. It was hardly highly publicised, but that increases its value in terms of watchability. I highly recommend it for an alternative - if you're considering a Hollywood blockbuster for a Saturday night, try Big Fish - you'll be pleasantly entertained."

","When Helena Bonham Carter recently gave birth to Tim Burton's baby and settled down to blissful (if presumably slightly quirky) family life, it finally dawned on me that we were probably not going to end up together. This was a thumping blow to say the least  I have carried a torch for Britain's most elegant and enigmatic actress ever since she flapped her arms about in a cornfield in Room With a View in 1986 - and I knew that if I was to finally allow myself to move on, I would need to stop thinking of Burton as a scheming, manipulative freak-show who was holding my precious English rose against her will and just be happy for the pair of them. So I stopped sticking pins in my crudely crafted Burton effigy and began to grudgingly concede that he was actually a pretty good director.<br/><br/>Still, he doesn't half take liberties with his missus: Not content with turning her into a talking gorilla in Planet of the Apes, his latest offering, Big Fish, has her playing both a scabby, one-eyed witch and a wistful middle-aged spinster who couldn't even lure Ewan McGregor into the sack.<br/><br/>Bonham Carter is not the only one readily jumping through hoops for Burton in this movie. He has a knack of creating unique and irresistible characters that light up his narrative and captivate his audiences. Why has nobody else ever cast Danny DeVito as a pint-sized, moustache-twirling ringleader or Steve Buscemi as terrible poet-cum-bank robber? What other director could assemble such a blistering supporting cast in what is essentially a glorified fairy tale? Big Fish was never the sort of project that was going to win truckloads of academy awards  the reason the cream of Hollywood are queuing up to be in his films is not one of artistic recognition, but because it looks like it would be a bloody good laugh.<br/><br/>What is also clear is that if you happen to land one of the plumb roles, you strive with every sinew to make the most of it. Albert Finney plays Edward Bloom: Charismatic, popular and richly entertaining, but dying of cancer. Billy Crudup is his son Will, who has endured a life of drudgery by comparison. Will is fed-up with his father's preposterous tales and it eventually drives them apart. As it becomes obvious Edward has only a short time to live, Will seeks reconciliation and acknowledgement from his father that his stories are all whopping great lies. <br/><br/>But Edward is a stubborn bugger and maintains that he only ever speaks the truth. And so, his history is recounted in a succession of vivid flashbacks where we follow his younger self (Ewan McGregor) through a life that was certainly less ordinary and frankly (to Will anyway) pretty unlikely. Young Edward, it seems, was a gifted individual to say the least: His anecdotes include a long list of sporting accolades; tussles with witches and giants; joining the circus and falling in love; escaping from the far East with the help of Siamese twin cabaret singers and saving a whole town from debt and destitution.<br/><br/>The tales are brought to life by Finney's sparkling voice-overs and McGregor's wide-eyed enthusiasm  Edward Bloom's past is Tim Burton's Wonderland; The town of Spectre, Alabama is his Bedford Falls, 'a place so great, nobody ever leaves!' <br/><br/>References and sly nods are scattered everywhere and colour and imagery stream out of every set. Here it is the present that is dreary and sepia. Edward, stymied in his later years through the relentless march of time and eventually bedridden, lives vicariously through his splendid reminiscences. Because, as Will eventually realises, his father is not interested in showing off or telling porkies  he just wants to remember the good times.<br/><br/>Big Fish is about cherishing memories. In Burton's book they can be as rose-tinted as you like. The cold facts are not important; feelings are what count. How he can pull off such an unapologetically sentimental motto like that without drowning in a fetid swamp of cheese and schmaltz is anybody's guess. But he does, and with his own inimitable aplomb. Burton just has this incredible imagination (although it helps that he is as mad as a snake).<br/><br/>My final word must rest with Helena. These pages are laced with praise for the entire cast of Big Fish. All the aforementioned actors deserve credit as well as Alison Lohman and Jessica Lange as the young and old incarnations of Edward's wife Sandra (Lange in particular is the foxiest pensioner you are ever likely to meet), but Bonham Carter proves once and for all she is one of the most talented and versatile actresses currently around. Once mocked as being fit only for corsets and period drama, she has laughed off the criticism and taken a series of challenging and thought-provoking roles. She is not afraid to experiment or risk looking silly and has a laissez faire attitude to stardom that is as admirable as it is unusual. If this film is Burton's homage to his new family lifestyle then it is a fitting tribute indeed. <br/><br/>OK, now I have closure.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jrfranklin01","5","0","2","16 July 2004"," Fairytale Journey
","This movie is best described as the journey of a man's life with a fairytale portrayal.  It chronicles Edward Bloom's sugar-coated life events that initially made for good stories and later defined his character.  His son wishes to discover ""who"" his father really was,  not just some made-up story.  But in the end, it is revealed that sometimes holding on to harmless fantasies in life, like a child's belief in the toothfairy, is not so bad after all.<br/><br/>And this movie felt like something out of a children's book, perhaps Gulliver's Travels.  The adventures you are taken on alternate with farcical themes intermingled with semi-serious ones.  And this ""replay"" of Edward Bloom's life seems at times better suited for children.  While still enjoyable by adults, it should not be assumed to be too much more than its ""Jack and The Beanstalk"" type story."

","Imaginative Tim Burton has created yet one more visually attractive flick. After a disappointing ""Planet of the Apes"" it basically restores Burton as a master at crafting fairy tales which deliver strong poignant messages about life, skillfully blend fantasy with reality and on the top of that are absolutely hilarious. In spite of that, ""Big Fish"" with its sublime story and stunning cinematography is far from being a masterpiece. Its shortcomings mainly originate from uninteresting flat characters (especially the ones from Senior Edward's tall tales) which struggle to carry the movie along. If you want to see Burton's fantasy classic, rent ""Edward Scissorhands"". If you want to see Burton at his best, get your hands at ""Ed Wood"". However, if you are a devoted Burton fan ""Big Fish"" is a must see."

","It's all about the importance of a good tale in people's life. We know this from Robert Guillaume's line near the end as he would pick the not-so-truthful, but better-sounding version of the drama surrounding Crudup's birth. Also being the tale about an estranged father and son relationship, the borderline between truth and fiction to both its own characters and moviegoers, provides the movie magic as well as the emotional vulnerability here.<br/><br/>With echoes of 'Forrest Gump', the ambition here is bigger than the final achievement, and I can sense the urge of the film-makers for a longer epic out of this story. Many bits and characters are presented to hold great importance, but are left dangling, annoyingly unfinished, as prodigal director Burton and writer John August shifts tone, narration emphasis and focus too often to hit a bulls-eye. But as pure entertainment it's thoroughly enjoyable and eye-filling as a day at the fun-fair. And the robust performance of Albert Finney as the old Ed Bloom clearly outshines anybody else here, with a much more believable accent than McGregor, too! 6 out of 10 from me."

It is the story of a man who would do anything to get what he wants, totally disrespectful of others feelings and lives, it is a saga of a male imperialist chauvinist conqueror in all aspects of life and what is most annoying is that his crudeness and indifference to others feelings, all his passive aggression, his violent innocence, is not at all contested but seen as 'he was a magnificent man after all' and everyone joins him at the funeral scene blah blah blah. Everyone, well not exactly. Find who are missing and that may get you thinking into my p.o.v.

","I should sue each and every one of the 14,692 IMDB members who voted this movie to an ""8.0"" rating. I cannot recall seeing a movie I felt was so vastly overrated. This could be yet another case of a moviegoer (that'd be me, folks) seeing a high rating and building his expectations so high that they are bound to be let down somewhat. Even if those set of circumstances do exist in this instance, that does not make the feelings boiling in my craw any more palatable. This movie is better than I think it is, I'll give you that. But an ""8.0?"" No, sir. I look at where this film resides on the list of the Top 250 and I see a list of films like RAIN MAN, MIDNIGHT COWBOY, NETWORK, GANDHI. BIG FISH does not belong among that company.<br/><br/>After all this negativity you might be wondering what it is that I didn't like about the film. I must admit that I have nothing original to say about that. My gripes are the same ones you've already heard before:  the stories Ed ""Big Fish"" Bloom kept retelling throughout his life were amazingly boring. The acting was superb, the sets and effects were perfect, the characters were well-written and believable, but all those tall tales were less fascinating than a pair of Dr. Scholl's foot cushions. Speaking of ""tall tales,"" there was a film in the mid-90's called TALL TALE (starring Patrick Swayze) which covered pretty much the same territory in terms of storytelling. Older guy tells outlandish stories to an unbelieving youth who comes to realize there were large nuggets of truth in each tale. Come to think of it, there have been quite a few films with that storyline. BIG FISH reminds me more of TALL TALE than the oft mentioned WIZARD OF OZ.<br/><br/>The other main storyline deals with the redemption of a father-son relationship. This was a far more compelling aspect of the film than the yawn-inducing fish tales. However, it was handled in such a low-key manner that it felt as if Tim Burton borrowed a page from M. Night Shyamalan's ""Subtlety Playbook."" Unfortunately for Burton there have been some outstanding films dealing with father-son relationships. If I had to rank them I'd put BIG FISH in a distant Fourth Place behind THE GODFATHER pt. 1, THE CHOSEN (a must-see, if you haven't already), and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. You read it right, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK! The relationship swings between the Bloom men can't hold a candle to the ones between the Skywalkers. Whereas Will Bloom severed communication with his father for three years because of an inappropriate wedding toast(!), Anakin Skywalker severed his son's hand in a bid to lure him into an evil partnership that would take over control of the galaxy.<br/><br/>BIG FISH is worth seeing, if only for the all-around cast performance. Of special note is Matthew McGrory, a 7'6"" giant whose typical character is named something discreet like ""Human Sasquatch."" Here McGrory gets to play a character who, although he works in a circus sideshow, is a 'real,' likable person who blends in well with the rest of the cast. At the same time he redeems himself for having anything to do with HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning, true. Tim Burton is a great director, and a great visionary, who can easily be forgiven for the mess that was PLANET O' THE APES. I'll keep my fingers crossed for his next effort. Hopefully he will be teamed with screenwriters who DO belong in the same room as him."

There is no evidence that he is a jerk, just that he's not as good at football, basketball, science and love as Ewan.  We have to accept Ewan's word that he is a jerk.

In real life, people see this cat coming, they go in the other direction.  Jessica Lange is utterly wasted & given nothing at all to do, period, except smile at Finney & take a fully clothed bath with him.

","Big Fish is a film so startlingly awful that I wonder how it ever got made. Tim Burton, the one-time imaginative director of such films as ""Batman,"" ""Beetlejuice,"" and ""Edward Scissorhands,"" has evidently lost whatever talent he once had. After this and his mind-numbing ""Planet of the Apes"" remake, I strongly urge Mr. Burton to retire, or at least take a LONG vacation.<br/><br/>Albert Finney stars as Edward Bloom, a dying man with a lifetime's worth of tall tales. Billy Crudup is his son attempting to separate the fact from the fiction. Unfortunately this involves long, pointless, confusing flashback/fable sequences starring Ewan McGregor (with the world's worst ""Southern"" accent) as a young Ed Bloom. The result is a mess of a movie that is neither entertaining nor enlightening, not funny or dramatic, not even bold enough to leave you with a lasting impression.<br/><br/>The direction is so derivative of other popular films/styles it is embarrassing to watch. There are changing-era soundtrack songs as we move through the years, including Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" (used first and more effectively in Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me""), Elvis Presley's ""All Shook Up"" (used in countless films including ""Honeymoon In Vegas"") and the astoundingly trite ""Ramblin' Man"" by the Allman Brothers, used too often to name. As the years go by and the jukebox plays one cannot help but be reminded of the similarities to Robert Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump."" And of course there are the obligatory Matrix-styled special effects- used absolutely unnecessarily- in which time freezes (!)<br/><br/>During attempted comedic sequences one gets the feeling that Burton has been influenced by the Coen Brother's ""O Brother, Where Art Thou."" Despite a handful of moments obviously intended to be funny I heard few laughs in the packed theater, and never laughed myself.<br/><br/>Then there are the tall tales themselves... clichéd, predictable and oddly flat. Meeting a giant and seeing a vision of your own death sound exciting on paper but these moments are rendered meaningless in the film. Wasted are such great actors as Jessica Lange, Danny DeVito, Helena Bonham Carter and Steve Buscemi.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone reading this review is to avoid the film at all costs, because I can guarantee you will be disappointed. See another movie, rent a classic or even an old favorite... do anything but waste two hours on this cinematic dead-end. Big Fish is a dull, derivative, uninspired effort from a director who once had the ability to shock, excite and entertain me. Now he only puts me to sleep.<br/><br/>GRADE: F<br/><br/>EDIT: This movie was so depressing it drained the life out of me. Now, years later, it has come to light that the film may actually have contributed to the death of actor/monologuist Spalding Gray. After seeing the film he left the theater, sent his family home, and committed suicide by jumping off the Staten Island Ferry. Look it up if you don't believe me... that's the kind of karma this movie has. Enough said."

","BIG FISH (2003) **1/2 Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Billy Crudup, Jessica Lange, Alison Lohman, Helena Bonham Carter, Danny De Vito, Robert Guillaume, Steve Buscemi, Matthew McGrory, Loudon Wainwright III, Missi Pyle, Marion Cotillard, Ada Tai, Arlene Tai. Engaging yet meandering bit of tall-tale telling envisioned by Tim Burton's adaptation of Daniel Wallace's novel (screenplay by John August does it's best to get the whimsy balanced with poignancy) about an estranged son and father (Crudup and the always watchable Finney) who try to re-unite before it's too late  the dad is dying  despite the non-stop whoppers told over the years that blend fictional fantasy into fact.<br/><br/>Embued by a fantastic ensemble (McGregor uncannily channeling Finney from his heyday in the flashback narrative and Lohman becoming Lane) and a unique production design by Dennis Gasner creating a parallel universe of sorts only shows the weakness of the long-windedness of the narrative that at times creaks along in its gradual pacing which hinders the heart of an otherwise exceptional  and this time very personal  take by Burton."

","""Big Fish"" as directed by Tim Burton pays lavish attention to detail, and that alone makes for this to be an enjoyable and entertaining film viewing experience.  The renderings of the fantastic tales of the elder Mr. Bloom are very visually rewarding and interesting, and the plot-line of the son's reconciliation with the dying father (and all of those tall tales) is a reasonable enough framework on which to have constructed the movie.  In all that detail and elaborate storytelling, however, some elaborate threads are left dangling, some storylines seem to have been changed mid-movie and some, briefly alluded to, and left sadly unexplored. These deficiencies do not prevent the film from being sentimental fun, creatively satisfying and well worth seeing, but nonetheless hold it short of attaining the distinction of a ""great"" movie.  There is enough symbolism and allusions to previous movies (his own and others)to keep film students and movie buffs busy analyzing and debating for years, but maybe Mr. Burton should have kept his eye more on the actual telling of the storyteller's story, rather than on constructing some of the perhaps too clever asides.  I hate to say it, but there's just something fishy about that."

","The film moves gracefully from start to finish. The main characters are people you would like to meet and know more about. The characters in the father's tales are a true homage to the characters in Fellini's Amarcord and 81/2. The world of fantasy does not only need hobbits to make it interesting."
